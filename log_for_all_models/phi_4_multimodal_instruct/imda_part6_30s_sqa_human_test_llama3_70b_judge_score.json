            "model_prediction": "A 50% discount is currently being offered for all travel packages in December, making the original cost of around $2,500 per person now approximately $1,000 plus GST or service charges. This includes any customizations.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer states that a 50% discount reduces the per-person cost from $2,500 to around $1,000, excluding customizations. The model's answer is close, but adds \"plus GST or service charges\" and includes customizations, which is not mentioned in the reference.
