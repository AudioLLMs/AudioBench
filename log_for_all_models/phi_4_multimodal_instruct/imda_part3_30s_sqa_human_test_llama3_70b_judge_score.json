They think Jay Chou is a very good singer and prefer his songs over JJ Lin's, even though JJ Lin is more popular in Singapore.",

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is specific about the speaker's experience being one of the best as a fan and their preference for Jay Chou's songs over JJ Lin's. In contrast, the model's answer focuses on the speaker's closeness to Jay Chou and their opinion that Jay Chou deserves a chance in Singapore, without mentioning the personal experience or song preference.

The model's answer, on the other hand, only mentions the difficulty of affording a house and the challenge of living in their country, missing the challenge of getting married and only vaguely mentioning the high cost of living. Additionally, the model's answer phrases the cost of a decent house as \"might cost around $500,000 in a few years\", which is not as accurate as the reference answer's statement that it \"may cost at least $500,000\".
