            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is a definitive \"Yes, waves do exist\", while the model's answer is a simpler \"Yes, there are waves\". The model's response is concise and to the point, conveying the same general meaning as the reference answer. I think the model's answer is a good match, but lacks the extra emphasis on existence provided by the reference answer.\n\nRating: 4",
