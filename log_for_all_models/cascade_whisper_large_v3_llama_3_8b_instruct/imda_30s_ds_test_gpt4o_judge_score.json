            "question": "Is it possible for you to summarize what's covered in the audio?",
            "reference": "Speaker1 and Speaker2 engaged in a casual conversation about dates, with Speaker1 mentioning that they don't often go on dates and struggling to recall a specific instance. Speaker2 playfully teases Speaker1, saying they can't give them anything (possibly a piece of advice or a date idea) and then tells Speaker1 it's their turn (likely to share a story or idea).",
            "model_prediction": "The audio transcription appears to be a conversation where the speaker is hesitant to go on dates and is having difficulty recalling past dates, citing that they \"seldom go for dates also\".",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer describes a casual conversation between two speakers about dates, highlighting Speaker1's infrequent dating experiences and difficulty recalling specific instances. It also mentions Speaker2 teasing Speaker1 and prompting them to share a story or idea. The model's answer captures the hesitation of the speaker to go on dates and their difficulty in recalling past dates but does not include the playful teasing or the prompt for Speaker1 to share something. The model's response is generally aligned with the reference but misses the interactive dynamics and additional context provided in the reference answer. Therefore, it lacks some detail and precision.\n\nRating: 3",
