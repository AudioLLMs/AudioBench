The model's answer, \"The bunny sign that says 'Buy Me' is located on the top side, under the front of the cage,\" is overly detailed and diverges from the reference answer. The phrase \"under the front of the cage\" is contradictory to \"on the front side\" and adds unnecessary information.\n\nRating: 2",
