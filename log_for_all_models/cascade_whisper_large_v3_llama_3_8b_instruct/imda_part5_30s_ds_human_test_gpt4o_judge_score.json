            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer discusses a dialogue between two speakers, focusing on handling regrets, with one speaker advocating for pushing boundaries to live a more fulfilled and regret-free life. In contrast, the model's answer generalizes the concept of regret, mentioning everyday regrets like not buying ice cream and acknowledges that regrets are natural but does not align with the reference answer's focus on pushing boundaries for a regret-free life. The model's answer diverges significantly from the reference in terms of accuracy and relevance, as it does not capture the essence of the discussion between Speaker1 and Speaker2 about living a fulfilled life by pushing boundaries.\n\nRating: 2",
