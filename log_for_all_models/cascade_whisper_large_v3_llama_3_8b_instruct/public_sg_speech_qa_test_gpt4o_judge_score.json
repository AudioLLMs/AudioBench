            "reference": "The speaker's perspective on the relationship between economics and healthcare is that economics is a necessary and important consideration in healthcare decision-making. By stating \"we need more economics, not less,\" the speaker is suggesting that economic analysis should not be overlooked or minimized in healthcare discussions, but rather should be embraced as a valuable tool for addressing complex healthcare challenges. This implies that economic factors should be considered alongside non-economic factors, such as values and trade-offs, in order to make well-rounded and informed healthcare decisions.",

It mentions the need for economic analysis to address healthcare challenges effectively. The model's answer is similar in that it acknowledges the importance of economics in solving healthcare problems and suggests involving more economists for better solutions. However, the model's answer is less detailed, not explicitly mentioning the integration of economic analysis with non-economic factors.
