            "question": "Could you offer a brief summary of what the audio contains?",
            "reference": "Speaker1 and Speaker2 attempted to figure out the zodiac sign associated with a specific date range, starting and ending in September. They eliminated Scorpio, Gemini, and Sagittarius as possibilities, but were unable to determine the correct sign. The conversation was more focused on the process of elimination than arriving at a definitive answer.",
            "model_prediction": "The audio contains a person trying to recall the sequence of zodiac signs, starting from the beginning of the year, with some confusion and uncertainty about the correct order.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer describes a conversation between two speakers who are attempting to determine a zodiac sign associated with a date range in September, focusing on eliminating incorrect options but not arriving at a definitive answer. The model's answer, however, describes a single person trying to recall the sequence of zodiac signs with some confusion, which is quite different from the interaction and process of elimination described in the reference. The model's response does not capture the essence of a conversation between two people or the focus on eliminating certain zodiac signs. Therefore, the model's answer is largely misaligned with the reference answer.\n\nRating: 1",
