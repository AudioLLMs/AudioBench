The model's answer, however, only mentions the color of the cage and the presence of a white rabbit, which is not referenced in the reference answer.

The model's answer also mentions that the speakers enjoy the lack of a time limit and not having to rush or call anyone.

Both answers convey the same information about the difference in the shop signs' messages.
