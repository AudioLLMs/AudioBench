            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"It is because one of the men has hit his wife and the other man does not agree with his actions,\" whereas the model's answer is \"They are arguing because one of them thinks he has the right to hit his wife, while the other disagrees and believes it's not okay to do so.\" I think the model's answer accurately conveys the same information as the reference answer, but with a slight difference in phrasing. The model's answer implies that the disagreement is about the moral justification of hitting one's wife, whereas the reference answer simply states that one man hit his wife and the other man disagrees.\n\nRating: 4",
