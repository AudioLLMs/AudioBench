            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"Jay Chou\", indicating that the question is asking for Speaker1's opinion on who is the better singer. However, the model's answer states that Speaker1 thinks both Jay Chou and JJ Lin are very good singers, without explicitly saying one is better than the other. This implies that the model is unsure or refuses to make a decision, which is not in line with the reference answer.\n\nRating: 0",

The model's answer is similar but not identical to the reference answer, as it adds the phrase \"of the cage\" which is implied but not present in the reference. I think the model's answer is close to the reference but lacks precision.\n\nRating: 4",

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer explicitly states that the speaker believes the government's encouragement is insincere, using the word \"wayang\" to imply it's just a show. The model's answer also conveys the idea that the speaker thinks the government's encouragement is insincere, but it does not specifically mention the word \"wayang\" and its implication. Nevertheless, the model's answer accurately captures the speaker's skeptical view of the government's encouragement. I think the model's answer is mostly accurate and relevant, but could be more detailed and precise.\n\nRating: 4",
