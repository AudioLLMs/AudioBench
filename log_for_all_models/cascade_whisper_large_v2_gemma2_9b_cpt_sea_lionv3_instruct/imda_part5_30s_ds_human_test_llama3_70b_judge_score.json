The model's answer lacks the nuance of the reference answer, specifically the emphasis on pushing boundaries. However, it does recognize the topic of regrets and their origin. \n\nRating: 3",

In contrast, the model's answer combines these reasons, stating that the speaker chose POSB due to family tradition and attractive interest rates without requiring a minimum account balance. While the model's answer is close, it oversimplifies the discussion by attributing both reasons to a single speaker.\n\nRating: 4",

The speakers acknowledge that generalizations about wealth accumulation may not apply to everyone.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer specifically highlights the comparison of CPF benefits to winning the lottery and the discussion's focus on its significance for specific individuals. In contrast, the model's answer takes a more general approach, discussing wealth accumulation and acknowledging that generalizations may not apply to everyone, but it lacks the specific details mentioned in the reference answer.
