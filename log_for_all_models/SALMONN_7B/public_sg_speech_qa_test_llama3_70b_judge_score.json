            "reference": "The speaker's perspective on the relationship between economics and healthcare is that economics is a necessary and important consideration in healthcare decision-making. By stating \"we need more economics, not less,\" the speaker is suggesting that economic analysis should not be overlooked or minimized in healthcare discussions, but rather should be embraced as a valuable tool for addressing complex healthcare challenges. This implies that economic factors should be considered alongside non-economic factors, such as values and trade-offs, in order to make well-rounded and informed healthcare decisions.",

They believe that economics plays a crucial role in healthcare and that it can be used to solve the complex healthcare challenges that we face today. The speaker is inclined to confine themselves to talking about markets, prices, dollars, and cents, but as a healthcare minister, they also need to talk about life and death, values, and trade-offs. Ultimately, the speaker believes that we need more economists, not less, and that we need more doctors, not less.",
