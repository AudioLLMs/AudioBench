            "reference": "okay they are both recording okay so both recording i guess we can just this is scenario one physical meeting can start okay so right so so yu chiaan has asked me to help to lead the organization of the next division team building event and she asked me to ask you chiou har and joey to help and i understand from yu chiann that chiou har you organized last year is team building so maybe could you share your experience from that okay so last year actually we have it in october 2021 and we have a half day starting with lunch during the lunch we have a game that was facilitated by joey and after that we have a short break about 510 minutes just to know wash up and then followed by another activity that is by external party there is a paid service so in that one we did leather making so the materials have been sent to our home the week before so then we do that and then we wrap up about four yeah so from about twelve to four so who was the provider of the leathermaking workshop all right is a company called the fun empire which apparently also did for the ed office earlier of the year yeah when you and google it pop up one of the more obvious one it keeps popping up yeah so yeah yeah so just to add on to chiou har is agenda that she laid out just now we actually played a warm up game as well if you remember zero yeah we played gartic phone so gartic phone it was an online game that mixes pictionary with telephone game right so for those who are not familiar you know the telephone game is a game where you whisper into the next person is ear all the way around the group and compare the original phrase to what was whispere so this game is essentially the visual version of that where you draw what you see and guess what you saw right so let me list a few thoughts on this 1st game so we go component by component i think for gartic phone because the rules was not very clear and we can only accommodate one round for this game before moving on to the next game which was the main game a lot of the participants did not really fully participate in the game so some will only draw some will only guess and actually very few of us actually drew and guess which was the whole point everyone should participate fully that was quite unfortunate in terms of participation regardless i think was still quite good in that everyone was very involved because everyone was commenting on the pictures and also some of the guesses which was way different from what was provided and what is more important i think was that there was a lot of interaction amongst the team members which was the entire point of the session itself so moving on after gartic phone chiou har do feel free to interject as and when after the gartic phone we had a bio break after that we played kahoot which is a free game based learning platform that makes it fun to learn any subject in any language on any devices so we decided to go with kahoot over other online game because it can easily accommodate up to thirteen to fifteen participants actually more than that i believe so yeah which other games cannot do so without a paid subscription yeah gartic phone only twelve and we had about fifteen yeah otherwise we would have chosen gartic phone it was more fun i mean we did went with gartic phone yeah we originally practiced that so gartic phone was originally supposed to be the main game but then we decide to switch to kahoot i guess if you have more than twelve we could split it into two games running concurrently but boss do not want yu chiann requested for everyone to be in the same game anyway only fifteen of us so so yeah plus it is basically in mcq format so everyone is very familiar with right and it does not really require any additional training or rules to level everyone else up so everyone can participate basically which is the most important thing for us and it kind of save us quite a bit of time as well so this was a quite a good game as well as compared to gartic phone because there was a lot of chatter and interaction amongst the team members also now i think we moved on after that we had another bio break then we moved on to the leather making session right as organized by fun empire personally speaking and i think this was reflected by some of the members as well i do not think the leather making session was too good because it was one to many right it was a teaching session one way kind of session we did not practice before that also we were not very familiar with tools and all that so there was a lot of downtime and lull periods where a lot of people were off camera trying to figure out what to do next and so there was a lot of quiet moments and not much interactions between the members which kind of defeats the purpose of the whole session nor did the facilitator i do not think he is very good as well nor did he try to like encourage any form of interaction amongst the members so he was a bit like going through the motions so everyone was just kind of the excitement kind of died down throughout the session as we go through the session yeah so that is i think the agenda and i think the general feedback yeah so how much time do you allocate to each activity i think it is forty wait i have the agenda it is about twelve to one give me awhile it is about one hour for the 1st game then then while having lunch so that is that is why it is about onefive hour and the break then another one hour for the 2nd game in total it took about three to four hours yes okay yeah that is given me a lot of ideas i guess for this year is team building exercise yeah so we had to go virtual you know why hopefully this year will be in person assuming that the state management measures will be relaxed i think so long as you focus on games that require a lot of interactions between the members be digital or physical i think will not go wrong yeah yeah the other thing we did quite a lot of polls because we are really new to everyone so we poll what game you like so the leather making got the most yeah this was before the session to get the feedback we also polled whether you are available on the dates and then we polled which date you are available so because we want to maximize the participation from the division okay those that did not later we asked them again do you like to come again so actually some were concerned about the cost but actually we settled that because boss chipped out a bit of the money and did you guys also provide food in terms of like in your case like grab vouchers or something yeah you are right so so boss sponsor grab vouchers $twenty each so it was given to them about a week before so you go and order whatever you like and then they are supposed to while we eat and play the game as joey described just now of course actually not many people eat at the same time because they want to play yeah a bit hard to multitask yeah they have the option to order in sounds good yeah thanks for the advice and suggestions yeah well the other thing is the game kahoot actually got three winners so there were prizes as well so what did you get for the prizes more grab vouchers i believe so okay yeah otherwise do not know what to send them okay then maybe we can call this meeting to a close yeah yeah okay thank you",
            "prediction": "okay so both recording i guess we can just this is scenario one physical meeting can start yeah okay so i have been asked to help lead the organization of the next division team building event and she asked me to ask you julie to help as well and i understand from ike that you have asked me to help lead the organization of the next division team building event and she asked me to ask you julie to help as well and i understand from ike that you have asked me to help lead the organization of the next division team building event and she asked me to ask you julie to help as well and i understand from ike that you have asked me to help lead the organization of the next division team building event and she asked me to ask you julie to help as well and chao hao you organized last year is team building so maybe could you share your experience with that activity that is by external party that is a paid service so in that one we did letter making so the materials have been sent to our home the week before so then we do that there and then we rap up about 44 yeah so from about twelve to four that is what we did so who was the provider of the letter making our right it is a company called the fund empire which apparently also did for the ed is office earlier of the year i think that one yeah yeah when you go and google it it pops up one of the many i mean one of the more obvious one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so for those not familiar the telephone game is the game where you whisper into the next person is ear all the way around the group and compare the original phrase to what was whispered so this game is essentially the visual version of that where you draw what you see and guess what you saw so maybe just a few thoughts on this 1st game so we go component by component the participants did not really fully participate in the game so some will only draw some will only guess and actually very few of us actually drew and guessed which was the whole point of everyone should participate fully that was quite unfortunate in terms of participation regardless i think it was still quite good in that everyone was very involved and and also some of the guests which was way out of which was way different from what was provided and what is more important i think was that there was a lot of interaction amongst the team members which was the entire point of the session itself so moving on after gartic phone or jeff chow do feel free to interject as we went after the gartic phone we had a bio break after that we played kahoot which is a free game based learning platform makes it fun to learn any subject in any language on any devices so we decide to go with kahootz over other online games because it can easily accommodate up to thirty to fifteen participants actually more than that i believe so which other games cannot do so without having a paid subscription yeah the kahootz only costs twelve and you have about fifteen otherwise we have chosen the kahootz because it is more fun yeah i mean we did when kahootz 1st came out yeah it is really fun originally it was supposed to be the main game but then we decided to switch to carcassonne i guess if we had more than twelve we could split it into two games running concurrently but we only have one i think each of us could play the same game and there are only fifteen of us so it does not really require any additional training or rules to level everyone else up so basically it is basically an mcu format which is so everyone is very familiar with and it does not really require any additional training or rules to level everyone else up so everyone can participate which is the most important thing us and it kinda saves us a bit of time as well so this was a quite good game as well as compared to gustyphone because there was a lot of chatter and interaction amongst the team members zero yeah right now i think we moved off after that we had another bio ride down after that we moved on to the ladder making session luckily that was organized by fun and pyre personally speaking i think this was reflected by some of my members as w because it was one to many right it was a teaching session one way or the other so we did not practice before that we did not practice before that either we are not very familiar with tools and all that so there was a lot of down time and long periods where a lot of people were off camera trying to figure out what to do next and so there was a lot of quiet sessions moments quiet moments and not much in did the facilitator i do not think he is very good at all did he nor did he try to encourage any form of interaction among the members so he was a bit like going through the motions so everyone also just kind of the excitement kind of died down throughout the session as we go yeah through the session yeah so that is i think the agenda yeah and i think the general feedback yeah and so like how much time did you allocate to each activity i think it is 45 yeah i have an agenda it is about so we have twelve to one i think it is about one hour for the 1st game then about an hour and a half for lunch and then another hour for the 2nd game in total it takes about threefive hours okay that is given me a lot of ideas i guess for this year is team building exercise yeah so we had to go to burger king they do not know why yeah hopefully this year will be in person assuming that like the safety management measures will be relaxed so yeah i think so long as you focus on games that like require a lot of interaction between the members whether it is digital or physical i think we will go wrong yeah the other thing we did was we did a lot of brainstorming we did a lot of brainstorming we did a lot of brainstorming we did a lot of brainstorming we did a lot of brainstorming we did a lot of brainstorming we did a lot of brainstorming we did a quite a lot of posts because we are really new to everyone everyone does not know everyone so we post what game you like so the the letter is the most active yeah this was before the session so we look at the feedback we also poll whether you can available on the dates and then we post which date you you are available so so cause we want to maximize the participation actually those that did not later we ask again do you want to come again so so because we want to maximize the participation actually those that did not later we ask again do you want to come again so so because we want to maximize the participation actually those that did not later we ask again do you want to come again so so because we want to maximize the participation somewhat will concern the cost but actually we will settle that because zero it is cheap out a bit of the money so we will settle that and did you guys also provide food in terms of like  in your case like grab vouchers or something yeah yeah right so so boss sponsored grab vouchers $twenty each so it was given to them about a week before so you go and order whatever you like and then we will play the game as joey are described just now of course actually not many people people eat at the same time because they want to have multiple dinners yeah but at least they have the option to have correct orders so you can have whatever you want ordinarily sounds good yeah thanks for the advice and suggestions yeah well the other thing is the game kung fu actually got three winners well that was really important because you know how important it is to have prizes and stuff yeah yeah easier lah other people do not know how to send that yeah okay then maybe we can call this meeting to a close yeah okay thank you",

            "reference": "all right so good morning everyone so in today is meeting let us discuss the new 360 degree feedback that we would like to launch for the next performance appraisal cycle so just to give some brief introduction to this 360 degree feedback the idea with the 360 degree feedback is that we want to be able to identify some of the strengths of team members as well as areas that we could highlight for improvements so so maybe let us start off by getting each of us to suggest two questions to ask during this 360 feedback and explain why we think this questions are useful when doing the feedback when when going through this exercise yeah thanks thanks tim but maybe before we start with the questions can you explain what does 360 mean so 360 also whether who we want to include like peers ex dotted line boss you know or or just anyone so who nominate the three the panel to to assess the person is it the supervisor themselves or the staff themselves you know because i used to have in another organization the staff will nominate but the reporting officer have to agree that panel you know because if you choose all your best friend your most trusted friend then is not so accurate so call okay yeah i think so it is important for the in order to get a good 360 degree feedback i think it is important that in the panel it should include colleagues of the the team member that is being evaluated as well as someone like a manager of that member and and also a subordinate of the team member yeah that should that should give us a comprehensive like assessment assessment overall assessment yeah of your performance yeah okay yeah sounds good so maybe for the two questions do you want me to start off 1st then sure yeah okay so maybe ill start off maybe i think for this 360 degree feedback right this 360 degree feedback is for others for others to answer about me yes correct okay good so so i think my 1st question that i would like to be answered for myself right to learn more about myself is does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers so the rationale being that you know because we are in a relatively flat structure in idpc i feel that it is very important for everyone to be able to work effectively with everyone else right rather than rather than being a superstar employee the as they say you know the whole is greater than sum of its parts us working together effectively as a team will be much more critical to us achieving success as opposed to just one superstar carrying everyone else that is my thinking so so you know i would like to know how i am doing in terms of communications and collaboration with my peers and find out more about how i can improve in my communication skills so the 2nd question is something i would like to know is you know do i recognize when there is a problem basically do i recognize and sound out you know when there is an issue because i think that you know astar is a relatively chill and laid back environment so oftentimes i think you know it takes a while for me to realize you know when there is an issue or sometimes i am just slow to report the problem right due to you know i think the overall circumstance environment is quite laid back so yeah so i think the ability to proactively reflect recognize and sound out an issue is quite important right especially in the infocomm industry where everything else moves so quickly so so yeah i think speed is something that i would like to work on as well for myself chiou har over to you right i think i will want to have an assessment of the person is teamwork because maybe i only do what my boss asked me to do joey ask me to do anything i dont want to do so so i thought teamwork is very important so you must work well with everyone the other one i am not so so maybe just to clarify i think what chiou har is saying is the ability to lean forward right beyond your jurisdiction beyond your original scope of work to help everyone achieve and do whatever it takes to achieve overall targets and success correct correct in other words like whether when collaboration the person being evaluated has like the initiative go the extra mile yes yeah does he or she take the initiative not just do what is in the target but can do a bit more beyond his or her scope yeah the other thing will be like i do not know whether job knowhow is important because at the end of the day if let us say timothy you are supposed to present something and then you did not present that then whether you know enough to present so the job knowhow although it sounds like also the target for the person but it will be something that i want to i think it is important or like how i view my my colleague maybe i am supposed to do procurement did i over buy you know buy buy the correct thing or or know what to buy you know for example yeah so the job knowhow the teamwork i think the job knowhow is very important especially for the technical folks in our team because i think yi tao and yu kai especially they will want to know you know the their respective peer are they like equipped adequately to develop the relevant systems and apis to get a project to get the product out right in one form so i think that is quite important for the technical folks but for the the more generalist role right so business development and maybe admin officers it may be a little bit less important so so i do not know very i do not really know how the 360 feedback process is like but you might want to have different weightage for this question how much does it overall contribute to the assessment of that person in year yeah because for generalists role right i think knowhow can be picked up the other skills and all that can be learned along the way so maybe less important the tech one is whether they have enough training the right training the tech one is once they go in they must know what to do already yeah i do not think they have can afford the time to pick up the technical skills which takes quite a while yeah so so yeah just for your consideration sure yeah and for me i think the some of the two questions that the two questions that i think i would like to ask well 1st i would like to ask the co workers whether like to help to identify one area that we think that they think this person can probably work on and improve yeah because i think sometimes like you may not be aware of your like what areas you should be working on to make improvements on so when you receive feedback from others hopefully you will not take it as like criticism but actually constructive feedback to make the improvement yeah yeah that also reminds me whether we want to and whether that that that decision is to know who write that comment or its going to be anonymous because if its anonymous of course some people can just write anything or become quite negative yeah so that would be a decision as well i think maybe it is important to like have ownership of the things that you say so is it anonymous the 360 feedback is it anonymous or i think is anonymous right it is right but i dont know i went through one that is anonymous i do not know whether the others need to put the name yeah yeah okay but i think you are given the option of putting the name if they want to right if i recall correctly for my previous yeah okay okay yeah and then for the for the 2nd question i think it is like i think it is more with regards to work life balance yeah so for example i would like to ask whether they are always like expecting you to work beyond the normal working hours so i mean i think that having work life balance is quite important because well i feel that if you are happy at work you can be a lot more productive than if you are feeling more negative about your job yeah yeah okay sounds good okay okay then so yeah i will i will compile this list of questions and send it to to yu chiann for approval so maybe in the next meeting we can come up with a final come up with a final list of questions yeah all right sounds good thanks thank you",
            "prediction": "well good morning everyone so in today is meeting let us discuss the new 360 degree feedback that we would like to launch for the next performance appraisal cycle so just to

we start with the questions can you explain what does 360 mean so 360 also may i ask who we want to include like your peers or experts or just anyone so who nominate the trip the panel of to to assess the person is it the supervisor themselves you know or just anyone so who nominate the trip the panel of to to assess the person is it the supervisor themselves you know or just anyone so who nominate the trip the panel of to to assess the person is it the supervisor themselves you know or just anyone so who nominate the trip the panel of to to assess the person is it the supervisor themselves you

agree that panel you know if you choose all your best friend your most trusted friend that is not so accurate so called okay yeah i think so it is important for the in order to get a good 3060 degree feedback i think it is important that in the panel it should include our colleagues the team member that is being evaluated as well as a manager of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that team member and and also a subordinate of that do you want me to start off low then sure yeah okay so maybe i will start off maybe i think for this 630 degree feedback right this 630 degree feedback is for others for for others to answer about me yes correct okay so so i think my 1st question that i would like to be answered for myself right to do learn more about myself is does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee meaning me communicate effectively with peers does the employee so the rational being that you know because we are in a relatively flat structure in idp i feel that it is very important for everyone to be able to work effectively with everyone else right rather than rather than being a superstar employee the as they say you know the whole is greater than the sum of its parts us working together effectively as a team will be much more critical to our achieving success as opposed to just one superstar carrying everyone else that is my thinking so so you know i would like to know how i am doing in terms of communications and collaboration with my peers and find out more about how i can improve in my communication skills so the 2nd question is something that i would like to know is you know do i recognize when there is a problem basically do i recognize and sum up you know when there is an issue because i think that you know era is a relatively briefly shrewd and laid back environment so often times i think you know it takes a while for me to realize you know when there is an issue or sometimes i am just slow to report the problem right due to i think the over 2nd overall comprehensive environment is quite laid back so yeah so i think the ability to proactively reflect recognize and sound an issue is quite important right especially in the infosec industry where everything else moves so quickly so so yeah i think speed is something that i would like to work on as well for myself chua over to you right i think i will want to have an assessment of the person is teamwork because maybe i only do what my boss asks me to do joey asks you to do i do not know so i thought teamwork is very important and also you must work well with everyone so i know i think what choi hai is saying is the ability to lean forward right beyond your jurisdiction beyond your original score to help everyone achieve and do whatever it takes to achieve overall targets and success so like in other words like whether the person being valued has the initiative yes does he or she take the initiative just do what is in the target but can do a bit more yeah yeah yeah always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always always yeah the other thing will be like i do not know whether job know how is important because at the end of the day if let us say timothy are supposed to present something and then you did not present that then whether you know enough to present that so the job know how although it sounds like also the target for the person but it will be something that i want to i think it is important like how i view my my colleague my maybe i am able to procurement did i ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you ever buy did you correcting or or know what to buy you know for example yeah so the job know how the team work i think the job know how is very important especially for the technical folks in our team because i think itau and yicai especially they would want to know you know are their respective peers are they you know equipped adequately to develop the relevant systems and apis to get the product out right and in one form so i think that is quite important folks but for the the more generalist role right say business development and maybe am in officers it may be a little less important so i do not know really i do not know really how the 360 feedback process is like but you might want to have different weightage for this question yeah how much does it overall contribute to the assessment of that person in the year because for generalist role i think nohow can be picked up on the older skills and all that yes because for generalist role i think nohow can be picked up on the older skills and all that yes because for generalist role i think nohow can be picked up on the older skills and all that yes because for generalist role i think nohow can be picked up on the older skills and all that yes because for generalist role i think nohow so maybe less important the class one is whether they have enough training the right training the class one is when they go in they must know what to do really i do not think they have can afford the time to to pick up the technical skills which are takes quite a while so so yeah just for your consideration sure and for me i think some of the two questions that i think i would like to ask well 1st the co workers were like to help to identify one area that we think that they think this person can maybe work on and improve yes because i think sometimes like we may not be aware of your like what areas you should be working on to make improvements on and so when you receive feedback from others hopefully you will not take it as like criticism but actually a constructive feedback to make that improve yeah yeah that also reminds me whether we want to whether that that decision is to know who write that comment or is going to be anonymous yeah because if it is anonymous of course some people can just write anything or become quite negative yeah yeah that would be a decision maybe it is important to have like ownership of the things that you say so is it anonymous the 360 feedback is it anonymous or i think it is anonymous yeah it is yeah it is yeah it is important to have like ownership of the things that you say so is it anonymous the 360 feedback is it anonymous or i think it is anonymous yeah it is yeah it is important to have like ownership of the things that you say so is it anonymous the 360 feedback is it anonymous or i think it is anonymous yeah it is yeah it is important to have like ownership of the things that you say so is but i do not know what i am talking about i mean i do not know where the others are yeah yeah yeah but i think they have given the option of putting the name if they want to all right if i recall correctly from my previous yeah okay okay and then for the 2nd question i think it is like like i think it is more with regards to work life balance so for example  click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click like to ask whether they are always like expecting you to work beyond the normal working hours so i mean i think that having work life balance especially in this area is quite important because i feel that if you are happy at work you can be a lot more productive than if you are feeling more negative about your job yeah yeah sounds good okay okay then so yeah i will compile this list of questions and send it to yuri for approval and so maybe in the next meeting we can come up with a final list of questions yeah yeah sounds good yeah thanks jim thanks",

            "reference": "okay hybrid meeting 2nd topic okay hi guys i am joey from industry development office and i have been tasked by ce astar to organize a visit program for the australian minister for foreign affairs mister albert smith and his wife missus diana smith yu chiann director integrated digital product center had nominated you two to join my team so thank you very much for your contributions but for a start you know i think we can discuss the actual implementation and administration details you know at a later time right in a subsequent meeting but i think for this session i would like to get some suggestions and ideas from you two on two things places of interest as well as our local dining options in singapore right because i think this is mister albert smith is 1st time in singapore so we have i think we will have quite a few interesting options for him right so maybe timothy can i get you to start 1st on places of interest to visit in singapore so i think in terms of places to visit maybe we can start off with some of the usual tourist sites so for example we can go to gardens by the bay and since if we are already in that area maybe you can also look at the singapore flyer mbs casino and so on and on top of that maybe if there is enough time on the other days we can also look at bringing him to the night safari or even changi prison maybe jurong bird park maybe can go to sentosa yeah yeah we can bring him to sentosa as well just to show him some of the like the less local less like residential areas okay sounds good so yes so sorry backtrack a bit forgot to inform you guys that this will likely be a a like a twofive day program right on the very 1st day he will have quite a few meetings delegate meetings right in mfa so just a point of reference for you two maybe chiou har can we also move on to the dining options like i understand that you have some ideas in mind for this yeah i am looking at that if he is they are going to gardens by the bay they can definitely visit the satay club since satay is one of the things that we usually want to introduce to our foreign friends and so forth so aside from there i was thinking as well actually when they arrive at the airport they can go to the jewel there are a lot of very different variety a lot of variety of foods that they can try otherwise in town they can go to lau pa sat if they want their local stuff or tiong bahru market more fusion kind would be they can go to dempsey if they are at the foreign mfa area in botanic gardens they can visit botanic gardens as well inside i think there are a few restaurants as well signature the stars one i do not know whether they should eat that one is that one pollen yeah just to name a few yeah okay but chiou har i was thinking because this is their 1st time visiting singapore and southeast asian countries so i was thinking i specifically do you have any like food ideas that you think we can let them try do not have to think about the places 1st they want to try durian go to geylang if they dare to try and of course if they are at geylang there will be a lot of chinese food and if they are game enough definitely can bring them to little india tekka the are also so then they can try the curry fish head at racecourse road if they are staying near orchard area the whole stretch of orchard road will have varieties to try yeah yeah and i am also thinking of fullerton bay they can try the high tea if they like that kind of stuff okay and also i think maybe chicken rice may be a good idea chicken rice never fails to amaze yeah if they are adventurous yeah we could bring them to tien tien or boon tong kee is there a boon tong kee in orchard road i am not familiar i know that there is one near boon keng now there is a branch the original one i do not really know where they are now boon keng okay okay just a bit far yeah it may be slightly far for the schedule there is one at star vista now star vista as well zero yeah by right if they want to go to mandarin hotel the famous one the original one the mandarin hotel one is still around right i understand the chef change hand quite a few times already yeah then all the the staff who used to work will all spin off and create their own yeah okay so the quality might not be good but okay okay we we we kiv that 11st so okay thanks thanks for the thanks for the suggestions so maybe if i can just quickly round up the the and draft up a skeleton program right so maybe for day one program i think we because they are based in mfa and they will be staying in saint regis so yes i think can start with orchard road 1st right try to expose them to the shopping district like what we have to offer then they can have lunch at ion maybe just for a start like maybe one of the chinese restaurants at level six i think yeah okay now after that maybe for dinner we can have them go to dempsey right maybe and they can have dinner with our our own minister vivian balakrishnan at dempsey maybe one of the places there are quite a few there maybe for a start i think there is a jumbo there right yeah they can have chili crab at jumbo eat popiah right okay then maybe for the 2nd day right maybe we can have them go to the more touristy attractions such as gardens by the bay and i think gardens by the bay will be a good choice as well because they will be quite familiar with the security jurisdiction and configuration because they have hosted quite a few other big name delegates as well right then from there we can have them have lunch at the satay club now after the satay club perhaps we can ferry them to sentosa not from satay club to sentosa as in you know it is not far yeah so is along the same west coast stretch right then maybe they can end the day at sentosa with dinner of some sort of with pm after that on the 3rd day i think we can have them visit in the morning if there is time right we perhaps we can have them visit some of the more local areas in singapore such as little india or maybe if ce agrees maybe in geylang right to have some durian then after that just to end off the day before they fly back yes i think we should give them a tour of jewel as well yeah so thanks thanks for the suggestion i think we have quite a good skeleton program here tim do you have any other further comments no additional comments chiou har any other comments or if they are adventurous and they are in saint regis i think tanglin mall there is a food court where if they want to they just go there they are on their own yeah tanglin there got a lot of other things also the tourism board is just nearby we can have that as part of the 1st day program right as part of the shopping district program okay i will send this draft up to ce for for a quick review 1st once he clears it i will keep you guys posted okay thank you thanks right thanks",

and if we are already in that area maybe you can also look at the singapore flyer mbs casino and so on and on top of that maybe if we there is enough time on the other days we can also look at

the less local areas the less like residential areas ok sounds good so yeah so sorry break it up a bit so folks i will inform you guys that this will likely be a like a twofive day program right on the very 1st day he will have quite a few meetings delegate meetings right in mfa so just a point of reference laura for you too yeah maybe chohab can we also move on to the dining options like

            "reference": "hi everyone thanks for joining this meeting at the last minute so i would like to just share with you about this 360 degree feedback that we are putting in place this year so so management has discussed and they felt that in addition to our annual performance review we will need a component called the 360 degree feedback and that is really for peers to share with you some real practical feedback to help you in terms of your development so just to assure you that this 360 feedback is solely for your own reference and it will not count towards your final rating so you need not be concerned about that so in order to design this feedback right i would like to hear from you what kind of questions do you think we should include in the feedback that would be helpful to you in your own professional development so and therefore i have called for this meeting to maybe get some ideas from you so chiou har maybe we will start with you could you share with us maybe two questions do you think we could include in this 360 feedback okay i think maybe we could include things like oral communication and written communication because during the course of our work a lot of times its about communicating excuse me so whether when i speak to you i make sense of what i am talking or i can understand you you know the language and so forth and as well as then written comms in in in your work if you are expected to write reports and so forth then you you have to be able to write actually even emails you must write in such a way that people are clearly understand what you are writing we are not asking for 100 no grammatical grammatical error as well but still you cannot write like like in dialact that kind or chinese translate to english so i thought oral comm written comm will be two of the criteria that we could include in for this 360 yeah alright okay how about you joey you have got any thoughts about this yeah i agree with chiou har that communications is very very important so actually i would like to suggest this question about you know does the employee you know such as myself communicate effectively with his or her peers the reason why i suggest this question is because you know we are in a relatively flat structure team wise so it is more important for everyone to be able to work effectively with everyone else rather than being just a champion superstar employee right the whole is greater than the sum of its parts so us working together effectively as a team will be much more critical to achieving success as opposed to just one superstar carrying everyone else then for the 2nd questionthat i have in mind i think that it would be good if we can have a question of does the does the employee recognize when there is a problem i think astar is a relatively you know chill environment right so oftentimes it might take a while for people to realize there is an issue or people are just sometimes slow to report the problem itself and even then you know they might only just report it when prompted right so i think the ability to proactively reflect recognize and sound out an issue is quite important especially in the infocomm industry where where you know things move so fast so yeah that is my ¢two worth okay can noted then one more thing to maybe seek your thoughts on right is how do we determine who are the people giving you the feedback i mean do you think the ro should choose or do you think we give a chance for the staff to provide a list of people that he or she typically works with both within and outside of the organization and then for the boss to approve and add others if needed chiou har what are your thoughts about you know selecting people who give you feedback i am of the view that eventually the reporting officer should decide to approve who will be the 360 panel but the staff himself or herself should be able to suggest who he normally work with you know because the the ro may not know for example who i deal with maybe yeah so that should be so my suggestion is the staff suggests who and then the reporting officer approve to say okay or not yeah yeah i agree with chiou har sorry chiou har you want to add on zero i was just saying that it should definitely include the peers the one you work with as well as other division i do not think we can include external party that is not astar staff anyway in order for them to access into the system it is also another challenge technically yeah yeah so i agree with chiou har in that yes actually both party should have say in who you should engage for 360 feedback program so for start the staff can provide a list of all the engagements he or she have had then after that you know the ros role will be to really narrow down right the number of people to a sizable amount right to give that that can give valuable feedback you know to the staff and i think it is a good idea to have ro be the one who kind of like sift out the key personnel to us because i think the ro should have a bit more control over the identification because he or she might want to focus on certain areas of the development for the staff so so using this list he or she might be able to try to point the staff in the right direction as well based on the feedback given by the peers or subordinates or whoever okay then that there is this thinking right although we are not implementing it this year is basically to tie your performance bonus to the 360 degree feedback because for this year we are launching it for the 1st time so maybe people are not quite prepared for it but looking ahead you know how what is the weightage what percentage of weightage should we give this kind of 360 degree feedback in terms of computing the performance bonus of course there is this concern about you know you nominate your good friend you know and you scratch his back he scratch your back you know there is some some degree of this kind of thing may go on so chiou har what are your thoughts in terms of the percentage of weightage you should give this kind of 360 degree feedback on your on bonus i am looking at about ten to twenty actually to me if if you do your job there is no need not worry about what you get what kind of feedback that you get you will be somewhere there i am more thinking of the other aspect whereby if i receive fifty person who nominate me to do their 360 then that will be a bit too many and i probably would not do all so maybe there could be a way to cap each persons to about you know six to six about there ten is also alot so that is another thought that comes just to my mind joey okay so off the top of my mind off the top of my head i think maybe five to ten makes sense to me right now as to whether should we increase it to like twenty thirty maybe next time we can discuss after we try it out 1st right cos as yu chiann you mentioned i think people might try to game the system especially if the staff is the one who nominate the people right to speak so so we should probably start a little bit smaller 1st with a smaller figure and if let us say we we see that there are indeed benefits from having people did not dictate but decide how much performance bonus the person should get there are benefits from it or like positive externalities then if if have then yeah maybe we might want to consider increasing it in subsequent review but for now i think five to ten will be a range i am more comfortable with okay can so thanks for your inputs i will consolidate our inputs as a team and then i will provide these to senior management as they design and put together this scheme okay i do not want to take up too much of your time so thanks thanks so much i will see you next time round thank you thank you thanks bye bye",

with you could you share with us maybe two questions that you do think we could include in this 260 feedback okay i think maybe we could include things like communication and written communication

you must in write in such a way that people clearly understand what you are writing we are not asking for 100 no grammatical grammatical errors as well but still you cannot write like like indirect that kind of crap or chinese translate to english so i thought oracle written come would be two of the criteria that we could include in for 365 all right okay how about you joey have you got any thoughts about this yeah i agree with joe that you know communications is very very important so actually i would like to suggest this question about you know does the employee you know search myself communicate effectively with his or her peers the reason why i suggest this question is because you know we are in a relatively flat structure team wise so it is more important for everyone to be able

whatever so okay then there is this is thinking right although we are not implementing it this year is basically to tie your performance bonus to the 360 degree feedback because for this year we are

there is no need no need to worry about what you get what kind of feedback that you get it will be somewhere there i am more thinking of the other aspect whereby if i receive fifty people who nominate
