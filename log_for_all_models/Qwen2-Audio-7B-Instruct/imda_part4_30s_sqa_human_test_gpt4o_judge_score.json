            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"Speaker1 works from home as part of their internship but occasionally has to visit the office one or two times a week.\" The model's answer is \"Speaker1 works from home but still goes down to the office once or twice a week.\" Both answers convey the same essential information: Speaker1 primarily works from home but also visits the office once or twice weekly. However, the model's answer omits the context that this arrangement is part of an internship. Despite this omission, the model's response is mostly accurate and relevant, closely following the reference in terms of the work-from-home arrangement described. Therefore, the model's answer is not perfect but still captures the core details of the reference.\n\nRating: 4",

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer indicates that obtaining medical certificates (MCs) is more scrutinized now than before, with employers potentially keeping records, making the process less casual. The model's answer conveys that obtaining an MC is more scrutinized and the process might take longer, which aligns generally with the reference. However, it does not mention employers keeping records or the casual nature of obtaining MCs in the past. While the model captures the essence of increased scrutiny, it lacks some specific details provided in the reference answer, such as the involvement of employers and the casual aspect.

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is about Hazel not inviting someone out, causing tension, and mentions a guy named Dickson who liked Hazel, who was already with someone else. The model's answer, however, describes Hazel as having many friends and being social, but her friendships didn't last because she would ghost them. The model's response focuses on Hazel's social behavior and short-lived friendships, which is not mentioned in the reference answer. The reference is more specific about a particular situation involving Hazel and Dickson, while the model's answer generalizes about Hazel's friendship patterns.

The model's answer, however, describes that Speaker 2 uses the paddle board by placing it underneath themselves while swimming, which allows them to move around in the water. The main discrepancy lies in the fact that the reference specifies that Speaker 2 does not know how to swim, whereas the model's answer implies that they are swimming with the paddle board. This divergence in details affects the accuracy and relevance of the model's response compared to the reference.
