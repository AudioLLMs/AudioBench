This, in turn, boosts Singapore's connectivity, trade, and tourism, making it a preferred destination for businesses and travelers alike.",
            "model_prediction": "The expansion and upgrading of Changi Airport have contributed to Singapore's status as a global aviation hub by providing modern facilities, increasing the number of跑道 and terminal spaces, and enhancing the overall passenger experience. This has attracted more airlines to operate out of Changi, further boosting its international connectivity and making it a key destination for travelers worldwide.",

Additionally, the higher end of the range is not as clearly stated as \"$877,000,\" but rather as \"eight hundred and seventy thousand,\" which lacks precision.

It contrasts this with middle-aged adults, who may have more self-sufficient children, and Golden-agers, whose children are typically independent. The model's answer captures the essence of the reference by mentioning the care for both young adults and elderly parents, but it lacks the comparative aspect with other age groups and the specific mention of middle-aged adults and Golden-agers.

            "reference": "Based on the text, it's not possible to predict whether Singapore's hospitals will be overwhelmed during future waves of COVID-19. While Singapore's gradual growth and tailing off of COVID-19 cases suggest effectiveness in controlling the spread of the virus, it's uncertain how future waves will unfold. However, Singapore's experience so far suggests that its measures to control the spread of the virus are working, and it has the resources and infrastructure to handle future waves.",
            "model_prediction": "The information suggests that Singapore's waves of COVID-19 cases grow and tail off more gradually compared to other countries, which implies that their hospitals may not experience a sudden overwhelming surge like in other countries. This is because the rate of increase and decrease in cases indicates that the disease transmission is being slowed down. However, it's important to note that this prediction assumes that the current strategies remain effective and that external factors like vaccine distribution or new variants of the virus do not significantly alter the situation.",

            "question": "What was the outcome of Mr Razali Puasa's actions in disinfecting the playground?",
            "reference": "The outcome of Mr Razali Puasa's actions was that families were reassured that the playground was clean and safe for their kids to play.",
            "model_prediction": "His action made all the difference to the community.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"The outcome of Mr Razali Puasa's actions was that families were reassured that the playground was clean and safe for their kids to play,\" which specifies the reassurance and safety aspect for families as a result of his actions. The model's answer is \"His action made all the difference to the community,\" which is more general and lacks the specific details provided in the reference answer. While it acknowledges a positive impact, it does not specifically mention the reassurance and safety for families. Therefore, the model's answer aligns with the general sentiment of the reference but lacks detail and precision. \n\nRating: 3",
