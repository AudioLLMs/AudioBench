The franchise has since expanded to include prequels, sequels, spin-offs, books, and TV series.",
            "model_prediction": "The Star Wars movie is a science fiction film that was released in 1977. It was directed by George Lucas and stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher. The movie tells the story of a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker who discovers he has a connection to the Force, a mystical energy that flows through all living things. He teams up with a rogue smuggler named Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca to rescue Princess Leia from the evil Empire and its leader, Darth Vader. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and the bounty hunter Boba Fett. The movie has become a cultural phenomenon and has spawned numerous sequels, spin-offs, and merchandise.",

            "reference": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model primarily used for analyzing visual imagery. It differs from a regular neural network by using convolutional layers that apply filters to input data, capturing spatial hierarchies and local features. This makes CNNs more efficient and effective for tasks like image classification, compared to regular neural networks that treat input data as flat vectors and may lose spatial relationships.",
            "model_prediction": "A convolved neural network is a type of artificial neural network that uses convolutional layers to process data. Unlike regular neural networks, which use fully connected layers, convolutional networks use filters that slide over the input data, applying weights to each section of the data they encounter. This allows them to recognize patterns and features in images and videos, making them particularly useful for image recognition tasks.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer emphasizes the key difference between a CNN and a regular neural network, highlighting the use of convolutional layers to capture spatial hierarchies and local features. In contrast, the model's answer uses the term \"convoluted neural network\" (which is actually a typo, the correct term is \"convolutional neural network\") and focuses on the filter-sliding mechanism, but doesn't explicitly mention the preservation of spatial relationships.

            "model_prediction": "Wearing a helmet is important for several reasons:\n\n1. Protection: Helmets provide protection to the head and brain from impact injuries, which can be severe and life-threatening in accidents involving motor vehicles, sports, or other activities that involve high-velocity impacts.\n\n2. Safety: Helmets help reduce the risk of head injuries, which are a leading cause of death and disability in many sports and recreational activities. They also help protect against concussions, which can have long-term effects on cognitive function and memory.\n\n3. Compliance: In many countries, wearing a helmet is mandatory in certain activities, such as motocross, cycling, and skiing. Failure to wear a helmet can result in fines and penalties.\n\n4. Style: Helmets come in various styles and designs, making them a fashion accessory for some people. They can also reflect personal preferences and team colors.\n\nOverall, wearing a helmet is an essential safety measure that can save lives and prevent serious injuries. It's important to choose the right helmet for your activity and to wear it consistently to ensure maximum protection.",
