            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"frustration,\" while the model's answer is \"sad.\" These are two distinct emotional states, and they do not align with each other. Frustration typically indicates an emotion related to irritation or annoyance, whereas sadness is associated with feelings of sorrow or unhappiness. The model's response does not accurately capture the meaning from the reference, which explicitly identifies the speaker's emotion as frustration. Therefore, the model's answer is incorrect and does not align with the reference in terms of content and relevance.\n\nRating: 0",
