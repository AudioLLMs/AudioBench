            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"four years in high school,\" which indicates that after primary school, students typically attend high school for four years. The model's answer is \"After primary school, students can join a vocational youth village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring, carpentry, or motor vehicle repair.\" The model's response provides alternative pathways after primary school, such as vocational training or apprenticeships, rather than attending high school. While the model's answer is relevant to the topic of post-primary school options, it diverges significantly from the specific pathway mentioned in the reference answer. Therefore, the model's response does not accurately align with the reference.\n\nRating: 2",

The model's answer \"Vandegraaff\" is incorrect and irrelevant to the question of who lived in a tree for such a cause. There is no connection between the model's answer and the reference answer, which makes it completely misaligned.

The model's answer does provide relevant information about Maxwell's work on electric and magnetic fields, aligning with the reference answer in identifying him as a key figure.
