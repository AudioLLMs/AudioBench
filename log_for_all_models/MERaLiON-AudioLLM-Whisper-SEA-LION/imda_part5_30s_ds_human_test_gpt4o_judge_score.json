The model answer touches on similar themes—trying new things to mitigate regrets—but diverges by focusing more on the example of ice cream and less on the broader concept of living a fulfilled life by pushing boundaries.

Speaker1 mentioned that their house still sells it, and Speaker2 confirmed that Hougang Green still has it, specifically at the interchange. Speaker1 expressed surprise that people still buy it, and Speaker2 shared that they occasionally purchase it, describing it as a tea mixed with syrup, similar to red tea.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer mentions that Speaker1 and Speaker2 discuss Sweet Talk beverages, noting its presence in Hougang and describing the tea as sweet but lacking authentic tea aroma. The model's answer captures the discussion about the availability of Sweet Talk at Hougang Green and mentions Speaker1's surprise that people still buy it, while Speaker2 confirms occasional purchases, describing it as a tea mixed with syrup, similar to red tea. The model's answer aligns well with the reference in terms of content and relevance, capturing the primary points and conclusions. However, it slightly diverges by not mentioning the specific point about the lack of authentic tea aroma, which is an important detail in the reference. Overall, the model's answer is mostly accurate but could be more detailed.\n\nRating: 4",
