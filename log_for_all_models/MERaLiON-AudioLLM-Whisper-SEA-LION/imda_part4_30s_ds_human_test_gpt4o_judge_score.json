            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer focuses on the discussion of online trends, highlighting Speaker1's frustration with repetitive and superficial social media posts. In contrast, the model's answer centers on a social media strategy about encouraging people to join a channel, detailing Speaker1's approach to provide reasons for joining and reading every post for understanding. The model's answer diverges from the reference answer in terms of theme and content, as it does not mention Speaker1's frustration or the superficial nature of social media posts, which are central to the reference. Therefore, the model's response does not accurately capture the essence or details of the reference answer.\n\nRating: 0",

Speaker1 clarified that the money was not their own, but rather a government grant. Speaker2 acknowledged that the organization had put in their own effort, but also received government assistance. The conversation touched on the idea of hard work and the role of government support in achieving success.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer discusses CDA accounts and emphasizes the mix of government contributions and parents' input. In contrast, the model's answer talks about funding and government assistance in a more general context, with a specific mention of an $800 grant received by an organization, which is not mentioned in the reference. The model answer diverges significantly from the reference, as it focuses on the idea of hard work and government support rather than the specific topic of CDA accounts and the involvement of both government and parents. Therefore, the model's response does not accurately reflect the content or focus of the reference answer.\n\nRating: 0",
