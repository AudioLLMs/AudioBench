            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is concise and states that Speaker2 inquired about travel package discounts, and Speaker1 confirmed a 50% discount with cost details and potential additional charges. The model's answer expands on this, adding details about the timing of the discount (for bookings made in December), the original and discounted prices, and mentions GST and service charges. While the model's answer provides more detail, it does not contradict the reference answer; instead, it enhances it by providing additional context. The key points of a 50% discount and cost details are captured accurately. However, the model's answer adds information not present in the reference, such as the specific booking month and GST inclusion, which may not have been implied in the reference.\n\nRating: 4",

Speaker1 acknowledged the information, and Speaker2 explained that the program aims to ensure students have access to lunch, even if they stay back for extracurricular activities.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer focuses on a discussion about a $2 per meal subsidy for primary school students, highlighting that it assists them in affording lunch during CCA (Co-Curricular Activities) days. The model's answer generally aligns with the reference by discussing the meal subsidy program, specifying the $2 subsidy per student for seven meals per week. It also mentions the purpose of ensuring students have access to lunch even if they stay back for extracurricular activities. While the model's answer contains additional details about the subsidy being applicable to meals consumed \"in school or elsewhere,\" it is still mostly relevant and accurate. However, it slightly diverges from the reference by not emphasizing the specific context of \"CCA days\" as strongly.\n\nRating: 4",
