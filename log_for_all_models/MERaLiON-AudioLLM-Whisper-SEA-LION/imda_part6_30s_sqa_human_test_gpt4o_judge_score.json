The model's answer states that a fifty percent discount is available for all travel packages. While the model's answer captures the essence of a 50% discount being available, it fails to specify that this discount is specifically for December bookings and does not mention the reduction in cost or the exclusion of customizations. Therefore, the model's answer aligns with the general idea of a discount but lacks the detail and specificity found in the reference answer.\n\nRating: 2",

It captures the essence of the reference by mentioning the same three types of stations (physical, E-station, and M-station) and specifying their access methods (internet and mobile app).

The model's answer is slightly less clear because it doesn't mention the specific fee amount of $120, but it captures the essence of the promotion accurately and is relevant to the reference.
