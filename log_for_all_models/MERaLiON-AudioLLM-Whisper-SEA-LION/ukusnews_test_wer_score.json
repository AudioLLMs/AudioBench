wartime levels of debt as the chancellor spends nearly £300000000000 in propping up the economy are keeping treasury officials awake at night but low interest rates allow a cautious approach we are going to be living with a much higher debt for a long period and that is easy at the moment because interest rates are so low we are actually spending less on debt interest than ever before but that does not mean that the debt in the long run might not be a worry we do not know if interest rates are always going to be that low and we have got lots of pressures coming down the road aging population more and more spending on health social care all those sorts of things so absolutely we should not be raising taxes at the moment the best way of getting the debt down is for the economy to grow fast but at some point it will be astonishing given the additional pressures that we are facing on public spending if we do not have some more tax at some point rishi sunak faces an unlikely

at all in the blue corner a former conservative prime minister speaks out if i want that i can read it on the front and in the red corner a labor leader arguing against possible tory tax rises that now is not the time for tax rises for families and for businesses final touches after elaborate preparations and a finished product ready for what is a very uncertain market nick what will joining me now david gauke a conservative treasury ministry from 2010 to 2017 and rushanara ali labor mp and member of the treasury select committee good evening to both of you 1st of all david gauke would it be a mistake for the chancellor to raise corporation tax yes i think it would be i i think 1st of all there is a timing issue and i i agree with those who said we do not need to rush into tax increases but i do think in the longer run we will need to raise more in tax the problem is that corporation tax is economically one of the more damaging ways in which we could do so in the end of course all taxes are paid by people whatever the political convenience of going with corporation tax it is a tax essentially on business investment and when business investment can be very mobile it can go where it wants we have to compete for it and we have to be competitive on that front and the consequences in the long term is the we will not get the business investment that we would otherwise do that will not drive up productivity and we will not be as prosperous a country as we would be so i think taxes sorry david you say it is damaging but the fact is it is quite an easy hit in terms of a single percentage point raises £3300000000 well you are right there is a political case for going with corporation tax it does not mean however that that is there is an economic case and i can see why the chancellor might be tempted by it but if we are looking at the long term prosperity of this country if we want to put the economics ahead of the politics i think you would stay clear of of corporation tax there are other taxes that would be less damaging to economic growth you can cut public or you could cut public services but you know all about cutting public services there is nothing there is there a cut to be honest i do not think there there is very much of course you have got to keep you know you have got to get value for money for how you spend your expenditure but there are substantial pressures on public spending in the years ahead so i i do think that tax is going to have to bear the burden here it is just a question if we are going to have a very high tax burden which by historic standards we are we need to be intelligent as to how we raise that money and ensure that we do not raise that money in a way that limits our productive capability rushinara ali you know keir starmer is not we understand in favor of raising corporation tax it would be interesting that labor outflanks the tories on the right and joins up with david davidson ian duncan smith on this look it is not about whether who you join forces with it is about what is right for the country and we are not out of the woods yet we have not even come out of lockdown and if if businesses are taxed prematurely which this would be this would be a premature tax increase on businesses that are employing people we need them to thrive and survive and we need them to employ more people so we can grow our way out of this crisis as much as possible now that is not to say that we should not have a conversation about taxation we do need to have an honest conversation with the british people about how we rebuild our country after the biggest crisis since the 2nd world war but to do that now to introduce taxes on businesses now and choke off growth and create more potentially much more unemployment especially when people go off for the furlough program when certain sectors are really struggling hospitality tourism and many other sectors that would be deeply deeply damaging for our country and i think that the politics david is right about the politics dominating over the economics and national interest here the chancellor has got his eye on the election cycle rather than what is right for the country and what is right for businesses and employers employees stella creasy as you know a big supporter of keir starmer says it is right that we look at corporation tax and actually indeed capital gains tax and ask how and when with those with the broader shoulders can contribute a bit more to the task of rebuilding our nation you know what increase in corporation tax would labor wear or would they not well look the the question is when you tax if you if you look at the amount where we have got to pay back 400000000000 by the end of this year after the 2nd world war it took a very long time to pay off the costs incurred during the war we need to think about a very comprehensive way in which we rebuild our society our economy our national health service with the aging population with intergenerational inequality so stella is absolutely right about making sure that those with the broadest shoulders pay the most and contribute the most as we come out of this crisis the question is when should we do that and i do not think it should happen for at least another a couple of years in fact and most of the evidence most of the experts and also the i m f and zero e c d and other countries that many other countries looking at this and very few people are saying start taxing businesses right now start increasing so david gauke the alternative if not corporation tax do you think boris johnson should cut off the cast iron guarantee he made in the tory manifesto in 2019 we will not raise the rate of income tax we will not raise v a t or national insurance should that still stand i i do not think it it could i i do not think it was a particularly sensible pledge to make at the time but but even accepting that it was made in good faith at that point the circumstances are so changed the the challenges that we face in terms of the public finances are that much more difficult and i think the government would be entitled to say look this is what we said at the time we we intended to one of that but circumstances have changed and you look at those three taxes that you have mentioned kirsty they constitute 64 of all government revenue and if the government is serious about trying to find substantial sums in taxation in due course not for a year or two but in due course to to close off the ability to do very much with those three taxes makes the task that much more difficult and could result in us increasing taxes in a way which is sub optimal and constrains our ability to attract business investment in the years ahead rushinara ali you have talked about the pandemic offering as a chance to make a radical reset much as beverage after the 2nd world war you are imposing an increase on business taxation at the moment so do you also support a freeze on personal allowances well what i what i am saying is that it is right now it would be the wrong move to start start taxing people or businesses we need to stimulate our economy we need to grow our economy for the foreseeable future and the other issue is we still do not know whether these new variants could undermine the vaccination effort and could lead to retrenchment in terms of return returning to some further restrictions even if we ease out of these restrictions now so there are big unknowns still for our economy and our country and that is why what i would say is that the government actually needs to use this budget to support businesses support people back into work next week instead of looking at taxes and freezing personal allowances we need to support people we need to support people at the end of what has been the most appalling set of circumstances over 220000 people have died and our n h s has been on its knees thanks to in part because of the austerity of the last largely because of the austerity of the last decade the government needs to learn the lessons of the last decade in terms of leave thank you very much indeed thank you",

the four most vulnerable groups in england their 1st jab by mid february it has been a truly national uk wide effort we have done it together and i want to thank each and every person who has helped make it happen you can be incredibly proud of the part you have played with vaccinations in full flow the prime minister is promised a roadmap out of lockdown in england a week tomorrow the 22nd of february the government wants schools to open to all pupils on the eigth of march next more outdoor recreation is likely to be allowed followed by more shops being able to open and finally hospitality venues do your vaccination today but with the aim now to offer everyone over fifty their 1st jab by the end of april some argue all legal restrictions should end by then it is completely tied to the rollout for vaccination program and the fact that you are then protecting the most vulnerable people from death and serious disease from covid from the fantastically successful vaccination program the n h s is undertaking and in the industry is worst affected there is an urgency to start trading soon we think we can open very safely for easter weekend we understand as i said that there would be social restrictions in place like there were in july and we will absolutely administer those to the letter and we will ensure that we have got a responsibility for our customers and our staff some conservative mps are growing increasingly frustrated and want firm commitments from the prime minister about when restrictions will be lifted although boris johnson can not ignore the political pressure from his own party the risks of opening things up too soon seem to be weighing more heavily and for now the watchword in government is caution until the impact of the vaccines becomes clear political opponents will be the 1st to accuse boris johnson of easing restrictions before coronavirus is contained this lockdown has to be the final lockdown by the way the strategic aim is is to do everything we can now so we do not have to go back into our lockdown while seizing on the success of the vaccination program so far the prime minister acknowledged there was much more work to do the return to normal is still some way off jonathan blake bbc news so having reached the 1st major vaccination target how does the rollout proceed from here and who is next in line for the jab our science correspondent rebecca morrell reports from margaret keenan in december the 1st person to be vaccinated to less than ten weeks later 15000000 people have had their 1st dose so who will be vaccinated next and when the next stage starts with 65 to 69 year olds that is nearly 3000000 people and those with underlying health conditions an estimated 7000000 next up it is 2000060 to 64 year olds then the 5000050 to 59 year olds that is a total of more than 17000000 people who will be offered vaccines by the end of april then for phase two another 21000000 people the rest of the adult population should be vaccinated by the autumn more than a 1000000 over 65 have already been sent letters this weekend and some areas have even started delivering jabs it is an indication of the different demographics of different parts of the country obviously certain populations will have much higher proportions of those people who are over seventy or who are housebound and that will take longer in my practice in north london we are vaccinating already those people over sixty and 65 people with some medical conditions are also being invited these include chronic lung disease down syndrome diabetes some cancers and morbid obesity so how will we know if vaccination is working the best place to look is israel which has inoculated more of its population than anywhere else in the world and hospitalizations of those who were vaccinated 1st the over 60s are falling much faster than other groups so when could we see an impact in the uk in about a week is time we may well see beginnings of an effect in hospitalizations particularly in older people relative to changes in younger people it will be cases it is going to be a little bit less clear i think because vaccine does not necessarily stop mild cases in the coming weeks could there be any problems there will be some bumps in supply with pfizer overhauling its factory in belgium new variants could also pose a problem and booster shots might be needed to improve immunity covid levels in the uk are still high but vaccinations should soon make a difference helping us map a path out of lockdown rebecca morell bbc news",

like the were in july and we will absolutely administer those to the letter and we will ensure that weve got a responsibility for our customers and our staff some conservative mps are growing increasingly frustrated and want firm commitments from the prime minister about when restrictions will be lifted although boris johnson can not ignore the political pressure from his own party the risks of opening things up too soon seem to be weighing more heavily and for now the watchword in government is caution until the impact of the vaccines becomes clear political opponents will be the 1st to accuse boris johnson of easing restrictions before coronavirus is contained this lockdown has to be the final lockdown by the way the strategic aim is to do everything we can now so we dont have to go back into a lockdown while seizing on the success of the vaccination program so far the prime minister acknowledged there was much more work to do return to normal is still some way off jonathan blake bbc news so having reached the 1st major vaccination target how does the rollout proceed from here and whos next in line for the jab our science correspondent rebecca morelle reports from margaret keenan in december the 1st person to be vaccinated to less than ten weeks later 15000000 people have had their 1st dose so who will be vaccinated next and when the next stage starts with 65 to 69 year olds thats nearly 3000000 people and those with underlying health conditions an estimated 7000000 next up its 2000060 to 64 year olds then the 5000050 to 59 year olds that is a total of more than 17000000 people who will be offered vaccines by the end of april then for phase two another 21000000 people the rest of the adult population should be vaccinated by the autumn more than a 1000000 over 65s have already been sent letters this weekend and some areas have even started delivering jabs it is an indication of the different demographics of different parts of the country obviously certain populations nations will have much higher proportions of those people who are over seventy or who are housebound and that will take longer in my practice in north london we are vaccinating already those people over sixty and 65 people with some medical conditions are also being invited these include chronic lung disease down syndrome diabetes some cancers and morbid obesity so how will we know if vaccination is working the best place to look is israel which has inoculated more of its population than anywhere else in the world and hospitalisations of those who were vaccinated 1st the over sixty s are falling much faster than other groups so when could we see an impact in the uk in about two weeks time we may well see beginnings of an effect in hospitalisations particularly in older older people relative to changes in younger people itll be a case cases its going to be a little bit less clear i think because vaccine doesnt necessarily stop mild cases in the coming weeks could there be any problems there will be some bumps in supply with pfizer overhauling its factory in belgium new variants could also pose a problem and booster shots might be needed to improve immunity covid levels in the yeah uk are still high but vaccination should soon make a difference helping us map a path out of lockdown rebecca morel bbc news",

caroline hyde kaylee lines taylor riggs counting you down to the closing bell romaine he rests and here to take us to the beyond the bell is a global simulcast we are joined now by carol massa tim stenovic of course bringing together our bloomberg television radio youtube audiences worldwide to pass through the most crucial moments of the trading day and i mean whether it has been inflation on the downside concerns and ramping up of their focus on crypto carol all eyes have been on this risk on tone to the day yeah and you have really seen it play out caroline in the trade the technology trade to be specific communication services information technology twitter is up about fourseven facebook google all of these names really getting a big boost and really providing some momentum to the overall trade here tim yeah taking a deeper dive into the s p 500 communication services higher by oneeight information technology and real estate not too far behind utilities though looking like it is likely going to finish the day in the red down just about two tenths of one health care pretty much flat on the day and we go across asset tim and frankly bonds are not doing very much can we say hunch is that too boring you are only down about two basis points but i think haley that really folds into the idea of what we have been seeing with big tech back in the lead that some of those inflationary concerns are on the backseat given that yields are catching a bid really really range bound david sowerby one big comment that stood out to me was he is really pretty surprised at how well behaved the bond market is at this moment well and he had some comments on bitcoin too taylor and i would know we are approaching $40000 thank you very much to elon musk and his twitter account this time elon being a positive upside catalyst caroline meanwhile also upside across the board on your major benchmarks after that pull back on friday just ten seconds until that market closed and as we reach settlement really is big tech back on top guys i noticed though that volumes were down significantly down by about twenty on the nasdaq so volumes down but still the nasdaq your outperformer up onefour a 190 points higher for our radio audience as we look at the s p 500 the closing bell being rung at 41 points higher that is just shy of a percentage point growth dao even the cyclical is up five tenths of a percent but you are underperforming laggard in the day was the russell 2000 your small caps carol yeah that is absolutely we saw some pressure there but we did not see pressure when it came to the sox the philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index up about twothree many of those chip names were among your top performers we know we continue to track some of the pressure certainly on that chip supply chain but nonetheless that is where investors were committing money today tim and on a sector levels i take a look at this for a radio audience mostly green on the screen of course as you are seeing some of those chip making concerns carol that you just mentioned phil trim with the auto sector the best performer on the day you are up more than three followed by pretty much everything technology semiconductors media software services those are all up anywhere from oneseven to twofive carol and caroline frankly the only thing in the red it is only two sectors it is a broad based rally it was interesting we had this broad based warri rally despite some of the geopolitical risks carol we do have a breaking news coming from ap associated press the european union leaders have agreed now on new sanctions against belarus including a ban on the use of eu aerospace and airports of course this after we saw that ryanair flight being grounded journalists being pulled off from belarus so clearly geopolitical risk engulfing the likes of russia just continuing to build yeah exactly and you do wonder we have got to watch these in terms of what the impact could be on some of those international and global companies so certainly something to keep in mind let us talk about some of the gainers because a lot of it was all new economy and those disruptors those kinds of companies specifically virgin galactic we were all watching space tourism is back in a big way we saw virgin galactic climbing big time today up about 27 just off its highs of the day this after they conducted a successful test flight to space for the 1st time in more than two years tesla we have been focusing on that name as well it was up about fourfour we have a bloomberg scoop today that maybe elon musk is looking at lidar as part of those self driving cars and keep in mind bfa actually cut their price target on this company today to 700 from 900 so that did not seem to sway investors coinbase just want to mention double dose of goldman sachs recommended buying the stock also the company tapping goldman is global co head of government affairs to be its top lobbyists we did see coin certainly moving up in today is trade session and beyond meat it was double upgraded to outperform from underperformed by bernstein and so we saw that stock up ten getting ready for all those barbecues tim zero i am certainly right reopening trade it is i had enjoyed some over the weekend i got to tell you though guys on a day like today where the s p 500 the nasdaq 100 closed at the highest level since may 7th it is a pretty tough task to find some notable decliners that said we did see some declines in the energy sector today because cabot oil and gas down nearly seven simrax down more than seven this is the as cabot oil and gas agreed to merge with simrax energy this is an all stock transaction after it was announced those shares of both companies falling more than seven peloton was lower for yeah you are cheating you can not have a gainer in your decliners i know hey you know what sometimes i do this stuff ahead of time and when we saw this late day rally at taylor tells the story of the market it does it tells the story of the market so early in the day peloton was lower by more than two it fell as much as twoeight because ubs came out with a note and said that its analysis shows that the adoption of the peloton digital app is declining slightly but then we saw a broad based tech rally and we also saw the company come out and say that it is building the 1st us factory to build bikes and treadmills in the us this will send potentially equipment to europe much of it coming here to the united states and finally a d r s of g sx tech i do those down nearly twelve it comes on amid a a broader crackdown on chinese education stocks that are listed here in the us as xi jinping called out late last week the need for tougher regulations on after school education and tutoring institutions kaylee all right tim let us talk about factors because you were mentioning the fact that it is big tech and growth that did well today and we are seeing that reflected on a factor basis one of the biggest factor outperformers is actually market capitalization think the biggest stocks out there the likes of apple and amazon for example you also have momentum here at the top well what is at the very very bottom of the pile is the value factor down about one one on the day of course interestingly eric balchunes our etf analyst over at bloomberg intelligence was actually saying that value is the new momentum but clearly factors painting a little bit of a different picture with tech outperforming today taylor and of course we have to round it out with our cross asset and go to treasury bonds unfortunately on a day when cash is trashed and rather own a bitcoin than a bond it does not well have an impact too much on my bond market because they catch a bid and yields fall by about two basis points or so pretty much all across the curve but very range bound and carol i think i led with the lead there right i would rather own a bitcoin than a bond this really kicks off are you ready the comments that we heard from ray dalio at the coin desk consensus where we heard from a slew of other huge leaders but carol an interesting point that after inflation you are losing money why hold a bond you mentioned that event let us bring in ray dalio keep in mind this interview was done on may 6th so it was before a lot of the turmoil that we have seen in the last week or so when it comes to cryptocurrencies and bitcoin but here is what ray dalio had to say at that event i think bitcoin is greatest risk is its success the more we create savings in it the more you might say i would rather have bitcoin than the bond personally i would rather have bitcoin than a bond and and then the more that happens then it goes into bitcoin and it does not go into credit and then they lose control of it so yeah that is a risk alright of course ray dalio there a bridgewater at that coindesk event you know as you said it taylor i mean he is now saying cash is trash he says he owns some bitcoin we do not know how much bitcoin he owns but it comes after a week you guys of so much volatility and turmoil and carolyn we know wall street whether it is jp morgan or goldman they are trying to kind of figure out what is next in terms of the crypto market and bitcoin in particular and i feel as though institutional players are not going to like the fact that well this potentially correlated asset now seems to be moved around by the tweeting habits of one particular elon musk i mean earlier today he once again is now saying he is getting on the case of these bitcoin miners in the united states trying to urge them to be more environmentally friendly michael saylor of microstrategy which is basically a play on bitcoin if you own that stock he was saying he set up that particular meeting well bitcoin is still down over the last seven days down nineteen but it is still actually like got to bounce on the back of that tim tim i am going to interrupt you i have an incredible chart here and actually speaks to you tim you look like you could be from brooklyn do not you eat avocado toast at some point yeah guilty is true come and take a look at this chart if you how much bitcoin you are only up 36 year to date you buy an avocado for tim is avocado toast he is up 92 this highlights inflation highlights commodity inflation it highlights some of the frustration that we have seen with some of these real assets and well i think i am just going to buy some avocados yeah well if you buy some save some for me because they are getting a little expensive look i think though the big picture is that even though we are seeing some of these commodity prices go higher at the same time we are seeing concerns about inflation not necessarily playing out in the equity market for example today was basically like inflation what inflation because we saw the check just absolutely rallied kaylee well yeah and we saw commodities under a little bit of pressure particularly in the asian session because china is not all too happy about the boom we have seen in some of those industrial metals they are increasingly strict in their rhetoric trying to rein in that rally and the question is where does that bleed through and if commodities go down does inflation fear go down with it caroline yeah exactly we are all or carol no one of you i think we are done it is a monday all right we got this one under our belt all right that is going to do it for our cross platform coverage everyone find more on all of these stories just head to bloomberg dot com and of course we will be back again tomorrow same place on bloomberg radio bloomberg tv and on youtube",

            "reference": "this comes at a time where we are finally seeing australian stocks after a terrible year last year getting some love do you think the road to normalization is priced in at the moment no i think what the equity markets are really illustrating is that the growth rebound that we are seeing in australia the relatively positive outlook in terms of the region that we are seeing here locally compared with the quite contained viral cases notwithstanding the most recent news and the fact that we do have that momentum building and the consumer side with the unemployment rate falling sentiment high the wealth effect the housing market really feeding into sort of still quite relatively strong gdp numbers and that is what is being reflected in the equity market as well as that obviously the high commodity prices are helping the middles and mining sector and i think there is still room to go further in terms of the australian equity market particularly as investors look for income and dividends to start coming through more and more let me bring you to the question of the day on our markets live blog which hints at what we heard from chinese authorities in terms of the reserve requirement for their banks trying to dampen some of the the rise that we have seen in the u m but also of course their jaw boning and measures around clamping down on commodities rally as well the question of the day really asking how do these moves that we see from beijing potentially affect broader assets right is there a concern particularly i suppose on the commodity side if china continues to to do what it wants which is to try and get prices lower you know the the one loser i guess if you want to put it that way from having the higher idle prices obviously china they want a low price the reason it would still maintain a certain level of value is that you are still seeing quite high steel demand steel studs are still pretty elevated this little incentive to create that and that should keep iron ore prices at a relatively high level compared to history you know will it touch the highs that it reached earlier this year maybe not because you will see some of that sentiment change and that jaw boning as you mentioned from chinese officials to try and bring it down and it is not the 1st time we have seen that so i think the outlook for commodity prices varies across the sector but if we think about iron ore we think about copper there is still strong demand there and there is still scope for limited supply that has been affected by covid and weather related effects which should really underpin those prices now carrie you still have inflation as a top risk on the inflation front how are you factoring in the risk of supply chain disruptions in asia from the lockdowns we have seen imposed in the region of late and does this give central banks something to worry about i think it does because we look at the inflation outlook we look at what central banks are telling us and it is really about inflation being hit by these one off effects from last year and there is a risk that it becomes a little bit more sticky in terms of these one off events whether it is the base effects from last year the ongoing disruption to supply chains from covid around the asian region particularly around semiconductors and the risk that this sort of one off event becomes a one off event every month for the next few months and inflation remains a bit higher than expected you know we do believe that inflation will come off the highs that it has seen that they will start to come down and eventually supply will come back to meet that accelerated demand but we do think that we look at the labor market particularly in the us and there is a real risk that that wage growth is a bit firmer that inflation is a bit stickier than the federal reserve is telling us and we do bring forward those expectations around tapering and those rate hikes coming through much earlier than the federal reserve is actually telling us i think the inflation outlook is a risk because it is just so unknown at the moment it will take a number of months to really get a true idea of whether we will see that inflation being persistently higher or not and there is just many moving variables when it comes to thinking about all the underpinning else is driving inflation at the moment and kerry what does that mean for the trajectory for yields we have seen a treasury yields pretty much range bound yeah they have not really done much since march of this year we saw that aggressive move in earlier part of the year as we just really saw markets reflected the better economic growth and inflation outlook on the back of that we have seen a lot more movement as the difference between real yields and break evens and how they have sort of moved together and apart and at the moment they are moving apart with break evens rising a lot more than we are seeing in the real yield space and that divergence is not something we have seen for some time so it does not raise that risk around a tapered tantrum again our view is that given the sort of unknown quantity around inflation there is still some raw risk to the downside globally from the vax from the vaccine rolled out and from the virus but also the upside from fiscal stimulus coming through that inflation is likely to be something that consistently pushes yields higher but it will probably be more of a slow grind into the end of the year and we are not expecting anything that is going to trigger a massive upside until we do see those inflation prints becoming a lot more persistent another thing we would watch out for in the near term is again the corporate action if we do look at the earnings season coming up in the us we hear a lot more from companies around supply pressures coming through we could start that to be reflected a bit more nerves and markets around that really translating into margin pressures and potentially that pass through cost to consumers as well kerry we are starting to see valuation metrics come down across asia right are there bargains to be had here now particularly if you take a look at potentially reinvesting some of the gains made in europe and the us back into this part of the world we are always looking for where the valuations are the most attractive but i think right now the focus is really on the earnings outline given that valuations are still pretty elevated around the world when it comes to equity markets we know that there is going to be a valuation drag across the markets this year because of that so you need that upside from earnings to offset that our preference is to look at developed markets at the moment are mainly focused on the european story the risks that come with the asian story are really around the lockdowns we are seeing imposed the potential hits from the supply chain disruptions and we do still tend to focus on china for the long run story understanding some of the pressures that have been faced there around the technology stocks and some of the official action that has been taken i think that when it comes to asia it will be positive in terms of those economies which are much more in tune with that global reopening so we do it towards korea and china we need to offset that sorry korea and taiwan but we need to offset that with some of the the covid numbers that are coming out and our preference is to really think about developed markets in this context we think that e m will be a better lag story it will catch up later on but the earnings outlook is much more strong in europe at the moment and carrie on europe we have seen the stock 600 cap a four month gain what fresh catalyst could keep this momentum going into a season that is historically a weak for european stocks and can the e c b hold off on talking about tapering given where inflation is headed i think the e c b will be lagging when it comes to thinking about tapering i mean the inflation outlook there is much more mute that we are seeing in the us and other developed markets i think there is some way from thinking about really a lot of the more sustained pressures that come through in inflation and also their bond purchasing program now some of the emergency policies they put in place may be reduced a little bit but they also maintain that bond buying program for much longer than we think about potentially the fed doing so to support the economy we are only at the very early stages of that reopening that is happening we still expect a lot more consumer demand to come through and we are also having that lag defect from the european recovery fund which was a bit delayed through some of the political processes still to come into the market and create that upside from the fiscal outlook so i think there is a lot more potential in europe it is a market that has been unloved for some time there is a lot of potential flows to hit in there to push those market valuations higher and the the the valuation around the growth story and the sorry the valuations around the value story and the cyclical story still looks somewhat appealing there",
            "prediction": "this comes at a time where were finally seeing australian stocks after a terrible year last year getting some love do you think the rona normalization is priced in at the moment no i think what the equity markets are really illustrating is that the growth rebound that were seeing in australia the relatively positive outlook in terms of the region that were seeing here locally compared with the quite contained viral cases notwithstanding the most recent news and the fact that we do have that momentum building in the consumer side with the unemployment rate falling sentiment high the wealth effect in the housing market really feeding into sort of still quite relatively strong gdp numbers and thats whats being reflected in the equity market as well as that obviously the high commodity prices are helping the minerals and mining sector and i think theres still room to go further in terms of the australian equity market particularly as investors look for income and dividends to to start coming through more and more let me bring you to the question of the day on our markets live blog which hints that well hear from chinese authorities in terms of the reserve requirement for their banks trying to dampen some of the the rise that weve seen in the yuan but also of course jawboning and measures around clamping down on commodities rally as well the question of the day really asking how do these moves that we see from beijing potentially affect broader assets right is there a concern particularly i suppose on the commodities side if china continues to to do what it wants which is to try and get prices lower to put it that way from having a high oil prices obviously china they want a low price the reason it would still maintain a certain level of value is that you still seeing quite high steel demand steel studs are still pretty elevated theres still an incentive to create that and that should keep oil prices at a relatively high level compared to history you know will it touch the highs that it reached earlier this year maybe not because you will see some of that sentiment change and that jawboning as you mentioned from chinas officials to try and bring it down and its not the 1st time prices varies across the sector but if we think about iron or we think about copper there is still strong demand there and there is still scope for limited supply thats been affected by covid and with the related effects which should really underpin those prices now kerry you still have inflation as a top risk on the inflation front how are you factoring in the risk of supply chain disruptions in asia from the lockdowns weve seen imposed in the region of late and does this give central banks something to worry about i think it does because we look at the inflation outlook we look at central banks are telling us and its really about inflation being hit by these oneoff effects from last year and theres a risk that it becomes a little bit more sticky in terms of these oneoff events whether its the base effects from last year the ongoing disruption supply chain from covid around the asian region and specifically around semiconductors and the risk that this sort of oneoff event become a oneoff event every month in the next few months and inflation remains a bit higher than expected you know we do believe that inflation will come off the highs that it has seen it will start to come down back to meet that accelerated demand but we do think that we look at the labor market particularly in the us and there is a real risk that that wage growth is a bit firmer but that inflation is a bit stickier than the federal reserve is telling us and we do bring forward those expectations around tapering and those rate hikes coming through much earlier than the federal reserve is actually telling us i think the inflation outlook is a risk because it is just so unknown at the moment and it will take a number of months to really get a true idea of whether well see that inflation being persistently high higher or not and its just many moving variables when it comes to thinking about all the underpinning forces driving inflation at the moment and kerry what does that mean for the trajectory for yield to see a treasury yields pretty much range bound yeah they havent really done much since march of this year we saw a aggressive move earlier part of the year as we just really saw markets reflect the better economic growth and inflation outlook on the back of that we have seen a lot more movement as the difference between real yields and break evens and how they have sort of moved together and apart and at the moment theyre moving apart with break evens rising a lot more than were seeing in the real yield space and that divergence is not something weve seen for some time so it does raise that risk around a taper tantrum again our view is that given the sort of unknown quantity around inflation theres still some risk to the downside globally from the vaccine from the vaccine rollout and from the virus but also the upside from fiscal stimulus coming through that inflation is likely to be something that consistently pushes yields higher but it will probably be more of a slow grind into end of the year and were not expecting anything thats going to trigger a massive upside until we do see those inflation prints becoming a lot more persistent the other thing wed watch out for in the near term is again the corporate action if we do look at the earning season coming up in the us we hear a lot more from companies around supply but pressures coming through we could start that to be reflected a bit more nerves in markets around that really translating into margin pressures and potentially that pass through cost to consumers as well kerry were starting to see valuation metrics come down across asia right are there bargains to be had here now particularly if you take a look at potentially reinvesting some of the gains made in europe and the us back into this part of the world well were always looking for where the valuations are the most attractive but i think right now the focus is really on the earnings outlook given that valuations are still pretty elevated around the world when it comes to equity markets we know that theres going to be a valuation drag across the markets this year because of that so you need that upside from earnings to offset that our preference is to look at at the moment and mainly focused on the european story the risks that come with the asian story are really around the lockdowns were seeing imposed the potential hits from supply chain disruptions we do still tend to focus on china for the long run story notwithstanding some of the pressures that been faced there around the technology stocks and some of the official action thats been taken i think that when it comes to asia it will be positive in terms of those economies which are much more in tune with that global reopening so we do look towards korea and china we need to offset that sorry korea and taiwan we offset that with some of the the covid numbers that are coming out and our preferences to really think about developed markets in this context we think that em will be a lag story that will catch up later on but the earnings outlook is much more strong in europe at the moment and carry on europe weve seen the stocks 600 cap a four month gain what fresh catalyst could keep this momentum going into a season that is historically a weak for european stocks and can the ecb hold off on talking about tapering given inflation is headed i think the ecb will be a laggard when it comes to thinking about tapering i mean the inflation outlook there is much more muted than we are seeing in the us and other developed markets i think there is some way from thinking about really i thought a lot of the more sustained pressures that come through in inflation and also their bond purchasing program now some of the emergency policies they put in place may be reduced a little bit but they will also maintain that bond buying program for much longer than we think about actually the fed doing so to support the economy we stages of that reopening thats happening we still expect a lot more consumer demand to come through and we also have that lagged effect from the european recovery fund which is a bit delayed through some of the political processes still to come into the market and create that upside from the fiscal outlook so i think theres a lot more potential in europe its a market that has been unloved for some time a lot of potential flows to head in there to push those market valuations higher and that the valuation around the growth story and the sorry valuations around the value story and the cyclical story still look somewhat appealing there the",

the green but lower than the other major indices lower than the other major indices but i mean russell 2000 look at that painting a picture for our radio viewers is that more than a percentage point kaylee on fire but you know where the biggest volume is within the russell 2000 of course it is a m c stock i was looking at about 5000000 shares being traded hands this is once again a story of the meme stock extravaganza the extravaganza continues this is the 4th day higher for a m c it is up more than a 120 over just the last four days so no the reddit traders are not hibernating they are active they are talking stocks up on wall street bets and they are a force in this market continue to be a force in this market tim yeah kaley a m c shares higher by 35 right now it was news this morning when the market cap surpassed $10000000000 i am looking at the bloomberg right now that market cap up to $13000000000 run man all right we are going to check back in on a m c and a lot of those meme socks which of course pretty much are your leaders in terms of valuation basis and in terms of shares swapping ants here but we are going to take a look here at the major markets here and you see it is a relatively update here nothing outrageous here but you are getting 4200 right now on the s p 500 that is good for about two tenths of a percent the nasdaq composite only up fractionally here on the day and these numbers still need to settle so it can still dip into the red 1300736 that is your number right now down joe is industrial average firmly in the green right now up four tenths of a percent the russell 2000 that is your outperformer here on the day 2273 on the wrestle that is good for a one gain on the day kelly and romain it is all part of that cyclical trade that is doing really well today and that is evident when you peel back the surface of the s p 500 and take a look at what is going on underneath it is those cyclical and value plays that are doing the best the likes of capital goods you have the financials higher as well what is lagging on the day are some of your more safeties the staples big tech under some pressure as well and i would just note one of the cyclical plays you would usually think of energy is also fractionally lower but that largely has to do with the drag that exxon and chevron are creating on that index from all right well you have been talking about 700000000 shares swapping hands today here on a m c that is pretty much your leader here both in terms of value and in terms of the number of shares swapping hands here on the day a huge outperformance here that we have seen on the day but we got to talk about ford here a stock that really is sort of kind of i guess for some people flying under the radar here up for a 2nd straight day here it was up nine yesterday seven today here now close to that $fifteen level you take a look at gap we are going to get those earnings after the bill keep an eye on that and then figs they came to market today of course this sells those scrubs those hospital scrubs are selling at twenty here closing here right around thirty wow for hospital scrubs direct consumer who would have thought well yeah absolutely huge romaine you got the gainers and i got the decline rally you know yeah it is you are absolutely right let us go on the program tomorrow guys zero the oat milk people a deep teas no figs figs okay that sounds good hey let us get to some decliners right now a dollar tree down by more than seven today shares dipping biggest decline since august after the retailers full year earnings per share guidance came in below analyst expectations the cloud platform and a plan lower on the day as well reality holdings corporation this company includes brands like century 21 coldwell banker better homes and gardens sotheby is closing down the date more than ten this after announcing a 300000000 offering of exchangeable senior notes exxonmobil finishing the day down by just more than seven tenths of one this comes of course a day after the surprising win by that tiny activist investment firm engine number one snagging at least two board seats and the promise to push the crude oil driller to diversify beyond oil and fight climate change caroline i i find it funny you did not mention that in general in that in that set up there dollar tree down dollar general having a great day do not they sell the same stuff zero you just ruined my nice segway from a oil yeah he was talking about oil companies and then i was going to move to commodities like when the plan comes together meanwhile let us get back to where the commodity space is and indeed the dollar you could have gotten dollar general into the us dollar but i am looking across asset for us teams right now radio and our tv youtube viewers checking out where oil was up eigth tenths percent on the day when flip flopping around on the news of iran whether we will see an issue in terms of supply coming from iran but indeed the demand and and the fact that we see some of those inventories once again piling up w t i crude up 910 brent crude up seven tenths of a percent steel zinc getting a push higher on the back of once again perhaps the demand story china not pushing back on commodities quite enough for some of these overall commodities pictures meanwhile though what is on the move is foreign currencies the yen down against the us dollar that is the story of yields pushing higher the dollar of course on the downside on the upside meanwhile british pound up six tenths percent bring it back to the uk team why well because mpc member the head in the bank of england saying look maybe we will see rate rises sooner than the market had anticipated we currently also move to the story of bonds remain and we see yields push higher in switzerland and sweden in the united kingdom we are at five basis points and that was a similar story for the united states overall yields pushing higher as we see a sell off in bonds all about that data today remaining yeah taking a look at sixteen on your ten year yield of course that is pretty much where we started of the month here thirty year yield right now at 227 interesting you are looking at bitcoin here on the day right now hunger hanging out right around that 39000 mark of course we did hear from the bank ceos a little bit earlier here in the day they are still speaking in washington i am told that could go on for a little while longer they did address of course a crypto and they all kind of hedge their bets here about a sort of what would actually happen with regards to them offering crypto caroline what did you think of some of those comments well jamie dimon still it is interesting he jamie jordan flip flops around and where crypto is really going they offer it is of course looking at how to offer it to their clients at the bank jp morgan but he says personally he is not recommending it in any way but really the crypto was front and center but so too was the story of diversity the story of e s g tim you were just mentioning how that was such a focus for us yesterday with the exxon news coming out the chevron shareholder news coming out today it was the bank ceos that were really facing tough questions about their focus on oil companies and indeed e s g within their own business yeah look i think we are going to look back on what happened yesterday as a real turning point when it comes to e s g because of the success of such a small activist investor i mean we are talking about 21 hundredths of one of actual ownership of the company and they were able to get at least two board seats it came the same day you mentioned the chevron news and then also from royal dutch shell as well i really do think we are going to look back on on yesterday as perhaps a turning point at least when it comes to the energy industry yeah and while we are on the subject of company news we do have some earnings crossing the wire now from salesforce and shares are moving higher and after hours trading on the backup about two raising their 2nd quarter revenue outlook $6220000000 to $6230000000 that was higher than the estimate also raising their full year revenue guidance for fiscal year 2022 and they did beat on the bottom line for the 1st quarter as well in revenue in the 1st quarter up 22 so some solid results out of salesforce and shares taking up a little bit in after hours trading yeah it will be interesting too to hear kind of how that slack acquisition is going remember a lot of people really want to see a when that is going to close and really how he is going to integrate that into salesforce of course a lot of questions about that deal when it was announced and whether it was actually a sound decision a sound use i should say of the company is capital yeah roman i am watching lionsgate right now because we are seeing numbers from lionsgate coming in revenue of 876400000 beating estimates of $800700000 4th quarter adjusted ebitda of $77400000 beating estimates of $38400000 and then 4th quarter adjusted e p s of ¢zero on these numbers estimates of a loss of ¢seven caroline meanwhile an outstanding start to the year so says ulta beauty tim we are seeing this company raising its full year forecast mary dylan the ceo saying really want to thank the associates they see a very dynamic environment finally we get to take our masks off potentially in certain parts of the united states and we see of course optimism around what is happening in terms of your beauty market up twothree after hours as it raises its outlook for full year 20211st quarter earnings per share remain $four ten versus a loss per share year on year so clearly a changing of the guard there yeah i think those all all of us sort of coming out back out into the wild here after the pandemic should potentially give a boost to some of those companies selling makeup so i think guys we have to circle back though to some of these individual movers and particularly on the retail side you could call it the meme stocks the reddit stocks if you will but on a day where you had a m c up 35 nicola up twenty virgin galactic up fifteen roblox up nine and a lot of other companies that have been associated with that retail trade not only rallying hard it makes you wonder here i have the fundamentals change is this a short squeeze what is going on i am not sure are you laughing at the fundamentals i am laughing i am no c f a but i am not feeling that the fundamentals have changed in terms of your overall viewpoint on these companies this is a short squeeze this is still hashtag a m c to 5000 it is not at 5000 yet but tim up a 1000 on the year and well up for four straight days

            "reference": "hi everyone i am carol massar bloomberg businessweek radio and tv and i am delighted to bring in kathy roy she is the founder ceo and chief investment officer of arc investment llc she is someone who is well known to our audience her consistent performance since she started arc about seven years ago has certainly given her a lot of notoriety kathy 1st of all thank you for joining us i know it is a crazy day we are all watching the markets we are all watching bitcoin in a big way the crypto market is coming undone last trade was about 35000 on bitcoin what is happening right now and how low do you think it can go well i think we are in a risk off period and for all assets if you if you look at the stock market the more risky or volatile parts of the market have come in dramatically since mid february and i think a lot of the concerns have been around inflation initially that was helping bitcoin because obviously bitcoin is in a very important inflation hedge you know it is a it is a rules based monetary policy the 1st global rules based monetary policy we have ever had hugely important reserve currency of the crypto acid ecosystem but i think what is happening right now is because the stock market the highly volatile part of the stock market the innovation oriented part of the stock market has gone through such a correction which has been flamed by inflation fears i think i think the correlations among volatile assets are going to one right now and that is including bitcoin well i want to unpack a couple of things so bitcoin i mean you at one point i think back in april told dow jones that it could go to about $500000 do you still hold that target do you still think that is where we are headed i we do i do yes you know mandra is our crypto analyst and we we go through soul searching times like this and scrape the models and yes our conviction is as high the one thing that has changed here however is the environmental concerns around bitcoin in particular have caused people like elon musk to pull away and say whoa whoa whoa whoa let let me let me make sure i understand this and we believe that even this is going to change because 1st of all right now the percentage of bitcoin mined with renewables and hydro electric power is quite substantial i think in china it is over fifty in renewables and we also believe and we wrote a paper in conjunction with square on this and we are going to have a conference about it in july we believe that bitcoin mining integrated into the distributed grid and by that i mean solar roofs power walls in homes utilities merchant power producers starting to include bitcoin mining in the eco system why would they do that they would do it because renewables are intermittent power sources right weather is it sunny or not wind is it windy or not and bitcoin mining could take off if it is if there is excess energy from solar being loaded into power walls it can be offloaded into bitcoin mining and the whole ecosystem therefore becomes much more economic if this happens we believe that the adoption of solar is going to accelerate dramatically because there is another profit center associated with it bitcoin mining well what happens though in the meantime so here we are at 35000 kathy do you think we go much lower from here you never know how low is low when a market gets very emotional a lot of traders see bitcoin dropping below the 200 day moving average which is which was at 40000 so traders once that happened they just dumped some just dump and run i think we are in a capitulation phase yassine has a dashboard we were looking at all the indicators this morning they are all suggesting that we are in the capitulation phase which is a really great time to buy no matter what the asset is a capitulation phase is buy it is on sale now am i saying 35000 is the low you know if traders and there are a lot of speculators in bitcoin if they are running for the hills just because bitcoin has broken through a moving average that is important to them it could continue but all of our indicators are saying this is capitulation right now do you have a low point on your model for bitcoin no these metrics are are more a measure are we in a truly capitulation phase and it is very detailed yassine uses on chain analysis which this is the only asset where you can see exactly who is doing what when why and how and all of those metrics are saying this is a capitulation this is as as bad as it got during the corona virus crisis so what about systemic concerns and i am not talking about bringing down the financial system but you know more and more of kind of the establishment are getting involved in bitcoin a lot more companies have bitcoin on their balance sheet should we be concerned about their exposure tesla for one but others yes yes well they are usually in the case of square and tesla they are between five and eight of their cash is in bitcoin so i do not think so that is no cause for concern i mean think about it we were worried that tesla would run out of cash of course arc was not worried but the world was worried two years ago that it would run out of cash it has so much cash now that it has the luxury to put five to eight in in bitcoins so microstrategy is another company it has almost all its cash in bitcoin that is that is perhaps something french you know but as i said if we are in the capitulation phase we should not be worried about microstrategy either we do believe this is a new asset class and that institutions they are looking at it right now because the correlations of relative returns and total returns to compare to other asset classes tends to be very low over time and so they have to look at it now esg might prevent a move in wholesale but we do believe that once they understand how renewables are becoming incorporated into the bitcoin mining ecosystem and that bitcoin mining might accelerate the adoption of solar that i think elon will come back and be a part of that ecosystem as well so why do you think he came out and said wait a minute maybe i am going to back off of bitcoin what do you think his concern was what was his nervousness well i think he moved in because he has been thinking watching like we all have basically unhinged monetary policies they are not tied to anything anymore whereas bitcoin is mathematically neutered to top out at 21000000 units and we are approaching 19000000 now so the scarcity factor should increase and support the price we do believe that is what is going to be supporting the price in here i believe what happened after he took the position in bitcoin is he got pushback from institutional shareholders like blackrock if you have got larry think you know beating the drum on climate change as one of the most important topics and problems of our time then he was going to have to face those sorts of concerns i do not think he expected that and now that he is sorting it out learning more about the environmental impact i think he will come back into the mix we certainly hope he will i do not know if he is going to be part of the conference in july or not and would be he would be a very good addition because i think he would provide both sides of the equation how quickly could the adoption of solar accelerate if we introduced mining into that ecosystem do you expect a bitcoin etf to get approved anytime soon and i am curious if you plan to launch a crypto etf anytime soon you know i think well now that gary gensler is head of the sec he is bitcoin friendly we know that he taught a class of course it courses at mit before coming back to the sec so and i think the research professionals at the sec they understand bitcoin in particular and and i think are much more comfortable with it now that we have had several years to digest what exactly it is go through a bear market go through a bull market now go through a bit of a bear market i think watching the ecosystem evolve and actually become even more anti fragile you know we are getting some real tests here and if the system does not break and i do not think it will i think that their comfort will increase in a couple of ways number one the infrastructure is there is robust number two the liquidity is there i do not think i do not think that is going to be disproven here and number three the price is down from very lofty levels so hey why not start an etf after a correction in in the market than before so i actually think the odds are going up now that we have had this correction i do not know if it is going to be this year or not we hear perhaps 4th quarter but you know we heard 3rd quarter before that so as we get closer to the 4th quarter we will know how much is being pushed out hey i want to ask you a bit more about tesla obviously you know you have been out there front and center years ahead when everybody was turning their backs on tesla taking another hit the news out of china they have certainly had some tough time their growth has slowed substantially they have had a lot of headaches and protests in shanghai after some accidents with its cars is the chinese market at risk for tesla i i think the chinese my china is going to favor its local producers like neo and others expanding and i think they are granting subsidies to neo which is the battery swap company even on its very high end cars which they are not granting to tesla so it is obvious and it has always been obvious that china would favor a local producer but what we are seeing from china and particularly tesla is exports into europe where it does not yet have a plant and what we are hearing is the especially in germany but all over europe where their their standards are extremely high for cars in terms of design and performance that they would prefer cars from shanghai which is a much newer plant and much more productive much more efficient in terms of these design perfecting these designs then is fremont and so i think we are seeing a big export market develop from china into europe and i think china will like that china wants to be known not for shipping or exporting you know cheap goods but also high end goods so this could be the beginning of a trend so so is china at risk then for tesla i mean i as i i do not think they are going to shut down the factory at all i think that that factory becomes much more for exporting than we once imagined i will say that tesla is cars in in china have sold very well until very recently i am sure the publicity the publicity it has received has cooled cooled tesla is jets in china but it is it has been fortuitous that this export market has opened up at the same time kept there one thing i want to ask you we talked about at the beginning inflation your mentor you and i talked about this just a few weeks ago art laffer you were in your 20s you know you were focusing on the economy it was a time where inflation was off the charts and everybody thought it would consistently stay that way laffer thought differently and we know well known in the supply side economics here we are at another time where the markets the volatility is often guided by our inflation expectations is inflation going to be a problem in your view well we have been saying for some time actually since the depths of the corona virus we were doing youtube videos saying regularly v shaped recovery businesses are way behind consumers consumers are buying all of these goods in fact that is all they can do because they are stuck at home right so they were buying non durable and durable goods that could be shipped to them right right none ok that part of consumption is 13rd of consumption and a disproportionate amount or percentage of the market basket of consumers was in goods for the past year businesses were did not expect it they were behind even before the corona virus they had been lagging in terms of capital spending in terms of inventories they were worried about inverted yield curves in china us trade conflict there were many many concerns so they have been dragging their feet they have got even further behind and and still have not caught up so what is a double triple ordering maybe quadruple ordering because they just can not get the goods exactly we have got companies panic buying too panic buying and so what i believe is we are setting up for a massive period of deflation now let me explain that there are three sources of deflation one is when the orders these double and triple orders are canceled right now we have seen lumber correct thirty in the last week i think this is the beginning of that copper is now starting to correct and i believe that commodity prices went too far too fast as businesses were scrambling and panicking right they are losing business to competition if they had not planned their inventories correctly so that is one source of deflation but that is only cyclical deflation and we actually did not expect it to start now we expected it to start later in the year but i guess it makes sense now that vaccines are here and consumers are shifting away from goods towards services or at the margin the writing is on the wall those are double and triple orders are going to be canceled prices were too high and we are probably going to see a drop in commodities but there are two other sources of deflation out there and this is what we have been saying for quite some time one has to do with it is a good deflation it is caused by technologically enabled innovation and we believe when you see dna sequencing costs dropping forty for every cumulative doubling in genome sequenced or when you see a training costs dropping 37 to fifty per year these are massive deflationary forces that are going to hit every part of the economy ai is going to be everywhere so that is good deflation now what is bad deflation bad deflation is going to hit those companies that are going to be disinterred into mediated and disrupted by all of the innovation that we talk about all the time based on dna sequencing robotics and storage artificial intelligence and blood gene technology so companies who have leveraged up to satisfy short term oriented shareholders who say i want my profits now i want my dividends now so they buyback their shares they have not been investing enough in innovation they are going to lose if they are not lucky if they are if they are unlucky they will lose their businesses so kathy what i like about you is your consistency and we have been talking about these themes right for a long time having said that you know your performance has been really consistent it has been a tougher year this year and you have had flows out of your funds i was tracking just i think over the last week it is almost a $1000000000 so you know how do you keep your investors kind of energized in your philosophy and your thinking and your outlook and confident in your strategy you know in a moment where there is a lot of doubt out there yes well a couple of things just in terms of flows in our our biggest outflows were in march there are a lot of commentators out there shall i say screaming about how etf would have to show our etf would have to shut down which is impossible and they just do not understand the etf infrastructure surrounding us it is a beautiful thing let me tell you the flows are no problem our spreads have not moved but anyway beyond that what has happened is our price targets for the next five years that is our investment time horizon have not changed right i looked at not at all no in fact some of them have gone up as quarterly results have come out now they are not going to change that much because that one quarter is result is not going to change a five year price target by that much but the forces that the corona virus put in motion supporting all of the innovation that in which we invest they are not they they are not looking back and so what we are seeing is you know a thirty to forty discount to peak prices in in february for the same price targets so we are looking at this saying alright on sale innovation is on sale and zero by the way the bull market has broadened out it has it is now embracing value and more cyclical stocks so what has happened is the bull market has broad and has strengthened and that is using usually a launching pad for our next move up this happened if i can just say 2016 same thing 4th quarter of sixteen after trump against all expectations was elected value stocks took off because we are going to have a big cycle of tax cuts right and our strategy went down we were negative but what happened was 2017 was one of our best years ever saved last year and that is because the bull market broadened out included value cyclicals were taking off and the economy was on the mend our economy is very strong right now and cyclical earnings growth and revenue growth is a competition to innovation but if we are right on what is happening with commodity prices right now and that is going to be extended that is the ticket to the next move in our kinds of stocks well that is interesting too what about though the tech underperformance kathy that we have seen how much longer do you think you know we see that well you can never say when we have hit bottom i mean i can tell you that the valuations in our mall and in our portfolios would suggest that over the next five years again if our research is correct no promises we believe that our portfolios will more than triple over the next five years so that is more than a 25 compound annual rate of return over the next five years actually it is approaching thirty after today so you know i am looking at that with great confidence because these innovation platforms have hit escape velocity and there is no turning back there is no turning back because they are helping businesses and consumers back world war you little freak sorry that we got your back go ahead no that is ok i am freezing up go ahead please we were not going back to the old world we are not going back to the old world so you know my confidence has only increased in our strategies can i ask you why did you guys get out of apple your position in apple ok what we do when a bull market is as extended as as the move into our type of stock was is as that move happens we start it we were freezing up a little bit let us see if we can get kathy back that is ok so innovation is happening but not always when it comes to the virtual conversation go ahead you are telling me not apple so apple was one of our cash like instruments it is an innovative company it is in in in the innovation zone but its characteristics are very defensive so we will add names like apple the things apple google facebook we will add those add to those positions or even reintroduce those stocks as a bull market our portfolios wrap 150 we knew there was going to be a correction and we just wanted to have very liquid stocks apple is a great company is going to do fine it is a fang it is in a lot of portfolios we are all about the next things but we will use the existing things if you see they are acting very defensively become a defensive group so we will fold them and increase them when we see a move like we saw last year when we see a decline like the one we are seeing now we are seeing much higher returns from the other stocks in our portfolio you know you are talking about kind of value in cyclical and i am curious are there any value and cyclical strategies right now that you guys have identified as ones you want to pursue well in our space strategy a r k x you will find a lot of value oriented stocks many people are surprised to see deer for example in there and what they do not understand is thanks to satellite technology and and and the increase in the number of satellites out there and that and the precision that we are getting from them we are now enabling precision agriculture with autonomous tractors and drones so without without that constellation out there that would not be happening we think the two biggest applications or are beneficiaries of the space race are satellites going to enable mobile connectivity or connectivity around the world broadband conductivity it is really hard for us to imagine that 3000000000 people in the world have no access to the internet or broadband this is going to enable that satellite and also farming and the other thing we think is is going to happen much sooner than space tourism or it will be a much bigger deal in terms of revenue generation is hypersonic flight so any aerospace company focused on hypersonic flight we are interested in and they tend to be value stocks you mentioned earlier there have been people who have been very vocal and public fans of you and then some now have become your critics or they criticize you know having a younger investment and a group of analysts your analysts team what do you say to them i would say that is our secret weapon those analysts have their their education and their feet in the new world the most seasoned analysts health care analysts on wall street and god bless them they have been great at what they do anything they know all the code words and how to decipher them from the fda but they probably have not experimented with crisper gene editing like our genomic analysts have and they do not have advanced degrees in cognitive computing including bringing behavioral science into it so many of our analysts are coming to us directly from college and they are fully equipped with domain expertise in a way that most analysts out there again very seasoned are not just because they did not go to school and have not been exposed to these new technologies no no know there are a lot of phds out there and they of course know a lot but i would put any of our analysts up against the most seasoned analysts on the street when it comes to the topic of innovation and new technologies right that is our focus and so why would not we i think we have a competitive advantage for a few reasons number one our analysts their domain expertise number two are their willingness to engage with the communities out there through social media and give our research away not when it is finished but as it is evolving so that they can communicate and engage with the innovators themselves so i think we have a competitive dynamic unmatched out there in the industry hey just to wrap up cathy i knew about you and i have been talking for a lot of years this has kind of been a year that is unusual i would i would say in some regards for you what have you learned in the past year and what is maybe change mean to you well as we were having such an incredible year last year and i do think the corona virus crisis caused it innovation so it solves problems i kept saying to everyone this will not everyone in the company we must stay humble we must stay humble and we must we we know this is going to come to an end we are going to go through a severe correction and we have to just keep our our heads down focused on our research to to keep our conviction and and drive our strategies forward that is what is happened keeping our heads down hopefully staying humble and really trying to educate people the great opportunities available out there get on the right side of change this is going to be the most amazing period of my investment career and i have been through forty plus years because we have never seen five innovation platforms evolve at the same time all of them leading to exponential growth trajectories that are going to transform people is lives and so i say just you know read our research and talk to our analysts on twitter if you really want to learn more and and and join the rally because we believe it is going to be magnificent just quickly from the audience do you ever get recognized in public like a celebrity some people likened you to warren buffett and do you ever miss kind of your pre rock star days just quickly the answer is yes to much to my surprise even in an island off of new zealand which is what but and no we are honored and delighted because you know what and i know it has been hard for our clients in recent months keep the faith but many people is lives have been changed by what happened last year they they put there they allocated resources towards our strategies towards bitcoin and and they had a magnificent run so it is gratitude that we feel now of course we are feeling very responsible of course this year but that is why it is so important for us to say you know that what pains me more than anything as a portfolio manager is when i know our clients are selling at the bottom and it usually is that people sell the big capitulation that i described earlier with bitcoin is selling at the bottom so so you make a terrible mistake and you do not want to ever get in again and it just pains me so i am just praying that we do not have a lot of that we have had a lot of retention just to correct one thing you said at the beginning actually as a firm we have not had one month of redemptions in the etf platform had if you go month end to month end which is how we measure this sort of thing our gins and march were 500000000 we had we we have had positive flows in april may it remains to be seen it has been nip and tuck it may end up being a small depends on what happens in these last few weeks but you know if there is real capitulation sure we could have a big outflow but i think that is capitulation",
            "prediction": "everyone im carol massar bloomberg businessweek radio and tv and im delighted to bring in kathy wood shes the founder ceo and chief investment officer of ark investment llc she is someone who is well known to our audience her consistent performance since she started ark about seven years ago has certainly given her a lot of notoriety kathy 1st of all thank you for joining us i know its a crazy day were all watching the markets were all watching bitcoin in a big way the crypto market is coming undone last trade was about 35000 on bitcoin whats happening right now and how low do you think it can go well i think were in a riskoff period and for for all assets if you if you look at the the stock market the the more risky or volatile parts of the market have come in dramatically since mid february and i think a lot of the concerns have been around inflation initially that was helping bitcoin because obviously obviously bitcoins a very important inflation hedge you know its  its a rulesbased monetary policy the 1st global rulesbased monetary policy we have ever had hugely important reserve currency of the crypto asset ecosystem but i think whats happening right now is because the stock market the highly volatile part of the stock market the innovationoriented part of the stock market has gone through such a correction which has been fanned by inflation fears i think i think the correlations among volatile assets are going to one right now and thats including bitcoin well i want to unpack a couple of things so bitcoin i mean you at one point i think back in april told dow jones that it could go to about $500000 do you still hold that target do you still think thats where were headed i i we do i do yasen elmandra is our crypto analyst and and we we go through soul searching times like this and and scrape the models and yes our conviction is as high the one thing that has changed here however is the environmental concerns around bitcoin in particular have caused people like elon musk to pull away and say wow wow wow wow let me let me let me make sure i understand this and we believe that even this is going to change because 1st of all right now the percentage of bitcoin mined with renewables and hydro electric power is quite substantial i think in china its over fifty in renewables and we also believe and we wrote a paper in conjunction with square on this and were going to have a conference about it in july we believe that bitcoin mining integrated into the distributed grid and by that i mean solar roofs power walls in homes  utilities merchant power producers starting to include bitcoin mining in the ecosystem why would they do that they would do it because renewables are intermittent power sources right weather is it sunny or not wind is it windy or not and bitcoin mining could take off if its if theres excess energy from solar being loaded into power walls it and be offloaded into bitcoin mining and the whole ecosystem therefore becomes much more economic if this happens we believe that the adoption of solar is going to accelerate dramatically because theres another profit center associated with it bitcoin mining well what happens though in the meantime so here we are at 35000 kathy do you think we go much lower from here you never know how low is low when a market gets very emotional a lot of traders see bitcoin dropping below the 200 day moving average which is which was at 40000 so traders once that happened they just dump some just dump and run i think were in a capitulation phase yasine has a dashboard we were looking at all the indicators this morning they are all suggesting that we are in the capitulation phase which is a really great time to buy buy no matter what the asset is a capitulation phase is buy its on sale now am i saying 35000 is the low you know if traders and there are a lot of speculators in in bitcoin if they are running for the hills just because bitcoin has broken through a moving average that is important to them it could continue but all of our indicators are saying this is capitulation right now do you have a low point on your model for bitcoin no these metrics are are more a measure are we in a truly capitulation phase and its very detailed yasin uses onchain analysis which this is the only asset where you can see exactly whos doing what when why and how and all of those metrics are saying this is a capitulation this is as as bad as it got during the corona virus crisis what about systemic concerns and im not talking about bringing down the financial system but you know more and more of kind of the establishment are getting involved in bitcoin a lot more companies have bitcoin on their balance sheet should we be concerned about their exposure tesla for one but others yes yes well theyre usually in the case of square and tesla theyre between five and eight of their cash is in a bitcoin i dont think so thats no cause for concern i mean think about it we were worried that tesla would run out of cash of course ark was not worried but the world was worried two years ago that it would run out of cash it has so much cash now that it has the luxury to put five to eight in in bitcoin so microstrategy is another company it has almost all its cash in bitcoin thats thats perhaps something different you know but as i said if we are in the capitulation phase we shouldnt be worried about microstrategy either i we do believe this is a new asset class and that institutions they are looking at it right now because the correlations of relative returns and total returns to compare to other asset classes tends to be very low over time and so they have to look at it now e s g might prevent a move in wholesale but we do believe eve that once they understand how renewables are becoming incorporated into the bitcoin mining ecosystem and that bitcoin mining might accelerate the adoption of solar and i think elon will come back and be a part of that ecosystem as well so why do you think he came out and said wait a minute maybe im going to back off a bitcoin what do you think his concern was what was his nervousness well i think he moved in and because hes been thinking watching like we all have basically unhinged monetary policies theyre not tied to anything anymore whereas bitcoin is mathematically metered to top out at 21000000 units and were approaching 19000000 now so the scarcity factor should increase and support the price we do believe that is what is going to be supporting the price in here i believe what happened after he took the position in bitcoin is he got pushback from institutional shareholders like blackrock if youve got larry fink you know beating the drum on climate change as one of the most important topics and problems of our time then he was going to have to face those sorts of concerns i dont think he expected that and now that hes sorting it out learning more about the environmental impact i think hell come back into the mix we certainly hope he will i dont know if hes going to be part of the conference in in july or not it would be he would be a very good addition because i think he would provide both sides of the equation how quickly could the adoption of solar accelerate if we introduced mining into that ecosystem do you expect a bitcoin etf to get approved anytime soon and im curious if you plan to launch a crypto etf anytime soon you know i think well now that gary gensler is head of the sec hes bitcoin friendly we know that he taught a class courses at courses at mit before coming back to the sec so and i think the research professionals at the sec they understand bitcoin in particular and and i think are much more comfortable with it now that weve had several years to digest what exactly it is go through a bear market go through a bull market now go through a bit of a bear market i think watching the ecosystem evolve and actually

world so you know my confidence has only increased in our strategies can i ask you why did you guys get out of apple your position in apple okay what we do when a bull market is as extended as as the

we will add names like apple the fangs apple google facebook we will add those add to those positions or even reintroduce those stocks as a bull market our our portfolio is up 150 we knew there was going to be a correction and we just wanted to have very liquid stocks apple is a great company its going to do fine its a fang its in a lot of portfolios we are all about the next fangs but we will use the existing fangs if you see they are acting very defensively become a defensive group so we will fold them in increase them when we see a move like we saw last year when we see a decline like the one were seeing now were seeing much higher returns from the other stocks in our portfolio you know you were talking about kind of value and cyclical and im curious are there any value and cyclical strategies right now that you guys have identified as ones you want to pursue well in our space strategy arkx youll find a lot of value oriented stocks many people are surprised to see deer for example and there and what they dont understand is thanks to satellite technology and and the increase in the number of satellites out there and the and the precision that were getting from them we are now enabling precision agriculture with autonomous tractors and drones so it without without that constellation out there that would not be happening we think the two biggest applications or are beneficiaries of the space race are satellites going to enable mobile connectivity or connectivity around the world broadband connectivity it is really hard for us to imagine that 3000000000 people in the world have no access to the internet or broadband this is going to enable that satellites and also farming and the other thing we think is is going to happen much sooner than space tourism or itll be a much bigger deal in terms of revenue generation is hypersonic flight so any aerospace company focused on hypersonic flight were interested in and they tend to be value stocks you mentioned earlier there have been people who have been very vocal and public fans of you and then some now have become your critics or they criticize you know having a younger investment and you know group of analysts your analyst team what do you say to them i would say thats our secret weapon those analysts have their  their education and their feet in the new world the most seasoned analysts health care analysts on wall street and god bless them theyve been great at what they do anything they know all the code words and how to decipher them from the fda but they probably havent experimented with crispr gene editing like our genomic analysts have and they dont have advanced degrees in cognitive computing including bringing behavioral science into it so many of our analysts are coming to us directly from college and they are fully equipped with domain expertise in a way that most analysts out there again very seasoned are not just because they didnt go to school and havent been exposed to these new technologies now i know there are a lot of ph d s out there and they of course know a lot but i would put any of our analysts up against the most seasoned analysts on the street when it comes to the topic of innovation and new technologies right thats our focus and so why wouldnt we i think we have a competitive advantage for a few reasons number one our analysts their domain expertise number two are their willingness to engage with the communities out there through social media and give our research away not when its finished but as its evolving so that they can communicate and engage with the innovators themselves so i think we have a competitive dynamic unmatched out there in the industry hey just to wrap up kathy and you but you and i have been talking for a for a lot of years this has kind of been a year thats unusual i would i would say in some regards for you what have you learned in the past year and and what is maybe change mean to you well as we were having such an incredible year last year and i do think the coronavirus crisis caused it innovation solves problems i kept saying to everyone this will not everyone in the company we must stay humble we must stay humble and we must we we know this is going to come to an end we are going to go through a severe correction and we have to just keep our our heads down focused on our research to to keep our conviction and and and drive our strategies forward thats whats happened keeping our heads down hopefully staying humble and really trying to educate people the great opportunities available out there get on the right side of change this is going to be the most amazing period of my investment career and ive been through forty plus years because weve never seen five innovation platforms evolve at the same time all of them leading to exponential growth trajectories that are going to transform peoples lives and so i say just you know  read our research  talk to our analysts on twitter if you really want to learn more and and and join the ride because we believe its going to be magnificent just quickly from the audience do you ever get recognized in public like a celebrity some people people likening you to warren buffett and do you ever miss kind of your pre rockstar days just quickly the answer is yes too much to my surprise even in an island off of new zealand which is what but and you know we are honored and and delighted because you know what and i know its been hard for our clients in recent months to keep the faith but many peoples lives have been changed by what happened last year they they put their they allocated resources towards our strategies towards bitcoin and and they had a magnificent run so its gratitude that we feel now of course were feeling very responsible of course this year and but thats why its so important for us to say you know what pains me more than anything as a portfolio manager is when i know our clients are selling at the bottom and it usually is that people sell the big cap regulation that i described earlier with bitcoin is selling at the bottom so you make a terrible mistake and you dont want to ever get in again and it just pains me so im just praying that we dont have a lot of that weve had a lot of retention just to correct one thing you said at the beginning actually as a firm weve not had one month of redemptions the etf platform had if you go month end to month end which is how we measure this sort of thing right our regions in march were 500000000 we had weve had positive flows in april may remains to be seen its been nip and tuck it may end up being a small it depends on what happens in these last few weeks but you know if theres real capitulation sure we could have a big outflow but i think thats capitulation",

day romaine bostic taylor riggs and kaylee lyons counting you down to the closing bell and here to help take us beyond that bell carol master and tim cenovec bringing together our bloomberg television radio and youtube audiences parsing the crucial moments of the day and carol i really appreciate you taking time from your bartending gig to break down what is happening today but you got to talk you were you were interviewing kathy wood earlier today and i mean you had sort of your poll your finger on the pulse what was going on what did she tell you about today is moves i am not just making drinks with the star of outlander but i also did talk to kathy with listen she is staying true to her conviction she still sees bitcoin going very higher from here what is interesting is listen she has got her plays she sees it as a market capitulation that maybe is happening right now and there is a lot of market watchers you are saying well maybe now we created some entry points for some of the different asset classes tim yeah they say timing is everything when it comes to markets but i say timing is everything when it comes to that interview you had with kathy wood because there is pretty much no better day to get to talk to her because cryptocurrency obviously a huge focus today at one point bitcoin was down more than thirty before recovering quite a few of those gains it was an absolutely wild day in the crypto markets and also we saw quite the sell off in equities before quite the bounce back a little later in the day yeah buying the dip seems to be a thing today tim and i have to say that if there is an asset that can swing $10000 in a single day maybe it is not all too unrealistic to expect that maybe one day it could indeed reach $500000 taylor the best note i read from cornerstone macros saying that the direction of these spillovers does imply that a crypto crash may spell wider pain for the broader financial markets that was the key question with financial markets well you guys are talking about some of the by the dip action going on in cryptos but we are seeing by the dip happening right here in equities a huge sort of leg up here for the nasdaq 100 which looks like it is going to finish in the green the nasdaq composite basically on the day right now the s p fiver 100 looking like it is going to finish up about a down about three tenths of a percent the dow jones industrial average 33900 right now on the screen down about five tenths of a percent the russell 2000 that is also your relative laggard here down about eight tenths of a percent girl well i am pretty remarkable romain you talked about us finishing kind of at our highs of the session this is after tim mentioned the fed minutes we did see stocks move down after the fed minutes were released we saw yields moving up maybe a little bit of a mini taper tantrum or so as the fed seems to be looking at asset prices and also maybe starting to think about taylor talking about when they start to move back on all of this easy monetary policy take a look at some of those asset prices caroline usually nails it every day with gmm she is out today so we are going to switch it up and do crypto go that is the best thing about the terminal there is a function literally for everything in this case all of the cryptos that you need to follow the only thing i will highlight for our radio audience everything is in the red that is all you need to know the camera is going to follow me bear with me here the only thing that i love on this screen as well the thirty day range in a matter of two days everything has gone down to the very low end of that thirty day range unbelievable yeah amazing moves and let us talk about some of the gainers today really a lot of it was earnings related and let us go through it target up about six here huge 1st quarter com sales beat huge huge performance 1st quarter sales soaring you guys expecting a more profitable 2021 remain i found that interesting that they were giving visibility about what they expected i am not actually surprised at how aggressive some of these guidance we are getting out of some of these retailers yeah exactly and it tells us a lot we will see whether we continue to hear that kind of upbeat outlook got to mention take two we were breaking it down after the close yesterday up seven up the most in ten weeks again in eps sales beat also analog devices love to watch the chip sector earnings eps and outlook beat and then marvel not the avengers not the superheroes we are talking about another semi device company city making its top semi pick and that stock was up about five here today yeah i was watching crypto related companies on the decliners today because anything that was crypto adjacent fell though recovered much later in the day let us start with microstrategy finishing the day down by more than sixsix at one point in the day it was down more than fifteenfive this is a business analytics company but it has 1000000000s of dollars of bitcoin on its balance sheet michael sayler leading the company there coinbase finishing the day down close to six at one point in the day guys a similar theme to what we saw with these other companies down by nearly thirteen tesla this is an interesting one finishing the day down twofive to its lowest levels since march eigth numbers on coinbase and and particularly on tesla 536 given where it was and tesla is not just off today because of crypto exactly it is off because of concern over china we got some data from china that there is slowing growth and that is such an important market to the company carol well kathy would not worry about that either that has been a big bet for her as well she is talking about how they are expanding into europe as well but we got to talk about crypto guys let us talk about a little bit more because when we saw that plunge across the board in terms of all those cryptocurrencies we were talking talking about wiping 100s of 1000000000s of dollars off digital tokens overall and taylor you look at the numbers i mean we were whipsawed today what what is the path to bitcoin to 500000 do we have it tell me really what carol what is the path to get there i thought what was interesting is kathy said specifically that we have got now about 19000000 bitcoins out there we are going to top out at 21000000 guys it is basic supply and demand economics 101 to some extent but there is a volatility issue here and i mean right after you had your interview with kathy wood i interviewed the ceo of binance us this was a cryptocurrency platform that was actually down or at least it was having trouble sort of facilitating some of these orders today and i just wonder sort of for something that is supposed to be so valuable how can it be so unstable well and why is it valuable remain my thing is still all about the use case because of course part of this volatility was inspired by the fact that the p b zero c said hey guys you can not actually use this as a currency but were you ever supposed to use it as a currency or were we treating this as a store of value kaylee you make a really good point it is a point that it is a question that we asked chipotle ceo just a few weeks ago i mean are you going to start are you going to start accepting bitcoin as payment for chipotle he had that reaction he pretty much left it he laughed at me he kind of laughed at me but it is a real question when you have a cup that you it is unstable but if you stabilize it then sure you could spend it on but what would what would michael saylor say about that well you know until a few weeks ago or until last week elon musk accepting payment in cryptocurrency and bitcoin specifically for tesla vehicles and i think a day like today says wait a 2nd if i am a company that is considering accepting bitcoin as a form of payment do i really want to do that we have look we have talked about crypto we have talked about tesla and i think that sort of brings up the broader theme of where we are in terms of correlations i was reading a note here of course cornerstone macro saying that the hedging value has been deteriorating over time with bitcoin you wonder what it means for the correlations carol of the broader markets they are saying that the direction of the spillovers given it is such a high beta asset does mean some wider financial pain and you wonder if that was indeed what we saw today given is tesla a crypto play or is coinbase the crypto play i thought tesla was a car company energy company energy batteries and listen their crypto holdings are a small part of what co you know ultimately makes you know up that company i think what is real we have to think about is watch the financial establishment how they continue to increasingly embrace cryptocurrencies if they start to back off then maybe we start to look at this in a different way well and i also want to talk about asset prices broadly because we had both the ecb and the fed today saying in their respective minutes of financial stability report hey things are looking frothy and exuberant and i look at crypto and i say well yeah yeah they are just real quickly here we are getting some earnings here remember fundamentals guys i know taylor thank you cisco cisco systems these are easier easy for me to say here those four queue numbers coming in this is their outlook here they are seeing revenue at six to eight that is the range given the street was looking for an average of about fivesix here so coming in with a pretty decent guidance but those three queue numbers are giving people a little bit of a pause here i am just going to give you a couple quick ones here three queue revenue 12800000000 the street was looking for twelvesix and adjusted eps coming in at ¢83 the street was looking for ¢82 so a beat here but maybe not a big enough beat here maybe that is why you are seeing the shares down about two in post market trading yep two to three now trying to find a range of course carol as we figure out where the market is going to go from here you know i think haley brought up a good point with the other big story of the days all about those fed meeting minutes and i thought we were not even close to talking about talking about tapering and today you saw that push forward of some participants might start talking about tapering soon are we whispering ellen zetner exactly except it is just morgan stanley killing it it is like hey honey i am thinking about doing something but i am not quite there yet i mean this is this is kind of how the fed does it is right right after the interview that that you had and then i had yeah then mike mckee interviewed rafael bostic right they kind of seemed to throw water on this idea that the fed would move quicker than than what than what everyone seems to think they would there is a lot going on by the way at that bloomberg business week conference by the way if you have not checked it out carol she makes a meme what were you making in manhattan no what was i making in old fashion an old fashion this is what she gets to do all day she gets to make drinks she gets the fun stuff she gets all the plumbers i work really hard no but listen i do wonder fed is bostick you know saying about being nimble the fed needs to be nimble and i wonder if now this is you know we have transitory and now we have to be nimble whether we are going to start seeing kind of these different words tim yeah and the important thing to keep in mind is that the minutes from a meeting before we got that jobs report just a couple of weeks ago that really concerned a lot of people about the pace of job growth and also the inflation data that we got last week so important to keep that in mind yeah we are starting to see downside surprises on the economic data and the city us economic surprise index is about to flip back into negative territory our colleague joe reisenthal pointing that out in his odd lots column on the bloomberg today i am sure he is going to talk about the ones what would you miss who is that guy he has got his own crypto now does he even talk to us anymore i think it went bust already by the way all right well cheers it has been quite a day a dram of what is in there no it is coffee it is a cappuccino for everyone likely story all right that is going to do it for our cross platform coverage on bloomberg radio bloomberg tv and youtube we will be back again same time tomorrow",

service of america and the service of freedom the service of justice remember their sacrifice their valor and their grace remember their smiles their loves their laughter their essential vibrant and transcendent humanity for while we stand amidst monuments of stone we must never forget that each of these markers for those known and unknown here at arlington and far beyond represent a precious life a son a daughter a mother a spouse a brother a sister a friend a neighbor for those who mourn a loved one today jill and i have some idea how you are feeling our losses are not the same but that black hole you feel in your chest as if it is going to suck you into it we get i know the incredible pride you felt seeing your loved one wearing the uniform of our country and the pride they felt wearing it our son beau serviced the delaware army national guard unit there he spent deployed in iraq was one of the things that he was most proud of in life yesterday marked the anniversary of his death and it is a hard time hard time of year for me and our family just like it is for so many of you it can hurt to remember but the hurt is how we feel and how we heal i always feel beau close to me on memorial day i know exactly where i need to be right here honoring our fallen heroes because through pain and anguish of his loss i remember the pride on his face when i pinned those bars on his shoulders all of you who are fighting with the fresh pain of loss as hard as it is to believe i promise you this the day will come when image of your loved one will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes the bible teaches blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted that comfort that reassurance can be a long time in coming but it will come i promise you and my prayer for all of you is that they that day will come sooner rather than later we all know of memorial day is origins lie in the wake of the civil war a war for the freedom of all a war for union a war for liberty and for the preservation of a constitution and calling for such today general john logan commander of the grand army of the republic issued general order number eleven he directed the nation set aside a day to honor and i quote those who died in the defense of their country during the late rebellion and whose bodies now lie in almost every city village and hamlet church art throughout the land and so we have and so we do again today in our time we are the children of sacrifice made by a long line of american service members each a link in that chain of honor we live by the light of the flame of liberty they kept burning we are free because they were brave here on these gentle rolling green hills and across america and around the globe lie buried the heroes of a greatest experiment the world has ever known ever seen the experiment bears the noble name the united states of america women and men all those we honor today gave their lives for the country but they live forever in our hearts forever proud forever honorable forever american they are they are the sentinels of liberty defenders of the downtrodden liberators of nations and still today americans stand watch around the world often in great personal peril war and conflict death and loss are not relics of our american history they are a part of american story here in arlington lie heroes who gave what president lincoln called the last full measure of devotion he did not only die at gettysburg or in flanders field or on the beaches of normandy but in the mountains of afghanistan and the desserts of iraq in the last twenty years section sixty when i walk through it reminds me of the cost of war 100s of graves 100s of graves are here from recent conflicts 100s of patriots gave their all each each of them leaving behind a family to live with their pain and their absence every single day i want to assure each of those families we will never forget what you gave to our country we will never fail to honor your sacrifice each day starting when i was vice president of the united states i carry in my pocket a number of troops killed during the wars in afghanistan and iraq not an approximation not rounded off numbers they each leave behind an entire community of family and today that number is 70367036 fallen angels who have lost their lives in these conflicts and on this memorial day we honor their legacy and the sacrifice duty honor country they live for it they died for it and we as a nation are eternally grateful you know america has been foraged in the bezel and the fires of war our freedom and the freedom of a numerable others has been secured by young men and women who answered the call of history and gave everything in the service of an idea the idea of america it is the greatest idea in a long history of humankind an idea that we are all created equal and the image of our mighty god that we are all entitled a dignity as my father would say and respect decency and honor love of neighbor they are not empty words but the vital beating heart of our nation and that democracy must be protected at all costs for democracy makes all this possible democracy that is the soul of america and i believe that it is a soul worth fighting for and so do you a soul worth dying for heroes who lie in eternal peace in this beautiful place this sacred place they believe that too the soul of america is animated by the perennial battle between our worst instincts which we have seen of late and our better angels between me 1st and we the people between greed and generosity cruelty and kindness captivity and freedom the americans of lexington and concord of new orleans gettysburg the argonne iwo jima and normandy korea and vietnam afghanistan and iraq and 1000s of places in between these americans were not fighting for dictators they are fighting for democracy they were not fighting to exclude or to enslave they are fighting to build and broaden and liberate they were not fighting for self they were fighting for the soul of the nation for liberty and simple fair play simple fair play and decency today as we remember their sacrifice remind ourselves of our duty to their memory to the future they fought for we owe the honored dead a debt we can never fully repay we owe them our whole souls we owe them our full best efforts to perfect the union for which they died we owe them the work of our hands and our hearts to make real the promise of a nation founded on a proposition all of us all of us all of us are created equal and are supposed to be treated that way throughout our lives democracy is more than a form of government it is a way of being it is a way of seeing the world democracy means the rule of the people the rule of the people not the rule of monarchs not the rule of the moneyed not the rule of the mighty literally the rule of the people the lives of 1000000000s from antiquity to our own hour have been shaped by the battle between aspirations of the many and the greed of the few between people is right to self determination and the self seeking of a dictator between dreams of democracy and appetites for autocracy which we are seen around the world our troops have fought this battle on fields around the world but also the battle of our time and the mission falls to each of us each and every day democracy itself is in peril here at home and around the world what we do now what we do now how we honor the memory of the fallen will determine whether or not democracy will long endure we all take it for granted we think we learn at school you have to every generation has to fight for it but look it is the biggest question whether a system the prize is the individual that bends toward liberty that gives everybody a chance of prosperity whether that system can and will prevail against powerful forces that wish it harm all that we do in our common life as a nation is part of that struggle a struggle for democracy is taking place around the world democracy and autocracy struggle for decency and dignity just simple decency a struggle for prosterity prosperity and progress and yes a struggle for the soul of america itself folks you all know it democracy thrives when the infrastructure of democracy is strong when people have the right to vote freely and fairly and conveniently when a free and independent press pursues the truth founded on facts not propaganda when the rule of law applies equally and fairly to every citizen regardless of where they come from what they look like excuse me wherever americans are there there is democracy churches and synagogues and mosques neighborhoods and coffee shops and diners bleachers at kids baseball or soccer games libraries and parks democracy begins and grows in the open heart and the impetus to come together for a common cause and i might note parenthetically thank you taps that is what you do and that is where we will be preserved for empathy is the fuel of democracy let me say that again empathy empathy is the fuel of democracy our willingness to see each other not as enemies as neighbors even if we disagree to understand what the other is going through to state the obvious our democracy is imperfect it always has been but america is of all backgrounds races creeds genders identities sexual orientations have long spilled their blood to defend our democracy the diversity of our country and our armed and of our armed services is and always has been an incredible strength and generation after generation of american heroes have signed up to be part of the fight because they understand the truth that lives in every american heart that liberation opportunity justice are far more likely to come to pass in a democracy than an autocracy if every person is sacred and every person is rights are sacred individual dignity individual worth individual sanctity the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness we say those words so often but think of it the right the vote the right to rise in a world as far as your talent can take you unlimited by unfair barriers a privilege in power such are the principles of democracy so how do we put these noble principles into practice how do we do that how do we make the idea real or as close to real as we can make it this nation is built on an idea the only nation in the world built on an idea every other nation is built on ethnicity geography religion et cetera we were built on an idea the idea of liberty an opportunity for all we have never fully realized that aspiration of our founding but every generation has opened the door a little wider and every generation has opened it wider and wider to be more inclusive include those that have been excluded before it is a mission handed down generation to generation the work of perfecting our union in 1830 when we were a young nation this union has put their sectional interest ahead of the common good a great senator daniel webster rose in the capitol to defend the union to him we are not just a collection of competing forces but a coherent whole his cry 1st uttered just across the potomac in the capitol resonates even now he stood on the floor and he said liberty in union now and forever one and inseparable liberty and union more than a 142 years later when i 1st came to the united states senate at a time where our country was so deeply divided over vietnam a struggle of civil rights the fight of our women is rights i had the notion of my 1st task as i stood to make my 1st speech on the floor of the senate it all of a sudden hit me i am standing where daniel webster had stood his desk was next to mine now i was struck by the weight of history as corny as it sounds by the legacy the work we are charged to carry forward liberty and union now and forever now as then unity is essential to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and so remember those who gave their all in the cause of unity in the cause of a nation that endures because of them we must honor their sacrifice by sustaining the best of america while honestly confronting all that we must do to make our nation a fuller freer and more just we must remember that we may find the light and the wisdom and yes the courage to move forward in the words of that great hymn fight as they nobly fought of old when remembrance lies not just our history but our hope not just our solemn remembrance but our renewed purpose not just our solace but our strength this memorial day remember that not all of us are called to make the ultimate sacrifice we all are called by god and by history and by conscience to make our nation free and fair just and strong noble and whole to this battle may we now dedicate our souls that our work may prove worthy of the blood of our fallen for this work the work of democracy is the work of our time and for all time and if we do our duty then ages still to come will look back on us and say that we too kept the faith if there is nothing more important nothing more sacred nothing more american than keeping the faith and god bless the united states of america and may the light perpetually shine upon the fallen may god bring comfort to their families and may god protect our troops today and always god bless you all",
            "prediction": "we gathered at this sacred place in this solemn hour engage in the most fundamental of undertakings the right of remembrance remember those who gave their all in the service of america in the service of freedom in the service of justice remember their sacrifice their valor and their grace remember their smile else their love their laughter their essential vibrant and transcendent humanity for while we stand amid monuments of stone must never forget that each of these markers for those known and unknown here at arlington and far beyond represent a precious life a son a daughter a mother a spouse brother sister a friend a neighbor to those who mourn a loved one today jill and i have some idea how youre feeling our losses are not the same but that black hole you feel in your chest as if its going to suck you into it we get i know the incredible pride you felt senior loved one wear the uniform of our country and the pride they felt wearing it our son boes service in the delaware national guard unit the year he spent deployed in iraq was one of the things he was most proud of in life yesterday marked the anniversary of his death and its a hard time hard time of year for me and our family just like it is for so many of you it can hurt to remember but the hurt is how we feel and how we heal i always feel close to me i am a memorial day i know exactly where i need to be right here honoring our fallen heroes because through pain and anguish of his loss i remember the pride on his face that pinned those bars on his shoulders all of you are fighting with the fresh pain of loss as hard as it is to believe i promise you this the day will come with the image of your loved one bring a smile their lips before it brings a tear to your eyes the bible teaches blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted that comfort that reassurance can be a long time in coming but it will come i promise you and my prayer for all of you is that that that day will come sooner rather than later well no memorial day origins lie in the wake of the civil war a war for the freedom of all a war for union a war for liberty and for the preservation of the constitution and calling for such today general john logan commander of the grand army of the republic issued general order number eleven he directed the nation set aside a day to honor and i quote those who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion and whose bodies now lie in almost every city village and hamlet churchyard throughout the land and so we have and so we do again today in our time where the children of sacrifice made by a long line of american service members each a link in that chain of honor we live by the light of the flame of liberty they kept burning were free because they were brave here on these gentle rolling green hills and across america and around the globe lie buried the heroes of the greatest experiment the world has ever known ever seen the experiment bears the noble name the united states of america women and men all those we honor today gave their lives for their country but they live forever in our hearts forever proud forever honorable forever american they are they are the sentinels of liberty defenders of the downtrodden liberators of nations and still today americans stand watch around the world often at great personal peril war and conflict death and loss are not relics of our american history they are part of american story here in arlington lie heroes who gave a president lincoln called the last full measure of devotion they did not only die at gettysburg or in flanders field or in the beaches of normandy but in the mountains of afghanistan the deserts of iraq in the last twenty years section sixty when i walk through it reminds me the cost of war 100s of graves 100s of graves are here from recent conflicts 100s of patriots gave their all each each of them leaving behind a family who live with their pain and their absence every single day i want to assure each of those families we will never forget what you gave to our country we will never fail to honor your sacrifice each day starting one i was vice president of the united states i carry in my pocket a number of troops killed during the wars in afghanistan and iraq not an approximation not rounded off numbers they each leave behind entire community family today that number is 70367036 fallen angels lost their lives in these conflicts and this memorial day we honor their legacy and their sacrifice duty honor country they lived for it they died for it and we as a nation are eternally grateful you know america has been forged in the battle in the fires of war our freedom and the freedom of an innumerable others has been secured by young men and women who answered the call of history and gave everything in the service of an idea the idea of america is the greatest idea in the long history of humankind an idea that we are all created equal in the image of almighty god that we are all entitled to dignity as my father would say and respect decency and honor love of neighbor they are not empty words words but the vital beating heart of our nation and that democracy must be defended at all cost for democracy makes all this possible democracy thats the soul of america and i believe its a soul worth fighting for and so do you a soul worth dying for heroes who lie in eternal peace in this beautiful place this sacred place they believe that to the soul of america is animated by the perennial battle between our worst instincts which weve seen of late and our better angels between me 1st and we the people between greed and generosity cruelty and kindness captivity and freedom the americans of lexington and concord of new orleans gettysburg the argonne evacuation normandy korea vietnam afghanistan iraq and 1000s of places in between these americans were fighting for dictators they are fighting for democracy they werent fighting to exclude or to enslave they are fighting to build and broaden and liberate they were fighting for self they were fighting for the soul of the nation for liberty and simple fair play simple fair play and decency today as remember their sacrifice remind ourselves of our duty to their memory to the future they fought for we owe the honored dead a debt we can never fully repay we owe them our whole souls we owe them our full best efforts to perfect the union for which they died we owe them the work of our hands and our hearts to make real the promise of a nation founded on the proposition that all of us all of us all of us are created equal and deserve to be treated that way throughout our lives democracy is more than a form of government its way of being its way of seeing

            "reference": "you are saying that this director refuse to would not shoot with you because you would not sit in his lap unbelievable do you think that it is gotten better for women in hollywood well 1st of all jim i do not think that the me too thing is about hollywood i think that the me too thing is a global issue i do not think it begins or ends in hollywood i think it is something that begins in the home in rich homes and poor homes i think it is a situation or something that we need to handle across the world i think it got a lot of attention because i think that women who had powerful voices in hollywood were willing to risk their careers to end it and i am really proud of the women who agreed to do that but i think that this is something that needs to be dealt with as i have said on other shows i think just like we have lice checks in kindergarten and elementary school and on the way up through middle school high school and college we should have sexual abuse checks so the children have someone to talk to and can be heard in a helpful and helpful way we have to look at the way that rape victims are treated we look from state to state and just when they go to the hospital they end up even with insurance paying at least $400 for their own check they stay overnight their bills are somewhere around a $1000 if they have to pay to get their own rape kit processed that is another $1000 because so often rape kits are not even processed so we are looking at what are the rights of people me too was more much more than a hollywood story it is a story about women being respected and not just women there are so many men that have been abused as well so i think it is a much bigger story then a hollywood story it is a global story very true and it is a story about respecting mostly children who are being abused in homes and then these people who are being molested and i think that we need to really look at this as a concerned global issue and how do we address it far differently then we have been another story that people might not know about sharon you write about this in your book is that you suffered a stroke in 2001 i was reading the beginning of your book and just i mean i i did not realize how close you came to losing your life we can put this excerpt up on the screen it says i came to as i was being wheeled down the hall by a young male orderly i asked where he was taking me to the operating theater he said and you asked for what and he said for exploratory brain surgery and you said but no one talked to me about it and he goes zero yeah the papers were signed you are all good this sounds frightening it was terrifying i had a massive brain hemorrhage i hemorrhaged into my brain for nine days and had a stroke and this was over twenty years ago and so you know women is rights and certainly medical rights are improving but not until this very century had medicine ever been considered or treated on the female anatomy and it is just the beginning of that happening and so women have been often just treated as hysterics and not really been spoken to about what actually was happening to them and their bodies and certainly when this happened to me i was not cared for as a thoughtful individual and so i bled into my brain for nine days before i was given an angiogram and an angiogram was brand new at that time and i had a one chance of survival when this happened to me wow the odds are better now they are ten to fifteen because this artery is what ruptured in the back of my neck but now they can transfer arteries out of your calf or out of they can use pig arteries now but it is still a very very dangerous thing that happens and in my case it was it was made much much worse by the fact that i did not get care right at the beginning wow and your family has been through a lot during this pandemic your grandmother godmother both died of covid at one point your sister was fighting for her life to look back at that and my brother in law and your brother in law to look it back look back at that and compare it to where we are now with coronavirus cases dropping across the country people getting vaccinated including yourself you know i have read about there is some video right there of sharon stone getting vaccinated if sharon stone can get vaccinated everybody should get vaccinated 1st of all but i was reading about how you really look up to the scientists and the medical professionals on the front lines of this pandemic well yes and a lot of that is because i have been an infectious disease worker for thirty years i worked for what was when i began the american foundation for aids research which became the global foundation for aids research during my stint with them and we did lots and lots and lots of fundraising to give to scientists so that they could develop the life saving drugs that you now see on the market today and i i do not want to let you go without asking you your favorite film that you worked on over the course of your career so many unforgettable roles we mentioned basic instinct obviously earlier but casino i think for a lot of people is the role that i think you know just encapsulates you know just the amazing career that you have had but i am i am a little preferential to total recall i have to say i i hope you do not think poorly of me for saying that there you are in total recall you really liked it when i kicked arnold in the head i really did not many people can get away with that you are also i do not know how you know perhaps you want to delve into this perhaps not why you are so good at playing the bad guy sometimes i actually think that people that are the best guys are very good at playing the bad guys i kind of thought that from michael douglas he is a big hero of mine and he is always done so much good in the world and i admired him tremendously and had such a great opportunity working with him in basic instinct and he told me you know with those sparkly eyes and that great smile you know the villain is the best part because you can do anything you want and it really is true the villain is a very fun part to play and as we know michael has done such great work when it comes to nuclear awareness or when it comes to aging or mental illness or anything he takes those parts and he brings the awareness to all of those things that we need to understand and he is such a good guy and he always plays such a great bad guy and i think yea he is great it is because he is so smart and because he cares about so many good things that he has the understanding of how to use playing the bad guy to take our attention to things that really need to be looked at absolutely and you have done that as well in your work throughout your career as well well i think that basic instinct brought our attention to the aids crisis and i think that that was very important in its time",

            "reference": "now let us take a look to how the country views the president at this very big moment and let us walk through some of the numbers including our brand new cnn poll 53 of americans approve of the president is job performance as he approaches the 100 day mark and this big speech tonight this is much better about ten points better then president trump was at this point of his presidency down from if you go back to obama days the george w bush days but we live in partisan polarized times 53 approve 43 disapprove let us look at how people look at this through their partisan lens democrats love president biden 93 approve republicans not so much 91 disapprove when you look at this this is a key piece right now the president has the middle of america if you will 51 approval among independents 43 say they disapprove watch this number over the next 100 days to see if the president can hold the middle of the american electorate which right now is giving him at least the benefit of the doubt let us walk through some of the issues these are important on the coronavirus fight to be at 66 approval means that number of republicans a decent number of republicans say president biden so far doing the job good job with the coronavirus 66 approve 31 disapprove also above water on racial injustice a big issue in the news including today 54 of americans approve 39 disapprove and again this is very important 51 approve of president biden handling of the economy so far 42 disapprove where does that number go as we get closer and closer to the midterm elections remember that underwater areas of concern for the president tonight on two issues he will talk about immigration and gun policy there majorities of americans are skeptical they disapprove of the president is handling so far so watch that where is the president standing the best among communities of color among moderates among college graduates and among women that is where joe biden is strongest president biden strongest political support comes from those groups where is he weak non college degree men whites and conservative this what you would think largely that trump coalition joe biden still has a lot of work to do if he can to win them over there what about campaign promises so far the american people think whether they agree or disagree that this president nearly six in ten americans say he is doing a good job of keeping his campaign promises that is a much higher rating by eleven points than president trump at this point not quite up to where ten points below nine points below where president obama was back at this point but by and large six in ten americans say this president is keeping his campaign promises so far let us bring in our conversation right now to share their expertise and their insights celinda lake she is a democratic pollster president of lake research partners and republican pollster neil newhouse among the co founders of public opinion strategies celinda i want to start with you and i want to go back to this number here when you look at the partisan breakdown this is the world we live in right the old joe biden is not going to have an approval rating like george w bush like barack obama because we live in polarized times you focus here on the middle of the electorate why is it so important and how strong is this 51 support approval among independents very strong and even stronger remember among covid where it is almost sixty among independents on covid we also have republic independents for the 1st time positive on the economy and they are the ones most worried about the economy that could be game changing if the president can hold his approval on the economy and keep the democrats ahead of the republicans on the economy that can change politics for the next two years and the next ten years so neil jump into the conversation will you look at this number 91 of republicans disapprove so that is where we are and i expect that is where we will be and when we got into the midterm election year one of the president is challenges tonight is to try to convince americans who are vaccine hesitant and when you look at a map and i will do it later in the program a lot of them live in rural trump america will they ever listen to joe biden when you see this 91 and how intense is this is there any chance he can win them over john 1st of all thanks for having me on you cannot overstate the partisan divide in the country just seven of republicans approve of biden the the same number of democrats approved of trump in 2017 this is this is not a country this is these are not two parties that are really open to reaching across partisan lines the president is can have a very difficult time convincing rural america convincing conservative convincing republicans to to take the vaccine meaning if if fauci can not do it biden sure as heck not going to do it but what this is is i think these presidential numbers are positive for for trump but they are extraordinarily soft he is making a transition from being not donald trump to being joe biden and as he makes that transition i think there are some soft spots that he is going to have to worry about in in the coming months celinda i want to bring out you know another question about that because the president is talking not only trying to woe over win over some republicans and more independents tonight he is also talking to democrats he is just formality at the top of the hour presidents have to make choices this president rebuffing liberals who wanted him to expand the medicare pro program essentially instead the presidents said let us fortify obama care let us not create a single payer system he is also rebuffing progressives and saying let us not right now get the government to negotiating drug prices something the pharmaceutical industry opposes pushing back against progressives at a time james carville the veteran democratic strategist is trying to tell democrats what he says wokeness is a problem i want to ask you if you agree with this we won the white house against a world historical buffoon james told vox and we came within 42000 votes of losing we lost congressional seats we did not pick up state legislatures so let us not have an argument about whether or not we are off key in our messaging president biden in one way one way he benefits right now celinda is that he is not viewed as ideological so he is viewed as kind of the man in the middle is james carville right though are democrats at risk of wondering too far left no democrats are not at risk of going too far left and in fact right now you have a record number of people democrats and independents who want to see a role for government and president who wants to show that government can deliver checks and shots and help small businesses and be a partner and improving america and getting us back on our feet one of the things that is really part of the solid base for the president and i disagree with neil a little bit here i think the platform is quite strong and it is based on a lot of personal characteristics too a solid majority of voters including independents see him as honest caring uniting the country working effectively and keeping his promises that is quite a platform to run from so i think that this platform is quite strong the thing about the media wants to have divisions between the democrats but 93 of democrats are in agreement and they are wondering who the other seven are and this agenda has a lot for everyone in it and is making huge progress on a lot of fronts so democrats are completely united and that is where democrats will stay and so neil i want to bring up one last yea john come on in come on in come on in yea no come on in yea there is there is no question i think americans view joe biden as being liberal and even though you you you can cite a couple of cases where you have not embraced the conservatives the issue down the road is going to be spending his achilles heel right now is china immigration and guns like your poll shows but i am not sure american pocket books are really deep enough to afford all the spending that biden is proposing he may win the legislative battle on spending but he is i think he is bound to lose in 2022 the political battle on spending because that is going to be the issue well the issue right now he is going to sell this cause he is raising taxes on the wealthy and raising that on the rich i covered bill clinton back in the days he did that successfully politically the challenge is can biden sell it just right let me ask both to close on this point here if you look right now you have got a 54 think the economic conditions are good today this is the metric as we go from now into the 2nd 100 days can biden sell his agenda and neil you are right it is a lot of government and it is a lot of spending he has to sell the american people trust him to do this and trust him to raise taxes on the right people if you will that will be his argument out there but this is the north star if the economy continues to improve is that not the beacon for this president into the midterm election cycle or is there something else neil to you 1st yea but but john your own your own data shows people think the economy is going well now but when you ask in a year from now how they think the economy is indeed going those numbers are ten points lower so they are you know the jury is still out on this thing and people are still considering about the economy down the road celinda you get the last word i think that the economy and creating jobs is the single most important thing the president can do and that is what he is doing and he is making sure that there are jobs that work for families and that make for strong families thriving families and that is really important it is a broader dialog that we have ever had people do not care how much we are spending people care about who is paying for it and people recognize and really respond to the language that says hey the wealthiest americans and the major corporations are not paying their fair share when we have a pandemic and zoom and netflix and amazon do not pay taxes something is wrong these are the most profitable corporations in our country and joe biden is going to right that wrong and make sure that we have investments that will benefit everyone including the wealthiest and the big corporations well you are cheering up the conversations for tonight and then the conversations for the next year and a half of our politics we will bring you back and walk through it as we go celinda lake grateful neil newhouse to you as well it is the 30th anniversary month of neil is firm public opinion strategies happy birthday neil have a little cake we will send it your way",
            "prediction": "now lets take a look at how the country views the president at this very big moment lets walk through some of the numbers including our brand new cnn poll 53 of americans approve of the presidents job performance as he approaches the 100 day mark and this big speech tonight this is much better about ten points better than president trump was at this point of his presidency down from if you go back to obama days the george w bush days but we live in partisan polarized times 53 approve 43 disapprove lets look at how people look at this through their 93 approve republicans not so much 91 disapprove when you look at this this is a key piece right now the president has the middle of america if you will 51 approval among independents 43 say they disapprove watch this number over the next 100 days to see if the president can hold the middle of the american electorate which right now is giving him at least the benefit of the doubt lets walk through some of the issues these are important on the coronavirus fight to be at 66 approval means a number of republicans a decent doing a good job with the coronavirus 66 approve 31 disapprove also above water on racial injustice a big issue in the news including today 54 of americans approve 39 disapprove and again this is very important 51 approve of president bidens handling of the economy so far 42 disapprove where does that number go as we get closer and closer to the midterm elections remember that underwater areas of concern for the president tonight on two issues he will talk about immigration and gun policy there are majorities of americans are skeptical they disapprove of the presidents handling so far so watch that where is the president standing the best among communities of color among moderates among college graduates and among women that is where joe biden is strongest president biden strongest political support comes from those groups where is he weak noncollege degree men whites and conservative this what you would think largely the trump coalition joe biden still has a lot of work to do if he can to win them over there what about campaign promises so far the american people think whether they agree or disagree this president nearly six in ten americans say hes doing a good job of keeping his campaign promises thats a much higher rating by eleven points than president trump at this point not quite up to where ten points below nine points below where president obama was back at this point but by and large six in ten americans say this president is keeping his campaign promises so far lets bring in our conversation right now to share their expertise and their insights cynthia lake shes a democratic pollster president of lake research partners and republican pollster neil newhouse among the founders of public opinion strategies so i want to start with you and i want to go back to this number here when you look at the partisan breakdown this is the world we live in right you know joe biden is not going to have an approval rating like george w bush like barack obama because we live in polarized times you focus here on the middle of the electorate why is it so important and how strong is this 51 support approval among independents very strong and even stronger remember among covid where its almost sixty among independents on covid we also have republican independents for the 1st time positive on the economy and they are the ones most worried about the economy that could be game changing if the president can hold his approval on the economy and keep the democrats ahead of the republicans on the economy that can change politics for the next two years and the next ten years so neil jump into the conversation where you look at this number 91 of republicans disapprove so thats where we are and i expect thats where will be when we get into the midterm election year one of the presidents challenges tonight is to try to convince americans who are vaccine hesitant and when you look at a map and ill do it later in the program a lot of them live in rural trump america will they ever listen to joe biden when you see this 91 and how intense is this is there any chance he can win them john 1st of all thanks for having me on you cannot overstate the partisan divide in the country just seven republicans approve of biden the same number of democrats approved of trump in 2017 this is this is not a country this is these are not two parties that are really open to reaching across partisan lines the president is going to have a very difficult time convincing rural america convincing conservatives convincing republicans to to take the vaccine i mean if if fauci cant do it biden is sure as hell not going to do it but what this is is i think these presidential numbers are positive for for trump but theyre extraordinarily soft hes making a transition from being not donald trump to being joe biden and as he makes that transition i think there are some soft spots that hes going to have to worry about in the coming months sulland i want to bring in another question about that because the presidents talking not only trying to woo over win over some republicans or more independents tonight hes also talking to democrats you just heard phil mattingly at the top of the hour presidents have to make choices this president rebuffing liberals who wanted him to expand the medicare program essentially instead the president says lets fortify obamacare lets not create a single payer system hes also rebuffing

            "reference": "so in response to georgia is new law that makes it harder for people to call it to vote major league baseball moving the season is all star game out of atlanta the commissioner explaining the decision in a statement saying major league baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all americans and opposes restriction at the ballot box the atlanta braves who were going to be hosting the game saying that they are quote deeply disappointed adding that they had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion so let us have a discussion now hall of fame broadcaster bob costas is here sitting contributer bob i love having these conversations with you you always give us such nuance and such great information here and so and such a great perspective this is really a huge decision from major league baseball because at the same time that we are learning tonight the pga tour is planning to keep the tour championship in georgia give me your next initial reaction to to all of these well there is so many aspect to it one that strikes me is that until relatively recently baseball was not as apt as a sport to weigh in on social issues as perhaps the nba the wnba the nfl but that all changed i mean last year was obviously a time of reckoning and it continues there is a players alliance now in baseball made up primarily of players of color primarily african american players but also widely supported by white players around major league baseball so there is still some people are going to say stick to sports stick to sports but as we have discussed before don there is a long history of athletes using their platform to register their point of view and to be in many cases effective and in some cases even profound the questions going to be going forward on a case by case basis is this always the right sort of approach there maybe some people who are in agreement overall have some differences with some aspect or differences with the approach stacy abrams has said she has mixed feelings about it you can understand how the atlanta braves feel about it there are people who feel that this is taking some economic opportunity away from those who would benefit from having a big event like an all star game and some of those people are relatively lower on the economic ladders so i understand those objections but the larger point that is being made here is that as daniel dale pointed out about an hour ago with you yeah you can claim as governor kemp did that there are certain provisions within this bill that will enhance access to voting but in the overall on balance it actually restricts voting and it is clear that it will most negatively impact people of color and people at the lower end of the economic scale and so this is what baseball has decided to do now this is also different when you talk about the pga tour you talk about the masters next week the masters is only at one place at one time baseball can move it is all star game and it will to some place else so these players are still going to be play in the all star game you know it is interesting that you brought up what daniel dale said because you know i have been i have been reading a lot about what is happening with the voter laws in georgia and i think the main thing that people have to remember right there is a lot of misinformation going around and half truths and we know that that happens is that that the main thing people should remember is that the initial the the impetus to this it was a lie about the election that it started from now it may enhance 1000s in some places it may take certain things away but it was built initially on a lie and we must keep that in mind so we have to start from the truth with this can i let me ask you about the mayor of atlanta keisha lance bottoms also martin luther king the 3rd dodger is own magic johnson lebron james as well had they had ownership lebron james ownership stay ga in the boston red socks they are all tweeting that they support the move what do you say to people who think that this is cancel culture or baseball being too you know quote woke i know there is a catchphrases and i hate little catchphrases but you know what i am saying there are there are catchphrases and they are sort of an intellectual get out of jail free card governor kemp who deserves some credit for standing up to president trump is lies in a 4th right way after the election nonetheless invoke this bogus thing about cancel culture and woke culture i am not saying that those are not legitimate complaints in fact there is something very illiberal about woke culture cancel culture is real and people of common sense and compassion across the political spectrum should speak out against it because it very often makes no sense at all and it is not proportionate and very often hurts innocent people ok fine but what does this have to do with being woke or cancel culture it is just a buzzword that appeals to certain people on the political spectrum and it is used in this case to try and dismiss the legitimate grievances that led major league baseball to remove the game from atlanta very well put so bob listen athletes and athletes and activism always gone hand in hand we know that baseball in particular you think the greats like jackie robinson roberto clemente hank aaron sadly who just you know passed not long ago the mlb is planning to celebrate aaron is life and career during the all star weekend by the way this is there is plenty of precedents for athletes and even leagues to take a stand this is not something that is new i think what is what is new here is maybe professional athletes are feeling more empowered yea they are feeling more empowered social media has something to do with it people are more inclined to express their their point of view yea there is as you said a very long history a noble history in many cases of athletes using their voice and this is one example i have said earlier don i think going forward it has to be on a case by case basis this seems to make sense to me it is a shame that they can not honor hank aaron on the year of his death in the year in the the city in which he broke babe ruth is record and where his legacy resides that is a shame but baseball will still will still honor him wherever the ball game the all star game winds up being played but i am just saying this going forward every particular gripe is not necessarily best addressed by boycott and there we have to recognize that people of good faith let us say within a baseball clubhouse teammates people who have had great feeling for one another they do not all necessarily see every issue exactly the same way so i think as i am saying i guess i am repeating myself here it is a case by case basis but i think there is a very good case to be made for what baseball has decided to do here plus there is this there was corporate pressure there were going to be corporations and possible sponsors that were going to object to this and there were players who have already said we will not play in the game if it remains in atlanta and dave roberts who was the manager of the national league team because the dodgers won the world series dave roberts has said he was not sure about whether or not he would manage the game in atlanta so there were multiple dynamics that came into play here and led to the decision i think you are right case by case basis case by case basis not everything falls under one big thing not everything is

            "reference": "we have breaking news right now the trump administrations are aggressive and very disturbing efforts to target american journalists as the former president was railing against leaks cnn justice correspondent jessica schneider is joining us she has details jessica a cnn correspondent was targeted tell our viewers what you are learning yea so well we are learning tonight wolf that the trump administration secretly sought and obtained phone and email records of our pentagon correspondent barbara starr now starr was notified by letter a week ago that the department of justice under former attorney general bill barr obtained her records covering a two month time period june and july 2017 doj got a hold of the records last year and those records included calls made too and from barbara starr is home cell and office phones the government also got a hold of non content information from her email that means details about who got emails and the time and the dates sent not the email content itself so the letter did not say why barbara starr is communications were sought but over the time frame listed in the letter june and july 2017 she reported on us military options for north korea that were being prepared for president trump as well as stories including on syria and afghanistan and this is significant because this is the 2nd time in just a few weeks that reporters whose records were obtained secretly and unbeknownst to them the 2nd time that they have been notified that the trump justice department got a hold of their records now the current justice department is responding to all of this now making clear that these records were in fact obtained under the trump administration last year now the president of our network jeff zucker is responding and has issued this statement saying cnn strongly condemns the secret collection of any aspect of a journalist is correspondence which is clearly protected by the 1st amendment we are asking for an immediate meeting with the justice department for an explanation wolf and jessica this happened last year but we are only finding out about it now right that is exactly right barbara starr was notified about a week ago and it is important to realize that all of this was done in secret attorney general bill barr had to approve of pursuing these records and then the case had to be made in court that the reporter barbara starr in this case could not be notified because it would jeopardize international security or the investigation itself you know these were likely or possibly leaked investigations that doj was pursuing and the court proceedings are typically under ceiling cases like this it is still unknown what evidence doj presented to secretly get this trove of records two months worth of phone and email records for barbara starr now she was informed via a letter from the justice department on may 13th and as for the former attorney general bill barr i have reached out to him for comment but we have not heard back yet wolf do we know jessica the reason for the investigation yes so right now the doj is not commenting if this was a leaked investigation pertaining to those stories that barbara starr worked on they are not commenting about whether this investigation is still ongoing but a justice official does tell me and makes clear barbara starr was not the target of this probe but what is especially troubling here is that this is the 2nd recent revelation about record searches of reporters at news organizations that former president trump frequently railed against cnn and the washington post it was reported that you know three washington post reporters who covered the fbi is rush investigation were told earlier this month that last year the justice department obtained their phone records from 2017 now i should add that when i sought information from the current department of justice about this a spokesman was very clear saying that attorney general merrick garland he is committed to press freedom and attorney general garland plans to meet with reporters to hear their concerns about these recent revelations well these revelations are so so disturbing alright jessica schneider thank you very much let us bring our cnn legal analyst former federal prosecutor elie honig elie the elie the lengths the trump administration went through to target american journalists it is so disturbing it is frankly reprehensible what is your reaction as someone who used to work at the justice department yea wolf anybody who has the privilege of representing the united states as a federal prosecutor for the justice department is given enormous power and enormous discretion it is really staggering how much power prosecutors have and it really falls to the integrity and the good judgment and sense of fair play of each individual in this case wolf unless there was an imminent and grave threat and there is zero to indicate that then this was a monumental abuse of power and had to go to the top of the justice department because under justice department regulations this would have to be approved by the attorney general this this was not just her phone number at the pentagon elie this was her home phone her cell phones her personal email accounts the scope of this intrusion is really staggering is not it it is wolf it it it is an incredibly invasive procedure and doj regulations recognized because the 1st amendment is at stake here the 1st amendment of course is the cornerstone the heart of our democracy and when the justice system obtains this information through subpoena an almost entirely one sided process that sheds a real pour over the 1st amendment that is a real threat to the 1st amendment because it will frighten people it will deter them from talking to journalists because if they believe well if i speak to this journalist barbara starr or anybody else doj may pull those records and see that i am talking to her and so that is the danger really at issue here wolf the former president trump he as all of us remember during those four years he almost always viciously attacked the news media through his campaign through his presidency how chilling is it to see that the justice department followed suit and targeted american journalists like this yea wolf one of the most devastating legacies of the trump administration is that he continually villianfied and attacked the media how many times did he lash out over twitter or elsewhere about the fake news or worse than that and it is really disturbing to see that the justice department as it did all too often under donald trump not only went along with it but facilitated it and promoted it and we know from jessica is reporting that this application to subpoena the information relating to barbara starr the approval was given in 2020 so unless it happened in the very last week of december it would have been bill barr who approved it and again that is all to characteristic of the way bill barr enabled donald trump is absolute worst instincts yea trump used to say almost all the time are the news media were the enemy of the american people it is it is just a latest example just in the last two weeks we learned that the trump justice department secretly obtained phone records of several washington post reporters not just barbara starr our pentagon correspondent who is distinguished highly regarded been there for many years how persuasive was this all of this potential in pervasive was this yea look yea well that is the big question how pervasive was this how far did it go how wide did it go there could well be more because the way these orders work and the way it worked with respect to barbara starr is doj has the ability to go to a court and say we want to get this information but we do not want to notify the journalists or the media organization and that puts the journalist and the media organization in an especially difficult position because we cnn or barbara star does not even have the ability to go to court and say judge we want to fight this it is a one sided fight and i believe that this information we have already seen it start to trickle out i think more and more of it will come out i think there is a real impetus here for the new attorney general merrick garland to expose whatever was done to reveal whatever was done and to fix it yea we got to learn exactly what happened in order to make sure it does not happen again we have something called freedom of the press here in the united states and that has to be cherished it has to be honored elie thank you very very much elie honig",
            "prediction": "breaking news right now the trump administrations aggressive and very disturbing efforts to target american journalists as the former president was railing against leaks cnn justice correspondent jessica schneider is joining us she has details jessica a cnn correspondent was targeted tell our viewers what youre learning yeah so were learning tonight wolf that the trump administration secretly sought and obtained phone and email records of our pentagon correspondent barbara starr now starr was notified by letter a week ago that the department of justice under former attorney general bill barr obtained her records covering a two month time period june and july 2017 d zero j got a hold of the records last year and those records included calls made to and from barbara stars home cell and office phones the government also got a hold of noncontent information from her email that means details about who got emails and the time and the date sent not the email content itself so the letter did not say why barbara stars communications were sought but over the time frame listed in the letter june and july 2017 she reported on u s military options for north korea that were being prepared for president trump as well as stories including on syria and afghanistan and this is significant because this is the 2nd time in just a few weeks that reporters whose records were obtained secretly and unbeknownst to them the 2nd time that theyve been notified that the trump justice department got a hold of their records now the current justice department is responding to all of this now making clear that these records were in fact obtained under the trump administration last year now the president of our network jeff zucker is responding and has issued this statement saying cnn strongly condemns the secret collection of any aspect of a journalists correspondence which is clearly protected by the 1st amendment we are asking for an immediate meeting with the justice department for an explanation and jessica this happened last year but were only finding out about it now thats exactly right barbara starr was notified about a week ago and its important to realize that all of this was done in secret attorney general bill barr had to approve of pursuing these records and then the case had to be made in court that the reporter barbara starr in this case could not be notified because it would jeopardize either national security or the investigation itself you know these were likely or possibly leak investigations that doj was pursuing and the court proceedings are typically under seal in cases like this its still unknown what evidence doj presented to secretly get this trove of records two months worth of phone and email records for barbara star now she was informed via a letter from the justice department on may 13th and as for the former attorney general bill barr i have reached out to him for comment but we have not heard back yet wolf do we know jessica the reason for the investigation yeah so right now the doj is not commenting if this was a leak investigation pertaining to those stories that barbara starr worked on theyre not commenting about whether this investigation is still ongoing but a justice official does tell me and makes clear barbara starr was not the target of this probe but whats especially troubling here is that this is the 2nd recent revelation about record searches of reporters at news organizations that former president trump frequently railed against cnn and the washington post it was reported that you know three washington post reporters who covered the f b i s russia investigation were told earlier this month that last year the justice department obtained their phone records from 2017 now i should add that when i sought information from the current department of justice about this a spokesman was very clear saying that attorney general merrick garland he is committed to press freedom and attorney general garland plans to meet with reporters to hear their concerns about these recent revelations well these revelations are so so disturbing jessica schneider thank you very much child lets bring a cnn legal analyst former federal prosecutor elie honig elie the lengths the trump administration went to to target american journalists its so disturbing its frankly reprehensible whats your reaction as someone who used to work at the justice department yeah wolf anybody who has the privilege of representing the united states as a federal prosecutor for the justice department is given enormous power and enormous discretion its really staggering how much power prosecutors have and it really falls to the integrity and the good judgment and sense of fair play of each individual in this case wolf unless there was an imminent and grave threat and theres zero to indicate that then this was a monumental abuse of power and it had to go to the top of the justice department because under justice department regulations this would have had to have been approved by the attorney general this wasnt just her phone number at the pentagon  l a this was her home phone her cell phones her personal email accounts the scope of this intrusion is really staggering isnt it it is it is an incredibly invasive procedure and d zero j regulations recognize because the 1st amendment is at stake here the 1st amendment of course is the cornerstone the heart of our democracy and when the justice department obtains this information through subpoena an almost entirely one sided process that sheds a real pall over the 1st amendment thats a real threat to the 1st amendment because it will frighten people it will deter them from talking to journalists because if they believe well if i speak to this journalist barbara starr or anybody else the doj may pull those records and see that im talking to her and so thats the danger really at issue here wolf the former president trump as all of us remember during those four years he almost always viciously attacked the news media through his campaign through his presidency how chilling is it to see that the justice department followed suit and targeted american journalists like this yeah well one of the most devastating legacies of the trump administration is that he continually vilified and attacked the media how many times did he lash out over twitter or elsewhere about the fake news or worse than that and its really disturbing to see that the justice department as it did all too often under donald trump not only went along with it but facilitated it and promoted it and we know from jessicas reporting that this application to subpoena the information relating to barbara starr the approval was given in 2020 so unless it happened in the very last week of december it would have been bill barr who approved it and again thats all too characteristic of the way bill barr enabled donald trumps absolute worst instincts yeah trump used to say almost all the time the news media were the enemy of the american people but its just the latest example just in the last two weeks we learned that the trump justice department secretly obtained phone records of several washington post reporters not just barbara starr our pentagon correspondent whos distinguished highly regarded been there for many years how persuasive was this all of this potentially pervasive was this yeah yeah well thats the big question how pervasive was this how far did it go how wide did it go there could well be more because the way these orders work and the way it worked with respect to barbara starr is doj has the ability to go to a court and say we want to get this information but we dont want to notify the journalist or the media organization and that puts the journalist and the media organization in an especially difficult position because we cnn or barbara starr doesnt even have the ability to go to court and say judge we want to fight this its a one sided fight and i believe that this information weve already already seen it start to trickle out i think more and more of it will come out i think there is a real impetus here for the new attorney general merrick garland to expose whatever was done to reveal whatever was done and to fix it yeah we got to learn exactly what happened in order to make sure it doesnt happen again we have something called freedom of the press here in the united states and that has to be cherished it has to be honored thank you very very much ellie hunting",
