The model's answer is slightly more specific by mentioning \"u.s. areas,\" which aligns closely with the reference. However, the model's answer does not diverge significantly from the reference in terms of accuracy or relevance.

The model's response captures the essence of the reference by mentioning the scandal, but it provides a slightly expanded context by indicating that it was a scandal that ensued, which is relevant and accurate. However, the model's answer lacks the directness of the reference.
