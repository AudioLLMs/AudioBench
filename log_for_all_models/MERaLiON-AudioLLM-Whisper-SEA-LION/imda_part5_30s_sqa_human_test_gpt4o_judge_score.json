            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"Speaker2 believes trying new things reduces regrets, using the example of missing out on buying a favorite ice cream as a minor daily regret.\" This provides a specific reason and example for encouraging stepping out of comfort zonesâ€”reducing regrets through experiences. The model's answer, \"To avoid regrets,\" captures the core reason but lacks the specific example and detail provided in the reference answer. While the model's response is relevant and aligned with the general idea, it lacks the specific illustration and depth found in the reference.\n\nRating: 3",

The model's answer is mostly aligned with the reference, though it uses slightly different wording. The main difference is the reference mentions \"explore on their own,\" which implies a reason for leaving, whereas the model does not specify this.
