            "reference": "The speaker's perspective on the relationship between economics and healthcare is that economics is a necessary and important consideration in healthcare decision-making. By stating \"we need more economics, not less,\" the speaker is suggesting that economic analysis should not be overlooked or minimized in healthcare discussions, but rather should be embraced as a valuable tool for addressing complex healthcare challenges. This implies that economic factors should be considered alongside non-economic factors, such as values and trade-offs, in order to make well-rounded and informed healthcare decisions.",
            "model_prediction": "The speaker believes that while economics is crucial for discussing markets, prices, and resources (as they mention confining themselves to these topics when speaking to economists), it is also essential in healthcare. They argue that解决复杂的医疗挑战需要更多的经济学家，而不是更少。这表明他们认为经济学在医疗决策和资源分配中扮演着重要角色，与医生的专业知识相辅相成。",
