            "model_prediction": "The audio states that there is a fifty percent discount for all travel packages starting from December. The discount is so origin per person, it will be around two thousand five hundred, but then now it's actually one thousand plus inclusive of any gst or service charges, and then if there's any customer service issues, please contact the travel agency.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is specific about the 50% discount reducing the per-person cost from $2,500 to around $1,000, excluding customizations. In contrast, the model's answer incorrectly adds \"inclusive of any gst or service charges\" and mentions \"customer service issues\" which are not mentioned in the reference.

Phone payment by calling the AXS customer service number\n  3. In-person payment at an AXS machine or partner location\n  4. Bank transfer or direct debit\n  5.

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer doesn't mention payment options, but instead describes different ways to access AXS services (physical stations, E-station, and M-station). The model's answer, on the other hand, provides a list of payment options for bill payments.

They mention that they can send an email regarding all the necessary information.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"more detailed information regarding the first tier and perhaps the business tier\", while the model's answer is \"more information and more detailed information regarding the first tier and perhaps the business tier\".

They mention that there was one night where they wanted to order room service but it took a very long time for someone to come up, and they had to call them again to get their order. This could be frustrating and inconvenience for guests who rely on room service for their meals. It's important for hotels to ensure that their room service is prompt and efficient to provide a positive guest experience.",

            "reference": "Speaker1 confirms that applicants must be Singaporean and reside in Singapore for at least 183 days annually to qualify for travel insurance.",
            "model_prediction": "The eligibility criteria for travel insurance vary depending on the insurance provider and the type of policy. However, in general, the following factors are considered when determining whether someone is eligible for travel insurance:\n\n1. Age: Most travel insurance providers have an age limit, typically ranging from 18 to 70 years old. Exceptions may be made for older individuals or children.\n\n2. Health status: Some travel insurance providers may exclude coverage for certain pre-existing medical conditions, while others may offer coverage with additional premiums.\n\n3. Destination: Travel insurance policies may have different coverage options for different destinations. Some policies may exclude coverage for certain countries or regions due to political instability or other risks.\n\n4. Trip duration: The length of the trip may also affect the eligibility for travel insurance. Some policies may only cover trips of a certain duration, while others may offer coverage for longer trips.\n\n5. Purpose of trip: The purpose of the trip may also be a factor in determining eligibility for travel insurance. Some policies may exclude coverage for certain types of trips, such as adventure sports or missionary work.\n\nIt is important to carefully read the policy terms and conditions to understand the specific eligibility criteria for a particular travel insurance policy.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer specifically states that applicants must be Singaporean and reside in Singapore for at least 183 days annually to qualify for travel insurance.

            "model_prediction": "Shared maternity leave allows both parents to take time off work to care for their new child. This can provide fathers with the opportunity to bond with their child and take on a greater role in childcare, which can benefit both the father and the family. Shared maternity leave can also help to reduce the financial burden on parents, as both parents can take advantage of government benefits and parental leave schemes. Additionally, taking time off work to care for a new child can help fathers to maintain their job and career, as they are able to take leave when their child is young and require the most care. Overall, shared maternity leave can provide fathers with the opportunity to take an active role in childcare, which can benefit both the father and the family.",

            "model_prediction": "The parking lot color codes are used to identify parking spaces in a parking lot. There are typically four different color codes used, with each color representing a specific type of parking space. The colors may be painted on the ground or displayed on signs.\nHere is a breakdown of the possible parking lot color codes:\n\n  * Red: This color is typically used to indicate a reserved parking space, such as for disabled drivers or for specific types of vehicles. It may also be used to indicate a no parking zone.\n  * Yellow: This color is typically used to indicate a paid parking space. The parking fee may be displayed on a sign next to the space.\n  * Green: This color is typically used to indicate a free parking space.\n  * Blue: This color is typically used to indicate a short-term parking space, such as for visitors or for a limited time.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific color codes used may vary depending on the location and the parking management company.",
