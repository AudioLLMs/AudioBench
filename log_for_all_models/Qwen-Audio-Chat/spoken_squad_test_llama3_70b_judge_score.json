He believed that individuals should read and interpret the Bible for themselves, rather than relying on priests or Church leaders to interpret it for them. He also encouraged people to live according to their faith, and to speak out against social and political injustices. By promoting a personal relationship with God and a commitment to ethical behavior, Luther believed that people could bring about social and political change from within.",
