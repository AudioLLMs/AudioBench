These regions have mild temperatures throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from about 10째C to 22째C (50째F to 72째F).

In these verses, Jesus says to Peter, \"And I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" Luther interpreted this verse to mean that the church, not the Pope, was the foundation of the Christian faith and that the Pope did not have the exclusive right to interpret scripture.",

He believed that the bread was transformed into the body of Christ and the wine into his blood through the power of the Holy Spirit. This belief, known as transubstantiation, was a central teaching of the Catholic Church, but it was rejected by Luther and his followers, who believed in a more literal interpretation of the sacrament.",

This was an issue crucial to Luther the theologians, including Zwingley, Mellanthon, Martin Bucer, and others, and was meant to establish a unified doctrine among the Protestant states.",
