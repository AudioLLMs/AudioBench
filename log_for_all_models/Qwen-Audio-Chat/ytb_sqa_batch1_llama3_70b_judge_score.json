            "model_prediction": "The benefits of being open-minded to different cultures as mentioned in the clip are:\n\n1. Increased understanding and appreciation of different cultures: When we are open-minded to different cultures, we are more likely to understand and appreciate their values, customs, and traditions. This can help build bridges between cultures and foster greater understanding and cooperation.\n\n2.

This can broaden our perspectives and help us develop empathy and tolerance for others.\n\n3. Business opportunities: Being open-minded to different cultures can open up business opportunities as we learn about new markets, customers, and ways of doing business. This can help us tap into new sources of revenue and expand our businesses.\n\n4.

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer mentions two options: collecting medications from MedSAFE (a self-service locker) or having them delivered on a pre-agreed date. The model's answer, on the other hand, mentions two options: collecting from the NUH Outpatient Pharmacy or Medsity (a 24-hour self-service locker). The model's answer is close but not entirely accurate, as it introduces new information (NUH Outpatient Pharmacy) and incorrectly renames MedSAFE to Medsity.\n\nRating: 3\n\nThe model's answer is generally aligned with the reference, but lacks precision in some aspects. It recognizes the topic and provides two options, but the details are not entirely accurate.",
