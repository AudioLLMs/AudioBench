            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer implies that the sound could be related to a cleaning job, leaving room for interpretation. In contrast, the model's answer dismisses the possibility of determining the sound's origin due to the lack of audio transcription, which is a valid point but diverges from the reference's tone and implication.
