            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is discussing a hawker support initiative between two speakers, agreeing that it lacks long-term sustainability. The model's answer, on the other hand, discusses a food store initiative that gave away hundreds of hawker food stores, focusing on the lack of long-term sustainability. While the model's answer captures the essence of the discussion being about an initiative that lacks sustainability, it misrepresents the initiative itself and omits the crucial detail that the discussion is between two speakers.

The speaker expresses frustration with others who say hurtful things without meaning them, and how it's difficult to process such comments. However, the speaker asserts their own strength in processing these emotions, acknowledging that others may interpret things wrongly or be weak in certain situations. The dialogue also touches on the idea that people can grow and develop strength, but still struggle with sadness and emotional pain.

The model's answer, on the other hand, is more elaborate and touches on various aspects such as self-awareness, emotional strength, and relationships. While it acknowledges the idea of emotional struggles, it diverges from the reference in terms of specificity and detail.
