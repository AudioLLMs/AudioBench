The reference answer specifies \"那个档口的 sambal\" in the context of a particular stall, while the model's answer generalizes to \"chow mein\" and miswrites \"sambal\" as \"samba.\" This divergence affects the accuracy and relevance of the model's response significantly.\n\nRating: 2",

The model's answer, however, introduces the idea that \"they are not fluent in English,\" which is not mentioned in the reference. Additionally, the model's answer refers to \"Cardi reviews\" instead of \"kadi reviews,\" which is a significant deviation from the reference.
