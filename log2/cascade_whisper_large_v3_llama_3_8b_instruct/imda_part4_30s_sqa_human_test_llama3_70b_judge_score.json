            "model_prediction": "Speaker1 and Speaker2 are concerned that the hawker food stall initiative is not sustainable and does not provide long-term benefits to the hawkers, as it is a one-time thing and does not provide a steady source of income.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is specific to Speaker1's concern, stating that they find the initiative unsustainable for the long term. In contrast, the model's response is more general, combining the concerns of both speakers and adding the idea that the initiative is a one-time thing without a steady source of income. While the model's response captures the general idea of sustainability, it lacks the precision and specificity of the reference answer.\n\nRating: 3",

The model's answer is a brief statement \"You don't have the strength to process it.\" While the model's answer touches on the idea of lacking strength to process emotions, it doesn't fully capture the context and nuance of the reference answer. \n\nRating: 3",

The model's answer focuses on the unique features, but omits the expectation of higher prices. Additionally, the model renames \"Plus Eight Two Cafe\" to \"plus 82\" which might be considered a minor detail.
