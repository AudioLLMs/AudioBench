The model's answer also introduces extra detail with the phrase \"The bunny sign that says 'Buy Me',\" which, while informative, is not present in the reference. These differences slightly detract from perfect alignment, as the model's answer could be seen as adding unnecessary complexity.\n\nRating: 4",

The model's response uses similar language to convey the insincerity of the government's actions, specifically using the term \"wayang\" to denote pretentiousness or insincerity.
