            "model_prediction": "The speaker does not provide a suggestion for avoiding regrets in daily life. Instead, they mention that regrets are a natural part of life and give an example of a small regret, such as forgetting to buy ice cream, to illustrate this point.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is that Speaker2 suggests pushing out of one's comfort zone and trying new things to avoid having regrets. Meanwhile, the model's answer is that the speaker does not provide a suggestion for avoiding regrets in daily life.

While eating local food is related to cultural experience, the model's answer is too narrow and doesn't fully capture the essence of the reference answer.\nRating: 2",

The model's answer, on the other hand, adds extra details about the speaker being \"confident with planning their finances\" and \"saving money\", which are not present in the reference answer.
