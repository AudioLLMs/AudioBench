aljunied hougang punggol east town council mister tharman said there are fundamental differences he said the a g zero gave an unmodified audit opinion of the government is financial statements now this means that the accounts of all government agencies are reliable and public funds accounted for in contrast he said the special audit of a h p e t c by the a g zero showed that its entire system of accounts is a problem this triggered an exchange with workers party chairman sylvia lim quoting the a g zero report on a h p e t c is finances mister tharman said there can be no assurance that the town council is accounts are accurate and reliable that public funds are properly spent accounted for and managed he said it is not just a matter of poor accounting procedures if i can put it simply the whole house of a h p e t c is finances is unsafe if you look at what the a g zero findings say both a g os both a h p e t cs own auditor and a g zero could not certify the a h p e t c house as structurally safe as structurally sound apart from from it being unsafe and unsound there are also many individual defects and problems by comparison the government agencies audited by a g zero do not have unsafe houses the house is safe and there is no question as to whether public monies are fully accounted for there are some repairs needed to the house in specific areas but everyone can be confident that the house is safe and there is also full visibility the curtains are not drawn there is full visibility this is the fundamental difference this let the opposition workers party chairman to question if mister tharman was aware that the town council has since filed a subsequent audited accounts for f y thirteen and forteen the auditors that audited our accounts which were recently submitted on 30th june is he not aware that out of the thirteen disclaimers that were put into our previous accounts the auditors have confirmed that only three remain unresolved and last of all the d p m is he not also aware that this recent audit that we did for f y thirteen forteen our auditors actually made the observation that except for certain specific issues the town councils are actually complied the act in terms of keeping proper accounts and books the accounts are still qualified with disclaimers of opinion they are qualified on several counts 1st i should note also that these are new auditors appointed by a h p e t c and they had flagged the eight different areas of concern involving non compliance with legal and regulatory requirements eight areas where there were non compliance and these were the fairly basic areas they were not minor areas of infraction they were they were still matters to do with related party transactions quite significant matters there were lapses with regard to transfer to sinking funds which is extremely important matter for all town councils failure to transfer monies to sinking funds when due is really putting the house at risk it is really putting the house at risk the transfers that a h p e t c made according to its own auditors report were late and as you recall from the a g zero is previous report errors were discovered in the computations only after a g zero is audit so there is something seriously wrong there there were also problems to do with all the the accounts themselves problems to do with the opening balances problems to do with determining the accuracy of the service and conservancy charges that were owed to the town council problems to do with accounting for creditors and accrued expenses so it is not something to be whitewashed and the house is structurally unsafe unsafe one does not just go and put paint of a new coat of paint on the front walls i think it needs a very hard look the foundations need to be put in place it is hard work but you have had a lot of time to do so d p m still has not actually answered my questions whether he accepts that in the f y thirteen forteen accounts which our auditors approved that they have noted that out of the thirteen disclaimers from the past only three remain unresolved so i would like him to confirm whether he accepts that point secondly does he also accept that some of the areas which our auditors highlighted were actually carried over from the the previous accounts opening balance issues for example you know there is a 2nd 3rd point also regarding the sinking fund transfers i think it is public knowledge that the town council is still not received its operating s and c c grants for f y forteen and f y fifteen so is d p m not aware of that as well and last of all does d p m not accept what i put him earlier that the auditors opinion was that except for the specific observations we have complied with the act that is like saying that except for the fact that the pillars of my house are are in serious danger of collapsing ev everything is fine the examples that i have that i have given of the areas that the auditor has qualified do strike me as a finance minister as being fairly serious examples they are not minor infractions which you put a coat of paint over they are very serious examples so i i would really strongly advise not to get in the game of saying that you know whether it is three or eight and so on but to look into the substance of the matter these are very serious issues a failure to transfer monies into the sinking funds being unable to account for your service and conservancy charges after a few years after a few years they are very serious matters to be taken seriously by everyone up and down the line

1st march 2020 this year marks 200 years since sir stamford raffles landed in singapore archaeological finds and records show that singapore is history stretches back at least 700 years serving as a trading emporium in the region 191819 was a key turning point in singapore is development the british decision to declare singapore a free port plugged us into an emerging network of global trade this and subsequent developments transformed singapore into a global node in our bicentennial year let us reflect on the twists and turns in our history so as to chart a path forward for an even better future for our people today we are in a different phase of globalization with new forces reshaping the global environment in last year is budget statement i mentioned three major shifts the shift in global economic weight towards asia rapid technological advancements and changing demographic patterns a 4th major force that is gaining prominence is the decline in support for globalization some countries are benefitting from globalization while others are questioning its value these four major forces are interacting in complex ways at the global regional and national levels on the global stage the trade frictions between the us and china are developing into a deeper strategic competition of strength and of governance systems this is raising geopolitical uncertainty closer to home asean has enjoyed over fifty years of peace and stability with bright economic prospects together the ten economies of asean are projected to become the 4th largest in the world by 2030 with the size of the middle class doubling innovation and entrepreneurship are also thriving in recent years southeast asia has grown several new unicorns or companies with valuations in excess of 1000000000 u s dollars working together asean nations can maximize our potential but closely connected neighbors will have occasional differences a couple of issues have surfaced recently with malaysia when such differences occur singaporeans must stay united as a people and present our positions firmly and calmly we have worked through difficult bilateral issues with our neighbors in the past based on mutual respect and common interests and in accordance with international laws and norms singapore will continue to seek to resolve issues in the same spirit domestically we need to address longer term challenges including aging social mobility any inequality economic transformation and climate change the changing global and domestic landscape presents both challenges and opportunities we will continue to chart our way forward confidently in the singapore way building on our distinct strengths and our singaporean dna we must always respond to challenges with grit and determination there were episodes in the centuries of singapore is history where our island is fortunes waned due to external forces these are sobering reminders that we have to constantly build up our security and resilience and plan long term singapore is success has roots in our port which thrives on openness and connectivity these traits have been forged into our identity as a people as a multi cultural society our openness to diversity is our strength it has inculcated a global mindset and deepened our knowledge of asia we must continue to cultivate cross cultural literacy among our youth and encourage them to build bridges with peoples across the world we strive to be a place where people and ideas congregate at the frontier of global developments we want to be a global asia node of technology innovation and enterprise we turn our size and strategic location into an advantage technological shifts have spread economic activities more widely and at the same time made cities more important as key nodes of enterprise and innovation as a city state we are nimbler and can adapt to changes faster we serve as a neutral trusted node in key spheres of global activity like sang kancil the small but quick witted mousedeer we can make our way in the world budget 2019 is a strategic plan to allocate resources to build a strong united singapore in this bicentennial year let us draw on our strengths and our singaporean dna openness multi culturalism and self determination to continue to progress at a fundamental level we must keep singapore safe and secure this allows us to preserve our way of life and forge our own destiny we must continue to transform our economy for only a vibrant and innovative economy can provide opportunities for our people to realize their potential we must continue to build a caring and inclusive society where we look out for one another and all of us play our part in weaving a tightly knit social fabric we must continue to build singapore as a global city and home for all keeping it smart sustainable and globally connected last but not least we must achieve these goals in a responsible and fiscally sustainable way we are using our financial resources to help realize our strategies for a strong united singapore but financial resources alone do not get us there we call on all singaporeans to partner with the government and support one another to succeed in this endeavor a safe and secure singapore gives us the confidence to chart an independent course but we cannot take our peace prosperity and stability for granted singapore is vulnerable to the fluctuations in our region and the world against an increasingly uncertain geopolitical environment our commitment to defense and security cannot waver diplomacy and deterrence are the twin pillars of our approach the ministry of foreign affairs works continuously to build good relations with our neighbors and the major powers and to promote a rules based international order with international laws and norms a strong saf lends weight to our diplomatic efforts and ensures that negotiations with singapore are taken seriously should diplomacy fail we must stand ready to safeguard our interests and defend ourselves the home team also works round the clock alongside other security agencies to ensure a safe environment for all we now have the cyber security agency of singapore leading our efforts to protect our critical information infrastructure from cyber threats and to create a secure cyberspace for businesses and communities these are fundamental to our sovereignty our success and to safeguarding our vital interests singapore is one of the safest cities in the world our crime rates are consistently low but we must not be complacent security threats are evolving and becoming more complex a strong saf remains a bulwark against threats to our way of life terrorism threats to singapore remain high we continue to detect individuals in singapore who have been radicalized by terrorist propaganda globally we see a rise in attacks perpetrated by radicalized individuals and cells such attacks are hard to prevent we must stay vigilant beyond physical threats malicious cyber activities are growing the networked nature of our society has enhanced connectivity but this can be exploited to disrupt and divide society through cyber attacks the spread of falsehoods or other means in particular foreign actors will try to influence our domestic affairs and politics this is not new but new technologies have made it easier for others to mount attacks with greater ease and intensity and with more sophisticated tactics to stay ahead of these threats we must continue to innovate and build new capabilities to meet our security needs both the public and private sectors have a major role to play the ministry of home affairs will set up a home team science and technology agency by the end of this year to develop science and technology capabilities to support the home team is operational needs these capabilities will strengthen the home team is ability to carry out its mission of safeguarding singapore the minister for home affairs will speak more about this at the committee of supply the private security industry has been stepping up efforts a good example is certis which has redesigned its business processes infusing technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence to deal with security threats mha will help to transform the private security industry through innovation and technology to meet growing needs and be an effective partner to the home team our total defense approach will continue to keep singapore safe and secure with every singaporean playing a part at the national level we plan long term and take measures such as stockpiling critical supplies diversifying our sources of water supply and strengthening our food security as a people we must have the psychological and emotional resilience to face crises stoically as threats get more sophisticated singaporeans must stay vigilant and guard against non conventional forces that threaten to divide us national service has forged a deep understanding in our people that each and every one of us has the duty to defend our nation when our young people serve ns families and employers support them in every way possible with our smart nation drive digital technology has become an integral part of our lives to harness the digital advantage we must be prepared to also deal with the threats that arise inevitably from its more pervasive use digital defense has now been incorporated as the 6th pillar of total defense like the other pillars of total defense digital defense involves everyone individuals community groups businesses and the government we must all play our part to be secure alert and responsible online be it through practicing good cyber hygiene being vigilant against fake news and helping one another use technology safely last year mindef launched the cyber national servicemen scheme training national servicemen with the singapore institute of technology to raise our cyber defense capability the government is also engaging our tech community with programs such as the government bug bounty program to achieve a higher level of collective cybersecurity given its strategic significance the government will continue to invest a significant share of our resources about thirty percents of our total expenditure this year to support our defense security and diplomacy efforts this spending is significant but indispensable we will invest more if the need arises to protect the sovereignty of singapore and the well being of singaporeans everyone has a role to play to keep singapore safe and secure let us continue to stay united in defending our home and our way of life a vibrant and innovative economy provides our people with the opportunities to realize their potential and to have a better life our efforts to transform our economy are bearing fruit in in tandem with the global expansion the singapore economy grew threetwo in 2018 good growth translated into good outcomes for our workers over the past five years the real median income of singaporeans has grown by threesix per year global growth is expected to moderate in 2019 while uncertainties and downside risks in the global economy have increased over the years our sound monetary and fiscal policies have enabled us to weather global economic crises and keep inflation stable these provide a stable environment for investors to make long term investment decisions beyond maintaining a supportive macro economic environment we need to build a sound micro economic foundation so that resources can be allocated to their best possible uses and to undertake structural reforms to enable our workers and firms to adapt and stay competitive every firm and every worker will need to work differently master new skills and use technology well and we must continue to create new opportunities including through partnerships with others in budget 2016 we launched the industry transformation maps i t m s which drive transformation at the company industry and economy wide levels each i t m integrates four key pillars of transformation jobs and skills innovation internationalization and productivity these are mutually reinforcing pillars to maximize impact to coordinate efforts the future economy council brings together leaders from the government industry trade associations and chambers unions and academia after three years of intensive work i am glad that all 23 i t m s have been launched covering about eighty of our economy we are seeing good progress aided by the global economic upturn in recent years productivity as measured by real value added per actual hour worked grew threesix per year in the last three years higher than the onesix per annum growth recorded in the preceding three years from 2012 to 2015 in particular we have seen strong performance by outward oriented sectors such as manufacturing while others like construction and some services industries continue to show weaker productivity growth but this is a continuing journey there is much more we can do especially in sectors like domestic services we must press on let me now outline three key thrusts in this budget to support industry transformation 1st building deep enterprise capabilities 2nd building deep worker capabilities 3rd encouraging strong partnerships within singapore and across the world the basic building blocks of a vibrant economy are strong competitive companies that maximize value creation hence the 1st thrust is to support the building of deep enterprise capabilities companies at different stages of growth have different needs the leadership of each company is in the best position to lead and drive changes while our agencies can provide support at each stage of growth a vibrant start up ecosystem encourages budding entrepreneurs to try out their business ideas such an ecosystem enables entrepreneurs to connect to mentors prospective business partners customers and investors two years ago we launched startup sg to provide holistic support for start ups and entrepreneurs such support ranges from co investments and proof of concept grants to mentorship and physical space our start up ecosystem is flourishing there are now over 220 venture capital deals per year in singapore worth close to 4200000000 u s dollars this is a significant rise from the eighty deals worth u s 136000000 in 2012 today more than 150 global venture capital funds incubators and accelerators are based in singapore supporting start ups here and in the region start ups can only thrive if they scale up and venture into new markets to help them do so we will provide support in three areas providing customized assistance better financing options and supporting technology adoption customized support can enable firms to identify and overcome the unique challenges they face and scale up quickly enterprise singapore will launch a scale up sg program in partnership with the private and public sectors scale up sg will work with aspiring high growth local firms to identify and build new capabilities to innovate grow and internationalize to support innovation we will launch a pilot innovation agents program for firms to tap on a pool of experts to advise them on opportunities to innovate and commercialize technology having smart patient capital that attracts investors with the expertise and the right time horizon is another way to help firms scale up over the past few years the government has worked on improving access to private capital for start ups and s m e s the pool of private equity and venture capital managers in singapore has grown the monetary authority of singapore has simplified the regulatory regime for venture capital manager manages and launched a u s $5000000000 private markets program to encourage global private equity players to deepen their presence here to further deepen the pool of smart patient capital the government has since 2010 set aside for $100000000 through two rounds of fund injections for the co investment program to invest in our s m e s alongside the private sector so far the government is investments have catalyzed approximately $1300000000 of additional funding for our s m e s this year i will set aside an additional $100000000 to establish s m e co investment fund three as part of this co investment funds you will catalyze investment in singapore based s m e s that are ready to scale up we expect that this will bring in at least $200000000 of additional funding loan financing remains an important source of funding for s m e s our banks have been responding d b s provides a business capabilities loan for innovative s m e projects u zero b provides financial support for technology investments and overseas ventures while zero c b c finances new s m e s which lack the track record typically required for credit assessment to catalyze these further we will enhance the accessibility of loans today our economic agencies have different financing schemes to make it simpler for companies we will streamline the existing financing schemes offered by enterprise singapore into a single enterprise financing scheme that will cover trade working capital fixed assets venture debt mergers and acquisitions and project financing this will be launched in october this year in addition the enterprise financing scheme will provide stronger support for companies that have been incorporated for less than five years the government will take up to seventy of the risk for bank loans to these young companies compared to the current fifty under most existing loan schemes to support viable s m e s in their day to day operations i will extend the s m e working capital loan scheme for about two more years till march 2021 since its launch in june 2016 the scheme has catalyzed more than $2500000000 of loans we expect the extension to catalyze a further $1800000000 support for working capital will be folded under the enterprise financing scheme from october our companies and workers must stay on top of rapid advances in technology especially in digital technology we will continue to help our s m e s adopt digital technologies we adopted the s m e s go digital program in budget 2017 since then around 4000 s m e s have adopted pre approved digital solutions we will expand the s m e s go digital program 1st accountancy sea transport and construction will get their own industry digital plans with more sectors to be added later these will guide s m e s on relevant digital technologies and skills training programs 2nd we will expand the number and range of cost effective pre approved digital solutions that will be supported under s m e s go digital to boost technology adoption among s m e s m a s and i m d a will also jointly pilot a cross border innovation platform for s m e s known as the business sans borders with an artificial intelligence enabled marketplace to help our s m e s match with buyers and vendors globally to help companies in the services sector capture opportunities from digitalisation the ministry of communications and information launched a pilot of the digital services lab or d s l in november last year the d s l brings together industry and the research community to co develop digital solutions with sector wide impact for example the d s l is exploring the development of solutions to integrate the logistics chain in malls besides digital technology we will support our firms to integrate technologies and re engineer business processes to raise efficiency and enhance product development last year i announced the productivity solutions grant to help firms adopt off the shelf technology this year we will extend the automation support package by two years introduced in budget 2016 the automation support package supports firms to deploy impactful large scale automation such as robotics internet of things solutions and other industry fourzero technologies since its launch the a s p has helped more than 300 companies to automate their operations and raise productivity we will extend the a s p to encourage more companies to do so the agency for science technology and research will extend its operation and technology roadmapping efforts to more companies and sectors to guide them to make the best use of technology in alignment with their business goals in the same spirit our government agencies must embrace technology to serve companies better we have made progress in this area the business grants portal launched in 2017 provides a one stop shop for businesses to identify and apply for the right grant for their plans to make it easier for businesses to transact with the government the ministry of trade and industry and relevant agencies are developing a one stop portal with a pilot to be launched for the food services sector by three q 2019 businesses will deal with only one point of contact instead of up to the fourteen different ones today b c a and h d b are also testing the use of drones to inspect building facades more effectively learning from these pilots government agencies will continue to innovate and improve the ease of doing business let me now touch on other ways to help build deep enterprise capabilities we have more than 200000 enterprises in singapore ranging from large m n c s to our neighborhood shops today across each of the four pillars of our i t m s different agencies provide support in each area while helpful companies have given feedback that we could streamline these i agree to better support this broad base of companies with diverse needs we will draw resources from each agency but focus support in an enterprise centric way to better help enterprises at each stage of growth this will be done in a tiered manner firms with large and complex needs or with strong growth potential will be provided a range of customized support by e d b e s g and other agencies the large numbers of s m e s facing common challenges will be supported through scalable solutions that are easy to adopt for instance i recently visited precursor assurance a local accounting firm precursor has developed an integrated digital solution with modules for corporate functions such as h r customer relationship management and finance s m e s can simply plug and play and scale up the use of these modules when they expand for medium sized companies that are seeking to grow we will provide targeted support in each of the different industry clusters to better address their needs as they grow the minister for trade and industry will provide further details i touched on the measures to support our enterprises to build deep capabilities so that they can succeed in the global competition but our ultimate goal is to enable our people to continue to have good jobs and opportunities and to be at their best hence the 2nd thrust of our economic transformation in this budget is to deepen the capabilities of our workers as the chinese say 活学活用 学以致用 终身学习 终身受用 our people need to be nimble to build industry relevant skills throughout their lives we want our people to have the skills knowledge and attitude to adapt and thrive in this competitive and technology intensive environment in this regard the leadership of companies plays a key role the leaders of successful companies are those who are committed to raising the capabilities of their workers by redesigning jobs and reskilling their staff these capabilities are key to the companies successes i recently visited fairprice is distribution center which has adopted automated storage and retrieval systems to improve the efficiency of its online store operations among the staff i spoke to were mister amzah bin mohammad ali and madam lee yin fong between them they have worked at fairprice for thirty years i asked how the new technology has impacted their work they told me that fairprice is training has helped them to quickly pick up new skills to make use of new systems and their work environment is more pleasant and conducive fairprice is a good example of how an enterprise can strive to serve her customers better deploy technology and new ways of working and at the same time redesign jobs and reskill workers so that everyone is better off many enterprises are doing this and i urge more to take this approach on the part of the government we will continue to invest in our people across all stages of their lives from pre school to work over the years we have instituted a range of support measures for workers including the workfare income supplement special employment credit and professional conversion programs to name a few these range from helping low wage workers and older workers through wage support to equipping young graduates to have a good start in their careers and enabling experienced professionals to access new jobs in particular n t u c has been working closely with its member unions and companies to enable workers to learn new skills and grow with the national skillsfuture movement and the adapt and grow initiatives we have made a stronger push to enable our people to reach their fullest potential throughout life and help singaporeans affected by restructuring our investments in supporting our people in their careers including adapt and grow initiatives and continuing education and training reached more than $1100000000 in financial year 2017 our people are making good effort to invest in their learning with good outcomes the percentage of residents in the labor force who participated in training grew from 35 in 2015 to 48 in 2018 from 2016 to 2018 more than 76000 job seekers found employment through the adapt and grow initiative workers firms unions and t a c s all need to play a part to continue this progress workers need to embrace upskilling and reskilling and make the most of new opportunities both locally and overseas firms must step up training and job redesign for their workers as they are well placed to know the skills that workers need as their sectors evolve one example is mister abdul jalil bin idros who started as a technical officer at y t l powerseraya over the years the company sponsored his bachelor is and master is degrees in electrical engineering through continuous learning as he worked mister abdul jalil moved from maintenance to managing plant upgrading projects he is now training his colleagues in cybersecurity and systems operations he received the skills future fellowships award in 2018 for his exemplary efforts besides workers and firms unions t a c s and professional bodies need to spearhead the reskilling and the upskilling of workers in various sectors i am heartened by the institute of singapore chartered accountants collaboration with the singapore university of social sciences to develop the joint business analytics certification program this program which was launched a year ago equips accounting professionals with practical skills in data analytics we will continue to enable our experienced professionals to build on their experience to move into new growth areas since the establishment of the p c p in 2007 over 100 p c p s have been launched in about thirty sectors this year we will launch new p c p s relating to blockchain embedded software and prefabrication to prepare our people to move into new growth areas in 2015 we launched the career support program to provide wage support for employers to hire eligible singaporeans who are mature and retrenched or are in long term unemployment we will extend this program for two years we must also ensure that the benefits of enterprise transformation are passed on to our workers starting from 1st april 2020 all transformation efforts supported by enterprise singapore is enterprise development grant must include positive outcomes for workers such as wage increases n t u c i know that n t u c and the unions are putting in extra effort and resources to support our firms and workers in this although some firms have done well to deploy their staff efficiently productivity growth has been uneven across sectors the manufacturing sector which faces strong global competition has done well in the services sector while some firms have done well despite a tight labor market some segments like f and b and retail remain very labor intensive growth in s pass and work permit holders in the services sector has also been picking up pace the number has risen by about three annum or 34000 in the last three years in particular the s pass growth in services is the highest in five years if this trend persists foreign manpower growth will be on an unsustainable path we need to act decisively to manage the manpower growth in services and encourage our companies to revamp work processes redesign jobs and reskill our workers our workforce growth is tapering and if we do not use this narrow window to double down on restructuring our companies will find this even harder in the future relying on more and more foreign workers is not the long term solution other economies are developing too what we need is to have a sustainable inflow of foreign workers to complement our workforce while we upgrade our singaporean workers and build deep enterprise capabilities in these sectors we must enhance the complementarities of our local and foreign workers the basic approach to our foreign worker policies has remained consistent based on evidence on the pace of foreign worker inflows and the progress being made in raising productivity across sectors we need to calibrate our policies the government recognizes the economic headwinds and cost pressures ahead of us but if we do not take action early our firms will find it harder to compete in the years ahead and our workers will be left behind after much deliberation we will adjust the workforce quota for the services sector reduce the services sector dependency ratio ceiling d r c in two steps from forty to 38 on 1st january 2020 and to 35 on 1st january 2021 we will also reduce the services sector s pass sub d r c in two steps from fifteen to thirteen on 1st january 2020 and to ten on 1st january 2021 we are announcing these changes about a year ahead to give companies time to prepare for firms whose existing workers are in excess of the new limits the d r c will apply as and when these firms apply for renewals of permits to support firms as they adjust to these changes we will put in place the following measures till f y 20221st the seventy funding support level for the enterprise development grant was due to lapse after 31st march 2020 i will now extend this enhanced funding support for three more years up to 31st march 20232nd we will do the same for the productivity solutions grant and expand its scope to support up to seventy of the out of pocket cost for training separately firms can continue to apply for additional manpower flexibilities in certain cases the lean enterprise development scheme provides support to firms that undertake transformation projects which lead to more manpower manpower lean businesses transitional manpower flexibilities can be considered if firms need more resources in the short term to transit to new operating models on a case by case basis firms can bring in foreign workers with specialized skills that are in demand globally this is provided that they still face a shortage after having given fair consideration to singaporeans the minister for trade and industry and the minister for manpower will provide more details at the cos as the marine shipyard and process sectors have only begun showing early signs of recovery i will defer the earlier announced increase in foreign worker levy rates for these sectors for another year i have spoken on how budget 2019 supports the building of deep enterprise capabilities and the building of deep worker capabilities let me now touch on the 3rd key thrust to support economic transformation building deeper partnerships within singapore and across the world to succeed companies need to both compete and cooperate compete to differentiate themselves and cooperate to solve common challenges our trade associations and chambers can play an important role in developing industry wide capabilities this includes supporting members in getting business advice and improving access to local and international markets t a c s have done well in helping our companies build overseas partnerships for example the singapore fintech association has forged many partnerships with foreign fintech associations and the singapore business federation has organized singapore is commercial participation at numerous overseas trade fairs including the 2018 china international import expo the singapore chinese chamber of commerce and industry has also developed the trade association hub which now houses 39 t a c s to raise the level of services for members s b f is also working closely with our t a c s we will support our support for t a c s through the local enterprise and association development lead program enterprise singapore will be developing five year roadmaps with t a c s that have demonstrated strong leadership and shown ambition to do more for the business community this will enable them to take on a more strategic and longer term approach in driving industry transformation these t a c s will be able to access funding and potentially take in public sector secondees through lead we will also develop stronger partnerships around the world at the government to government and business to business levels our t a c s such as the s b f have developed international linkages for our businesses over the years we have negotiated free trade agreements with partner economies which enlarge our businesses access to new markets just last week the eu singapore free trade agreement and the eu singapore investment protection agreement received the european parliament is consent with a clear majority to draw greater value from these trade networks we will streamline and digitize our trade processes further to raise efficiency this will enable easier access to overseas markets and help our firms make better use of these f t a s last year i launched the networked trade platform n t p to streamline trade processes and provide a one stop information management system for traders we will also be working with partners to facilitate the secure exchange of electronic trade documents to unlock further productivity gains members will appreciate that the three key thrusts i have just announced building deep capabilities in our enterprises and in our people and forging deep partnerships build on the itms that i announced in budget 2016 with the progress we have made we are better prepared for major changes that are coming our way one major change is the speed of advancements and convergence of new technologies it is what some have dubbed the 4th industrial revolution or industry fourzero this will transform the way we invest trade and consume over the years we have forged deep partnerships with the g three economies of us europe and japan as well as china india and asean with the center of economic gravity shifting to asia and with the technological depth of our partnerships with the g three economies we should position singapore as asia 101 for global m n c s looking to expand into asia is growing markets and as global 101 for asian companies ready to go global for our next phase of growth as we press on with industry transformation we will continue to build singapore is position as a global asia node of technology innovation and enterprise this will open up new opportunities for our firms and our people to ride on the wave of the 4th industrial revolution our efforts to achieve this will build on the same three key thrusts as laid out for the broader economic transformation 1st investments in research and innovation by our universities research institutes and our firms 2nd investments in our people and 3rd building global partnerships 1st we will continue to invest in r n d to support the push to make innovation pervasive we have set aside $19000000000 as part of our five year research innovation and enterprise 2020 plan our investments in r n d in our universities and research institutes are bearing fruit n u s and n t u are ranked the best in asia in areas such as materials science and chemistry and among the top fifty globally for engineering and computer science many of our researchers are regarded by their peers as among the world is best especially in areas such as artificial intelligence quantum technologies and biomedical sciences a star has research institutes that are highly regarded together with our universities they are actively working to translate research findings into innovation in partnerships with industries but for r n d to make an impact our companies must take the lead members of this house will be encouraged to know that some sectors are moving ahead including two old economy sectors 1st despite digital advancements we still need brick and mortar buildings the construction sector seen as low tech and labor intensive is now using integrated digital delivery this makes use of building information modeling and other digital technologies connecting different players working on the same construction projects this has raised productivity and created new high value jobs such as three d modelers site productivity has improved by about fifteen over the last eight years 2nd in the digital age we still need food not just bits and bytes the agriculture and food production sectors are transforming for example a v a s marine aquaculture center and temasek life sciences laboratory have developed the saint john is sea bass this fish is less susceptible to disease and can be bred in thirty less time a start up allegro aqua is looking to bring more saint john is sea bass to the world another example is temasek life sciences laboratory is temasek rice which produces four times as much rice per hectare as compared to regular breeds of rice to tap on the demand for high quality food and to build on our progress enterprise singapore is investment arm seeds capital has appointed seven partners to co invest in singapore based agri food start ups to catalyze more than $90000000 of investments leading m n c s and our large local companies are also establishing their r n d centers in singapore in different areas of technology we now have fourteen corporate laboratories in our universities doing cutting edge work from cyber physical systems to power electronics last year we opened four corporate labs with major companies applied materials h p wilmar and surbana jurong to work on advanced manufacturing biochemicals and smart cities i recently visited lux photonics consortium which brings together researchers in n u s n t u a star and the industry to translate cutting edge photonics research into practical applications there i met nanoveu a singapore start up specializing in nanotechnology applications one of its prototype products a high tech screen protector promises to allow long sighted users to see clear images on digital devices without their glasses and to see three d objects from two d films that is another project i am sure this house will support the enabling of us to see issues far or near with greater clarity i also met technolite our helix bridge and new buildings such as the jewel at changi airport are lit in scintillating ways by technolite the company is embarking on r n d to take its products to a new level so i wish nanoveu and technolite success to light up our lives and to let us see better to keep the momentum going we will continue to invest in centers of innovation at our institutes of higher learning and research institutes and to support companies in innovation enterprise singapore is collaborating with industry partners to establish a center of innovation in aquaculture at temasek polytechnic this center will bring together aquaculture firms to improve our food resilience enterprise singapore will also launch a center of innovation in energy at n t u building on earlier investments at the energy research institute at n t u the center will collaborate with the sustainable energy association of singapore to drive industry led innovation in areas such as energy efficiency renewable energy and electric mobility we will share more about these exciting new research initiatives at the research innovation and enterprise council meeting next month the spiit of entrepreneurship is critical for all these endeavors having a vision of the future and taking practical actions day in day out to explore a range of possibilities and solve a myriad of problems it is the grit and determination of our entrepreneurs that make a difference mister sim wong hoo c e zero of creative technology brought us the popular sound blaster cards in the 1990s creative technology went through a difficult patch after its initial success with the sound blaster but mister sim and his team pressed on after twenty years of r n d costing u s $100000000 the company recently launched the super x fi a technology that recreates the holographic sound experience or three d sound with headphones personalized it has already won fourteen awards at the 2019 consumer electronics show in the u s having tried it myself and having heard the endorsement of audiophiles including some in this chamber i am happy that mister sim and his team are at the cusp of a major breakthrough and i wish them every success mister sim is story illustrates the point that to succeed we must learn we must walk the ground and we must persist i have touched on our efforts in research innovation and enterprise singapore as a global asia node will bring new opportunities for our people in new frontiers the 2nd thrust is to prepare and develop our people to make full use of this node we are partnering firms to invest in our people including young singaporeans to provide them with opportunities to gain working experience abroad for students who are currently in i h l s we will combine the current local and overseas internship programs into a single global ready talent program or great you will have enhanced funding support for our students interning overseas with singapore firms the program will also support high growth singapore firms to send singaporeans with up to three years of working experience for postings in key markets such as southeast asia china and india by giving young singaporeans overseas exposure they can develop new skills to better support our firms overseas expansion for instance oceanus group a local seafood supplier sent interns from republic polytechnic to its operations in china in a range of jobs one of their former interns bernice chan is now a management trainee in oceanus farm in fotan china our 3rd thrust is to build global partnerships so that our firms and people can forge new areas of collaboration with other innovation centers in budget 2017 we started the global innovation alliance one of the committee on the future economy is recommendations we have now established nine nodes in global start up hotspots such as bangkok beijing berlin jakarta and san francisco these g i a nodes give our entrepreneurs and students opportunities to learn and build networks globally we are also bringing the global innovation community to come together in singapore to explore and collaborate last year we held the 3rd edition of the singapore fintech festival this is now the world is largest fintech festival as part of this festival the global investor summit brought together investors on our meet asean is talents and champions or match platform these investors expressed an interest to invest up to u s $12000000000 in asean enterprises in fintech info communications technology and medtech over the next three years another technology event the singapore week of innovation and technology switch brought together more than 350 exhibitors and 1000 promising start ups and financiers from 75 countries to maximize impact this year switch and the singapore fintech festival will be held in the same week in mid november we can join in even more entrepreneurs investors innovators from around the world to explore and collaborate in technology innovation in this 4th industrial revolution these various programs on economic transformation and jobs build upon our efforts and investments over the years to summarize our economic transformation is progressing well but we must persist with our industry transformation efforts at the same time the pace of technological innovation is rapid and global economic weight is shifting towards asia we will position singapore as a global asia node of technology innovation and enterprise economic transformation is critical we expect to spend $4600000000 over the next three years on the new and enhanced economic capability measures in budget 2019 and to support singaporean workers $3600000000 will go towards helping our workers to thrive amid industry and technological changes $1000000000 will go towards helping firms build deep enterprise capabilities but let me emphasize that supporting companies and supporting workers are mutually reinforcing stronger companies provide better jobs and pay for workers and highly skilled workers make companies stronger i am confident that we can continue to make good progress our enterprises and t a c s workers and unions and the government must continue to work closely together as long as we stay relevant and useful to the world we can continue to create opportunities for our people and enterprises as you can see it is a long speech i am too fast i have spoken about how we invest to secure our home and grow our economy at the heart of these efforts is the desire to improve the lives of current and future generations of singaporeans our approach to social development has served us well we invest heavily to bring out the best in our people we believe that access to quality education enables singaporeans to realize their potential we strive to ensure that all singaporeans regardless of background enjoy a quality living environment and have good access to healthcare and we provide targeted support to those who are less advantaged so that they can have a fair chance to succeed and to those who fall on hard times so they can bounce back our efforts were affirmed by the world bank when they ranked singapore top in the human capital index last year we recognize that singapore like many advanced economies will have to deal with issues such as maintaining social mobility supporting healthy and purposeful aging and fostering a stronger sense of unity amid polarizing forces over the past decade or so we have significantly increased our social spending social ministries expenditures have doubled from $15000000000 in f y 2009 to $30000000000 in f y 2018 the social measures in budget 2019 are part of our long term plan to build a caring and inclusive society they are driven by three main strategies 1st uplifting singaporeans to maximize their potential and providing access to opportunities through their stages of life we pay particular attention to children from disadvantaged backgrounds to give them a good start in life with increasing lifespans we are helping older singaporeans stay in the workforce so that they can earn and save more for retirement 2nd providing greater assurance for healthcare we will continue to strengthen support for the healthcare needs of singaporeans in particular we want to help our seniors stay active healthy and engaged in their silver years 3rd fostering a community of care and contribution through strong partnerships we strive to nurture an ethos in our society where we support one another and give a helping hand where we can those who succeed should help to uplift others just as they have benefitted from the support of others around them as the chinese say 同舟共济 共创未来 we are in the same boat and weather the storms together we progress together and forge our future together i will 1st talk about how we are supporting our children workers and seniors to access the best opportunities through each stage of life we invest heavily to provide a world class education for young singaporeans this is to bring out the best in every child no matter his or her starting point i know that this is an area of deep concern for many singaporeans many of you expressed this during feedback sessions and through your actions in giving time and money to help children in need pre schools support parents in laying a strong foundation for children by helping to develop children is cognitive language social and emotional skills therefore we are spending more to enhance the accessibility affordability and quality of early childhood education and care the government spent about $1000000000 on the pre school sector in 2018 this is more than twofive times of the $360000000 that we spent back in just 2012 and this support continues throughout the schooling years the government subsidizes over ninety of the total cost of educating our children this means that a child entering primary school in 2018 will receive over $130000 in education subsidies by the time he or she completes secondary education children from lower income families get even more support for example through the recently enhanced m zero e financial assistance scheme we have been doing more to better support children from disadvantaged backgrounds by intervening earlier with new forms of proactive and targeted support one such effort is kidstart kidstart practitioners pre schools and community partners work together to provide health learning and developmental support for children and their families since the pilot began in 2016 more than 900 families have been supported by kidstart last year we set up the uplifting pupils in life and inspiring families taskforce uplift this taskforce will pilot upstream interventions and partner communities to help disadvantaged children and their families to ensure that no child is left behind a recent initiative is the uplift scholarship for independent schools this will provide a monetary award of $800 per year for eligible lower income students in independent schools to cover their out of pocket expenses the taskforce is also looking at how to strengthen after school care and support for disadvantaged students in school based student care centers the minister for education will speak more about this and other initiatives spurred by uplift at the cos our support for singaporeans continues into their working lives workfare and silver support are two key pillars of our social security systems the two schemes supplement incomes and mitigate inequality in the working and retirement years respectively the workfare income supplement wis scheme provides cash payouts and cpf top ups for workers whose earnings are in the bottom twenty with some support for those slightly above the scheme has raised their income encouraged employment and help them save more for retirement we will enhance workfare income supplement to better support lower wage workers from january 2020 the qualifying income cap will be raised from the current $2000 to $2300 per month the maximum annual payouts will also be increased by up to $400 older workers will see higher increases in payouts for example workers aged sixty and earning $1200 a month will now receive $4000 per year from the workfare income supplement or almost thirty of their wages these enhancements will cost an additional $206000000 a year in total we expect the enhanced workfare income supplement to cost close to $1000000000 a year and benefit almost 440000 singaporeans as our society ages older workers will make up an increasing share of our workforce today about one in four of our workforce is aged 55 and above they continue to make important contributions to our economy and society some are giving back by mentoring the younger generations while others wish to continue working we are doing more to help older singaporeans earn more save more and have greater peace of mind during their retirement years i appreciate the concerns and suggestions regarding the retirement adequacy of older workers raised by members of the public and the p a p seniors group among others and i thank the members of this house for your views during the recent debate on the motions on aging with purpose and support for caregivers the government has set up a tripartite workgroup to study the concerns of older workers the workgroup is reviewing policies such as the retirement and re employment age and the cpf contribution rates of older workers they will present their recommendations later this year to support employers in hiring older singaporean workers the government introduced the special employment credit or s e c scheme in 2011 since then we have extended and made changes to the s e c in response to labor market and economic conditions we have also introduced an additional s e c or a s e c scheme to encourage employers to hire workers who are above the re employment age i am happy that companies have responded by hiring older workers tapping on their experiences and supporting them in upgrading their skills with a tighter labor market and more singaporeans choosing to work longer more companies will be hiring older workers the government will study better forms of support to continue to help workers to remain productive earn more and save more for retirement we will review the relevance and structure of the s e c and a s e c in tandem with the recommendations from the tripartite workgroup on older workers in the meantime i will extend the s e c and a s e c for another year until 31st december 2020 to support this extension i will top up the s e c fund by $366000000 taken together members will see that the government has been making significant investments in education and employment for our people from early childhood to the working years our aim is to help singaporeans fulfill their potential at each stage of life we are improving the lives of our people by enabling them to be the best that they can be we enhance our people is sense of well being and dignity without the burden of welfare schemes elsewhere which weaken people is sense of agency and independence as more singaporeans enter their senior years healthcare needs will grow over the years we have implemented major changes to make healthcare more affordable accessible and comprehensive we have also been providing greater social support within the community to help seniors stay active through programs such as the p a wellness program and the community networks for seniors our 2nd social strategy is to provide greater healthcare assurance 1st doctors at our neighborhood clinics provide primary care that is easily accessible this helps us stay healthy to enhance access we will make it more affordable to consult doctors in our neighborhoods we introduced the community health assist scheme chas in 2012 chas subsidizes subsidies help lower to middle income families by making primary care and basic dental care at clinics near their homes more affordable over 97 of existing chas and pioneer generation cardholders have access to more than one chas clinic within ten minutes from their homes we will enhance chas subsidies at gp clinics in three ways as the prime minister announced at the national day rally last year we will extend chas to cover all singaporeans for chronic conditions regardless of income 2nd lower to middle income singaporeans who are chas orange cardholders currently receive chas subsidies for chronic conditions only we will extend subsidies for common illnesses to this group 3rd we will increase the subsidies for complex chronic conditions chas makes it possible for more singaporeans to turn to gp clinics near their homes to manage their chronic conditions but we must also put in the measures to ensure that chas clinics are delivering good outcomes to this end the ministry of health will be looking at how to help chas clinics better track their patients progress and outcomes in a similar vein m zero h will also review its clinical guidelines for care provided at chas dental clinics to ensure that the care delivered is appropriate to the needs of the patient with these changes we expect to pay out more than $200000000 a year in chas subsidies the minister for health will provide more details on these changes at the cos a 2nd way to provide greater healthcare assurance is that we will strengthen financial protection for long term care as we age the chances of having one form of disability or another rises significantly m zero h estimates that one in two healthy singaporeans aged 65 could become severely disabled in their lifetime and may need long term care some of us face a higher risk some lower but regardless low risk does not mean no risk the best way of protecting ourselves is to lead a healthy lifestyle and take preventive actions at the same time we need to guard against unpredictable events the most efficient way is to help one another by pooling risk through an insurance scheme today we have medishield life for all singaporeans to provide financial protection against large hospital bills for life as we live longer there is a higher chance that we will need long term care towards the end of our lives we need to prepare for this the ministry of health has announced that you you will be introducing the new careshield life from 2020 an enhancement of the current eldershield scheme careshield life will provide lifetime coverage with higher monthly payouts of at least $600 a month for those who become severely disabled this offsets the costs of long term care for individuals and their families the government will provide subsidies and premium support to ensure that careshield life premiums are affordable we will also offer participation incentives for existing cohorts born in 1979 or earlier to join careshield life so that they are better protected should they need care in the future careshield life will offer much greater peace of mind for singaporeans in addition we will also launch elderfund next year to help severely disabled lower income singaporeans who need additional financial support for long term care this includes those who might not be able to join careshield life or have low medisave balances the cost of long term care is not only high but will increase as our population ages last year i earmarked $2000000000 for premium subsidies and other forms of support for singaporeans this year i will set aside another $3100000000 the government will put this $5100000000 into a new long term care support fund this will help fund the careshield life subsidies and other long term care support measures such as elderfund this is a significant commitment to help singaporeans with their long term care needs as the prime minister mentioned at the national day rally last year and the tribute event earlier this month we would also like to express our appreciation and support for our merdeka generation the merdeka generation is a resilient and independent generation they played a critical role in our nation is development the merdeka generation was among the earliest batches to serve national service build up our public services and modernize our economy they came together to forge our multi cultural multi racial society one member of the merdeka generation is ms barbara d cotta ms d cotta started work as a special education teacher at the age of nineteen to help support her mother in 1984 she was among the 1st batch of teachers to attain a certificate in special education throughout her life she continued learning and completed her bachelor in special education in 2016 at the age of 57 today she is a specialized teacher for students with hearing deficiencies and a volunteer interpreter she is also pursuing her master of special education she is an excellent example of lifelong learning and giving i am glad to have met ms d cotta and many others who built our nation at our merdeka generation tribute event they continue to be an active generation contributing in their various capacities at work in the community caring for their families and learning something new the merdeka generation package is a gesture of our nation is gratitude for their contributions and a way to show care for them in their silver years it will provide them better peace of mind over future healthcare costs while helping them to stay active and healthy the merdeka generation package or m g p comprises five key benefits 1st to support their active lifestyles all merdeka generation seniors will receive a one time $100 top up to their p a passion silver cards they can use this to pay for activities and facilities at the community clubs entry to public swimming pools public transport and more we will also work to introduce more active aging opportunities for seniors such as lifelong learning under the national silver academy and volunteerism under the silver volunteer fund 2nd we will provide a medisave top up of $200 per year for five years this will start from this year until 2023 this will help them save more for their healthcare needs this is on top of the g s t voucher medisave top ups that eligible seniors aged 65 and above receive every year 3rd m g seniors will receive additional subsidies for outpatient care for life you will receive special chas subsidies for common illnesses chronic conditions and dental procedures the subsidy rates will be higher than the chas blue subsidies all m g seniors will receive these enhanced subsidies regardless of income including those who do not have a chas card today at polyclinics and public specialist outpatient clinics they will receive 25 off their subsidized bills this is on top of the prevailing subsidies available 4th m g seniors will have additional medishield life premium subsidies for life all m g seniors will receive subsidies for their premiums starting from five of their medishield life premiums and increasing to ten after they reach 75 years of age this is on top of the means tested subsidies that lower to middle income singaporeans are already receiving finally we will provide an additional participation incentive of $1500 for m g seniors who join careshield life when it becomes available for existing cohorts in 2021 in addition to the $2500 previously announced this means that all m g seniors who join careshield life who join careshield life will receive participation incentives totalling $4000 each this will cover a significant portion of their premiums and is on top of the regular means tested premium subsidies i hope this will encourage our m g seniors to join careshield life to have peace of mind against the risk of high long term care costs there are a number of other details which i will include in the annex and will be given to the medium the merdeka generation package will benefit close to 500000 singaporeans those born in the 1950s and who obtained citizenship by 1996 will be eligible for the m g p in addition we will extend the m g p benefits to those born in 1949 or earlier but missed out on the pioneer generation package if they obtained citizenship by 1996 all eligible seniors will receive the m g p benefits regardless of their income they will be notified by april 2019 and will receive their merdeka generation cards starting from june 2019 the minister for health will provide further details and the implementation timeline for the m g p benefits at the c zero s the merdeka generation is aged sixty to 69 today singaporeans lifespans are increasing our life expectancy is now 84eight years this is good news it means the merdeka generation will be able to enjoy the benefits for many years the ministry of finance and m zero h in sizing the budget for these benefits have taken this into account we estimate that the package will cost over $8000000000 in current dollars over the merdeka generation is lifetimes this budget i will set aside $6100000000 for a new merdeka generation fund with interest accumulated over time this will cover the full projected costs of the merdeka generation package the merdeka generation will enjoy many key healthcare benefits for life we hope that this will go some way in providing greater peace of mind for the merdeka generation and their families this is a significant commitment by the government it is important that the government of the day continues to monitor the patterns and cost of healthcare utilization and life expectancy over the next thirty years or more so that the government is able to meet this commitment to better prepare for increasing lifespans we should encourage everyone to set aside something for the future to help singaporeans who are younger than the merdeka generation with their future healthcare expenses i will provide medisave top up of $100 a year for the next five years for singaporeans who are aged fifty and above in 2019 and who do not receive the m g p or p g p this is a generation who are even younger and healthier and i hope that everyone will make the extra effort to stay active and healthy our 3rd social strategy is to foster a community of care and contribution and build strong partnerships in our society the government will continue to make every effort to care for our seniors the disadvantaged and vulnerable families the long term care assistance scheme provides basic monthly cash assistance to those who are permanently unable to work and have little family support to support their living expenses additional assistance is provided for households with additional needs such as medical supplies we will raise the cash assistance rates for this scheme for example a two person household who are both on long term who are both on comcare long term assistance will receive an additional $130 a month this brings the total cash assistance to $1000 a month the minister for social and family development will provide more details at the c zero s to help government pensioners who draw lower pensions we will increase the singapore allowance and monthly pension ceiling by $twenty per month each to $320 and $1250 respectively this will benefit about 9300 pensioners working alongside the government individuals non profit organizations and corporates have all been playing their part contributing their skills their time and their hearts as we reflect on our history and culture in this bicentennial year let us we see this spirits of helping one another as a community in action over time in the past our forefathers who arrived in singapore banded together mainly within their ethnic groups forming various clans and associations as the support of the government then was inadequate today i am glad that this spirit extends across ethnic and religious lines in our society in the last few months we have received many good suggestions from members of the public on cultivating this community spirit to help those in need as our society ages and new needs emerge we hope everyone will lend a helping hand one good example is mister shaleem khamalluden and his friends from pals singapore pals stands for peace and love society a non profit organization that provides a support network for singaporean youths from all backgrounds through sports events and workshops shaleem and other like minded volunteers have been helping young singaporeans learn skills to overcome challenges such as bullying and cyber addiction to date they have touched the lives of about 800 youths another example is doctor rose sivam who started my home your home with her husband as the chef rose and her family bring together people from various backgrounds including those with disabilities and children with special needs to share a meal in her home this is another good example of our community spirit how we care for the less privileged and build unity in our diversity i am heartened that many other singaporeans too have stepped forward in their own ways to make a difference within their community and i encourage everyone to do their part i spoke about the s g cares movement at last year is budget it seeks to bring together the public people and private sectors in partnership create a greater collective impact and grow as a community of care and contribution this year we continue to build on the s g cares movement we will have three measures to mobilize our people across all age groups and across the public private and people sectors 1st growing the spirit of volunteerism in our youth many of our secondary school students are already active volunteers and are giving back to the community we want to sustain this momentum as they move to i h l s and later into the workplace we are working with youth corps singapore to nurture youth community leaders in our i h l s who can in turn rally their peers to be involved in the community on a sustained basis 2nd our seniors have an abundance of skills and experience to make meaningful contributions to enable more of them to do so we will work with community partners and companies to encourage volunteerism among older workers this will enable our seniors to stay active and contribute to the community at work and when they retire 3rd the government is encouraging all public officers to volunteer under the public service cares initiative today each ministry has a senior officer appointed as the giving ambassador to champion volunteerism more than 85 of public officers are making monthly donations going forward public service cares will strengthen capabilities in corporate social responsibility and create larger scale and sustained voluntary volunteering opportunities for public officers across agencies for example they can take part in house visits to share healthcare and active aging schemes or guide seniors in mobile devices at digital clinics this will also help public service officers to better understand citizens needs and co deliver services with the people and private sectors this is the public service is contribution to the s g cares movement the minister for culture community and youth will be sharing more on s g cares at the c zero s the spirit of giving back has a special meaning this year as we commemorate the singapore bicentennial therefore i will launch two special initiatives in support of this 1st i will set aside $200000000 for a bicentennial community fund today we encourage individuals and corporates to give back to the community in various ways donations to institutions of a public character qualify for a 250 tax deduction businesses also enjoy a 250 tax deduction on qualifying expenditure when their employees volunteer or provide services to i p c s under the business and i p c partnership scheme the new bicentennial community fund will provide dollar for dollar matching for donations made to i p c s in financial year 2019 with this we hope to further encourage more singaporeans including younger singaporeans to embrace the spirit of giving back at the same time we are encouraging i p c s to reach out to more donors the fund will be designed to ensure a good distribution of support for all donations to i p c s which currently do not receive government matching and to increase the impact of the good work they are doing we have also enhanced our one stop platform giving dot s g to better match donors and volunteers with meaningful causes this platform provides charities with an easy and secure way to establish an online presence and to receive donations digitally donors too can quickly navigate and find a worthy cause that matches their passion and commitment and start on their giving journey details will be shared by the ministry of culture community and youth at a later date 2nd i will introduce a $1100000000 bicentennial bonus from time to time when our finances allow we share the surpluses with singaporeans and provide more help to those with specific needs with this bonus i hope all singaporeans young and old will join us to commemorate this significant moment in singapore is history the bicentennial bonus has several components for lower income singaporeans i will provide additional help with their daily living expenses i will provide up to $300 through a g s t voucher cash bicentennial payment this will benefit 1400000 singaporeans in addition lower income workers who receive workfare income supplement payments will get a workfare bicentennial bonus they will receive an additional ten of their wis payment for work done in 2018th with a minimum payment of $100 this will be given in cash i will provide a fifty personal income tax rebate subject to a cap of $200 for the year of assessment 2019 i set the cap at $200 so that the benefits go mostly to middle income earners for parents with school going children we will provide additional support for their children is education each year the government contributes to the edusave accounts of all singaporean students at primary and secondary school levels this helps to pay for school enrichment activities to better develop students holistically this year we will provide a $150 top up to their edusave accounts this is on top of the annual edusave contributions that they already receive from the government in addition singaporeans aged seventeen to twenty will receive up to $500 in their post secondary education accounts this will go towards helping parents to save for their children is tertiary education we will also provide support additional support for older singaporeans who are near retirement i will provide a cpf top up of up to $1000 for eligible singaporeans aged fifty to 64 years old in 2019 who have less than $60000 of retirement savings in their cpf accounts this will be credited into the special account for members aged fifty to 54 and the retirement account for members aged 55 to 64 about 300000 singaporeans will benefit from this cpf top up the majority of these recipients will be women many of them left the workforce early and took up important roles as mothers caregivers or housewives as a result they had fewer years to build up their savings this top up is a way to recognize their contributions and to help them save more in addition to the cpf top up singaporeans in the age group of fifty to 64 who qualify for workfare will also benefit from the workfare income supplement enhancements that i mentioned earlier most of those in the sixty to 64 age group will also receive the merdeka generation package while the rest will receive the five year medisave top ups these are all on top of the targeted benefits such as the g s t voucher together we hope that these measures will provide greater peace of mind for our older workers now and later in their silver years in addition to the special bicentennial initiatives we will provide another year of service and conservancy charges rebates s n c c rebate to h d b households eligible singaporean households will receive s n c c rebates of between onefive and threefive months this will cost $132000000 and benefit about 930000 households finally i will top up the public transport fund by $10000000 to continue helping commuters in need with their transport expenses such as through public transport vouchers for lower income families the government keeps a close watch on the cost of living over the years we have done much to alleviate cost pressures whether in healthcare education or day to day expenses good macro economic management has enabled us to keep inflation low while the singapore dollar has been strengthening over time many singaporeans who go on overseas vacations would appreciate this over and above these favorable conditions this budget continues to provide significant support for singaporeans especially our seniors and lower income households budget 2019 supports the government is long term strategy to build a caring and inclusive society this is our continued effort to improve the lives of our people and our future generations today our shining little red dot can hold its own on the global stage but as the minister for national development has said we are not done building singapore infrastructure takes time to build but once built can serve us for a long time we must take a long view for our development plans the upcoming ura master plan 2019 will guide our urban developments over a ten to fifteen year time frame it ensures that our limited land can be optimized to meet the needs of current and future generations the minister for national development will share more details at the c zero s the long term transformation of our city must start with our h d b estates where most singaporeans homes are it is important that we keep our living environment 1st class many cities have large tracts that slip into disrepair over time we must avoid that we must strive to make every town in singapore green and liveable by rejuvenating them systematically over time as our home and a global node our city has to be well connected within and with the world within singapore we now have about 230 kilometers of m r t lines this will rise to about 360 kilometers in the twenty thirtie when major m r t projects such as the cross island line are completed to enhance to enhance our global connectivity we are increasing the capacities of our airport and sea port this will strengthen our role as a key node within asia and to the world connecting to future growth knowledge and cultural centers in asia and beyond will not only benefit singaporeans but also add to the connectivity and vibrancy in our region beyond the next decade we must also plan for climate change climate change and rising sea levels threaten our very existence as a low lying island nation there is nowhere to hide when sea levels rise other small island nations like the maldives are already facing the risk of flooding with severe implications the government is studying the implications carefully and will come up with measures to prepare ourselves adequately our climate action plan which was launched in 2016 sets out the strategy for mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change especially on our infrastructure in line with the action plan low lying roads near coastal areas have been raised changi airport terminal five will also be built at fivefive meters above mean sea level the use of polders and dikes is already being piloted on pulau tekong these will help us to learn how to deal with rising sea levels to protect ourselves against climate change and rising sea levels we will have to invest more together with existing infrastructure needs our total bill for infrastructure will increase significantly it is very difficult to project spending needs way into the future but the different ministries have done some preliminary estimates we will continue to do our best to look forward develop fiscal plans well in advance and put in place the right approach to finance such long lived major infrastructure each generation should contribute its fair share tackling climate change requires global cooperation singapore is committed to doing our part it is the responsible thing to do for our children and future generations the carbon tax will be applied on this year is emissions this is an important signal to companies and households to reduce emissions and adopt energy efficient practices as individuals we too must change our way and work towards becoming a zero waste nation by adopting the three r s reducing consumption reusing and recycling the zero waste masterplan will be launched in the 2nd half of this year among other issues it will look at better management of food waste e waste and packaging waste including plastics the minister for the environment and water resources will provide more details at the c zero s given our dense urban environment air quality and greenery are especially important nparks has done an excellent job in greening singapore our island has more than forty green cover this improves our living environment and our air quality but diesel exhaust is highly pollutive and adversely affects our people is health and quality of life many cities in europe have announced restrictions on diesel vehicle usage we have taken steps to discourage diesel consumption over the years we have implemented schemes to encourage early renewal of diesel commercial goods vehicles and to also account for the impact of vehicular emissions we have seen positive results more owners are shifting towards more environmentally friendly engines such as electric hybrids we are glad to see a drop in the numbers of new diesel cars and taxis registered we also restructured diesel taxes in 2017 to shift away from an annual amount of tax towards a usage based tax system we permanently reduced the annual special tax on diesel cars and taxis and re introduced the volumetric diesel duty to continue the restructuring of diesel taxes i will raise the excise duty for diesel by ¢ten per liter to ¢twenty per liter this takes immediate effect at the same time i will permanently reduce the annual special tax on diesel taxis by $850 i strongly urge taxi companies to pass on the savings to their drivers like they did in 2017 this will on average reduce the impact of the duty increase by more than three quarters for taxis i will also permanently reduce the special tax on diesel cars by $100 this will on average reduce the impact by more than half to help businesses adjust i will provide a 100 road tax rebate for one year and partial road tax rebate for another two years for commercial diesel vehicles i will also provide over three years additional cash rebates of up to $3200 for diesel buses ferrying school children building a more sustainable environment makes our quality of life better and also creates economic opportunities just as we closed the water loop we can now turn our attention to closing the waste loop we are already there are already start ups tackling this challenge two companies ugly good and tria have been working on innovative ways to convert food related waste into useful products these are good examples of opportunities in our zero waste movement so i hope to see more of such initiatives in the coming years our beautiful living environment can also be enhanced through the smart use of technology as a part of our smart nation efforts to reduce energy use we have implemented district cooling in the marina bay area to improve our quality of life we have started rolling out pneumatic waste collection and trialed smart urban mobility solutions buildings can also be designed to be environmentally friendly for example by being energy efficient and producing enough renewable energy to run itself b c a was the 1st to retrofit its academy in 2009 making it the 1st retrofitted net zero energy building in south east asia this year n u s s school of design and environment launched s d e four a brand new net zero energy building these initiatives contribute towards making our environment more sustainable and pleasant the national research foundation will continue to fund research and innovation in urban solutions and sustainability our public housing policies have also been uniquely successful because of our long term planning today we are not just building new flats we are improving the quality of life for singaporeans through the rejuvenation of our public housing estates our plans for the rejuvenation and renewal of our city includes the home improvement program the neighborhood renewal program and the remaking our heartland initiative for the longer term we have announced h i p two and the voluntary early redevelopment scheme vers these are plans that will keep our living environment 1st class over the coming years the minister for national development will be sharing more on these plans to build endearing homes for our people at the c zero s singapore is ability to plan for the long term is our strategic advantage but the best laid plans to develop our people and transform our city can only be realized with a sound fiscal plan our fiscal discipline and prudence gave us the resources to respond decisively to unexpected challenges such as the 2008 global financial crisis we must not take this for granted while our nation is needs are growing significantly we must continue to take a disciplined and prudent approach we will pursue new investments using a differentiated fiscal strategy taking one approach for major infrastructure investments and another for recurrent social and security expenditures 1st infrastructure investments some of these are major long term projects such as the development of changi east and rail projects such as the cross island line others such as infrastructure to protect us against climate change are contingent on the future state of the world it is challenging to predict their exact timing and requirements for these large and lumpy expenditures where the benefits span many generations of singaporeans paying for them through some borrowing is fairer and more efficient borrowing done in a responsible and sustainable manner will help instill financial discipline and distribute the share of funding more equitably across current and future generations in the 1980s the government borrowed to build our 1st m r t lines our statutory boards and government owned companies have also continued to finance many major infrastructure projects through borrowings for the development of changi east the changi airport group will be taking up loans to fund its share of the infrastructure investments to lower financing costs the government with the president is concurrence will provide a guarantee for changi east borrowings this allows us to tap on the strength of the government is balance sheet to back this strategic investment this lowers the cost of borrowing the government is further studying the option of using government debt as part of the financing financing mix for long term infrastructure projects that the government will be taking on directly 2nd for recurrent spending needs in areas such as healthcare pre school education and security we must recognize that these are necessary expenditures to take care of our elderly give our children a good start in life and keep singapore safe and secure for our families many countries have taken the easier route by funding these recurrent expenditures through borrowing we must not do this as such borrowing shifts the burden of paying for today is needs onto future generations that is not the singapore way a fairer and more robust approach is to meet recurrent spending with recurrent revenues hence we must continually review our tax system to ensure its resilience g s t is a broad based tax that contributes significantly to our fiscal resources last year i mentioned the introduction of g s t on imported services to make sure g s t contribution collections remain fair and resilient in a digital economy this year i will tighten the g s t import relief for travelers giving rising international travel given rising international travel for travelers who spend less than 48 hours outside singapore the value of goods bought overseas that can enjoy g s t relief will be reduced from $150 to $100 for travelers who spend 48 hours or more outside singapore the relief quantum will be reduced from $600 to $500 this will take effect from tomorrow i will also tighten the alcohol duty free concession for travelers from three liters to two liters this will take effect from 1st april 2019 as i had announced at the previous budget we will raise gst by two percentage points sometime in the period from 2021 to 2025 when we raise g s t we will ensure that our overall system of taxes and transfers remains progressive and fair we will continue to absorb g s t on publicly subsidized education and healthcare we will provide more help to lower income households and the elderly by enhancing the permanent g s t voucher scheme we will also cushion the impact of the g s t increase for a period through a g s t offset package lower and middle income households will get more more details will be announced later notwithstanding the need to raise revenues in the future at the core of our fiscal system is our commitment to keep the overall tax burden low we want workers and firms to keep as much as possible of what they earn this leaves our citizens free to choose how they spend save or invest our main indirect tax the g s t is not high by international standards even after the planned increase to nine the oecd average is nineteen among asia pacific countries many have standard g s t rates that exceed nine ultimately a competitive tax regime helps us to attract and retain investments and talent these in turn help to bring in good jobs for singaporeans a competitive tax regime is a key anchor to our economic growth and the best way to sustainably increase tax revenues i will extend and strengthen tax incentives to enhance our business competitiveness at the same time i will make some adjustments to further enhance the progressivity and resilience of our tax system the details of these changes are in the annex the government will continue to plan ahead for the long term my commitment to singaporeans is that our overall taxes and transfers system will always remain fair progressive and pro growth let me now summarize our overall budget position for financial year 2018 we expect an overall budget surplus of $2100000000 or zerofour of gdp this is a 2700000000 increase from the zerosix $600000000 deficit forecasted a year ago this was due to the unexpected two year suspension of the kuala lumpur singapore high speed rail project and higher than expected stamp duty collections when we exclude the government is top ups to funds and net investment returns contribution from past reserves we expect a basic deficit of $7000000000 or onefour of gdp financial year 2018 was hence an expansionary budget for 2019 our budget position remains expansionary with a basic deficit of $7100000000 ministries total expenditures are expected to be $80300000000 onesix higher than in financial year 2018 we are setting aside funds to meet singaporeans long term needs including $6100000000 for the merdeka generation package and $5100000000 for long term care support on the whole we expect an overall budget deficit of $3500000000 or zeroseven of gdp we have sufficient fiscal surplus accumulated over this term of government to fund the overall deficit in financial year 2019 there is no draw on past reserves mister speaker sir i will now conclude 1st i would like to thank the many singaporeans as well as businesses unions charities and community organizations who have provided your feedback and ideas special thanks to the talented students from nanyang polytechnic for the beautiful sketches that you see in my slides today we commemorate 2019 our bicentennial year to learn from our past in order to chart our future we will have many opportunities to reflect and share in the coming months and years but three lessons stand out for me and my colleagues 1st for as long as we stay relevant and useful singapore and singaporeans will have our place in the world we must develop deep capabilities stay open and connected and draw ideas and talents from around the globe singaporean talents have been making their mark in various fields and connecting with other highly skilled individuals from around the world will make our team even stronger 2nd external events around us will shape and re shape our lives our people have shown time and again that we can take the long view adapt with the times and thrive 3rd we draw strength from our diversity by focusing on what we have in common in the earlier years our forefathers clustered around ethnic and religious groups to support one another today singaporeans support one another regardless of race language or religion budget 2019 draws on these key lessons we build on our multi cultural heritage to foster a caring and inclusive society we continue to nurture our young and develop our people on a lifelong basis we seek to take better care of our seniors so that they can stay active and healthy we will partner businesses and workers to transform our economy we welcome the best m n c s and s m e s from around the world and help our start ups and s m e s to grow scale and internationalize we will help our workers deepen their capabilities and seek new opportunities to catch the wave of the 4th industrial revolution we are positioning singapore as a global asia node of technology innovation and enterprise the changes ahead will be faster and deeper budget 2019 highlights the key challenges we are facing and how we are preparing to ride on the changes to turn challenges into opportunities for singaporeans and for our partners in the global community we are investing to keep singapore safe and secure we are restructuring our economy to enable our businesses and workers to thrive we are building a more caring and inclusive society and we are building singapore as a global home as a global city and a home for all even as we invest more budget 2019 maintains our fiscal discipline our institution of the elected president and the council of presidential advisors ensure that the government of the day does not squander the reserves our forefathers have left for us the government will ensure that we abide by this we must not only take care of this generation but our children and their children it is a core value we must uphold budget 2019 lays out this government is approach to build a strong united singapore we nurture our young take care of our seniors expand opportunities for our people to be at their best and to live in a liveable endearing home secure and globally connected together in close partnership with all in our public people and private sectors

            "prediction": "mister speaker sir i beg to move that parliament approves the financial policy of the government for the financial year from one april 2019 to 31 march 2020 this year marks 200 years since the stanford reifers landed in singapore archaeological finds and records show that singapore is history stretches back at least 700 years serving as a trading emporium in the region 1819 was a key turning point in singapore is development the british decision to declare singapore a free port plugged us into an emerging network of global trade this and subsequent developments transformed singapore into a global node in our bicentennial year let us reflect on the twists and turns in our history so as to chart the path forward for an even better future for our people today we are in a different phase of globalization with new forces reshaping the global environment in last year is budget statement i mentioned three major shifts the shift in global economic weight towards asia rapid technological advancements and changing demographic patterns a 4th major force that is gaining prominence is the decline in support for globalization some countries are benefiting from globalization while others are questioning its value these four major forces are interacting in complex ways at the global regional and national levels on the global stage the trade frictions between the us and china are developing into a deeper strategic competition of strength and of governance systems this is raising geopolitical uncertainty closer to home asean has enjoyed over fifty years of peace and stability with bright economic prospects together the ten economies of asean are projected to become the 4th largest in the world by 2030 with the size of the middle class doubling innovation and entrepreneurship are also thriving in recent years southeast asia has grown several new unicorns or companies malaysia has grown several new unicorns or companies with valuations in excess of us one 1000000000 working together asean nations can maximize our potential but closely connected neighbors will have occasional differences a couple of issues have surfaced recently with malaysia when such differences occur singaporeans must stay united as a people and present our positions firmly and calmly we have worked through difficult bilateral issues with our neighbors in the past based on mutual respect and common interests and in accordance with international laws and norms singapore will continue to seek to resolve issues in the same spirit domestically we need to address longer term challenges including aging social mobility and inequality economic transformation and climate change the changing global and domestic landscape presents both challenges and opportunities we will continue to chart our way forward confidently in the singapore way building on our distinct strengths and our singaporean dna we must respond to challenges with grit and determination there were episodes in the centuries of singapore is history where our island is fortunes waned due to external forces these are sobering reminders that we have to constantly build up our security and resilience and plan long term singapore is success has roots in our port which thrives on openness and connectivity these traits have been forged into our identity as a people as a multicultural society our openness to diversity is our strength it has inculcated a global mindset and deepened our knowledge of asia we must continue to cultivate cross cultural literacy among our youths and encourage them to build bridges with people across the world we strive to be a place where people and ideas congregate at the frontiers of global development we want to be a global asia node of technology innovation and enterprise we turn our size and strategic location into an advantage technological shifts have spread economic activities more widely and at the same time made cities more important as key nodes of enterprise and innovation as a city state we are nimbler and can adapt to changes faster we serve as a neutral trusted node in key spheres of global activity like sun can chiu the small but quick witted mouse deer we can make our way in the world children the small but quick witted mouse deer we can make our way in the world budget 2019 is a strategic plan to allocate resources to build a strong united singapore in this bicentennial year let us draw on our strengths and our singaporean dna openness multiculturalism and self determination to continue to progress at a fundamental level we must keep singapore safe and secure this allows us to preserve our way of life and forge our own destiny we must continue to transform our economy for only a vibrant and innovative economy can provide opportunities for our people to realize their potential we must continue to build a caring and inclusive society where we look out for one another and all of us play our part in weaving a tightly knit social fabric and we must continue to build singapore as a global city and home for all keeping it smart sustainable and globally connected last but not least we must achieve these goals in a responsible and fiscally sustainable way we are using our financial resources to help realize our strategies for a strong united singapore but financial resources alone do not get us there we call on all singaporeans to partner with the government and support one another to succeed in this endeavor a safe and secure singapore gives us the confidence to chart an independent course but we cannot take our peace prosperity and stability for granted singapore is vulnerable to the fluctuations in our region and the world against an increasingly uncertain geopolitical environment our commitments to defense and security cannot waver diplomacy and deterrence are the twin pillars of our approach the ministry of foreign affairs works continuously to build good relations with our neighbors and the major powers and to promote rules based international order with international laws and norms a strong saf lends weight to our diplomatic efforts and ensures that negotiations with singapore are taken seriously should diplomacy fail we must stand ready to safeguard our interests and defend ourselves the home team also works round the clock alongside other security agencies to ensure a safe environment for all we now have the cyber security agency of singapore leading our efforts to protect our critical information infrastructure from cyber threats and to create a secure cyberspace for businesses and communities these are fundamental to our sovereignty our success and to safeguarding our vital interests singapore is one of the safest cities in the world our crime rates are consistently low but we must not be complacent security threats are evolving and becoming more complex a strong saf remains a bulgur against threats to our way of life terrorism threats to singapore life terrorism threats to singapore remain high we continue to detect individuals in singapore who have been radicalized by terrorist propaganda globally we see a rise in attacks perpetrated by radicalized individuals and cells such attacks are hard to prevent we must stay vigilant beyond fiscal threats malicious cyber activities are growing the network nature of our society has enhanced connectivity but this can be exploited to disrupt and divide society through cyber attacks the spread of falsehoods or other means in particular foreign actors will try to influence our domestic affairs and politics this is not new but new technologies have made it easier for others to mount attacks and with greater ease and intensity and with more sophisticated tactics to stay ahead of this stress we must continue to innovate and build new capabilities to meet our security needs both the public and private sectors have a major role to play the ministry of home affairs will set up a home team science and technology agency by the end of this year to develop science and technology capabilities to support the home team is operational needs these capabilities will strengthen the home team is ability to carry out its mission of safeguarding singapore the minister for home affairs will speak more about this at the committee of supply the private security industry has been stepping up efforts a good example is certis which has redesigned its business processes infusing technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence to deal with security threats mha will help to transform the private security industry through innovation and technology to meet growing needs and be an effective partner to the home team our total defense approach will continue to keep singapore safe and secure with every singaporean playing a part at the national level we plan long term and take measures such as stockpiling critical supplies diversifying our sources of water supply and strengthening our food security as a people we must have the psychological and emotional resilience to face crises stoically as threats get more sophisticated singaporeans must stay vigilant and guard against non conventional forces that threaten to divide us national service has forged a deep understanding in our people that each and every one of us has a duty to defend our nation when our young people serve ns families and employers support them in every way possible with our smart nation drive digital technology has become an integral part of our lives to harness the digital advantage we must be prepared to also deal with the threats that arise inevitably from its more pervasive use digital defense has now been incorporated as the 6th pillar of total defense like the other pillars of total defense digital defense involves everyone individuals community groups businesses and the government we must all play our part to be secure alert and responsible online be it through practicing good cyber hygienes being vigilant against fake news and helping one another use technology safely last year mindef launched the cyber national servicemen scheme training national servicemen with the singapore institute of technology to raise our cyber defense capability the government is also engaging our tech community with programs such as the government bug bounty program to achieve a higher level of collective cyber security given its strategic significance the government will continue to invest a significant share of our resources about thirty of our total expenditure this year to support our defense security and diplomacy efforts this spending is significant but indispensable we will invest more if the need arises to protect the sovereignty of singapore and the well being of singaporeans everyone has a role to play to keep singapore safe and secure let us continue to stay united in defending our home and our way of life a vibrant and innovative economy provides our people with the opportunities to realize their potential and to have a better life our efforts to transform our economy are bearing fruit in tandem with the global expansion the singapore economy grew threetwo in 2018 good growth is translated into good outcomes for our workers over the past five years the real median income of singaporeans has grown by threesix per year global growth is expected to moderate in 2019 while uncertainties and downside risks in the global economy have increased over the years our sound monetary and fiscal policies have enabled us to weather global economic crises and keep inflation stable this provides a stable environment for investors to make long term investment decisions beyond maintaining a supportive macroeconomic environment we need to build a sound microeconomic foundation so that resources can be allocated to their best possible uses and to undertake structural reforms to enable our workers and firms to adapt and stay competitive every firm and every worker will need to work differently master new skills and use technology well and we must continue to create new opportunities including through partnerships with others in budget 2016 we launched the industry transformation maps or itms which drive transformation at the company industry and economy wide levels each itm integrates four key pillars of transformation jobs and skills innovation internationalization and productivity these are mutually reinforcing pillars to maximize impact to coordinate efforts the future economy council brings together leaders from the government industry trade associations and chambers unions and academia after three years of intensive work i am glad that all 23 itms have been launched covering about eighty of our economy we are seeing good progress aided by the global economic upturn in recent years productivity as measured by real value added per actual hour worked grew threesix per year in the last three years higher than the onesix per annum growth recorded in the preceding three years from 2012 to 2015 in particular we have seen strong performance by outward oriented sectors such as manufacturing while others like construction and some services industries continue to show weaker productivity growth but this is a continuing journey there is much more we can do especially in sectors like domestic services we must press on let me now outline three key thrusts in this budget to support industry transformation 1st building deep enterprise capabilities 2nd building deep worker capabilities capabilities 2nd building deep worker capabilities 3rd encouraging strong partnerships within singapore and across the world the basic building blocks of a vibrant economy are strong competitive companies that maximize value creation hence the 1st thrust is to support the building of deep enterprise capabilities companies at different stages of growth have different needs the leadership of each company is in the best position to lead and drive changes while agencies can provide support at each stage of growth a vibrant start up ecosystem encourages budding entrepreneurs to try out their business ideas such an ecosystem enables entrepreneurs to connect to mentors prospective business partners customers and investors two years ago we launched startup sg to provide holistic support for startups and entrepreneurs such support ranges from co investments and proof of concept grants to mentorship and fiscal space our startup ecosystem is flourishing there are now over 220 venture capital deals per year in singapore worth close to us$fourtwo 1000000000 this is a significant rise from the eighty deals worth us$136 1000000 in 2012 today more than 150 global venture capital funds incubators and accelerators are based in singapore supporting start ups here and in the region start ups can only thrive if they scale up and venture into new markets to help them do so we will provide support in three areas providing customized assistance better financing options and supporting technology adoption customized support can enable firms to identify and overcome the unique challenges they face and scale up quickly enterprise singapore will launch a scale up sg program in partnership with the private and public sectors scale up sge will work with aspiring high growth local firms to identify and build new capabilities to innovate grow and internationalize to support innovation we will launch a pilot innovation agentsme for firms to tap on a pool of experts to advise them on opportunities to innovate and commercialize technology having smart patient capital that attracts investors with the expertise and the right time horizon is another way to help firms scale up over the past few years the government has worked on improving access to private capital for start ups and smes the pool of private equity and venture capital managers in singapore has grown the monetary authority of singapore has simplified the regulatory regime for venture capital managers and launched a us $5000000000 private markets program to encourage global private equity players to deepen their presence here to further deepen the pool of smart patient capital the government has since 2010 set aside $400000000 through two rounds of fund injections for the co investment program to invest in our smes alongside the private sector so far the government is investments have catalyzed approximately $1300000000 of additional funding for our smes this year i will set aside an additional $100000000 to establish sme co investment fund three as part of this co investment fund it will catalyze investment in singapore based smes that are ready to scale up we expect that this will bring in at least $200000000 of additional funding loan financing remains an important source of funding for smes our banks have been responding dbs provides a business capabilities loan for innovative sme projects uob provides financial support for technology investments and overseas ventures while ocbc finances new smes which lack the track record typically required for credit assessment to catalyze this further we will enhance the accessibility of loans today our economic agencies have different financing schemes to make it simpler for companies we will streamline the existing financing schemes offered by enterprise singapore into a single enterprise financing scheme that will cover trade working capital fixed assets venture debt mergers and acquisitions and project financing this will be launched in october this year in addition the enterprise financing scheme will provide stronger support for companies that have been incorporated for less than five years the government will take up to seventy of the risk for bank loans to these young companies of the risk for bank loans to these young companies compared to the current fifty under most existing loan schemes to support viable smes in their day to day operations i will extend the sme working capital loan scheme for about two more years till march 2021 since its launch in june 2016 the scheme has catalyzed more than $2500000000 of loans we expect the extension to catalyze a further $1800000000 support for the working capital will be forwarded under the enterprise financing scheme from october capital will be forwarded under the enterprise financing scheme from october our companies and workers must stay on top of rapid advances in technology especially in digital technology we will continue to help our smes adopt digital technologies we adopted the smes go digital program in budget 2017 since then around 4000 smes have adopted pre approved digital solutions we will expand smes go digital program 1st accountancy sea transport and construction will get their own industry digital plans with more sectors to be added later this will guide smes on relevant digital technologies and skills training programs 2nd we will expand the number and range of cost effective pre approved digital solutions that will be supported under the smes go digital to boost technology adoption among smes mas and imda will also jointly pilot a cross border innovation platform for smes known as the business science borders with an artificial intelligence enabled marketplace to help our smes match with buyers and vendors globally to help companies in the services sector capture opportunities from digitalisation the ministry of comms and information launched a pilot of the digital services lab in november last year the dsl brings together industry and the research community to co develop digital solutions with sector wide impact for example the dsl is exploring the development of solutions to integrate the logistics chain in malls besides digital technology we will support our firms to integrate technologies and re engineer business processes to raise efficiency and enhance product developments last year i announced the productivity solutions grant to help firms adopt off the shelf technology this year we will extend the automation support package by two years introduced in budget 2016 the automation support package supports firms to deploy impactful large scale automation such as robotics internet of things solutions and other industry four technologies since its launch the asp has helped more than 300 companies to automate their operations and raise productivity we will extend the asp to encourage more companies to do so the agency for science technology and research will extend its operation and technology road mapping efforts to more companies and sectors to guide them to make the best use of technology in alignment with their business goals in the same spirit our government agencies must embrace technology to serve companies better we have made progress in this area the business grants portal launched in 2017 provides a one stop shop for businesses to identify and apply for the right grants for their plans to make it easier for businesses to transact with the government the ministry of trade and industry and relevant agencies are developing a one stop portal with a pilot to be launched for the food services sector by three q 2019 businesses will deal with only one point of contact instead of up to the fourteen different ones today bca and hdb are also testing the use of drones to inspect building facades more effectively learning from these pilots government agencies will continue to innovate and improve the ease of doing business let me now touch on other ways to help build deep enterprise capabilities we have more than 200000 enterprises in singapore ranging from large mncs to our neighborhood shops for ranging from large mncs to our neighborhood shops today across each of the four pillars of our itms different agencies provide support in each area while helpful companies have given feedback that we could streamline this i agree to better support this broad base of companies with diverse needs we will draw resources from each agency but focus support in an enterprise centric way to better help enterprises at each stage of growth this will be done in a tiered manner firms with large and complex needs or with strong growth potential will be provided a range of customized supports by edb and esg and other agencies the large number of smes facing common challenges will be supported through scalable solutions that are easy to adopt for instance i recently visited precursor assurance a local accounting firm precursor has developed an integrated digital solution with modules for corporate functions such as hr customer relationship management and finance smes can simply plug and play and scale up the use of these modules when they expand for medium sized companies that are seeking to grow we will provide targeted support in each of the different industry clusters to better address their needs as they grow the minister for trade and industry will provide further details i have touched on the measures to support our enterprises to build deep capabilities so that they can succeed in the global competition but the ultimate goal is to enable our people to continue to have good jobs and opportunities and to be at their best hence the 2nd thrust of our economic transformation in this budget is to deepen the capabilities of our workers as the chinese say 活学活用 学以致用 终身学习 终身受用 our people need to be number to build industry relevant skills throughout their lives we want our people to have the skills knowledge and attitude to adapt and thrive in this competitive and technology intensive environment in this regard the leadership of companies plays a key role the leaders of successful companies are those who are committed to raising the capabilities of their workers by redesigning jobs and re skilling their staff these capabilities are key to the company is successes i recently visited fairprice distribution center which has adopted automated storage and retriever systems to improve the efficiency of its online store operations among the staff i spoke to were mister amzab bin muhammad ali and madam lee in fong between them they have worked at fairprice for thirty years i asked how the new technology has impacted their work they told me that fairprice training has helped them to quickly pick up new skills to make use of new systems and their work environments is more pleasant and conducive fairprice is a good example of how an enterprise can strive to serve her customers better deploy technology and new ways of working and at the same time redesign jobs and reskill workers so that everyone is better off many enterprises are doing this and i urge more to take this approach on the part of the government we will continue to invest in our people across all stages of their lives from preschool to work over the years we have instituted a range of support measures for workers including the workfare income supplement special employment credit and professional conversion programs to name a few these range from helping low wage workers and older workers through wage support to equipping young graduates to have a good start in their careers and enabling experienced professionals to access new jobs in particular ntuc has been working closely with member unions and companies to enable workers to learn new skills and grow with the national skills future movement and the adapt and grow initiatives we have made a stronger push to enable our people to reach their fullest potential throughout life and help singaporeans affected by restructuring our investments in supporting our people in their careers including the adapt and grow initiatives and continuing education and training reached more than $1100000000 in financial year 2017 our people are making good efforts to invest in their learning with good outcomes the percentage of residents in the labor force who participated in training grew from 35 in 2015 to 48 in 2018 from 2016 to 2018 more than 76000 jobseekers found employment through the adapt and grow initiative workers firms unions and tacs all need to play a part to continue this progress workers need to embrace upskilling and reskilling and make the most of new opportunities both locally and overseas firms must step up training and job redesign for their workers as they are well placed to know the skills their workers need as their sectors evolve one example is mister abdul jalil bin idros who started as a technical officer at ytl power suraya over the years the company sponsored his bachelor is and master is degree in electrical engineering through continuous learning as he worked mister abdul jalil moved from maintenance to managing plant upgrading projects he is now training his colleague in cybersecurity and systems operations he received the skillsfuture fellowship award in 2018 for his exemplary efforts besides workers and firms unions tacs and professional bodies need to spearhead the re skilling and up skilling of workers in various sectors i am heartened by the institute of singapore is chartered accountants collaboration with the singapore university of social sciences to develop the joint business analytics certification program this program which was launched a year ago equips accounting professionals with practical skills in data analytics we will continue to enable our experienced professionals to build on their experience to move into new growth areas since the establishment of the pcp in 2007 over 100 pcps have been launched in about thirty sectors this year we will launch new pcps relating to blockchains embedded software and prefabrication to prepare our people to move into new growth areas in 2015 we launched a career support program to provide wage support for employers to hire eligible singaporeans who are mature and retrenched or are in long term unemployment we will extend this program for two years we must also ensure that the benefits of enterprise transformation are passed on to our workers starting from one april 2020 all transformation efforts supported by enterprise singapore is enterprise development grant must include positive outcomes for workers such as wage increases i know ntuc and its unions are putting extra effort and resources to support our firms and workers in this workers in this although some firms have done well to deploy their staff efficiently productivity growth has been uneven across sectors the manufacturing sector which faces strong global competition has done well in the services sector while some firms have done well despite a tight labor market some segments like f b and retail remain very labor intensive growth in s pass and work permit holders in the services sector has also been picking up pace the number has risen by about three per annum or $34000 in the last three years or 34000 in the last three years in particular the ex pass growth in services is the highest in five years if this trend persists foreign manpower growth will be on an unsustainable path we need to act decisively to manage the manpower growth in services and encourage our companies to revamp work processes redesign jobs and reskill our workers our workforce growth is tapering and if we do not use this narrow window to double down on restructuring our companies will find it even harder in the future relying on more and more foreign workers is not the long term solution other economies are developing too what we need is to have a sustainable inflow of foreign workers to complement our workforce while we upgrade our singaporean workers and build deep enterprise capabilities in these sectors we must enhance the complementarities of our local and foreign workers the basic approach to our foreign workers policies has remained consistent based on evidence of the pace of foreign workers inflows and the progress being made in raising productivity across sectors we need to calibrate our policies the government recognizes the economic headwinds and cost pressures ahead of us but if we do not take action early our firms will find it harder to compete in the years ahead and our workers will be left behind after much deliberation we will adjust the workforce quota for the services sector reduce the services sector dependency ratio ceiling in two steps from forty to 38 on one january 2020 and to 35 on one january 2021 we will also reduce the services sector s pas sub drc in two steps from fifteen to thirteen on one january 2020 and to ten on one january 2021 we are announcing these changes about a year ahead to give companies time to prepare for firms whose existing workers are in excess of the new limits the drc will apply as and when these firms apply for renewal of permits to support firms as they adjust to these changes we will put in place the following measures till fy 20221st the seventy funding support level for the enterprise development grant was due to lapse after 31 march 2020 i will now extend this enhanced funding support for three more years up to 31 march 20232nd we will do the same for the productivity solutions grant and expand its scope to support up to seventy of the out of pocket costs for training separately firms can continue to apply for additional manpower flexibilities in certain cases the lean enterprise development scheme provides support to firms that undertake transformation projects which lead to more manpower lean businesses transitional manpower flexibilities can be considered if firms need more resources in the short term to transit to new operating models on a case by case basis firms can bring in foreign workers with specialized skills that are in demand globally this is provided they still face a shortage after having given fair consideration to singaporeans the minister for trade and industry and the minister for manpower will provide more details at the cos as the marine shipyard and process sectors have only begun showing early signs of recovery i would defer the earlier announced increase in foreign worker levy rates for these sectors for another year in foreign worker levy rates for these sectors for another year i have spoken on how budget 2019 supports the building of deep enterprise capabilities and the building of deep worker capabilities let me now touch on the 3rd key trust to support economic transformation building deep partnerships within singapore and across the world to succeed companies need to both compete and cooperate compete to differentiate themselves and cooperate to solve common challenges our trade associations and chambers can play an important role in developing industry wide capabilities this includes supporting members in getting business advice and improving access to local and international markets tacs have done well in helping our companies build overseas partnerships for example the singapore fintech association has forged many partnerships with foreign fintech associations and the singapore business federation has organized singapore is commercial participation at numerous overseas trade fairs including the 2018 china international import expo the singapore chinese chamber of commerce and industry has also developed the trade association hub which now houses 39 tacs to raise the level of services for members sbf is also working closely with our tacs we will support our support for tacs through the local enterprise and association development or leed program enterprise singapore will be developing five year roadmaps with tacs that have demonstrated strong leadership and shown ambition to do more for the business community this will enable them to take on a more strategic and longer term approach in driving industry transformation these tacs will be able to access funding and potentially taking public sector secondaries through leed we also develop stronger partnerships around the world at the government to government and business to business levels our tacs such as the spf have developed international linkages for our businesses over the years we have negotiated free trade agreements with partner economies which enlarged our businesses access to new markets just last week the eu singapore free trade agreement and the eu singapore investment protection agreement received the european parliament is consent with a clear majority to draw greater value from these trade networks we will streamline and digitize our trade processes further to raise efficiency this will enable easier access to overseas markets and help our firms make better use of these ftas to overseas markets and help our firms make better use of these ftas last year i launched the network trade platform to streamline trade processes and provide one stop information management systems for traders we will also be working with partners to facilitate the secure exchange of electronic trade documents to unlock further productivity gains members will appreciate the three key thrusts i have just announced building deep capabilities in our enterprises and in our people and forging deep partnerships built on the itms i announced in budget 2016 with the progress we have made we are better prepared for major changes that are coming our way one major change is the speed of advancements and convergence of new technologies in what some have dubbed the 4th industrial revolution or industry four this will transform the way we invest trade and consume over the years we have forged deep partnerships with the g three economies of the us europe and japan as well as china india and asean with the center of economic gravity shifting to asia and with the technological depth of our partnerships with the g three economies we should position singapore as asia 101 for global mncs looking to expand into asia is growing markets and as global 101 for asian companies ready to go global for our next phase of growth as we press on with industry transformation we will continue to build singapore is position as a global asian node of technology innovation and enterprise this will open up new opportunities for our firms and our people to ride on the wave of the 4th industrial revolution our efforts to achieve this will build on the same three key thrusts as laid out for the broader economic transformation 1st investments in research and innovation by our universities research institutes and our firms 2nd investments in our people and 3rd building global partnerships 1st we will continue to invest in r d to support the push to make innovation pervasive we will set aside $19000000000 as part of our five year research innovation and enterprise 2020 plan our investments in r d in our universities and research institutes are bearing fruit nus and ntu are ranked the best in asia in areas such as material science and chemistry and among the top fifty globally for engineering and computer science many of our researchers are regarded by their peers as among the worst best especially in areas such as artificial intelligence quantum technologies and biomedical sciences astar has research institutes that are highly regarded together with our universities they are actively working to translate research findings into innovation in partnerships with industries but for r d to make an impact our companies must take the lead members of this house will be encouraged to know that some sectors are moving ahead including two old economy sectors 1st despite digital advancements we still need brick and mortar buildings the construction sector seen as low tech and labor intensive is now using integrated digital delivery this makes use of building information modeling and other digital technologies connecting different players working on the same construction projects this has raised productivity and created new high value jobs such as three d modelers site productivity has improved by about fifteen over the last eight years 2nd in the digital age we still need food not just bits and bytes the agriculture and food production sectors are transforming for example ava is marine aquaculture center and temasek life sciences laboratory have developed the saint john is sea bass this fish is less susceptible to disease and can be bred in thirty less time a start up allegro aqua is looking to bring more saint john is sea bass to the world another example is temasek life sciences laboratory is temasek rice which produces four times as much rice per hectare as compared to regular breeds of rice to tap on the demand for high quality food and to build on our progress enterprise singapore is investment arm seeds capital has appointed seven partners to co invest in singapore based agri food start ups to catalyze more than $90000000 of investments leading mncs and our large local companies are also establishing their r d centers in singapore in different areas of technology we now have fourteen corporate laboratories in our universities doing cutting edge work from cyber physical systems to power electronics last year we opened four corporate labs with major companies applied materials hp billmer and sabana jurong to work on advanced manufacturing biochemicals and smart cities i recently visited lux photonics consortium which brings together researchers in nus ntu astar and the industry to translate cutting edge photonics research into practical applications there i met nanoview a singapore start up specializing in nanotechnology applications there i met nanoview a singapore startup specializing in nanotechnology applications one of its prototype products a high tech screen protector promises to allow long sighted users to see clear images on digital devices without their glasses and to see three d images from two d films that is another project so i am sure this house will support the enabling of us all to see issues far or near with greater clarity and perspective now i also met technolight our helix bridge and new buildings such as the jewel at changi airport are lit in scintillating ways by technolight the company is embarking on r d to take its products to a new level so i wish nanoview and technolight is success to light up our lives and to let us see better to keep the momentum going we will continue to invest in centers of innovation at our institutes of higher learning and research institutes and to support companies in innovation enterprise singapore is collaborating with industry partners to establish a center of innovation in aquaculture at temasek polytechnic this center will bring together aquaculture firms to improve our food resilience enterprise singapore will also launch a center of innovation in energy at ntu building on earlier investments at the energy research institute at ntu the center will collaborate with the sustainable energy association of singapore to drive industry led innovation in areas such as energy efficiency renewable energy and electric mobility we will share more about these exciting new research initiatives at the research innovation and enterprise council meeting next month the spirit of entrepreneurship is critical for all these endeavors having a vision of the future and taking practical actions day in day out to explore a range of possibilities and solve a myriad of problems it is the grit and determination of our entrepreneurs that make a difference mister sim wong hoo ceo of creative technology brought us the popular sound blaster cards in the 1990s creative technology went through a difficult patch after its initial success with the sound blaster but mister sim and his team pressed on after twenty years of r d costing us $100000000 the company recently launched the super x five a technology that recreates the holographic sound experience or three d sound with headphones personalized it has already won fourteen awards at the 2019 consumer electronics show in the us having tried it myself and having heard the endorsement of audio files including some in this chamber i am happy that mister sim and his team are at the cusp of a major breakthrough and i wish them every success mister sim is story illustrates the point that to succeed we must learn we must walk the ground and we must persist i have touched on our efforts in research innovation and enterprise singapore as a global asia node will bring new opportunities for our people in new frontiers the 2nd thrust is to prepare and develop our people to make full use of this node we are partnering firms to invest in our people including young singaporeans to provide them with opportunities to gain working experience abroad for students who are currently in ihls we will combine the current local and overseas internship programs into a single global ready talent program or great you will have enhanced funding support for our students interning overseas with singapore firms the program will also support high growth singapore firms to send singaporeans with up to three years of working experience for postings in key markets such as southeast asia china and india by giving young singaporeans overseas exposure they can develop new skills to better support our firm is overseas expansion for instance oceana is group a local seafood supplier sent interns from republic polytechnic to its operations in china in a range of jobs sent interns from republic polytechnic to its operations in china in a range of jobs one of the former interns bernice chan is now a management trainee in zero shanna is farm in foutan china our 3rd trust is to build global partnerships so that our firms and people can forge new areas of collaboration with other innovation centers in budget 2017 we started the global innovation alliance one of the committee on the future economy is recommendations we have now established nine nodes in global start up hotspots such as bangkok beijing berlin jakarta and san francisco these gia notes give our entrepreneurs and students opportunities to learn and build networks globally we are also bringing the global innovation community to come together in singapore to explore and collaborate last year we held the 3rd edition of the singapore fintech festival this is now the world is largest fintech festival as part of this festival the global investors summit brought us$twelve 1000000000 in asean enterprises in fintech infocommunications technologies and medtech over the next three years and under technology events the singapore week of innovation and technology or switch brought together more than 350 exhibitors and 1000 promising startups and financiers from 75 countries to maximize impact this year switch and the singapore fintech festival will be held in the same week in mid november we can join even more entrepreneurs investors innovators from around the world to explore and collaborate in technology innovation in this 4th industrial revolution these various programs on economic transformation and jobs built on our efforts and investments over the years to summarize our economic transformation is progressing well but we must persist with our industry transformation efforts at the same time the pace of technological innovation is rapid and global economic weight is shifting towards asia we will position singapore as a global asia node of technology innovation and enterprise economic transformation is critical we expect to spend $4600000000 over the next three years on the new and enhanced economic capability measures in budget 2019 and to support singaporean workers $3600000000 will go towards helping our workers to thrive amid industry and technological changes $1000000000 will go towards helping firms build deep enterprise capabilities but let me emphasize that supporting companies and supporting workers are mutually reinforcing stronger companies provide better jobs and pay for workers and highly skilled workers make companies stronger i am confident that we can continue to make good progress our enterprises and tacs workers and unions and the government must continue to work closely together as long as we stay relevant and useful to the world we can continue to create opportunities secure our home and grow our economy at the heart of these efforts is the desire to improve the lives of current and future generations of singaporeans our approach to social development has served us well we invest heavily to bring out the best in our people we believe that access to quality education enables singaporeans to realize their potential we strive to ensure that all singaporeans regardless of background enjoy a quality living environment and have good access to healthcare we provide targeted support for those who are less advantaged so that they can have a fair chance to succeed and to those who fall on hard times so they can bounce back our efforts were affirmed by the world bank when they ranked singapore top in the human capital index last year we recognize that singapore like many advanced economies will have to deal with issues such as maintaining social mobility supporting healthy and purposeful aging and fostering a stronger sense of unity amid polarizing forces over the past decade or so we have significantly increased our social spending social ministry is expenditures have doubled from $15000000000 in fy 2009 to $30000000000 in fy 2018 the social measures in budget 2019 are part of our long term plan to build a caring and inclusive society they are driven by three main strategies of our long term plan to build a caring and inclusive society they are driven by three main strategies 1st uplifting singaporeans to maximize their potential and providing access to opportunities through their stages of life we pay particular attention to children from disadvantaged backgrounds to give them a good start in life with increasing life spans we are helping older singaporeans stay in the workforce so that they can earn and save more for retirement 2nd providing greater assurance for healthcare we will continue to strengthen support for the healthcare needs of singaporeans in particular we want to help our seniors stay active healthy and engaged in their civil years 3rd fostering a community of care and contribution through strong partnerships we strive to nurture an ethos in our society where we support one another and give a helping hand where we can those who succeed should help to uplift others just as they have benefited from the support of others around them as the chinese say 同舟共济 共创未来 we are in the same boat and weather the storms together we progress together and forge our future together i will 1st talk about how we are supporting our children workers and seniors to access the best opportunities through each stage of life we invest heavily to provide a world class education for young singaporeans this is to bring out the best in every child no matter his or her starting point i know this is an area of deep concern for many singaporeans many of you expressed this during feedback sessions and through your actions in giving time and money to help children in need preschools support parents in laying a strong foundation for children by helping to develop their children is cognitive language social and emotional skills therefore we are spending more to enhance the accessibility affordability and quality of early childhood education and care the government spent about $1000000000 on the preschool sector in 2018 this is more than twofive times of the $360000000 that we spent back in just 2012 and this support continues throughout the schooling years the government subsidizes over ninety of the total cost of educating our children this means that a child entering primary school in 2018 will receive over $130000 in education subsidies by the time he or she completes secondary education children from low income families get even more support for example through the recently enhanced moe financial assistance schemes we have been doing more to better support children from disadvantaged backgrounds by intervening earlier with new forms of proactive and targeted support one such effort is kidstart kidstart practitioners preschools and community partners work together to provide health learning and developmental support for children and their families since the pilot began in 2016 more than 900 families have been supported by kidstart last year we set up the uplifting pupils in life and inspiring families taskforce or uplift this taskforce will pilot upstream interventions and partner communities to help disadvantaged children and families to ensure that no child is left behind a recent initiative is the uplift scholarship for independent schools this will provide a monetary award of $800 per year for eligible lower income students in independent schools to cover their out of pocket expenses the task force is also looking at how to strengthen after school care and support for disadvantaged students in school based student care centers the minister for education will speak more about this and other initiatives spurred by uplift at the cos our support for singaporeans continues into their working lives workfare and civil support are two key pillars of our social security systems the two schemes supplement incomes and mitigate inequality in the working and retirement years respectively the workfare income supplement scheme provides cash payouts and cpf top ups for workers whose earnings are in the bottom twenty with some support for those slightly above the scheme has raised their income encouraged employment and help them save more for retirement we will enhance workfare income supplements to better support lower wage workers from january 2020 the qualifying income cap will be raised from the current $2000 to $2300 per month the maximum annual payouts will also be increased by up to $400 older workers will see higher increases in payouts for example workers aged sixty and earning $1200 a month will now receive $4000 per year from the workfare income supplement or almost thirty of their wages these enhancements will cost an additional $206000000 a year in total we expect the enhanced workfare income supplement to cost close to $1000000000 a year and benefit almost 440000 singaporeans as our society ages older workers will make up an increasing share of our workforce today about one in four of our workforce is aged 55 and above they continue to make important contributions to our economy and society some are giving back by mentoring the younger generations while others wish to continue working we are doing more to help older singaporeans earn more save more and have greater peace of mind during their retirement years i appreciate the concerns and suggestions regarding the retirement adequacy of older workers raised by members of the public and the pap seniors group among others and i thank the members of this house for your views during the recent debate on the motions on aging with purpose and support for caregivers the government has set up a tripartite workgroup to study the concerns of older workers the workgroup is reviewing policies such as the retirement and re employment age and the cpf contribution rates of older workers they will present their recommendations later this year to support employers in hiring older singaporean workers the government introduced the special employment credit scheme in 2011 since then we have extended and made changes to the sec in response to labor market and economic conditions we have also introduced an additional sec or asec scheme to encourage employers to hire workers who are above the re employment age i am happy that companies have responded by hiring older workers tapping on their experiences and supporting them in upgrading their skills with a tighter labor market and more singaporeans choosing to work longer more companies will be hiring older workers the government will study better forms of support to continue to help workers to remain productive earn more and save more for retirement we will review the relevance and structure of the sec and asec in tandem with the recommendations from the tripartite work group on older workers in the meantime i will extend the sec and asec for another year until 31 december 2020 for another year until 31st december 2020 to support this extension i will top up the sec fund by $366000000 taken together members will see that the government has been making significant investments in education and employment for our people from early childhood to the working years our aim is to help singaporeans fulfill their potential at each stage of life we are improving the lives of our people by enabling them to be the best that they can be we enhance our people is sense of well being and dignity without the burden of welfare schemes elsewhere which weaken people is sense of urgency and independence as more singaporeans enter their senior years healthcare needs will grow over the years we have implemented major changes to make healthcare more affordable accessible and comprehensive years we have implemented major changes to make healthcare more affordable accessible and comprehensive we have also been providing greater social support within the community to help seniors stay active through programs such as the pa wellness program and the community networks for seniors our 2nd social strategy is to provide greater healthcare assurance 1st doctors at our neighborhood clinics provide primary care that is easily accessible this helps us stay healthy to enhance access we will make it more affordable to consult doctors in our neighborhoods we introduced the community health assist scheme or chars in 2012 chars subsidies help lower to middle income families by making primary care and basic dental care at clinics near their homes more affordable over 97 of existing chars and pioneer generation cardholders have access to more than one chas clinic within ten minutes from their homes we will enhance chas subsidies at gp clinics in three ways as the prime minister announced at the national day rally last year we will extend chas to cover all singaporeans for chronic conditions regardless of income 2nd lower to middle income singaporeans who are chars orange card holders currently receive chars subsidies for chronic conditions only we will extend subsidies for common illnesses to this group 3rd we will increase the subsidies for complex chronic conditions chars makes it possible for more singaporeans to turn to gp clinics near their homes to manage their chronic conditions but we must also put in the measures to ensure that chars clinics are delivering good outcomes to this end the ministry of health will be looking at how to help chas clinics better track the patients progress and outcomes in a similar vein moh will also review its clinical guidelines for care provided at chas dental clinics to ensure that the care delivered is appropriate to the needs of the patients with these changes we expect to pay out more than $200000000 a year in chas subsidies the minister for health will provide more details on these changes at the cos a 2nd way to provide greater healthcare assurance is that we will strengthen financial protection for long term care as we age the chances of having one form of disability or another rises significantly moh estimates that one in two healthy singaporeans aged 65 could become severely disabled in their lifetime and may need long term care some of us face a higher risk some lower but regardless low risk does not mean no risk the best way of protecting ourselves is to lead a healthy lifestyle and take preventive actions at the same time we need to guard against unpredictable events the most efficient way is to help one another by pulling risk through an insurance scheme today we have made it a shield line for all singaporeans to provide financial protection against large hospital bills for life as we live longer there is a higher chance that we will need long term care towards the end of our lives we need to prepare for this the ministry of health has announced that you will be introducing the new careshield life from 2020 an enhancement of the current eldershield scheme careshield life will provide lifetime coverage with higher monthly payouts of at least $600 a month for those who become severely disabled this offsets the costs of long term care for individuals and their families the government will provide subsidies and premium support to ensure that careshield life premiums are affordable we will also offer participation incentives for existing cohorts born in 1979 or earlier to join careshield life so that they are better protected should they need care in the future careshield life will offer much greater peace of mind for singaporeans in addition we will also launch elder fund next year to help severely disabled lower income singaporeans who need additional financial support for long term care this includes those who might not be able to join care shield life or have low medisave balances the cost of long term care is not only high but will increase as our population ages last year i yearmarked $2000000000 for premium subsidies and other forms of support for singaporeans this year i will set aside another $3100000000 the government will put this $5100000000 the government will put this $5100000000 into a new long term care support fund this will help fund the casual life subsidies and other long term care support measures such as elder fund this is a significant commitment to help singaporeans with their long term care needs as the prime minister mentioned at the national day rally last year and the tribute event earlier this month we would also like to express our appreciation and support for our merdeka generation the merdeka generation is a resilient and independent generation they played a critical role in our nation is development the merdeka generation was among the earliest batches to serve national service build up our public services and modernize our economy they came together to forge our multicultural multiracial society one member of the merdeka generation is ms barbara de cotter ms de cotter started work as a special education teacher at the age of nineteen to help support her mother in 1984 she was among the 1st batch of teachers to attain a certificate in special education throughout her life she continued learning and completed her bachelor in special education in 2016 at the age of 57 today she is a specialized teacher for students with hearing deficiencies and a volunteer interpreter she is also pursuing her master of special education she is an excellent example of lifelong learning and giving i am glad to have met ms de cotta and many others who built our nation at our merdeka generation tributes event they continue to be an active generation contributing in their various capacities at work in the community caring for their families and learning something new the medica generation package is a gesture of our nation is gratitude for their contributions and a way to show care for them in their silver years you will provide them better peace of mind over future healthcare costs while helping them to stay active and healthy the merdeka generation package comprises five key benefits 1st to support their active lifestyle all merdeka generation seniors will receive a one time $100 top up to their pa passion silver cards they can use this to pay for activities and facilities at the community clubs entry to public swimming pools public transport and more we also work to introduce more active aging opportunities for seniors such as lifelong learning under the national silver academy and volunteerism under the silver volunteer fund 2nd we will provide a medisave top up of $200 per year for five years this will start from this year until 2023 this will help them save more for their healthcare needs this is on top of the gst voucher medisave top ups that eligible seniors aged 65 and above receive every year 3rd mg seniors will receive additional subsidies for outpatient care for life they will receive special charge subsidies for common illnesses chronic conditions and dental procedures the subsidy rates will be higher than the chas blue subsidies all mg seniors will receive these enhanced subsidies regardless of income including those who do not have a chas card today at polyclinics and public specialist outpatient clinics they will receive 25 of their subsidized bills this is on top of the prevailing subsidies available 4th mg seniors will have additional medishield life premium subsidies for life all mg seniors will receive subsidies for their premiums starting from five of their medishield life premiums and increasing to ten after they reach 75 years of age this is on top of the means tested subsidies that lower and middle income singaporeans are already receiving finally we will provide an additional participation incentive of $1500 for mg seniors who join careshield live when it becomes available for existing cohorts in 2021 in addition to the $2500 previously announced this means that all mg seniors who join careshield live will receive participation incentives totalling $4000 each this will cover a significant portion of their premiums and is on top of the regular means tested premium subsidies i hope this will encourage our mg seniors to join careshield live to have peace of mind against the risk of high long term care costs there are a number of other details which i will include in the annex and will be given to the media the medical generation package will benefit close to 500000 singaporeans those born in the 1950s and who obtained citizenship by 1996 will be eligible for the mgp in addition we will extend the mgp benefits to those born in 1949 or earlier but missed out on the pioneer generation package if they obtain citizenship by 1996 all eligible seniors will receive the mgp benefits regardless of their income they will be notified by april 2019 and will receive their medical generation cards starting from june 2019 the minister for health will provide further details and the implementation timeline for the mgp benefits at the cos the medical generation is aged sixty to 69 today singaporeans lifespans are increasing our life expectancy is now 84eight years this is good news it means that the merdeka generation will be able to enjoy the benefits for many years the ministry of finance and moh incising the budget for these benefits have taken this into account we estimate that the package will cost over $8000000000 in current dollars over the merdeka generation is lifetime this budget i will set aside $6100000000 for a new merdeka generation fund with interest accumulated over time this will cover the full projected cost of the merdeka generation package the merdeka generation will enjoy many key healthcare benefits for life we hope that this will go some way in providing greater peace of mind for the merdeka generation and their families this is a significant commitment by the government it is important that the government of today continues to monitor the patterns and costs of healthcare utilization and life expectancy over the next thirty years or more so that the government is able to meet this commitment or more so that the government is able to meet this commitment to better prepare for increasing lifespans we should encourage everyone to set aside something for the future to help singaporeans who are younger than the medical generation with the future healthcare expenses i will provide medisave top up of $100 a year for the next five years for singaporeans who are aged fifty and above in 2019 and who do not receive the mgp or the pgp this is a generation who are even younger and healthier and i hope that everyone will make the extra effort to stay active and healthy our 3rd social strategy is to foster a community of care and contribution and build strong partnerships in our society the government will continue to make every effort to care for our seniors the disadvantaged and vulnerable families the long term care assistance scheme provides basic monthly cash assistance to those who are permanently unable to work and have little family support to support their living expenses to support their living expenses additional assistance is provided for households with additional needs such as medical supplies we will raise the cash assistance rates for this scheme for example a two person household who are both on comcare long term assistance will receive an additional $130 a month this brings the total cash assistance to $1000 a month the minister for social and family development will provide more details at the cos to help government pensioners who draw lower pensions we will increase the singapore allowance and monthly pension ceiling by $twenty per month each to $320 and $1250 respectively this will benefit about 9300 pensioners working alongside the government individuals non profit organizations and corporates have all been playing their part contributing their skills their time and their hearts as we reflect on our history and culture in this bicentennial year let us see this spirit of helping one another as a community in action over time in the past our forefathers who arrived in singapore banded together mainly within their ethnic groups forming various clans and associations as the support of the government then was inadequate today i am glad this spirit extends across ethnic and religious lines in our society in the last few months we have received many good suggestions from members of the public on cultivating this community spirit to help those in need as our society ages and new needs emerge we hope everyone will lend a helping hand one good example is mister shalem kamaluddin and his friends from pals singapore pals stands for peace and love society a non profit organization that provides support network for singaporean youth from all backgrounds through sports events and workshops shalem and other like minded volunteers have been helping young singaporeans learn skills to overcome challenges such as bullying and cyber addiction to date they have touched the lives of about 800 youths another example is doctor rose sivam who started my home your home with her husband as a chef rose and her family bring together people from various backgrounds including those with disabilities and children with special needs to share a meal in her home this is another good example of our community spirit how we care for the less privileged and build unity in our diversity i am heartened that many other singaporeans too have stepped forward in their own ways to make a difference within their community and i encourage everyone to do their part i spoke about the sgcas movement at last year is budget it seeks to bring together the public people and private sectors in partnership create a greater collective impact and grow as a community of care and contribution this year we continue to build on the sgcares movement we have three measures to mobilize our people across all age groups and across the public private and people sectors 1st growing the spirit of volunteerism in our youth many of our secondary school students are already active volunteers and are giving back to the community we want to sustain this momentum as they move to ihls and later into the workplace momentum as they move to ihls and later into the workplace we are working with you cause singapore to nurture youth community leaders in our ihls who can in turn rally their peers to be involved in the community on a sustained basis 2nd our seniors have an abundance of skills and experience to make meaningful contributions to enable more of them to do so we will work with community partners and companies to encourage volunteerism among older workers this will enable our seniors to stay active and contribute to the community at work and when they retire community at work and when they retire 3rd the government is encouraging all public officers to volunteer under the public service cares initiative today each ministry has a senior officer appointed as the giving ambassador to champion volunteerism more than 85 of public officers are making monthly donations going forward public service cares will strengthen capabilities in corporate social responsibility and create larger scale and sustained volunteering opportunities for public officers across agencies for example they can take part in house visits to share healthcare in the active aging schemes or guide seniors in their mobile devices at digital clinics this will also help public service officers to better understand citizens needs and co deliver services with the people and private sectors this is the public services contribution to the sgcas movement the minister for culture community and youth will be sharing more on sgcas at the cos the spirit of giving back has a special meaning this year as we commemorate the singapore bicentennial therefore i will launch two special initiatives in support of this 1st i will set aside $200000000 for a bicentennial community fund today we encourage individuals and corporates to give back to their community in various ways donations to institutions of a public character qualify for a 250 tax deduction businesses also enjoy a 250 tax deduction on qualifying expenditure when their employees volunteer or provide services to ipcs under the business and ipc partnership scheme the new bicentennial community fund will provide dollar for dollar matching for donations made to ipcs in financial year 2019 with this we hope to further encourage more singaporeans including younger singaporeans to embrace the spirit of giving back at the same time we are encouraging ipcs to reach out to more donors the fund will be designed to ensure a good distribution of support for all donations to ipcs which currently do not receive government matching and to increase the impact of the good work they are doing we have also enhanced our one stop platform giving sg to better match donors and volunteers with meaningful causes this platform provides charities with an easy and secure way to establish an online presence and to receive donations digitally donors too can quickly navigate and find a worthy cause that matches their passion and commitment and start on their giving journey details will be shared by the ministry of culture community and youth at a later date 2nd i will introduce a $1100000000 bicentennial bonus from time to time when our finances allow we share the surpluses with singaporeans and provide more help to those with specific needs with this bonus i hope all singaporeans young and old will join us to commemorate this significant moment in singapore is history the bicentennial bonus has several components for lower income singaporeans i will provide additional help with their daily living expenses i will provide up to $300 through a gst voucher cash bicentennial payment this will benefit 1400000 singaporeans in addition lower income workers who receive workfare income supplement payments will get a workfare bicentennial bonus they will receive an additional ten of their wisp payments for work done in 2018 with a minimum payment of $100 this will be given in cash i will provide a fifty personal income tax rebate subject to a cap of $200 for the year of assessment 2019 i have set the cap at $200 so that the benefits go mostly to middle income i have set the cap at $200 so that the benefits go mostly to middle income earners for parents with school going children we will provide additional support for their children is education each year the government contributes to the edusafe accounts of all singaporean students at primary and secondary school levels this helps to pay for school enrichment activities to better develop students holistically this year we will provide a $150 top up to their edusafe accounts this is on top of the annual edusafe contributions that they already receive from the government in addition singaporeans aged seventeen to twenty will receive up to $500 in their post secondary education accounts this will go towards helping parents to save for their children is tertiary education we will also provide additional support for older singaporeans who are near retirement i will provide a cpf top up of up to $1000 for eligible singaporeans aged fifty to 64 years old in 2019 who have less than $60000 of retirement savings in their cpf accounts this will be credited to the special accounts for members aged fifty to 54 and the retirement account for members aged 55 to 64 about 300000 singaporeans will benefit from this cpf top up the majority of these recipients will be women many of them left the workforce early and took up important roles as mothers caregivers or housewives as a result they had fewer years to build up their savings this top up is a way to recognize their contributions and to help them save more in addition to the cpf top ups singaporeans in the age group of fifty to 64 who qualify for workfare will also benefit from the workfare income supplement enhancements that i mentioned earlier most of those in the sixty to 64 age group will also receive the medeca generation package while the rest will receive the five year medisave top ups these are all on top of the targeted benefits such as the gst voucher together we hope that these measures will provide greater peace of mind for our older workers now and later in their civil years in addition to these special bicentennial initiatives we will provide another year of service and conservancy charges rebates to hdb households sncc rebates to hdb households eligible singaporean households will receive sncc rebates for between onefive and threefive months this will cost $132000000 and benefit about 930000 households finally i will top up the public transport fund by $10000000 to continue helping commuters in need with their transport expenses such as through public transport vouchers for lower income families the government keeps a close watch on the cost of living over the years we have done much to alleviate cost pressures whether in healthcare education or day to day expenses good macroeconomic management has enabled us to keep inflation low while the singapore dollar has been strengthening over time many singaporeans who go on overseas vacations would appreciate this overseas vocations would appreciate this over and above this favorable condition this budget continues to provide significant support for singaporeans especially our seniors and lower income households budget 2019 supports the government is long term strategy to build a caring and inclusive society this is our continued effort to improve the lives of our people and our future generations today our shining little red dot can hold its own on the global stage but as the minister for national development has said we are not done building singapore infrastructure takes time to build but once built it can serve us for a long time we must take a long view for our development plans the upcoming ura master plan 2019 will guide our urban development over a ten fifteen year timeframe it ensures that our limited land can be optimized to meet the needs of current and future generations the minister for national development will share more details at the cos the long term transformation of our city must start with our hdb estates where most singaporeans homes are it is important that we keep our living environments 1st class many cities have large tracts that slip into disrepair over time we must avoid that we must strive to make every town in singapore green and liveable by rejuvenating them systematically over time as our home and a global node our city has to been well connected within and with the world within singapore we now have about 230 kilometers of mrt lines this will rise to about 360 kilometers in the 2030s when major mrt projects such as the cross island lines are completed to enhance our global connectivity we are increasing the capacities of our airport and seaport this will strengthen our role as a key node within asia and to the world connecting to future growth knowledge and cultural centers in asia and beyond will not only benefit singaporeans but will also add to the connectivity and vibrancy in our region beyond the next decade we must also plan for climate change climate change and rising sea levels threaten our very existence as a low lying island nation there is nowhere to hide when sea levels rise other small island nations like the maldives are already facing risk of flooding with severe implications the government is studying the implications carefully and will come up with measures to prepare ourselves adequately our climate action plan which was launched in 2016 sets out a strategy for mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change especially on our infrastructure in line with the action plan low lying roads near coastal areas have been raised changi airport terminal five will also be built at fivefive meters above mean sea level the use of polders and dikes is already being piloted on pulau tekong this will help us to learn how to deal with rising sea levels to protect ourselves against climate change and rising sea levels we will have to invest more together with existing infrastructure needs our total bill for infrastructure will increase significantly it is very difficult to project spending needs way into the future but the different ministries have done some preliminary estimates we will continue to do our best to look forward develop fiscal plans well in advance and put in place the right approach to finance such long lived major infrastructure each generation should contribute its fair share tackling climate change requires global cooperation singapore is committed to doing our part it is a responsible thing to do for our children and future generations the carbon tax will be applied on this year is emissions this is an important signal to companies and households to reduce emissions and adopt energy efficient practices as individuals we too must change our way and work towards becoming a zero waste nation by adopting the three r is reducing consumption reusing and recycling the zero waste master plan will be launched in the 2nd half of this year among other issues you will look at better management of food waste e waste and packaging waste including plastics the minister for the environment and water resources will provide more details at the cos given our dense urban environment air quality and greenery are especially important mparks has done an excellent job in greening singapore our island has more than forty green cover this improves our living environment and our air quality but diesel exhaust is air quality but diesel exhaust is highly pollutive and adversely affects our people is health and quality of life many cities in europe have announced restrictions on diesel vehicle usage we have taken steps to discourage diesel consumption over the years we have implemented schemes to encourage early renewal of diesel commercial goods vehicles and to also account for the impact of vehicular emissions we have seen positive results more owners are shifting towards more environmentally friendly engines such as electric hybrids we are glad to see a drop in the numbers of new diesel cars and taxis registered we also restructured diesel taxes in 2017 to shift away from an annual amount of tax towards a usage based tax system we permanently reduced the annual special tax on diesel cars and taxis and reintroduced the volumetric diesel duty to continue the restructuring of diesel taxes i will raise excise duty for diesel by ¢ten per liter to ¢twenty per liter this takes immediate effect at the same time i will permanently reduce the annual special tax on diesel taxis by $850 i strongly urge taxi companies to pass on the savings to their drivers like they did in 2017 this will on average reduce the impact of the duty increase by more than three quarters for taxis by more than three quarters for taxis i will also permanently reduce the special tax on diesel cars by $100 this will on average reduce the impact by more than half to help businesses adjust i will provide a 100 road tax rebate for one year and partial road tax rebate for another two years for commercial diesel vehicles i will also provide over three years additional cash rebates of up to $3200 for diesel buses faring school children building a more sustainable environment makes our quality of life better and also creates economic opportunities just as we close the water loop we can now turn our attention to closing the waste loop there are already start ups tackling this challenge two companies ugly good and treya have been working on innovative ways to convert food related waste into useful products these are good examples of opportunities in our zero waste management so i hope to see more of such initiatives in the coming years our beautiful living environments can also be enhanced through the smart use of technology as part of our smart nation efforts to reduce energy usage we have implemented district cooling in the marina bay area to improve our quality of life we have started rolling out pneumatic waste collection and trough smart urban mobility solutions buildings can also be designed to be environmentally friendly for example by being energy efficient and producing enough renewable energy to run itself bca was the 1st to retrofit its academy in 2009 making it the 1st retrofitted net zero energy building in southeast asia this year nus is school of design and environment launched sde four a brand new net zero energy building these initiatives contribute towards making our environment more sustainable and pleasant environment more sustainable and pleasant the national research foundation will continue to fund research and innovation in urban solutions and sustainability our public housing policies have also been uniquely successful because of our long term planning today we are not just building new flats we are improving the quality of life for singaporeans through the rejuvenation of our public housing estates our plans for the rejuvenation and renewal of our city includes the home improvement program the neighborhood renewal program and the remaking our hearts learned initiative for the longer term we have announced hip two and the voluntary early redevelopment scheme or verse these are plans that will keep our living environment 1st class over the coming years the minister for national development will be sharing more on these plans to build endearing homes for our people at the cos singapore is ability to plan for the long term is our strategic advantage but the best laid out plans to develop our people and transform our city can only be realized with a sound fiscal plan our fiscal discipline and prudence gave us resources to respond decisively to unexpected challenges such as the 2008 global financial crisis we must not take this for granted while our nation is needs are growing significantly we must continue to take a disciplined and prudent approach we will pursue new investments using a differentiated fiscal strategy taking one approach for major infrastructure investments and another for recurrent social and security expenditures 1st infrastructure investments some of these are major long term projects such as the development of changi east and rail projects such as the cross island line others such as infrastructure to protect us against climate change are contingent on the future state of the world it is challenging to predict the exact timing and requirements for these large and lumpy expenditures where the benefits span many generations of singaporeans paying them through some borrowing is fairer and more efficient borrowing done in a responsible and sustainable manner will help instill financial discipline and distribute the share of funding more equitably across current and future generations in the 1980s the government borrowed to build our 1st mrt lines our statutory boards and government owned companies have also contributed to finance many major infrastructure projects through borrowings for the development of changi east the changi airport group will be taking up loans to fund its share of the infrastructure investments to lower financing costs the government with the president is concurrence will provide a guarantee for changi east is borrowings this allows us to tap on the strength of the government is balance sheet to back this strategic investment this lowers the cost of borrowings the government is further studying the option of using government debts as part of the financing mix for long term infrastructure projects that the government will be taking on directly 2nd for recurrent spending needs in areas such as healthcare preschool education and security we must recognize that these are necessary expenditures to take care of our elderly give our children a good start in life and keep singapore safe and secure for our families many countries have taken the easy route by funding these recurrent expenditures through borrowing we must not do this as such borrowing shifts the burden of paying for today is needs onto future generations this is not the singapore way a fairer and more robust approach is to meet recurrent spending with recurrent revenues hence we must continually review our tax system to ensure its resilience gst is a broad based tax that contributes significantly to our fiscal resources last year i mentioned the introduction of gst on imported services to make sure gst collections remain fair and resilient in the digital economy this year i will tighten the gst import relief for travelers given rising international travel for travelers who spend less than 48 hours outside singapore the value of goods brought overseas that can enjoy gst relief will be reduced from $150 to $100 for travelers who spend 48 hours or more outside singapore the relief quantum will be reduced from $600 to $500 this will take effect from tomorrow this will take effect from tomorrow i will also tighten the alcohol duty free concessions for travelers from three liters to two liters this will take effect from one april 2019 as i announced at the previous budget we will raise gst by two percentage points sometime in the period from 2021 to 2025 when we raise gst we will ensure that our overall system of taxes and transfers remains progressive and fair we will continue to absorb gst on publicly subsidized education and healthcare we will provide more help to lower income households and the elderly by enhancing the permanent gst voucher scheme provide more help to lower income households and the elderly by enhancing the permanent gst voucher scheme we will also cushion the impact of the gst increase for a period through a gst offset package lower and middle income households will get more and more details will be announced later notwithstanding the need to raise revenues in the future at the core of our fiscal system is our commitment to keep the overall tax burden low we want workers and firms to keep as much as possible of what they earn this leaves our citizens free to choose how they spend save or invest our main indirect tax the gst is not high by international standards even after the planned increase to nine the oecd average is nineteen among asia pacific countries many have standard gst rates that exceed nine ultimately a competitive tax regime helps us to attract and retain investments and talents this in turn helps to bring in good jobs for singaporeans a competitive tax regime is a key anchor to our economic growth and the best way to sustainably increase tax revenues i will extend and strengthen tax incentives to enhance our business competitiveness at the same time i will make some adjustments to further enhance the progressivity and resilience of our tax system the details of these changes are in the annex the government will continue to plan ahead for the long term my commitment to singaporeans is that our overall taxes and transfer system will always remain fair progressive and pro growth let me now summarize our overall budget position for financial year 2018 we expect an overall budget surplus of $2100000000 or zerofour of gdp this is a $2700000000 increase from the $600000000 deficit forecasted a year from the $600000000 deficit forecasted a year ago this was due to the unexpected two year suspension of the kuala lumpur singapore high speed rail project and higher than expected stamp duty collections when we exclude the government is top ups to funds and net investment returns contribution from past reserves we expect a basic deficit of $7000000000 or onefour of gdp financial year 2018 was hence an expansionary budget for 2019 our budget position remains expansionary with a basic deficit of $7100000000 ministry is total expenditures are expected to be $80300000000 onesix higher than in fy 2018 we are setting aside funds to meet singaporeans long term needs including $6100000000 for the medical generation package and $5100000000 for long term care support on the whole we expect an overall budget deficit of $3500000000 or zeroseven of gdp we have sufficient fiscal surplus accumulated over this term of government to fund the overall sufficient fiscal surplus accumulated over this term of government to fund the overall deficit in financial year 2019 there is no draw on past reserves mister speaker i will now conclude 1st i would like to thank the many singaporeans as well as businesses unions charities and community organizations who have provided your feedback and ideas a special thanks to the talented students from nanyang polytechnic for the beautiful sketches that you see in my slides today we commemorate 2019 our bicentennial year to learn from our past in order to chart our future we will have

will have our place in the world we must develop deep capabilities stay open and connected and draw ideas and talents from around the globe singaporean talents have been making their mark in various fields and connecting with other highly skilled individuals from around the world will make our team even stronger 2nd external events around us will shape and reshape our lives our people have shown time and again that we can take the long view adapt with the times and thrive 3rd we will draw strength from our diversity by focusing on what we have in common in the earlier years our forefathers

our multicultural heritage to foster a caring and inclusive society we continue to nurture our young and develop our people on a lifelong basis we seek to take better care of our seniors so that they can stay active and healthy we will partner businesses and workers to transform our economy we welcome the best mncs and smes from around the world and help our start ups and smes to grow scale and internationalize we will help our workers deepen their capabilities and seek new opportunities to catch the wave of the 4th industrial revolution we are positioning singapore as a global asia node of technology innovation and enterprise the changes ahead will be faster and deeper budget 2019 highlights the key challenges we are facing and how we are preparing to ride on the changes to turn challenges into opportunities for singaporeans and for our partners in the global community we are investing to keep singapore safe and secure we are restructuring our economy to enable our businesses

            "reference": "mister deputy speaker sir today my fellow co chairs of the multi ministry task force the mtf minister gan kim yong and minister lawrence wong and i will be delivering ministerial statements to update members on the covid nineteen situation in singapore our ministerial statements will address oral questions one to five and 26 to 28 and written questions 282931 to 33 of today is order paper it will cover questions on the ktv and jurong fishery port clusters our covid nineteen vaccination program and our plans to transit to live normally with covid nineteen mister murali pillai associate professor jamus lim mister darryl david mister xie yao quan mister yip honorable weng mister seah kian peng miss raeesah khan and mister sitoh yih pin have found oral and written questions scheduled for future sittings on these issues as today is ministerial statements would address those questions mister deputy speaker sir i would like to invite these members to seek clarification should they have on these issues after the ministerial statements and should their queries be sufficiently addressed it may not be necessary for them to proceed with their pqs for future sittings with that let me start on monday twelve july 21st moh detected several covid nineteen positive cases amongst individuals who frequented ktv bars and lounges these individuals include included patrons of the bars and hostesses who worked in the lounges these activities were considered very high risk and had been disallowed since the beginning of the pandemic the cluster grew rapidly and moh moved in quickly to isolate infected persons we ident we identified rings of contacts and tested them for covid nineteen we ordered a two week suspension of operations in all pivoted nightlife establishments from sixteen july till 30th july the pivoted nightlife establishments cannot resume operations until they pass inspections to ensure that safe management measures measure protocols are in place and they have received written approval mister xie yao quan asked if we would consider making the individuals in the ktv cluster pay for their covid nineteen medical expenses in full we are all upset by the irresponsible behavior of the individuals involved in this ktv cluster but we still have a public responsibility to ensure that everyone receives the medical care that they need we also do not want individuals especially those who are infected to avoid getting tested and treated or hide where they have been from contact tracers because they are afraid of getting penalized and this will make it harder to contain the spread and would cost us more in the long run we were on the path towards progressive opening and the ktv cluster was a major unexpected bump on the road the mtf deliberated on the matter took in advice from moh experts and came to the conclusion that given our extensive tracing and testing efforts and our population vaccination rate for two doses were approaching fifty at that time on balance we felt that the cluster ought not significantly change our plans to open up hence on sixteen july the mtf announced our decision to maintain our then current safe management posture we made some adjustments to the rules for eating in restaurants we call it the 25 rule two if you are unvaccinated five you can dine together provided everyone is vaccinated is fully vaccinated based on how the cluster has developed we still believe that was the correct call as of 25th july 2021 that means yesterday end of yesterday the ktv cluster has a total of 237 infected persons for the past three days the daily increase in infection for the cluster was 65 and five respectively so it is coming under control but unfortunately things got derailed due to a larger and more troublesome cluster and this is the jurong fishery port cluster on the evening of friday sixteen july 2021 we started to detect multiple infections at the jurong fishery port as well as in hong lim market this involved fishmongers their assistants going about an honest living collecting fishes at the fishery port but unwittingly getting infected and then transmitting to more people in the markets and communities where they apply their trade moh with the help of nea took immediate steps to prevent further spread by stopping the fishmongers and their assistants from setting up stores on sunday 18th july 2021 it was very tough to tell them you can not set up stalls we then issued health risk warnings which required them to undergo pcr tests and isolate themselves until they get a negative result of the 1548 tested 43 were found to be covid nineteen positive the numbers are a bit different from what i reported earlier as we clean up the numbers this indicated that significant community transmission had most likely already silently occurred in the days before 18th july 2021 sunday see markets are frequented by wide segments of the public particularly seniors of whom one quarter are still not fully vaccinated the risk of infections rising uncontrollably could not be ruled out these infections could potentially result in more cases of severe illnesses or even deaths among our vulnerable senior population hence the mtf decided to preemptively dial back to phase two heightened alert this came into effect on 22nd july 2021 we did this to buy ourselves time precious time to get more of our population vaccinated so that we can continue on our path towards living with covid nineteen safely the preliminary phylogenetic findings suggest that while the ktv and jurong fishery port clusters were all driven by the delta variant it is distinct from the delta variant that infected tan tock seng hospital and the changi airport cluster the recent clusters have a delta strain that is more closely related to what we detected in imported cases from our immediate region however there are also slight genetic differences between the strains in the two clusters suggesting that there were multiple introduction points as of july 25th 2021 the jurong fishery port has a total of 792 cases it is still growing but now at a slower rate the daily infection numbers over the last three days were 7979 and 46 respectively overall we have seen a high number of daily cases at over 100 for the past several days but the situation is stabilizing with daily infections trending down percentage of cases isolated or quarantined before turning covid nineteen positive is something we watch closely and it is on an upward trend which is good that means when the person is in started to be detected as positive he is already quarantined and isolated on 19th july we had that is when the cluster 1st breakout we had a total of 163 cases and only 27 were isolated before detection lately this hovers around forty today we should have more than half of our cases already isolated if we can keep raising that percentage through tracing and testing we can progressively suppress this wave of transmission but our objective is not to stop transmission completely that is no longer possible given how transmissible the delta variant is and as we open up and people circulate more so the only possible way now to eradicate infections is to go into a hard circuit breaker for at least a month probably too but we do not want to be locked up further even if we do lock ourselves up when the cb ends and we open up cases will rise again so eradication is therefore not possible nor sustainable we must instead find ways to live with this virus safely several members namely mister yip honorable weng associate professor jamus lim miss raeesah khan were interested to find out more about our transition plans to live with covid nineteen as an endemic disease vaccinations are key to this transition and the national program is progressing well as of end of yesterday 25th july 202154 of our population has received two doses of the mrna vaccines and our population vaccination rate is going up by about one percentage point a day so by national day almost seventy will have received two doses by early september it should be almost eighty having received two doses of mrna vaccines and this means singapore by then will have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world it puts us in a strong position to transit to a covid resilient society our main worry is that our seniors especially those seventy and above are not sufficiently vaccinated today just over seventy of them have received two doses of the vaccines miss tin pei ling asked for an update on the home vaccination scheme we have launched nine home vaccination teams so far as of 23rd of july 734 seniors have received vaccinations under that program further more seniors are coming forward to our vaccination centers and also our mobile vaccination teams we have been seeing about 500 seniors coming forward on a daily basis to receive their 1st doses for the past a few weeks but for the past few days that number has doubled to over a 1000 every day now how did that come about it is good news but it may be due to heightened awareness as a result of more community transmission lifting of rules that had previously deferred their vaccinations for those with medical conditions and also our very intensive outreach efforts for example our mobile teams have gone all the way to pulau ubin to vaccinate seniors who are living there we know of gps who persuaded called up their clients the seniors persuaded them go for vaccinations and then open up their clinics for them to sit in the clinic the whole day so that they feel assured that if they feel unwell help is always nearby help from someone they trust their gps mister deputy speaker sir this is a measure of the kind of society we are we are making such an extraordinary effort with our seniors because we are not prepared to accept the high fatality rates amongst the elderly that other countries had or are still experiencing as a result of all these efforts 77 of our seniors seventy and above have now received their 1st doses within a month or so they should all have received their 2nd doses and after that another fourteen days they should all be strongly protected against covid nineteen even at our current rate of vaccination 54 or so two doses the preliminary evidence is that it has been effective in reducing the incidence of severe illnesses and deaths mister deputy speaker sir may i show a chart on screen please yes please do thank you top line is blue line is infection bottom line orange is number with severe illnesses requiring oxygen supplementation or icu as members can see while daily infections have gone up sharply over the past couple of weeks the number of patients with severe illnesses who require oxygen supplementation or in icu remains relatively low the slight uptick but relatively suppressed currently all of these patients with severe illnesses are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated but we are watching this closely because there is a time lag of twelve weeks between infection and the onset of severe illnesses for now it would appear that we have successfully weakened the link between infections and severe illnesses while we are making good progress in vaccinating our people we acknowledge that the recent reversion to phase two heightened alert has caused some confusion amongst members of the public they are asking are we still committed or is the mtf still committed to the path towards normalcy and living with covid nineteen the answer is a definite yes for that is the only way for singaporeans to regain our lives and livelihoods for singapore to reconnect with the world again for our young to look into the future with hope some countries like the uk have declared a freedom day recently where all social restrictions are lifted all at once others like israel and netherlands open up and saw sharp increases in infections and hospitalization and have to dial back very quickly ours will be a controlled opening we are not going to do a big bang because predictably things will then blow up the mtf has been developing a roadmap comprising packages of measures to be implemented step by step over the next few months and with every step ensure that opening up is safe for the community but even as we do so we must bear in mind that until we reach a sufficiently high vaccination rate especially amongst our senior we will continue to be vulnerable to unexpected setbacks just like what we are going through now a high rate of vaccination will provide us with a more solid and stable base as we proceed on this journey the higher the vaccination rate the more solid the ground we walk on so in a way this is the most peculiar period of our transition where we are clear about our mission our will is firm we have a broad plan but we do not have enough antibodies in all of us to ensure that we can follow through our plans without a hitch but let us not underestimate the progress we have made the roadmap is in fact being implemented as we speak our attention often is on the smms the safe management measures such as whether we can eat in restaurants but there are at least three other important aspects namely one restoring economic and social activities including connecting with the outside world two remodeling covid nineteen healthcare proto which i feel is probably the hardest minister gan will speak about restoring economic activities while minister lawrence wong will speak more about enabling more social activities let me talk about healthcare protocols and our collective psychology as we learn to live with covid nineteen our healthcare protocols must be remodeled if covid nineteen is indeed endemic having 200 or more cases may not be an unusual thing at all during an influenza influenza season our daily infection rates can go up to as high as a 1000 a day imagine we treat influenza like we treat covid nineteen this is what will happen we will put everyone suspected of influenza infections through pcr tests and then long isolated stays in hospitals and then everyone they come into contact with will be quarantined 1000 cases a day this will disrupt the lives of many people further hospital beds will all be filled and many other patients who are sicker will be turned away the healthcare system will not be able to cope and that is clearly not the way to deal with an endemic disease so if we want to live with covid as an endemic disease we cannot carry on with the current healthcare protocols they need to shift closer to how we treat influenza today without extensive contact tracing and quarantine in dedicated facilities and hospitalizing only those who are very ill but that can only happen when the likelihood of developing very serious or life threatening disease as a result of covid nineteen infection has been significantly reduced by effective vaccination of our population especially amongst the vulnerable with our current rate of vaccinations we have started to take the 1st transition step to remodel our healthcare protocols as of last week we made the following changes 1st greater use of community care facilities instead of hospitals vaccinated individuals aged between 45 and 59 who tested positive for covid nineteen and show no or mild symptoms can be directly admitted to community care facilities instead of going 1st to hospitals so the this community care facility facilities currently is for example is ntuc d resorts as well as csc loyang this was already the practice for all cases aged between seventeen to 45 years but we are now expanding the protocol to people up to 59 years old and with this change we expect up to sixty of infected cases to recover in community care facilities instead of in acute care hospitals meanwhile we will plan for the next step because this is just the 1st step we will plan for the next one where perhaps eighty can be admitted to community care facilities and some can even start to recover at home 2nd change we have shortened the length of stay in hospitals and community care facilities our tests have shown that the viral load in infected persons who are fully vaccinated falls very rapidly to a very low level after nine days previously most people generally were discharged only after 21 days we are now discharging fully vaccinated persons after fourteen days from the onset of illnesses with a seven day leave of absence in addition so long as their tests show that they are covid negative or have very low viral loads we are reviewing our policy to allow fully vaccinated patients to be discharged even earlier and to complete the rest of the isolation period at home if their home environment is suitable 3rd change is the greater use of home quarantine for fully vaccinated persons they can now serve their quarantine at home instead of a dedicated government facility provided that their home is suitable for isolation we expect up to forty of persons under quarantine can serve their quarantine at home and this will go beyond fifty in the coming few weeks as more people get vaccinated these are amongst 1st steps the 1st steps that we will take in the healthcare transition in the meantime what we are experiencing in this current wave of transmission is also valuable because we are also witnessing a palpable shift in our collective psychology the 1st i think is a shift away from always focusing on infection numbers we used to get a shock when we see high daily numbers because this will mean a week or two from then we will see more severe illnesses and deaths however in recent days that mental link is starting to be broken as we know that with vaccinations high infection numbers need not necessarily mean more sickness and deaths many people are now rightfully focusing on the number of people with severe illnesses as of today despite the higher infection cases over the past few days that number is fourteen and does not threaten our hospital capacity many friends including members of this house have been texting me asking me why do not we publish the number of people with severe illnesses so that we know that vaccination works actually the media have been publishing these numbers every day for quite a while now but our attention is always on the vaccination on the infection numbers but it is good that the attention is now shifting i would not say there is a huge psychological shift but i think the shift is starting to happen a 2nd shift is a greater acceptance of differentiated safe management measures between those who are vaccinated and those who are not there have been many calls to do this mister xie yao quan has also asked about this this is something which the mtf has always intended to do and that was why we decided on the 25 rule for restaurants when the ktv cluster broke out but it was scuttled with our reversion to phase two heightened alert when our whole society is very highly vaccinated and we have transitioned to living with covid nineteen we should make very little differentiation between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated but during this period of transition when we are still building up our resilience differentiation by vaccination status is a practical way to open up some activities 1st while protecting those who are still vulnerable mtf will visit this during our phase two heightened alert midpoint review and minister lawrence wong will speak more about that later let me address several other questions from members mister murali pillai will be comforted to know that mof actively monitors international developments in medical treatment options for covid nineteen this is done through the national center of infectious diseases ncid and an expert committee they have developed national treatment guidelines which are constantly updated based on new evidence they provide guidance to our doctors on the use of evidence based medical treatment options for covid nineteen patients our local institutions have also been participating actively in international multicenter trials investigating novel covid nineteen therapeutics these trials have generated important data on new covid nineteen treatments such as remdesivir we will continue to closely monitor developments in covid nineteen treatments proactively procure therapeutic agents which are shown to be effective and maintain a stockpile based on our population needs to mister leon perera is question factors that affect covid nineteen vaccine effica test for risk factors and scientific papers on the correlations may be published in future antibody testing is not required after vaccination under singapore is national vaccination program and we are actively reviewing the need for vaccine boosters we are also continually reviewing singapore is portfolio of covid nineteen vaccines we plan to bring in non mrna vaccines that are robustly assessed for quality safety and effectiveness this should happen before end of the year subject to supply and regulatory approval testing that will remain very important even as we transit to living with covid because it is only through testing that we can know if we are infected and then do the civic minded thing in excusing ourselves from work and then staying home but we have to make testing simple accessible affordable even more so than now so that we can all do our part i believe many members have done the breathalyzer testing just now so it is one example of a test that is non intrusive simple easy accessible and fast since mid june we have progressively wrote out regular fast and easy tests for staff working in higher risk settings this includes a network of sixteen quick test centers which we intend to expand further so in response to miss joan pereira is question for quick the quick test centers will support small businesses by allowing their staff to walk in and get themselves tested and have their results recorded at some point i believe the quicksand quick test centers should also be using breathalyzer tests as we have gone through just now we will also continue to work with nea to deploy wastewater testing across singapore mister dennis tan asked about this currently nea has deployed 270 auto samplers across 200 sites so every site can have a few two or more auto samplers we are increasing this to 500 auto samplers across 400 sites by the end of the year wastewater testing is an increasingly strategic resource as we learn to live with covid nineteen where we place the sites are very important we can deploy them in areas where we suspect transmission is happening such as around all the markets that are currently affected now or we can deploy them to areas where we know many unvaccinated seniors are living there such testing is non intrusive and will give us valuable early warning when covid nineteen starts to take hold in the locality we will know very early and that will prompt us to take further public health measures in the affected residential areas mister darryl david doctor lim wee kiak and mister murali pillai asked about the safety of covid nineteen vaccines moh has been publishing monthly safety data updates on our website it also gives an age breakdown of the affected persons and indeed the majority are young people as of 30th june 2021 hsa has received twelve reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring in persons after receiving a dose of the mrna based covid nineteen vaccine while there is a small increased risk among those in the younger age groups relative to the baseline rate the local incidence rate remains low one of the reported cases is a full time national serviceman in the saf who is below thirty years of age none of the cases are from the singapore police force or the scdf we implemented the vaccine injury financial assistance program or vifap to give greater peace of mind to people taking vaccinations but remember with or without vaccinations there is a baseline number of disease cases amongst our population since the vast majority of singaporeans have stepped forward to be vaccinated there will naturally be numerous incidents which just happen to coincide with vaccinations hence we have to do what is practical and reasonable which is to have a vifap which is to have the vifap applications revealed by a panel of medical experts who will consider who will consider them against known evidence about the vaccines a few members have also asked about the sinovac vaccine the sinovac vaccine is called coronavac but we always just call it sinovac sinovac is the company the vaccine is coronavac but for simplicity i would just refer it as the sinovac vaccine as at 25th july 2021 about 72000 persons have received at least one dose of the sinovac vaccine and about 17000 persons have received their 2nd doses amongst them 28 are singapore citizens and they are mostly young so for those who have taken the sinovac vaccine and are seniors above sixty years old only ten or in fact less than ten are singaporeans if the supply of 200000 doses which the government has procured is insufficient to cater to the demand private clinics can bring in additional supply as is the case for any other w h zero eul vaccine under the special excess route as of nine july 2021 hsa has received ten adverse event reports following vaccination with a sinovac vaccine the event comprises mainly allergic reactions such as itch and rashes as for concessions on safe management measures the data on the efficacy of the sinovac vaccine against the delta variant is still building up sinovac has also recently submitted the required safety data for the application for the pandemic special access route approval to hs hsa so the hsa and our expert committee are going through the various data when the evidence justifies it we will certainly want to extend the concessions to individuals who have received the sinovac or other vaccines which may qualify mister deputy speaker sir let me conclude as a government we need to recognize that our society is diverse with different segments of the population having different opinions needs and wants when these differences cannot be reconciled we agree to disagree we live in that lift at the same time we do our best to unite and forge a consensus for what is a society without commonalities and without shared communa commonalities and this is what a responsible government needs to do across a range of issues from education health care public housing to racial harmony and free trade we must always try to strike a balance between forging a consensus as well as respecting diverse views it is the same when it comes to learning to live with covid nineteen on the one hand we have the young vaccinated individuals who feel that we should open up and allow vaccinated individuals to enjoy more social activities on the other hand we still have a sizable segment of older singaporeans who for medical or other reasons are yet to be vaccinated and who remain vulnerable differentiated safe management measures is something we will have to put in place for public health reasons and to protect the unvaccinated but at the same time we must do our best to get more of the vulnerable vaccinated just now as i reported just now we are making progress as for the non vulnerable as more of you get vaccinated when you show more consideration to others you are also doing your part to better protect the vulnerable remember our children our nieces and nephews younger brothers and sisters under twelve will not be vaccinated for a while yet so when we work together as a people we will bring ourselves to a much stronger and more resilient position in our transition to living with covid will gather pace mister deputy speaker sir singapore is one of the few countries to have come through the last twenty months of the pandemic with very few fatalities and we can look forward with confidence to living with endemic covid nineteen because a high proportion of our population will be fully vaccinated most of the developing world still has little access to vaccines and even amongst the countries and regions which have vaccines singapore is unique because we have one group including us uk israel many eu countries which went through major episodes of widespread transmission hospitals overwhelmed with many fatalities they are now highly vaccinated and opening up their economies and societies and then there is another group the likes of australia new zealand hong kong maybe south korea who kept the pandemic under control but but are now finding it a challenge to get their people vaccinated partly because their lives have not been very threatened by covid nineteen and this will make us perhaps the only country in the world which has not suffered a collapse of our hospitals nor high death toll and at the same time achieve a very high vaccination rate in our population and this uniqueness is due to the unity of our people the trust amongst them and between people and government mister deputy speaker sir we can look towards the road ahead with confidence and optimism thank you the minister for trade and industry and minister for finance will be making related ministerial statements i will allow members to raise points of clarification on all three statements after the 3rd statement minister gan thank you mister deputy speaker minister ong ye kung has given members an update on the covid nineteen situation let me now share with members our journey out of phase two heightened alert and towards a covid resilient state from the point of view of businesses about a month ago the mtf co chairs wrote a commentary outlining a future where singapore can live normally with covid nineteen the virus is likely to become endemic eventually like influenza with the vast majority of us protected against the severe outcome of the virus as long as we are fully vaccinated we are not there yet and we need to press on with vaccination especially among the elderly as we journey towards this destination we were never under the illusion that it would be straightforward and we expected to face a few bumps along the way the ktv and jurong fishery port clusters are cases in point like minister ong i received many questions on whether our decision to return to phase two heightened alert signals a reversal of our plan to transition to a covid endemic state the answer is a clear no we are determined to get to our destination of being a covid resilient singapore but our journey must take into account public health realities sometimes we may need to take a detour if we can if we see hazards ahead this way we can ensure that we will get to our final destination safely even though it may take a little longer the last onefive years has been a very difficult ride for our businesses this is particularly so for sectors that are more affected by the tightening of safe management measures such as f and b retail sports and gyms and performance arts i know that the impact on them must be very severe minister wong and i met the f and b and retailers trade associations last week we appreciated their feedback which helped mti and mof design the support packages for them as well as for the other affected businesses at the same time i am also heartened to see that many businesses have adapted their operations in response to the challenges food establishments and retail shops have leveraged online platforms and gyms have turned to virtual classes or move some of their classes outdoors nevertheless we know that these efforts are insufficient to fully compensate for the loss of income from their usual business model the aviation tourism and mice sectors have also been severely impacted due to travel restrictions with changi airport is passenger load at only around three of pre covid levels three not thirty three of pre covid levels demand in these sectors have plummeted some firms have pivoted to adjacent areas for example singapore airlines is now using some of its passenger planes to operate cargo flights to take advantage of the increase in cargo traffic while operators in the tourism sector have come up with new and creative products to attract local visitors as foreign tourists have dried up the singapore rediscover vouchers would have helped them somewhat the construction marine and process sectors are also under tremendous pressure they have had to make difficult but necessary worksite adjustments to protect workers health and safety at the same time they have had to deal with labor shortages as a result many have faced project cancellations and delays or shied away from taking on new projects we fully understand the challenges and uncertainties that our businesses and their workers are going through since the start of this pandemic mti has worked closely with industry and other government agencies to help businesses cope we delivered eight budgets over onefive years including the supplementary supply bill that we will be debating later to marshall resources to support businesses and protect jobs we introduced several schemes such as a job support scheme jobs growth initiative rental relief and tax rebates we ensure that firms that ran into casual problems could gain access to credit by enhancing our enterprise financing schemes and working with the banks to put in place a moratorium on loan repayment together these efforts have helped avert massive business failures a much deeper recession and higher unemployment businesses and workers have told us that while these support measures have been critical and helpful they can only serve as temporary pain relief they would much prefer to resume their business fully and for the economy to grow again many are therefore transforming their businesses to seek out new opportunities and prepare for the recovery i think this is the right attitude to have even as we manage the short term impact of the pandemic we should not lose sight of the fu future covid nineteen has wrecked havoc on almost every single economy in the world but those which can respond well and take the opportunity to adapt and transform quickly will emerge stronger and move ahead of others to ensure that we do not get left behind once the dust settles we must turn this once in a generation crisis into a once in a generation opportunity to transform our businesses to develop new areas of growth and strengthen our connections to the global economy we recognize that it is not easy for businesses to juggle everyday challenges during the pandemic and the need to change and transform for the future we need focused efforts this is why we set up the emerging stronger task force or est at the height of the crisis in may last year to look at how singapore should refresh and reimagine our economic strategies going forward the est formed nine alliances for action or afas as a new model of public private partnership to allow our businesses to move quickly and bounce back stronger some of the afas have delivered promising results for ex for example the afa on safe and innovative visitor experiences enabled us to testbed several ideas for safe mice events which provided some relief for the mice sector while also elevating its international profile the afa on supply chain digitalization saw the growing demand for supply chain transparency and resilience and created sg tradex which stands for singapore trade data exchange as a digital infrastructure sg tradex allows businesses to share data with each other in the trusted and safe manner thereby allowing them to optimize the supply chain flows through singapore with more trades coming through singapore our position as a key note in the global supply chain is further strengthened for sectors that are doing well despite the pandemic the government is focus is to add wind to their sales to help them create new products forge new partnerships and break into new markets these include the financial ict biomedical manufacturing and the electronic sectors in particular the biomedical manufacturing sector expanded significantly by almost 25 last year while the electronic sector grew around twelve point half twelvefive the afa on medtech development medtech product development is another good example of our new partnerships recognizing the increasing prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases it identified in vitro diagnostics as a key sub sector that we can grow we will continue to work closely with industry and partner businesses in this endeavor to give them the support they need to raise their productivity innovate and grow beyond our shores we will also help workers to be ready for the challenges in the new normal as businesses transform to remain competitive and seize new opportunities workers will also need to learn new knowledge and acquire new skills the need for workers to upgrade and upskill is more urgent than ever the government is committed to walking this journey with our workers every step of the way we introduced the skilled future movement in 2015 and intensified our efforts through the sg united jobs and skills package since the pandemic started we will work with the ministry of manpower and the unions to encourage and support workers to tap on these schemes to stay relevant in their current job or retrain to enter new jobs i also call on employers to continue working with the government and the tripartite partners to upgrade and redesign jobs and invest in workforce training even as we plan ahead we know that businesses are naturally concerned about what an endemic state means for their daily operations and the adjustments they may need to make as we get there let me sketch out the path forward and give businesses a sense of what to expect to help them plan ahead some of the details are still being finalized and we will share them in the future as our vaccination coverage increases we will be in a much stronger position to ease our covid nineteen measures and safely and confidently we will begin to adjust our safe management measures in stages while keeping an eye on the number of serious cases for example restrictions on social gatherings will ease and we can expect larger dining dining in group sizes and lower requirements and higher capacity for various events we will take a differentiated approach vaccinated individuals will be able to engage in a wider range of social activities and in larger groups while those who are unvaccinated will only be able to do so with a negative pre event test result with this f and b retail and other businesses that provide in person services such as gyms and beauty services will see a return in demand sectors such as tourism crews and mice will also get some relief as capacity limits are progressively raised although foreign tourists will still take some time to return workplace restrictions will also be eased and progressively more workers can go back to office businesses will be able to conduct important face to face meetings or whole workplace events that are important for networking or team bonding businesses can do several things to prepare for reopening 1st encourage and facilitate all medically eligible employees especially those involved in high touch point activities to get vaccinated and deploy those who cannot be vaccinated to low risk lower risk settings 2nd integrate the use of a r t self tests into your work processes especially for businesses that provide high touch point services or which tap on a pool of workers that frequently change encourage employees to self isolate and get themselves tested if they are not feeling well or if they are if they suspect that they may have been exposed to covid nineteen doing so can help detect cases early and limit the extent of disruption to your businesses i know of several employers who have made bulk purchases of testing kits so their staff can easily access them if needed this is a good idea and i encourage more employers to do so and 3rd continue allowing flexible work arrangements and putting in place business continuity plans to strengthen operational resilience we are also looking at relaxing our border restrictions safely as a small and open economy we simply do not have the luxury of closing ourselves off to the world many parts of the economy require a steady flow of people in and out of singapore be it workers or visitors as a business hub many of our executives have to travel to manage and grow their regional businesses our tourism and mice industry as well as our air hub status also critically depend on international connectivity we should also not forget the international community based here many have not been able to return home to visit their family since the start of the pandemic this is because if they go home they may not be able to return to singapore there are also singaporeans whose loved ones are stranded overseas this has not been easy for many of them therefore as our vaccination coverage increases and the majority of residents here are protected against covid nineteen we will also progressively facilitate international travel with countries that have managed covid nineteen well and allow fully vaccinated persons to travel and to do business more freely this is a critical move that will allow us to reassert singapore is position as a business travel and talent hub we are working this out carefully and engaging our partner countries and will provide more details when ready we will continue to push for higher vaccination coverage and if the incidence of severe illness from covid nineteen remains low despite clusters emerging from time to time we will eventually be able to arrive at a truly endemic state practically all social and workplace restrictions can be lifted although some critical measures such as mask wearing and precautions for large events may remain this means that domestically infected cases will create much less disruption than they do today and our businesses can largely return to normal operations for the majority of cases businesses will not have to shut down their premises for deep cleaning and we need not commit huge resources towards contact tracing instead infected individuals with mild symptoms may be able to recover from home and closed contacts will likely just be required to monitor their health without the need for quarantine or self isolation this is similar to how we treat influenza cases today globally singapore will likely be one of the hi highest vaccinated countries in the world we will be able to regain strong air and maritime connectivity to a large number of countries while ensuring that our healthcare system is well functioning and not overstretched by covid nineteen cases this will make us one of the best places to work and live in the region and across the world businesses have in fact continued to show confidence in our strong fundamentals during the pandemic despite the challenging environment investors committed $17200000000 in investment in 2020 the highest in twelve years more recently we also attracted significant investment from major biomedical and electronics companies such as sanofi in april biontech in may and global foundries in ju in june but we cannot take this for granted we will continue to work hard to pursue projects that help companies grow and create new jobs and meaningful career meaningful careers for singaporeans before i end i would like to thank singaporeans our businesses and our workers for walking this journey with us for the last eighteen months it has been tremendously difficult for many of you and we are deeply appreciative of the commitment and grit you have shown we are so close to reaching the end of the tunnel we will soon achieve a high vaccination coverage which will allow us to move decisively to a covid resilient state i want to appeal to everyone to not lose heart and work together to press on in our journey thank you minister wong mister deputy speaker sir like many countries around the world our fight against covid nineteen has been difficult and full of ups and downs the latest outbreak is a major setback for all of us many have been surprised at the size of these new clusters it shows how easy it is for the delta variant to spread and cause large outbreaks with the potential to overwhelm our hospital system furthermore in a mixed population of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons we are more likely to see large clusters because vaccinated persons can be infected but experience very mild symptoms consequently they may not realize they are infected and inadvertently become asymptomatic carriers by the time the cases pop up days or even weeks would have passed and the infection would have spread to many people because of these large clusters we faced a heightened risk of widespread community transmission before we attained adequate vaccine protection we must remember the proportion of people with two doses and with two weeks after their 2nd dose 2nd shot is still less than fifty this is when we moved into the heightened alert and we are especially worried about our seniors because there are still over 200000 seniors above six aged sixty and above who are not fully vaccinated if they catch the virus many will likely become severely ill or even succumb to the infection and that is why as you heard just now from my co chairs the mtf made the difficult decision to scale back activities and return to phase two heightened alert this will help to slow down transmission in the community and crucially this will give us time to push up vaccination rates further and protect our seniors i know the restrictions have caused much inconvenience to everyone we seek your forbearance and understanding i hope our explanations will help you understand why we had to reintroduce these painful but necessary measures to protect our seniors we also know these measures are will be difficult for our workers and businesses and that is why mof introdu announced a new $1100000000 support package last friday to cushion the impact i will elaborate on this in my statement later this afternoon on the supplementary supply bill and we hope the support measures will help affected workers and businesses tied over the heightened alert period as we bring the current outbreak under control and continue to speed up vaccinations we will be able to get our reopening plans back on track the key is to open up at the correct juncture some countries have decided to open up fully even though their vaccination rates are less than ideal for example the netherlands lifted all restrictions when 45 of its population was fully vaccinated cases surged tenfold to an average of 10000 a day within two weeks they have since reimposed restrictions the uk has about 55 of its population fully vaccinated although its coverage of its seniors is much higher at above ninety it lifted all restrictions on 19th of july it is freedom day cases surged to 50000 a day more than two thirds of its peak in the last wave and are likely to rise further hospitalization and death rates are starting to creep up again almost entirely amongst unvaccinated individuals we are watching what is happening in these countries very closely what is clear to the multi ministry task force and our medical advisors is that we should be very careful about lifting restrictions when a significant proportion of our people are still not fully vaccinated especially our more vulnerable seniors while other countries may have come to terms with a certain level of covid nineteen cases and even deaths this is not the choice we want to make in singapore here we look out for one another and we take care of each other we do not want to see large numbers of covid nineteen patients in intensive care on oxygen supplementation let alone succumb to the virus so we must give our fellow singaporeans more time today many younger singaporeans are still waiting for their 2nd doses of vaccines and many of our seniors who had been hesitant about getting vaccinated are now starting to step forward so we will see continued improvements in our vaccination rates at the same time there is no need to wait for everyone to be vaccinated before we begin to open up that would mean holding back the entire reopening timeline until much later in the year which is not tenable so what is our approach let me explain we will synchronize our reopening with our vaccination coverage not just of the overall population but also amongst our seniors who are the most vulnerable and we will do so in a series of controlled steps so this is what we can all expect in the weeks ahead in early august at the midpoint of the phase two heightened alert period we plan to review the current set of measures we will assess the overall infection situation we will also monitor the status of the infected cases to confirm that the link between infection and hospitalization has been weakened by the vaccines like in the chart just now which minister ong showed importantly by then two thirds of our population would have received two doses and we would have vaccinated about three quarters of our seniors aged seventy and above so if the clusters are under control and hospitalization rates remain low we will be able to ease some of the phase two heightened alert measures but the easing will be differentiated and extended to only vaccinated persons because they are much better protected against the effects of the virus this means that if you want to attend a large event or religious service involving more than 100 persons you have to be fully vaccinated if you want to go out to dine in a restaurant or work out in a gym you have to be fully vaccinated by around early september we expect to vaccinate about eighty of our population with two doses and we hope to cover a similar proportion of our seniors aged seventy and above we will then be able to ease the restrictions further including allowing larger groups to get together especially if they are fully vaccinated we will also begin to reopen our borders especially for vaccinated persons to travel we will start by establishing travel corridors with countries or regions that have managed covid nineteen well and where the infection is similarly under control so fully vaccinated persons will then be able to travel to these countries or regions without needing to serve the full fourteen day stay home notice in a hotel when they return depending on the risk level of the country they visit we will either replace the shn with a rigorous testing regime or shorten the shn to seven days at home and this will allow vaccinated persons to travel more freely those who are not vaccinated can still travel but will be subject to the prevailing shn requirements beyond that we will continue with a series of progressive easings as we do so we must expect cases to rise partly because there is still ongoing cryptic transmission in our community which can easily break out into new clusters with increased activity levels also as we open our borders for people to travel without shn we will see more imported cases and infected persons slipping through from time to time but at that stage as you heard just now our main focus will no longer be on daily case numbers because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they catch the virus they are much less likely to become very ill instead our focus will be on the much smaller number of infected persons who need supplementary oxygen or require intensive care so at each stage of easing we will monitor the health outcomes especially the hospitalization and icu cases closely we will ensure that these remain acceptable and stable before we proceed to the next step but if hospitalization cases or or worse severe illnesses were to shoot up we will have to be prepared to slow down or even pull back in particular we have to expect new variants to emerge which may be more transmissible more lethal or more successful at evading the present vaccines we will find solutions to these variants especially through booster shots or updated vaccines which we may need to roll out nationwide but we must be prepared that the new variants can lead to more severe outbreaks and may well force us to introduce restrictions again from time to time in short there are still considerable uncertainties about how the pandemic will unfold globally but our best bet is to push ahead with a high level of vaccine coverage for our people this will give us the best chance to resume more normal lives while keeping our morbidity and mortality rates low i have provided an overview of the roadmap for our transition to a covid resilient society where we learn to live with covet nineteen as part of our daily lives the mtf is still flashing out the details and we will share more when ready i assure everyone that we are committed to seeing through these plans the current heightened alert is a temporary limited timeout with better vaccination coverage we will soon be able to resume our plans to reopen progressively while keeping everyone safe but i underline vaccination is key especially vaccination for our seniors if many more many among our seniors are not vaccinated we will continue to worry about our hospitalization and icu cases as well as fatalities so i make a special plea to all who remain unvaccinated or have not registered to be vaccinated especially our parents and grandparents please come forward and if you can not get out of the house we will send a team to your homes for the vaccination as part of our controlled and phased reopening safe management measures will remain will still remain relevant and important basic smms like keeping a safe distance from others and wearing a mask can help reduce transmission effectively so we must stay disciplined and continue to maintain these practices even as we transition towards the new normal for example we would probably not want to do away completely with our mask requirements we may consider dispensing with masks when outdoors but it would still make sense to wear them in an indoor enclosed environment where transmission risks are greater so this may well be one of the last rules to go in the new normal at the same time we will continue with our regular enforcement checks and take strict strict actions against any breaches of the rules several members have asked about asked questions about this especially how our nightlife establishments are monitored and i believe minister shanmugam will be sharing more on this especially efforts by mha and the police later too but let me just say that our enforcement agencies are doing everything they can in very challenging circumstances since april last year a multi agency task force comprising various government agencies including the police have been coordinating the enforcement of safe management and safe distancing measures in public venues including f and b outlets and massage and spa establishments they have been doing daily enforcement checks where laws were flouted offenders both operators and individuals have been taken to task and cases publicized our sdas and enforcement officers will continue to do their best and we should give them our full support most importantly we must all do our part and continue to exercise individual and social responsibility we cannot rely on enforcement efforts alone to get us through this pandemic our society will be much safer if we demonstrate social solidarity and a collective sense of responsibility to do the right things together there are a few simple but very effective precautions which we should all incorporate into our daily routines and we have said this probably like a 1000000 times but i think it is worth repeating practice good hygiene if you are not feeling well stay home see a doctor and get yourself tested do so even if you are vaccinated remember what i said earlier at the start that vaccinated persons can get infected and may feel very mild symptoms or even no symptoms so if you even if you are feeling unwell vaccinated feeling unwell but very mild symptoms get yourself tested if you receive an sms alert come forward to be tested as soon as possible and minimize your social interactions until you have a confirmed negative test result there is really no excuse not to be tested since testing is now more affordable accessible and convenient than it used to be and will continue to be so in the future the antigen rapid test kits the self test kits are widely available at all general retailers now if you buy in bulk it is cheaper too so you can buy a few and have it at home the mtf is also distributing these test kits to households we are starting with those who live near markets where large clusters have been identified and we will progressively scale up and distribute to everyone in singapore and as you heard just now we are also rolling out new methods of testing for be it waste water surveillance in our estates or breathalyzer tests at our checkpoints and now we have the breathalyzer test in parliament too before each parliamentary session so regular testing and the social consciousness to get ourselves tested regularly will protect us and keep us safe as we transit to the new normal mister deputy speaker sir we are all disheartened and upset when we hear of people breaking the rules acting irresponsibly and causing new classes to break out but over the past year and a half the vast majority of singaporeans have shown tremendous discipline many have also been working tirelessly in our fight against covid nineteen it is not just our healthcare workers like our doctors and nurses at our hospitals clinics and community care facilities it is also our fellow singaporeans on the front lines elsewhere some in less expected settings others in less visible places they include our safe distancing ambassadors food delivery riders cleaners and many more they work hard to keep singapore going and to keep all of us safe like mister lok chun kiet a cleaner with cbm private limited he attends to high risk locations where positive cases have been detected the cleaning work that he does is not easy under normal circumstances but now with the exposure to the virus he and his team have to be have to put on full ppe and adhere closely to stringent procedures while they work it is because of people like chun kiet and his team that we are able to quickly deep clean our infected premises and minimize the risk of formide transmission or miss siti zulana binti muhammad zayed a senior medical technologist with the national public health laboratory at the ncid she leads the team to investigate outbreaks and undertake testing surveillance it is mission critical work that requires long hours stretching into weekends and public holidays you can imagine the load coming through recently with the surge of cases we have had in the community it is because of people like siti and her team that we are able to detect and ring fence infections early there are many more chun kiets and sitis out there many more unsung heroes and heroines quietly and steadfastly contributing to our fight against covid nineteen i am sure the entire house will join me in saying to all of them a big heartfelt thank you sir these actions of our fellow singaporeans inspire us and give us confidence and hope that we will get through this together we are all disappointed by the latest outbreak and the heightened alert restrictions but we will recover and bounce back it is always darkest before the dawn so let us be strong and keep the faith the dawn is coming let us approach it with renewed strength as one people thank you mister deputy speaker sir minister k shanmugam thank you mister deputy speaker i would like to address some of the questions that have been raised in relation to enforcement against ktv outlets specifically in this house and outside there have been a number of questions related to ktvs why were ktvs and nightclubs allowed to operate as f and b outlets the enforcement regime in respect of these outlets the why were hostesses allowed in those places and the immigration status of those providing hostessing service at these places for example i can refer to a facebook post by mister allen john former editor straight times raising some of these questions in a very succinct way and making a number of fair points based on his understanding of the facts and i will address these questions 1st why were ktvs allowed to change into f and b operations during the circuit breaker last year nightlife outlets were shut from 27th of march 2020 together with many other businesses from phase two which june 2020 many businesses were allowed to reopen including dine in at f and b outlets massage establishments were also allowed to open with conditions but ktvs were not allowed to reopen we took a stricter approach with ktvs because singing was considered a high risk activity in a indoor setting and a higher risk of transmission in august of 2020 the singapore nightlife business association call them snba and the singapore entertainment affiliation sea other associations as well as individual businesses appealed for ktvs to reopen they had been closed by then for several months jobs livelihoods of those in the ktv industries the workers their jobs were at risk badly affected even with financial support from the government our assessment is that they probably employed about 10000 local workers as of end 2019 some of us met directly with the ktv businesses in august of 2020 listened to them there were several town hall sessions they asked to have singing dancing to resume and they proposed a pilot with a maximum of five persons in a room masks would be worn when not singing and disposable microphone covers would be used and they refer to other countries including south korea where this had been allowed others proposed changing their business models to f and b outlets they needed to help they needed help to get new permits changed their use for f and b and so on and for many the situation was desperate we considered their suggestions weighed the risks at one time we considered possibly allowing a pilot project for ktvs with very strict conditions but eventually we did not proceed so the 1st point to note is from march of 2020 until now ktv operations remain forbidden it is illegal to have any kind of ktv operations alright we did not allow those then the group that had asked to move over to provide f and b on a temporary basis we said okay to that with again with several conditions why because basically anyone can offer and open an f and b outlet and the government can not specifically say no to ktv outlets which want to become f and b outlets provided they have the space to be an f and b premises allow f and b outlets and can get approval from sfa land use permissions and so on so and conditions were imposed the pivoted businesses would need a food preparation area to prepare and serve food adequate indoor dining area for customers to be seated to have their meals with safe distancing in place and once converted to f and b they were subject to the same safe management measures smms imposed on f and b outlets meaning no inter mingling amongst patrons and staff no live music no performances various other conditions so in summary since from march 2020 until now one ktvs were not allowed to operate and two some ktvs were allowed to become f and b outlets as well as some pubs and bars which they were also allowed to pivot to f and b outlets so if you look at as of march of this year after several months of operations of these massage establishments former pubs bars ktv businesses pivoting to being f and b outlets and so on situation was stable numbers of cases infections was generally low so that is a context in the background to why pubs bars ktv outlets were allowed to pivot and provide f and b two it has been suggested that we should have assumed or known that ktv operators will cheat allow themselves to become semi brothels even though they were only allowed to provide f and b and there have been suggestions ranging from we were in effect in cahoots with ktvs which is a suggestion in a recent quite unbalanced nikkei article or alternatively be very naive not to realize what happens in ktvs the truth is we were neither in cahoots with the ktv operators nor are we as naive as some suggest now let me explain i think most people will accept it will be wrong to treat all the 430 odd businesses ktv operators pubs bars who want to change to provide f and b automatically as crooks several are genuine operators they want to pivot over to provide f and b that is the only way they can survive if you ask snba sea there are ktvs which cater to families there are many which do legitimate business and they were crying out for help so more than 400 such businesses converted and about a 100 exited the nightlife industry at the same time as we were considering this yes mtf government does know that there are some ktv operations pubs bars with dodgy reputations should we have said to them no you cannot convert to f and b and for some if you look at their premises darkened rooms not the most optimal for dining and people might well say why would i want to go here for dining it appears commonsensical to say this is dodgy and doubtful but in law it is not so straightforward if the person comes to you and says yes i want to convert and i will keep to the rules you know this is how i was i was my business was perfectly legal in the past and now i will continue to be legal then the agencies will have to look him in the eye and say you can not get a license to become a food place because we do not think you are going to keep to the law in future we think you are going to break the law even though you have committed no offense and even though you confirm that you will follow the rules so i will come back to this later so in addition to seeing if we can say no to those with dodgy reputations part of the answer has got to be enforcement and i will also say realistically the people who are going to cheat going to do illegal things will do them anyway they will use lounges flats warehouses various places it has gone on and i am sure it goes on regardless of whether we allow the change to f and b and there have been several illegal operations in different places outside of ktv outlets or x ktv outlets which have been busted so as of november 2020 it was a risk assessed approach and in general it was working if you look at it as of march this year with a relatively low number of cases we then had the delta variant completely different transmissibility that variant came into the ktvs created a cluster there is some public confusion minister for health my colleague has spoken about it a number of times to clarify it the confusion that you know the ktv cluster was somehow the reason for the recent phase two heightened alert tightened restrictions imposed on 22nd of july and that is not so he has clarified it that is not so if we had had only the ktb cluster then we would not have had to move to phase two h a or the tightened restrictions in fact the mtf as he pointed out considered the ktv cluster and decided we can manage it without having to impose any additional restrictions and as he said in his speech the ktv cluster has been brought under control fairly quickly tracing testing ring fencing the cases so we have what about five new cases linked to the ktb cluster each day for the past few days he gave you the figures i have the figures as of 24th of july 232 cases 49 in hospital none have been or are in icu so let me summarize by making three points about 430 businesses pivoted to f and b for several months cases infections overall in singapore were low the new delta variant caused a ktv cluster that has been brought under control and three if if we were facing only the ktv cluster there would have been no need for any tightened measures tightening of the measures is due to the cluster at the jurong fishery port they spread from the ports to the markets and the hawkers and into the wider community my colleagues have explained how this happened some are under the im misimpression that the virus went from the ktvs to the fisheries port the evidence we have does not suggest that the virus seems to have come from the region to our port jfp now with this background there is a life issue which i will share with the members the snba has sent an open letter appealed for the industry to work more closely with the government to report illegal activities among other things and they have also pointed out pivoting has helped many legitimate businesses to survive so should we allow them to reopen and continue as s f and b operations this brings me to the earlier question i posed some of them when you look at the premises you do question if they can really be f and b but it requires us to say flat out to the operators regardless of what you say i am not going to believe you and i am not going to allow you to operate an f and b agencies are working on the conditions that can be imposed like cctvs various other conditions over and above what is applied to f and b outlets they will also have to consult with agc can we say no to an operator if we think it might be dodgy even with the operators undertake to comply with the conditions it is not so straightforward once these issues are assessed mtf has to decide on whether the opening or reopening can be allowed i will now deal with the questions which have been raised on enforcement the period october 2020 to 10th of july 2021 the police conducted 202 operations against pivoted outlets as well as other outlets which were operating illegally so this is what i said earlier you know assume we had said no to all pivoting of f and b operations there would still be places which offer sex and meet up opportunities that was always going to happen so we had one police operation every single day on average since october 2020 so this i think should put to rest any questions about enforcement actions by the police one operation every day and that has resulted in the detection of 58 public entertainment act liquor control act infringements 595 smm breaches 142 arrests for offenses under various laws including the public entertainment act liquor control act employment of foreign manpower act immigration act not all in pivoted places but also in completely illegal operations to share a few example in october of 2020 police raided units along ubi road and kallang pudding road 57 persons were investigated for breach of smms in november genting lane 24 persons were investigated for breach of smms ten women were arrested for work pass related offenses in february 2021 at emerald hill road and again at genting lane 88 persons investigated for breach of smms one man arrested for working without a valid work permit in april at kitchener road and verdun road 45 persons investigated for breach of smms seven men and one woman arrested in all the cases items such as karaoke equipment liquor was seized operators are being investigated enforcement operations were also conducted over twenty weekends at every single festive occasion since october of 2020 about 400 f and b outlets including pivoted outlets were inspected in each operation today agencies have imposed around 100 closure orders on f and b outlets including on about forty pivoted outlets as i said to the house just now there were about 437 pivoted outlets so roughly ten have been acting illegally and about sixty other f and b outlets also were in breach so sfa has permanently revoked the food license of seven pivoted outlets as of 23rd of july so let me now move to this business of hostesses hostesses since the onset of covid nineteen the rules are that hostessing is not allowed in any setting the women who are caught were likely in breach of their visit or work past conditions and they were operating illegally and the 1st woman much attention has centered on her linked to the ktv cluster had come into singapore in february of 2021 through the boyfriend girlfriend category under the what we call a familial ties lane i will refer to it as ftl sponsored by a singapore citizen who applied for her on the basis that he was her boyfriend and let me explain this boyfriend girlfriend category at the start of covid nineteen last year we banned short term visitors from coming into singapore so as of september last year the ban on short term visitors continued basically only singapore residents can come back some of their relatives and some business travelers october last year we introduced flexibility to allow boyfriends and girlfriends to come into singapore and why we had almost a complete ban on short term visitors so boyfriends girlfriends could not come in there were many appeals and for background reference you know in the ten years between 2000 to 2019 there were about a 120000 singapore citizens who married in non resident marriages about one in four marriages between singaporeans and non singaporean partners so it is quite common for singaporeans to have relationships with non singaporeans this boyfriend girlfriend category was specifically introduced in the context of the ban on short term visitors to allow singaporeans who are in relationships with foreign partners to be reunited because they have been separated for a long time due to border restrictions and this was after numerous appeals on this were received meanwhile there was a parallel development around september october 2020 we announced the unilateral opening to specific countries and regions which were lower covid risk including vietnam brunei new zealand australia except victoria state our assessment was the risk of importation of the virus was assessed to be low vietnam specifically had a comprehensive public health surveillance system had displayed successful control over covid at that time and the last week four weeks of september 2020 it had zero local covid cases so under the unilateral opening travelers could seek entry into singapore by applying for an air travel pass and this means short term travelers from these countries were allowed to come in in february 2021 due to the worsening covid situation in vietnam we suspended the unilateral opening between singapore and vietnam which meant that short term travelers from vietnam could not come in from february 2021 under the unilateral opening ica then began to receive many applications for vietnamese to come into singapore under the boyfriend girlfriend category and people are quite s skeptical no i was not going to say skeptical i said i was going to say inventive so to emphasize once we suspended the unilateral opening of vietnam in february of 2021 there were many applications under the boyfriend girlfriend category we looked at it scratched our heads the applications raised concerns because i will just give examples in several examples you know there will be one vietnamese applicant and multiple sponsors claiming to be the ladies boyfriend there will be singaporean sponsors many who applied for multiple girlfriends it is possible but you know sponsors who already married to someone else applying many men claiming to be a single lady is boyfriend i mentioned it earlier and sponsors who are unable to substantiate when we ask questions what relationship do you really have with this person who is proposed to become sponsored but as members of parliament will know you know the residents will come to the mps and say i am a singapore citizen i have done national service why not allowing my girlfriend to come in we all have received such appeals ica received but when we looked at these applications for girlfriends and they are all primarily girlfriends to come in we decided this will not do we have to stop this so in march of 2021 this girlfriend boyfriend category was removed so you can no longer appeal for a boyfriend or girlfriend to come in so ica moved quite fast right february the unilateral opening of vietnam was suspended the next month in march the boyfriend girlfriend category was scrapped because we took the view that this was being abused so we created this category boyfriend girlfriend during a pandemic last year october because we wanted to be compassionate now i mean if you wanted to rank the organizations in terms of compassion i do not think most people will put ica as number one on the list but and mha will not usually be accused of being the most compassionate either but we did want to try and be compassionate and help helpful because of the number of appeals and people want their loved ones to come in and we want to try and help but if the system is abused then we have to stop it if it is mutated we have to stop it but unfortunately what that has meant is that many legitimate applications are now being refused ica has also taken action against in respect of dodgy applications by rescinding the approvals barring the travelers from entry into singapore and suspending the sponsors and travelers from future applications apart from the ftl category we have other avenues for foreigners to enter into singapore during this pandemic but very limited they include mom is work pass holder lane and moe is student pass holder lane where applicants are required to submit the application to mom and moe respectively for entry approval and are subject to screening obviously there are also short term visitors who are already in singapore before the border controls were imposed in march of 2020 and for these persons ica assesses the application for extensions of their short term visit pass on a case by case basis it takes into consideration factors including restrictions on international travel flight availability and whether the applicants have family ties in singapore so tying that back to the police operations against nightlife outlets recent operations 29 women aged between twenty and 47 of various nationalities have been arrested for offenses under the employment of foreign manpower act and other laws the 29 include permanent residents work pass holders s pass holders short term pass holders one who came in under the unilateral opening five who had come in under the girlfriend category long term visit pass holders other passes student pass dependence pass permanent residents unlikely to have committed any offense except for maybe safe distancing measures others on work pass would be in breach of their work past conditions if they were performing services as hostess but those on visit passes would be in breach as well by working without a work permit but if they say they were not working then we have to show that they were in breach and it is often cat and mouse and as members will know we can not use the trace together data for this so so far sixteen women have had their passes canceled and they have been or will be deported investigations are ongoing in respect of the other women and of course the operators operations some of them are pivoted outlets several of them are not you know in other places in warehouses and so on and we continuously have to look for them rely on tip offs as well as our own intelligence and keep trying to keep it under control so i think i have dealt with many of the questions that have been raised thank you mister pritam singh thank you mister deputy speaker i have a few questions for minister mti mister gan kim yong and originally minister of health but i think i will direct them to the minister of home affairs the 1st series of questions pertain to the differentiated regime between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals which is a part of the coming to terms with the endemic state of treating covid nineteen as endemic in the community this refers the query pertains to the negative pre event tests that unvaccinated individuals will be required to undertake i think a few days ago in israel the prime minister announced that the individual the unvaccinated individual there will pay for the test i do not believe minister clarified who pays for that test in singapore it will be helpful for minister to clarify that the 2nd question directed at minister gan pertains to supply issues of the vaccine i think previously in updates that the mtf had given is this still a problem or are we on track to open the economy in con in concert with the plan that mtf has announced by i believe september now the question specifically on the kt ktv issues indeed as minister ong i mentioned earlier lots of disappointment among singaporeans but i thought it will be important to have at least some understanding of common facts before coming to conclusions so the 1st question is with regard to the enforcement regime at the pivoted establishments was it a heightened sort of enforcement regime minister mentioned a few numbers 202 enforcements from october last year to july this year but was there some specific attention paid on pivoted ktv esta pivoted establish pivoted ktv establishments i think earlier on minister wong spoke in a facebook post about a cat and mouse game a minister referred to that as well was there were additional conditions imposed on certain operators in view of their past record or reputation so to speak and in this regard again was there a differentiated regime from the enforcement agencies to pay more attention to some of these establishments ministers spoke of some i think at a total of seven establishments and and i stand corrected if i am wrong seven establishments that have seen their licenses revoked but that about ten of the establishment of the pivoted ktv establishments have been in breach of regulation so are those or are the licenses for those for that ten which i think would extend to about forty establishments are going to be revoked as well and finally i received some emails from members of the public about warnings that they had given the authorities about some of these ktv establishments how many warnings or feedback did how many pieces of feedback did not just mha but also moh and the other agencies receive on potential smm violations egregious smm violations in ktv establishments thank you minister gan thank you mister deputy speaker let me 1st address the question on the economic reopening it is still on on on track and the key is to look at the progress in our vaccination program and our vaccination program as a minister for health explained just now is picking up a momentum but it is important for us to focus a lot more on the vaccination of our senior population which is of a greater concern to all of us and therefore i think we continue to be on track with our economic opening and once as soon as we are able to reach our vaccination rate of eighty and above round about september or october i think we will be able to move in a bigger way in the opening of the economy but i also also want to point out that we are not likely to have a big bang opening to allow everything to be done in one go because it is important for us as a minister ong and i mentioned earlier to continue to monitor the impact on the severe cases because if we do have a serious cases we will then have a problem with the capacity of a healthcare system which will then result in a high mortality rate so we need to continue to keep an eye on our serious number of serious cases look at the trend of these serious cases at the same time making sure that our vaccination rate is high then we will be able to progressively step by step open up our economy and open up our borders to allow travel in and out of singapore and as i mentioned my speech these details are still being worked out and we will share more details later on i will ask mister wong to talk about testing because this relates to the national policy on testing thank you the question i believe was about who pays for the cost of tests if the person is unvaccinated to get into a venue well the rule will be the thinking is that the rule is for certain activities certain settings we will require vaccinated persons only and from the government side the rule will be that if the person is not vaccinated not fully vaccinated then he will have to produce a negative test a confirmed negative test that is the requirement now how to go about that we will let venue operators and owners decide they may want to do it free they may want to set up an operation a restaurant might want to do that a venue operator might want to do that a mice event organizer might want to do that because he says look i want to allow you know do that to let unvaccinated persons come in if not then he may well say look it is up to the individual the individual has to go to the clinic get a test and then show me the results so government sets the rule the framework i think individual organizations that then are looking at the framework can decide whether or not they want to provide the test for their customers or they would require the customers to get the test from a clinic minister shanmugam thank you as i noted it i think there were four questions if i got it right from mister singh 1st on the enforcement regime i think mister singh wanted to know if it is heightened i think mister can assume that if there was one enforcement action per day it is quite intense and it has been so from october of last year to july of this year right from the beginning and this is quite apart from what safe distance ambassadors and so on do 2nd i think mister singh wanted to know was there a particular focus on pivoted outlets i gave the breakdown just now not all were targeted pivoted outlets in fact there were a number who were not to be operating at all and in fact totally illegal operations and i would say in terms of seriousness those are particularly pernicious in terms of transmission the kind of activities and so on and nothing is supposed to be happening in a warehouse they set up it they do everything and so those kinds of operations were busted as well so a broad range and also f and b operations which were not pivoted operations just simply reopening they also some some of them have been breaching now do not do not mistake me to think that every single one was therefore engaging in what we might consider to be shadier activities sometimes they were breaches also but you know we needed to target a broad range 3rd i think mister singh wanted to know seven have been closed but ten i pointed out that ten were in breach about forty odd out of the 400 odd which had pivoted and are they going to be closed i assume mister singh is not asking for closing down every operation as long as there is any breach there is a framework depending on the nature of the breach there will be a penalty and the penalty is transparent as and penalty will be imposed according to the kind of breach that has been committed and i think most people will know there is also a point system for breaches which leads to closure of course egregious breaches there will be closure but and i would not ascribe to mister singh the suggestion that police now should get even tougher and just close everyone down as long as there is one breach right now the last point i think was whether warnings given by public were taken seriously now i do not do the operations obviously but the i think most mps will know how in general police intel system is expected to work police have their own intelligence framework their own ground framework and public tip offs a lot of crimes are solved by public tip offs and they are important they are taken seriously and i assume that goes into the assessment framework on what operations to conduct thank you sir minister ong thank you there is a last question by mister singh on supplies supplies continue to be in shortage throughout the world many developing countries are still trying to secure supplies and in the earlier stage of the pandemic we too are short of supplies but fortunately we had negotiated for apas advanced purchasing agreements with major suppliers in the early stage of the pandemic and lately we were able to discuss and able to bring forward and confirm some of the delivery schedule so as of now for the past month or two actually we have not had a supply problem our now our constraint now is we need more especially our seniors to come forward and get vaccinated minister gan you have a clarification thank you mister deputy speaker i just wanted to add a point to what mister wong has explained on the testing strategy because as time goes on the testing system will also evolve say for example in time to come if you have got gotten a negative test result you may be able to enter multiple events and multiple premises so it is not just one event to one test so you just have to bear that in mind miss nadia samdin thank you deputy speaker and thank you to the ministers for the update i have two groups of clarification points the 1st is really stemming from a worry about discrimination and treatment between those who have been vaccinated versus those who are unable to and those who do not wish to be vaccinated and the treatment that they receive on one hand you know i empathize and hear the calls of those saying what is the point of being vaccinated if i am still you know faced with certain restrictions or why why are we being penalized but at the same time i know full well the impact of some of those who are unvaccinated for various medical reasons in particular our seniors and the social impact of the isolation not being able to be involved in activities as such i wonder if in the trace together app for example we might consider amending it to show those who are vaccinated those who are not vaccinated and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and if there can be differentiation of treatment if so how and also how this might take into account for example families who have seniors who are need are all children who are unable to be vaccinated moving on to my 2nd group of clarification points i think we have spoken about the ktv cluster but i also like to ask about the jurong fishery port cluster as this spread has impacted stall holders workers and residents alike in both my cheng san and chong boon markets as well as food centers firstly with a closer closure of jurong fishery pot and seafood stalls in the markets what is the impact to the supply of our seafood and what are measures which have been taken to mitigate disruption to these supplies 2nd some are also very worried about the safety of eating seafood during this time could the minister please elaborate what led to the spread of covid ninteen in the jurong fishery port whether there are clearer findings on the mechanism of transmission of covid ninteen into the port and subsequently into our local markets and whether our seafood is safe for consumption and finally as we look towards reopening while we understand that there have been efforts to make the operations at the port contactless we also understand that it is hard work and markets working in the markets can be strenuous and there are inevitably close interactions between the workers do our smm measures need changing and how can we ensure the safe reopening of jurong fishery port and our markers and our markets in hawker centers thank you minister ong thank you i will provide some answers then i will invite minister grace fu to supplement with her clarifications 1st on the differentiation i will not call it the discrimination because they have good public health reasons to differentiate the treatment between those who are vaccinated and not vaccinated because the differentiation help protect those who are not vaccinated member asked about whether trace together app can indicate vaccination status i believe it already does mine does it says i am vaccinated you can check yours yeah it does 2nd is children or seniors who because of medical conditions are not allowed to be vaccinated whether they get left out earlier on when we came out with the 25 rules one of the criticism is that it is so confusing and indeed one of the confusions the confusion arises because of the exemptions we are trying to give that in a group of five all vaccinated but you are allowed up to two children below twelve who can not get vaccinated but can join part of the group yeah so i think when we devise when do our midterm review we will also take into account these provisions and as for those who can not be vaccinated or unvaccinated for some reasons but want to join such a group we had earlier also allowed them to take a p e t a pre event test and if you are negative you can join the group and this is something we will consider as we do our midterm review lastly i do want to reiterate a point i made earlier when we get to a very high level of vaccination rate there should be very little differentiation between vaccinated and unvaccinated because collectively we will be very resilient by then there will be there will probably justi be justification for lesser differentiation as for the point about seafood being safe seafood is absolutely safe to consume how did they get into the jurong fishery pot as i mentioned earlier phylogenetic studies show that there is likely to be multiple points of entries because there are slight genetic differences in the virus and in the infections across the cluster we will continue to see if we can trace the sources of the infections but as of now it does not help our public health measures it does not help us to suppress the cluster it helps us understand the infections infiltration how it happened and help us strengthen the safe distancing safe management measures as to controlling the cluster now those information does not help but we will continue to study them minister grace fu thank you deputy speaker for allowing me to address the clarifications that miss nadia samdin have sought because of because i think of the important effect that the cluster has on this topic i think it is important for us to give the house an account on jurong fishery port as well as our food supply and its impact on hawker center and markets so with your permission deputy speaker may i address some of the pqs that members have filed on related subject as well yes please members mister dennis tan and miss nadia samdin have found pqs on the same subject sat down for a later sitting several members have also found related pqs for later sitting which i will address together so members yip honorable weng mister dennis tan on measures taken to mitigate the transmission of covid nineteen at official reports and key food facilities mister dennis tan on assistance given to the companies and workers at jfp mister daryl david on support given to stall holders and markets and hawker centers mister deputy speaker on food resilience we have worked closely with industry partners over the years to build diversified food supply chains this includes our seafood supplies the jurong fishery port handles about thirty of our total seafood imports and is complemented by senoko fishery port or sfp which handles about four of seafood imports the remaining two thirds of our seafood imports are distributed to the industry via other routes so it is a very diversified type distribution platforms our seafood supply has remained stable despite the closure of jfp and local disruptions at our markets following the closure of jfp on 17th july singaporeans were understandably worried some had rushed to buy seafood over that weekend we saw an increase in food fall at supermarkets after the market seafood storeholders were required to get tested on 18th july they could open their stores only after receiving a negative pcr swab test result all jfp workers were quarantined thus affecting the operations of many suppliers the phase two heightened alert restrictions on dining in moderated the demand the singapore food agency sfa and enterprise singapore esg responded quickly to facilitate distributors and supermarkets to activate alternative arrangements and these arrangements include diverting supplies directly to the supermarkets distribution centers and retail outlets supermarkets themselves increase their stock of fresh produce through their suppliers they have been keeping their retail shelves well stocked with a variety of seafood including the frozen seafood varieties meanwhile sfp senoko remains in operation as the market seafood stores resumed operations some switched to sfp for the supply or sourced from alternative suppliers we have sufficient stocks of frozen seafood i visited the jurong coast store last wednesday which stores supplies of frozen shrimp sea bass and grouper among others the coastal facility serves many wholesalers supplying to the supermarkets and food establishments island wide at the same time retail food establishments are adjusting by switching to frozen alternatives our local farms also produce a good variety of seafood such as seabass tilapia and grouper and some of them have reported a manifold increase in inquiry and and orders and they can be found online for example lazada is redmart is fairprice online shop and at and at the supermarkets as well such as prime and fairprice i encourage singaporeans to broaden their choices of seafood and where they buy their seafood from we have been reviewing longer term plans for the sector since 2020 sfa has been conducting studies on enhancement to the wholesale fresh produce sector and is working with nea to study the wet market sector to better meet the future demands of consumers and industry we will factor in lessons learned from this episode to better future proof the sector this episode has truly tested the resilience of our supply teams our overall seafood supply situation has remained stable because of our diversified supply and distribution channels sfa and esg will work with industry partners to strengthen their business continuity plans and i also like to thank all the industry players for stepping up in this period of crisis next at jurong fishery port and key food facilities our fishery ports pasir panjang wholesale center abattoir and slaughterhouses are key notes in our food supply chain sfa has begin working with the companies with the companies operating in these facilities to implement smm is since the start of the covid nineteen pandemic our objectives are to protect public health by minimizing the spread of the virus and to ensure business continuity to minimize risk of infection from foreigners contactless delivery for the truck drivers and boatmen was implemented controlled access to these facilities has been in place with only workers and registered trade visitors covid nineteen managed to break through these defenses with many cases detected at jfp over the past month the cases further spread to the markets and hawker centers through the stall holders who had visited jfp in order to break the chains of transmission moh made a difficult but necessary decision to close jfp for two weeks from 17th to 31st july with all 604 workers issued quarantine orders investigations by moh and sfa are ongoing to determine how transmission had taken place in jfp and we have all heard from minister for health earlier on we are not waiting for that investigations to complete because as mister ong has mentioned it is important for us to act immediately to protect public health so on our own our preliminary review has identified some areas for improvement 1st the humid and laborious environment made in made it uncomfortable for workers to wear their masks for prolonged period of time this meant a higher propensity for workers to adjust their masks or take them off momentarily 2nd the workers could have taken off their masks while they take their breaks smoking breaks for example and socialize in close proximity 3rd jfp being a marketplace meant that the workers and traders mix freely throughout the facility it is just like a market that we are used to shoppers going around traders going around and sometimes between stall holders they mix as well as they move stocks from one to another some contactless delivery measures were not strictly followed finally we are investigating the possibility of fomite transmission in jfp we will address these areas in our smm is with practical solutions and enforcement before we reopen jfp the 1st round of deep cleaning of jrp was done on eighteen july and we will be conducting another round before it is reopened common areas and crates will be regularly cleaned during its operation sfa will work with companies to implement seven day rostered routine testing or rrt for all workers at jfp and all workers will be encouraged to get vaccinated contactless delivery protocols for truck drivers and boatmen will be stepped up trade visitors who are not on any covid nineteen testing regimes such as rrt will be subjected to an antigen rapid test art before entering more frequent patrols will be carried out to ensure compliance with the smm is working closely with moh and informed by the epidemiological investigation we will adjust these enhanced measures if necessary to better protect both the workers and trade visitors sfa has audited the smm at sfp and pbwc it will progressively cover all the other key food facilities one time pcr swab test of all workers is being carried out we are almost at the tail end i am very glad to report that we are not seeing big clusters in these facilities seven day rrt and enhanced smms will be rolled out to these facilities as soon as possible we will monitor the operation closely and take enforcement action for any non compliance with the smms at these facilities an alternative site is being made available for use in the event of another closure of the fishery ports or ppwc the delta variant is a formidable foe collective responsibility is required to keep everyone safe next on assistance extended to jfp and related businesses the relevant agencies are working with companies to provide the necessary assistance during this difficult period we have been facilitating companies to redirect supplies directly to the supermarkets distribution centers and retail outlets so that they can continue operations despite the closure of jfp we are also coordinating closely with the companies to ensure that their workers have been swabbed and are healthy before we resume operations at jfp next week as announced by the ministry of finance last week the government will provide an additional four week rental waiver for qualifying tenants on government owned commercial properties eligible workers and self employed persons can apply for the covid nineteen recovery grant temporary those under quarantine can also apply to the ministry of health for financial assistance under the quarantine order allowance scheme and as to the support for storeholders in markets and hawker centers the government is committed to support our hawkers and work with them through this difficult period a one off cash assistance of $500 under the market and hawker center relief fund will be dispersed to each storeholder of cooked food and market stalls in centers managed by nea or nea appointed operators in august storeholders need not apply for this relief the money will be directly credited into the bank accounts of the stall holders this is on top of the 3rd month of rental waiver and subsidies for fees for table cleaning and dishwashing services provided this year those on the quarantine can apply for the quarantine order allowance scheme and those eligible may apply for the covid nineteen recovery grant covid nineteen recovery grant temporary for hawkers that continue to face financial issues they can also approach nea who will review their case and provide case by case support on ms nadia samdin is question about measures to improve safety at our markets and hawker centers nea will be putting in place tightened smm at all markets and hawker centers to ensure that they remain clean and safe for stall holders and patrons bear in mind that many of our hawker centers and markets are frequented by elderly patrons so we are taking extra precaution to make sure that you know their their health and safety are protected so we will carry out rostered routine testing for stall holders once every fourteen days we will facilitate the testing such as setting up more quick testing centers as announced by moh and explore teaching hawkers to conduct self testing at steady state mandatory safe entry check in will be implemented at all markets and hawker centers managed by nea or nea appointed operators to facilitate more effective contact tracing we have previously introduced e payments to go cashless i will encourage hawkers and patrons to use this mode of payment to minimize contact and also possibility of fomite transmission about ninety of those working in markets and hawker centers this includes our stall holders our our hawkers as well as our cleaners at the centers have received at least one dose of the vaccine so it is very high vaccination rate ninety and we are calling up encouraging those who have yet to do so to go for vaccination as soon as possible while we will continue to ensure the cleanliness of our hawker centers through regular cleaning and disinfection i also want to remind all patrons to adhere to smms and to observe personal hygiene when dining resumes patrons are reminded that they can do their part by returning their own used trays crockery and litter to help create a cleaner a cleaner dining environment thank you deputy speaker doctor tan wu meng i thank the ministers for their statements by way of clarification i would like to raise three questions a number of clementi residents feel very much affected by the recent outbreak our central market has had to close many worried parents seniors families concerned about the way forward the 1st question is relating to the jurong fishery port cluster what measures can we take to better identify workplaces that may have a higher risk of transmission compared to elsewhere three weeks ago i filed a pq on detecting covid virus in the built environment can i ask the task force what efforts are being made to look for other areas and workplaces that could be potential hotspots but which have not yet come to surface but which are still at higher risk 2nd question is on our schools a number of clementi parents have been watching the reports of some schools having students infected possibly by transmission at home and they want to know given the delta variant what measures are being taken to maintain the safety of students especially younger children who are not yet able to be vaccinated for example how soon can we roll out breathalyzers and tests which are easy enough for a child to do themselves and thirdly 3rd question sir even as we open up and transition i ask the ministries that we must maintain many of the capabilities built up during this pandemic and internalize the lessons learned because we know that a worse variant of covid or even a future disease acts a worse pandemic is just a question of when rather than if so i thank the ministers for their efforts our public servants for their efforts and i seek these questions as clarification thank you minister wong so on the three questions firstly we are constantly looking at the landscape to identify areas of risk where we might want to take greater attention i would say there are three broad criteria number one anything that interfaces with the outside world is at risk and therefore we take greater attention that includes our airport our seaports our the different interfaces with the external environment and there we want to put greater precautions safeguards including regular testing for the people who are working there number two any domestic or local activity that has high touch interactions with many people and where people are not wearing masks or potentially are in in an indoor environment and that includes dining it includes your spas massage establishments your beauty services and that is why we have also identified these as higher risk settings and we have asked the people who are in this settings to be put on a regular testing regime using the antigen rapid test kits thirdly it is an assessment of areas where we think smms may not be effectively done right so you know we look around and there is a qualitative assessments our sdas are out there enforcement officers are out there and if we see that but potentially in this particular industry in this particular work site smms are not followed then that raises alarm bells and we want to take a closer look at that so this is constantly being done and we are always looking at you know potential areas of risk where we would want to put more attention or require more testing to be done on schools that is also something we are watching carefully i think the school protocols have fortunately been very tight up to now in the recent outbreaks we have not had school based transmission we have had students who have been infected from their home from family members but not yet school based transmission we hope that can continue and that is in part because our schools have been very stringent in keeping and complying with these protocols but still beyond just having safe management measures we would certainly look at putting in place a testing regime especially when there are more convenient methods of testing which can be scaled up and then finally we completely agree with mister tan doctor tan is point that we have to continue to build up our capabilities because the battle is not over yet new variants future pandemics we just have to continue this process of building better capabilities to protect ourselves thank you miss hazel thank you deputy speaker i thank the ministers for their statement i am asking this question on behalf of some seniors who have conveyed to me their frustration that while they are being urged to get vaccinated they are unable to get an appointment for a sinovac vaccination i think we do have a group of individuals who prefer vaccinations using the traditional approach and have reservations about newer technologies so given that we are especially concerned about vaccination for our seniors what avenues are there available for these seniors who prefer the traditional approach are there plans to further expand the sinovac vaccination thank you thank you i think 1st of all let us try to explain to the seniors which i have tried a lot which is that the mrna vaccine actually has been developed for many many years it is not something so novel and so new it went through all the rigorous evaluation by different authorities and then approved and so far even in singapore a few 1000000s have taken it around the world even more and it is proven to be safe and effective every vaccine will have side effects including sinovac including mrna so it is a good vaccine and as far as possible we want to persuade everyone including our seniors to take the mrna vaccine but for those who simply not comfortable or they are contract indicated for mrna vaccine and they want to take the sinovac vaccine we now have made it available under the special assessed routes they can make an appointment it may involve some waiting but they will eventually get their vaccinations i have reported just now that 7172000 people have in fact gotten their doses so it is possible a minority especially amongst seniors only ten chose the or rather for all those who take the sinovac vaccine and our senior above sixty years old only ten are singaporeans so the great majority of singaporean seniors actually still prefer the mrna vaccine so make the appointment you have got to wait a while but you eventually will get the vaccine sorry minister i i should clarify that they actually tried to make the appointment but they are told that it is fully booked zero it should not be the case but if you can give me the contact we will more than happy to help them facilitate and make a appointment yeah there are twenty over clinics that are doing that now mister liang eng hwa thank you mister deputy speaker so businesses are especially the f and b sectors are finding this start stop series of activities really disruptive and they are they are growing frustrations low morale fatigue setting in and they ask why is the f and b sector seems to be bearing the brunt of each of the heightened measures so can i ask the minister why did we reverse on the nineteen july decision to have this fully vaccinated five dining it appears to be a reasonable proposition where the diners among them are fully vaccinated and this is indeed what the kind of scenario we are looking at and with that kind of the risking why do not we allow that to continue i would like to hear this one minister mister gan thank you i thought i spent half an hour explaining why we need to revert back to a phase two heightened alert and let me try again i think when we when we introduced the 52 regime we were prepared to went ahead with it except when we found that there is a significant number of infection transmitting within the community and the vaccination rate of our seniors are still relatively low therefore the risk profile was significantly different from when we 1st started planning for 52 framework and therefore we have to make a very painful decision i must share with you that we deliberated at length on this issue of course one option is to proceed with it come high water or hell high water but the risk that we are going to take is that you may see significant number of seniors being infected and because they will still be unvaccinated and they will still have this risk severe outcome and even mortality and you may think that well it is okay then just do not allow the unvaccinated to go to the restaurants but you must always also remember that those who go to the restaurant who are vaccinated may still be infected and bring the virus back home to the families where they are seniors who are unvaccinated and therefore it is important for us to weigh the pros and cons between proceeding with it or to make a painful decision to reverse the decision and to give us more time to allow the vaccination rate to improve both general vaccination rate as well as a seniors vaccination rate so we fully appreciate the challenges the f and b sector is facing and is still facing today until we are able to restore dining in and therefore we appeal to them to work with us and i think we have been working with a ministry of finance to roll out support packages to help them tied over this period of difficult and challenging phase and i think minister of finance and i met them and tried to understand their concerns and to also reassure them that we are aware of the challenging challenges and we will do what we can to help and support them and i must also say that the reason they are facing usually face the brunt of our measures is because as mister wong pointed out earlier they are front facing and there is a lot of interaction within restaurants and f and b outlets and the most critical difference is that their activities are mask off because when they eat and drink they have to remove that mask and therefore it is one of the very high risk settings and therefore we have to be extra careful and exercise additional caution and unfortunately when we have to tighten our measures in order to protect the community the f and b will have to work with us mister gerald giam fish into the pot and the exact mechanism for transmission is unclear up to now will these were these foreign fishermen required to take any covid nineteen tests or be vaccinated before entering the fishery port and if not can this be introduced immediately to prevent further import of the virus from countries where the pandemic is raging next regarding the sinovac vaccine is the relatively lower efficacy rate of the sinovac vaccine the reason why compared to the and the mrna vaccines is that the reason why those who got the sinovac vaccine are not considered fully vaccinated in singapore and this lower efficacy rate has been known for some time so why did not moh make this clearer so make this known clearer so that they will not be giving the same recognition to sinovac as mrna vaccine yet for the purpose differentiated measures because this could have blunted the demand for the vaccine which was mentioned earlier and convince more people to get the mrna vaccines 3rd as we reopen our borders many more foreigners will be entering singapore are there plans to require vaccinations for both short and long term visitors so that they do not inadvertently reduce our overall vaccination rate and lastly a recent british study found that a longer period of eight weeks between vaccinations produces a higher immune response than the spacing of three weeks now in our haste to get people fully vaccinated where we are encouraging people to vote to to to to book the 2nd dose three weeks after the 1st dose will we be compromising on maximizing durable immunity minister grace fu mister deputy speaker i would like to address mister gerald giam is 1st question on crewmen in indeed i think that minister would you like to take your mask off there is a hypothesis that the cluster may have come through punch through through a indonesian or through a fishboat fisherman on the on a fishery boat that hypothesis actually has not been confirmed at this point in time but we are not waiting for that so we are looking at how to strengthen the smm at the border we have already started contactless delivery since april that is along with the strengthened heightened smm at papa pasir panjang warehouse center wholesale center we have instituted that also for senoko and jurong fishery port but with regard to the question about whether we should subject them to vaccination or art that is something that we are considering at this point in time whatever we do i think we are looking for practical solutions where we can do it without increasing the risks so if the crewmen right now they are actually contactless in other words they are not allowed to land they will stay on the vessel and they will use the vessel equipment to move their buckets of fish onto the shore and then our shore people shore workers will take it over and we actually do not allow them to land on our shore so if to subject them to test frequent tests that may be a way for them to actually be landing more frequently on our shore so we have to evaluate these options look for practical and effective solutions minister ong here a couple questions one on sinovac actually if one is vaccinated with sinovac now it does reflect in your health hub and it it brackets sar so it is it is it is recorded that you are vaccinated with sinovac i think the question is whether it should then be comfort the concessions should we have differentiated safe management measures i would say that currently we there are different vaccines and every vaccines have different efficacy and it would not be from a public health point of view it would not make sense to just treat every vaccine the same i mentioned in my statement just now the efficacy of sinovac against delta variant because of the places that it has been applied and administered that data is still being built up and at the same time the key issue is that sinovac when it applied to hsa for psar approval the data was not complete but those data has now been submitted so we have a lot of data now before us that data on efficacy against delta is building up we got data in hsa we will assess them robustly and once if if it is approved under psar naturally it will be recognized the 3rd question if i get correctly is if we allow traveling travel lanes to open whether we would ensure that travelers to singapore also vaccinated and explained by minister laurence wong just now i think we have to open up travel very carefully and step by step and you do not want to inject infections that make things go out of control again so what is a natural so for example we have unilateral opening for very safe regions and so far it has not cost us community spreading because we assess those regions and and know that they are very safe next step is for those regions that have also controlled their infections and at risk level about same as us we can for example open up for vaccinated travelers to and fro without the need for shn but require a series of tests so i think whichever step we whatever step we take always make sure that it does not raise our risk level but maintain or even lower our risk level that would be our approach mister alex young thank you mister deputy speaker i welcome the mtf is focus on future differentiated treatment for vaccinated and unvaccinated it is perhaps one of the two in the kit to persuade encourage nudge and cajole those who are still considering however i wish to return to a suggestion i made at the very beginning of the national vaccination program which is to consider making vaccination mandatory a lot of effort has gone into encouraging singaporeans to be vaccinated because it makes sense and i therefore consider it our civic duty to be vaccinated if there are no medical grounds to refuse ultimately the fear is that the freedom of a minority to choose not to be vaccinated will affect the freedom of the majority who have chosen to be vaccinated for the sake of themselves their families and the community the 2nd clarification i seek is with regards to effectiveness of trace together and safe entry for contact tracing over the last few days with regards to the ktv cluster and also partially to the jurong fishery cluster we heard various issues not so much issues we heard some limitations vis a vis contact tracing because people who do not bring their phones with them or their dongles with them because of fear of being detected in certain places so whether or not the mtf can comment on whether contact tracing has been made more difficult recently and lastly on differentiated treatment i i quote a comment that was made by a fellow member ms nadia samdin on differentiated treatment why welcome it how will we eventually distinguish between those who knowingly avoid vaccination and those who do not have a choice for example the young and the medically excused this is of course if we do not introduce mandatory vaccination thank you minister ong i did not quite get the 2nd question so maybe minister lawrence wong can answer that later whether we can make vaccine i was busy in copying the question whether we can make vaccination compulsory like we did for mmr and others it is not time yet to think about that proposition because as of now the use of the vaccines is under psar which is pandemic special assessed route so under emergency use and in the pandemic situation to make it mandatory i think is not quite consistent in time to come when covid nineteen is really endemic maybe it is something it is a policy that governments around the world will have to consider on the 3rd question to how which is related to miss nadia samdin is question how do we distinguish between those who knowingly choose not to vaccinate versus those who cannot get vaccinated from a public health point of view they are actually the same they are equally vulnerable and so from a public health point of view we ought to treat them the same in terms of the differentiated treatment if you are not vaccinated to protect you best not to join the big events it cannot be that because your intention is different we let you join that will not make sense from a public health point of view having said that as i mentioned earlier we will think of measures such as you get yourself tested and you can join or in time to come when our vaccination rate is very high and our collective resilience is so strong we actually do not need much of that differentiation question is on contact tracing the effectiveness of trace together and safe entry i would say generally even in the recent episode we have seen that the systems are in place most people vast majority are using the trace together tokens or app properly establishments are having proper gating check ins using safe entry and so overall we still find this to be very effective in doing timely contact tracing and ring fencing are there lapses are there people who abuse who do not use the app and trace together yes obviously there are but by and large it has still been very effective and we want to make it even more effective which is why for markets and hawker centers previously we had not put safe entry check in requirements for all markets and hawker centers because we all know it is very difficult it is open it is porous people come in from all the different places so we only did it for the very popular markets but now we are planning based on the lessons we have learned and realizing how effective it is we are planning to put in safe entry centers it will lead to some inconvenience on the ground with many of your residents and i seek members understanding to explain to your residents why this is necessary in order for us to have effective contact tracing during this pandemic sorry mister deputy speaker i missed out one question by mister gerald giam just now he mentioned whether we are rushing dose one and dose two by keeping only a three week duration and whether a longer duration will make the vaccine more effective that is the hypothesis of one study and the and the conclusion it is not conclusive there are many other studies that show that three weeks for pfizer moderna a pfizer biome tech four weeks for moderna is an appropriate duration and gap between dose one and dose two for good efficacy so i think the conclusion is not definite miss joan pereira the quick test centers for the fast and easy testing can be opened for extended hours to cater to one man operations and other businesses who may have to go for their mandatory swab tests every fourteen days outside of their operating hours thank you answer is yes i think the quick test center in time to come is likely to be almost a national infrastructure for living with endemic covid i can imagine buildings employers requiring that their employees should be tested once every fourteen days or seven days before coming to work as a precaution as part of living with covid and the easy way to do it either you buy a self test kit from the pharmacy or you walk into one of this quick test center do a self swab or do a breathalyzer test and in that circumstance i think we need to study the the demand pattern and if need be we will need to operate on more days of the week or through longer for longer hours right now it is five days ten to five i think because many of the f and b outlets find that weekends are not suitable for them but we have changed as we move into the next phase and judging by the demand we will have to adjust the timing associate professor jamus lim thank you deputy speaker i earlier on minister ong had noted that the vaccination rate was progressing at an impressive one per day and that we could expect a seventy coverage by around mid august and possibly eighty by september now i am wondering what the basis for such an optimistic projection is in part because once we factor in the under twelve in the population for instance that would not qualify for vaccination you get something in the order of ten to twelve so it only assumes an eight to nine vaccine vaccine hesitancy share of the population and elsewhere it has been demonstrated that at far lower coverage rates populations have seen a point of inflection where there is resistance so how i guess the question is how would we get this coverage to this eighty that i agree would certainly be welcome the basis of projection is because we watch the number every day i do and that right now those who have taken 1st jab is already 76 yeah and that is over the whole population including those under twelve and you break down by age bands it is well over 808588 except for the most senior group above seventy right now is i think 7374 so these are the 76 thank you so just based on who has taken 1st dose and so long as they turn up for 2nd doses which they always do they tend to i do not think that will change by the time we reach national day we should be close to seventy receiving two doses and we believe that that momentum continues by september i think there is a very good possibility that we will reach eighty associate professor jamus lim is right that if that comes about that means vaccine hesitancy in singapore is actually much lower in other countries compared to other countries and i think this is a function of us working together as a united front as a united people trusting each other with trust between government and people and that is what help us overcome vaccine hesitancy we still have a lot of work to do for those who are older but let us continue this work doctor lim wee kiak thank you sir i have two clarifications one is on sinovac i think when the task force announced that we are going to release the sinovac vaccine to the to the people many will rejoice they are very happy about it but this rejoice was shortly after when you announced that the sinovac once you are vaccinated is not considered as part of the national vaccination program i also understand that there are overseas singaporeans who have vaccinated with astrazeneca with other vaccines and i think moh is prepared to accept them if they do a serology test and this serology test shows that they have immunity they can be included in the national registry so my question is that if a singaporean receives sinovac if they are willing to go through a serology test and serology tests show that their immunity is there can you accept them into the register them into the national registration so when next month or the month after next when the the restrictions are lifted for the vaccinated can they be considered as part of the vaccinated instead that is 1st clarification 2nd clarification is on the supply of vaccine i am very happy to hear that there is enough vaccine for all of us and by september we probably would hit hit about eighty i read in the papers our near neighbors jb has about 23 vaccination as from last month and i think in the batam sorry batam was 23 and jb was fifteen my question is that can singapore help our immediate neighbors with the vaccination once we hit our eighty because if our neighbors are not safe we are not safe as well thank you thank you on on the issue of sinovac i explained earlier i think the easiest rather than doing serology tests and between our amongst our experts there are also a different interpretation of serology tests i think the easiest thing is to go back to what i said just now as of 5th of july sinovac has submitted all the required data for us to do a proper evaluation under our pisa framework so let hsa do its work it is trying to do as fast as it can it may take a month from 5th of july and once if sinovac gets approved under pisa or other vaccines in time get approved under pisa naturally we will want to take a more inclusive approach in recognizing them as for helping our immediate neighbor all these purchase agreements have quite strict contractual requirements so we can not take delivery and then donate to another country or region and this all require us to discuss with the suppliers but certainly where we can help we will want to help our immediate region because it is only when every country around the world and in the region recover from covid that we can really be able to live with covid as an endemic disease mister xie yao quan i thank the ministers for their statements and i am particularly heartened to hear the concrete roadmap that minister wong has provided as to how we will ease ourselves out of phase two heightened alert and the differentiation for vaccinated versus unvaccinated persons in in this particular roadmap the clarification i like to seek pertains to the longer term so beyond immediate easing and reopening when we are truly and well into a new normal of endemic covid now in this new normal as minister ong has noted we will have reached a high level of vaccination and therefore covid resilience in the population and the need for differentiation between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons will be less but minister wong has also said that as we reopen we must expect cases the case numbers to rise and so to take this a little bit further in the new normal there is still a possibility that we get a major flare up in infections from time to time and in such a scenario the few 100s of 1000s or half a 1000000 persons or so who remain unvaccinated will be the ones at greatest risk of severe illness and therefore at greatest risk of loading our healthcare system and so in such a scenario i like to ask the multi ministry task force how might we tame the flare up and would the mtf then consider in such a scenario a sharper differentiation albeit a transient or interim one in safe management measures between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons so that we can protect the unvaccinated but yet not cause a major disruption to normal life for the vast majority like we now have in phase two heightened alert and more to the point do we think we still need to pull back to use minister wong is words pull back sharply as a population from time to time in a new normal or can we finally expect to see the last of phase two heightened alert thank you minister wong mister deputy speaker sir i have tried to give some clarity on what we can expect in the weeks ahead mister xie would like clarity in the months forward and unfortunately with the current situation being so fluid and uncertain it is very hard we do not have a crystal ball that is why beyond i said early august midterm of the phase two heightened alert we have one move when we get to about eighty coverage we make another move maybe in september and beyond that we will consider sequential moves but each time we do so we do it step by step step and we do it in a controlled manner not a big bang and whenever we make one move to ease we monitor health outcomes very closely precisely for the concerns that mister xie had highlighted that there will still be unvaccinated persons and we are concerned that if and when we make one step to open cases go up we have to watch the health outcomes and the hospitalization and icu cases if these were to spike then as i said we might either have to slow down on the next step of reopening or in the very worst case if indeed a lot of unvaccinated persons a lot of elderly turn up sick in the hospitals then we may really have to pull back as i mentioned the worst case in my mind is when the new variant strikes and i think i the no one knows exactly when this will happen what what sort of new variants we will see but the risk is not trivial and if a new variant emerges down the road that is much more transmissible or worse lethal and more resistant to the current batch of vaccines then it is it is almost like you are dealing with a new virus frankly and therefore the defenses have all to go up again so while we are embarking on this journey of reopening let us understand that there are still risk there are still uncertainties ahead and therefore we are taking this controlled step forward remain alert remain vigilant and continue to be flexible and adaptable in adjusting our posture based on the latest assessment of risk and the external environment and how the pandemic proceeds i will take two more clarifications before closing the debate mister leon perera thank you mister deputy speaker just one clarification for the minister of health there will be some individuals who are who get both doses and who still have very low resistance to the virus due to they being immunocompromised for genetic reasons or other reasons or due to having certain risk factors is the government actively looking at and this kind of relates to the pq that i found is the government actually looking at giving a 3rd jab to such individuals if the science actually supports that that will help them to raise their resistance to the vaccine and i understand that the us centers for disease control is actively looking at this question right now thank you if i am not wrong the us has not come to a conclusion and neither have we we are studying this actively whether we need a 3rd dose as a booster when and what kind of strategy whether you use back mrna or you use a heterologous strategy so these are all are all being studied and when the details when we make a decision or when the expert committee has made a decision we will make them public miss tin pei ling thank you deputy speaker just a change to direct my question to min chan actually i had earlier filed a pq for a later sitting but thank you for answering it earlier so i just had a follow up question which is that given that there were rules to disallow hostessing and yet there were blatant yet there were blatant disregard for the rules and now with the spotlight on these ktv or pivoted outlets i am just wondering whether there is a risk that more of these vice activities may then be driven underground to other settings and therefore how will the surveillance and enforcement be stepped up to control this i know minister had addressed this in in in quite a detail but just wondering how will it the surveillance and enforcement be stepped up further given the current possibility and especially in areas such as industrial place spaces where perhaps offices or factory spaces could be used for parties at night some of these anecdotal feedback that we have heard as well so to mention thank you thank you miss tin for that question i think we have to rightly focus on the people who are the cause of the spread people who operate illegally and the people who patronize but look before the pandemic what was our framework singapore never made prostitution illegal because we knew that countries which have tried and for 1000s of years people have tried it is not going to work so you need to be realistic what is doable and what is not doable pimping was legal pimping is illegal prostitution was neither illegal then nor is it now except i suppose when there are safe distancing measures the the when we allowed the nightlife outlets pubs bars ktvs those who wanted to pivot what was our understanding of the situation supposing we had said no to all of them there would have been a great deal of loss of jobs but does that mean that immediately all dodgy activities would have stopped ms tin is right precisely this issue it would have gone underground much more and it would have been very difficult to trace so the pivoting is not the issue the issue is that there is money to be made in making available these services and there will always be people because there is a huge demand regardless of the rules and there is i will not say unlimited supply but there is some supply there will always be opportunities make money and you that is why flats industrial spaces warehouses people organize i mean you know you would have seen in the newspapers another they even organized illegal ktv operations so if we got to sort of remove the two issues not that one is one is not connected to the other the pivoting of some operators is not connected to illegal activities they go on and by definition because of our rules if all these activities are caught i quote underground in the sense that they are not being open and we have to go and use our intel to find and deal with them some are in these outlets some are in outlets that are not obvious we have to keep continuing at it and whatever rules we come up with this is not going to stop it is just a question of whether it is more or less the activities and you know it it puts a heavy onus on the regulatory authorities we can urge everyone to be responsible but as you saw from the example i gave immediately after the unilateral opening was closed there were many girlfriends turning up with singapore sponsors with a variety of reasons and this this will go on we just have to try and deal with them thank you order we have completed our proceedings on the ministerial statements on 5th update on hall of government response to covid nineteen",
            "prediction": "mister deputy speaker today my fellow co chairs of the multi ministry task force the mtf minister gan kim yong and minister lawrence wong and i will be delivering ministerial statements to update members on the covid nineteen situation in singapore our ministerial statements will address oral questions one to five and 26 to 28 and written questions 28 29 31 to 33 of today is order paper it will cover questions on the ktv and jurong fishery port clusters our covid nineteen vaccination program and our plans to transit to live normally with covid nineteen mister murali pillai associate professor james lim mister daryl david mister xie yaochuan mister yip honorable wing mister xia jinping ms raisa khan and mister sito yipin have filed oral and written questions scheduled for future sittings on these issues as today is ministerial statements would address those questions mister deputy speaker sir i would like to invite these members to seek clarification should they have on these issues after the ministerial statements and should their queries be sufficiently addressed it may not be necessary for them to proceed with their pqs for future sittings with that let me start on monday twelve july 21st moh detected several covid nineteen positive cases amongst individuals who frequented ktv bars and lounges these individuals included patrons of the bars and hostesses who worked in the lounges these activities were considered very high risk and had been disallowed since the beginning of the pandemic the cluster grew rapidly and moh moved in quickly to isolate infected persons we identified rings of contacts and tested them for covid nineteen we ordered a two week suspension of operations in all pivoted nightlife establishments from sixteen july to thirty july the pivoted nightlife establishments cannot resume operations until they pass inspections to ensure that safe management measure protocols are in place and they have received written approval and they have received written approval mister xie yaoqian asked if we would consider making the individuals in the ktv cluster pay for their covid nineteen medical expenses in full we are all upset by the irresponsible behavior of the individuals involved in this ktv cluster but we still have a public responsibility to ensure that everyone receives the medical care that they need we also do not want individuals especially those who are infected to avoid getting tested and treated or hide where they have been from contact traces because they are afraid of getting penalized this will make it harder to contain the spread and would cost us more in the long run we were on the path towards progressive opening and the ktv cluster was a major unexpected bump on the road the mtf deliberated on the matter took in advice from moh experts and came to the conclusion that given our extensive tracing and testing efforts and our population vaccination rate for two doses were approaching fifty at that time on balance we felt that the cluster ought not significantly change our plans to open up hence on sixteen july the mtf announced our decision to maintain our then current safe management posture we made some adjustments to the rules for eating in restaurants we call it the two five rule two if you are unvaccinated five you can dine together provided everyone is fully vaccinated based on how the cluster has developed we still believe that was the correct call as of 25 july 2021 the ktv cluster has a total of 237 infected persons for the past three days the daily increase in infection for the cluster was six five and five respectively so it is coming under control but unfortunately things got derailed due to a larger and more troublesome cluster and this is the jurong fishery port cluster on the evening of friday sixteen july 2021 we started to detect multiple infections at the jurong fishery port as well as in hong lim market this involved fishmongers their assistants going about an honest living collecting fishes at the fishery port report but unwittingly getting infected and then transmitting to more people in the markets and communities where they ply their trade moh with the help of nea took immediate steps to prevent further spread by stopping the fishmongers and their assistance from setting up stalls on sunday eighteen july 2021 it was very tough to tell them you can not set up stalls we then issued health risk warnings which required them to undergo pcr tests and isolate themselves until they get a negative result of the 1548 tested 43 were found to be covid nineteen positive the numbers are a bit different from what i reported earlier as we clean up the numbers this indicated that significant community transmission had most likely already silently occurred in the days before eighteen july 2021 sunday sea markets are frequented by wide segments of the public particularly seniors of whom one quarter are still not fully vaccinated the risk of infections rising uncontrollably could not be ruled out these infections could potentially result in more cases of severe illnesses or even deaths among our vulnerable senior population hence the mtf decided to pre emptively dial back to phase two heightened alert this came into effect on 22 july 2021 we did this to buy ourselves time precious time to get more of our population vaccinated so that we can continue on our path towards living with covid nineteen safely the preliminary phylogenetic findings suggest that while the ktv and jurong fishery port clusters were all driven by the delta variant it is distinct from the delta variant that infected tantok sing hospital and the changi airport clusters the recent clusters have a delta strain that is more closely related to what we detected in imported cases from our immediate region however there are also slight genetic differences between the strains in the two clusters suggesting that there were multiple introduction points as of july 25 2021 the jurong fishery port has a total of 792 cases it is still growing but now at a slower rate the daily infection numbers over the last three days were 79 79 and 46 respectively overall we have seen a high number of daily cases at over 100 for the past several days but the situation is stabilizing with daily infections trending down percentage of cases isolated or quarantined before turning covid nineteen positive is something we watch closely and it is on an upward trend which is good that means when the person is started to be detected as positive he is already quarantined and isolated on nineteen july that is when the cluster 1st broke out we had a total of 163 cases and only 27 were isolated before detection lately this hovers around forty today we should have more than half of our cases already isolated if we can keep raising that percentage through tracing and testing we can progressively suppress this wave of transmission we can progressively suppress this wave of transmission but our objective is not to stop transmission completely that is no longer possible given how transmissible the delta variant is and as we open up and people circulate more so the only possible way now to eradicate infections is to go into a hard circuit breaker for at least a month probably two but we do not want to be locked up further even if we do lock ourselves up when the cv ends and we open up cases will rise again so eradication is therefore not possible nor sustainable we must instead find ways to live with this virus safely several members namely mister yip hong wing associate professor james lim ms raisa khan were interested to find out more about our transition plans to live with covid nineteen as an endemic disease vaccinations are key to this transition and the national program is progressing well as of end of yesterday 25th july 2021 54 of our population has received two doses of the mrna vaccines and our population vaccination rate is going up by about one percentage point a day so by national day almost seventy will have received two doses by early september it should be almost eighty having received two doses of mrna vaccines and this means singapore by then will have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world it puts us in a strong position to transit to a covid resilient society our main worry is that our seniors especially those seventy and above are not sufficiently vaccinated today just over seventy of them have received two doses of the vaccines ms ting pei ling asked for an update on the home vaccination scheme we have launched nine home vaccination teams so far as of 23rd of july 734 seniors have received vaccinations under that program further more seniors are coming forward to our vaccination centers and also our mobile vaccination teams we have been seeing about 500 seniors coming forward on a daily basis to receive their 1st doses for the past few weeks but for the past few days that number has doubled to over 1000 every day now how did that come about it is good news but it may be due to heightened awareness as a result of more community transmission lifting of rules that had previously deferred their vaccinations for those with medical conditions and also our very intensive outreach efforts for example our mobile teams have gone all the way to pulau ubin to vaccinate seniors who are living there we know of gps who persuaded who called up their clients the seniors persuaded them go for vaccinations and then open up their clinics for them to sit in the clinic the whole day so that they feel assured that if they feel unwell help is always nearby help from someone they trust their gps mister deputy speaker this is a measure of the kind of society we are we are making such an extraordinary effort with our seniors because we are not prepared to accept the high fatality rates amongst the elderly that other countries had or are still experiencing as a result of all these efforts 77 of our seniors seventy and above have now received their 1st doses within a month or so they should all have received their 2nd doses and after that another fourteen days they should all be strongly protected against covid nineteen even at our current rate of vaccination 54 or so two doses the preliminary evidence is that it has been effective in reducing the incidence of severe illnesses and deaths mister deputy speaker sir may i show a chart on screen please yes please do thank you top line is blue line is infection bottom line orange is number with severe illnesses requiring oxygen supplementation or icu as members can see while daily infections number with severe illnesses requiring oxygen supplementation or icu as members can see while daily infections have gone up sharply over the past couple of weeks the number of patients with severe illnesses who require oxygen supplementation or in icu remains relatively low there is slight uptick but relatively suppressed currently all of these patients with severe illnesses are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated but we are watching this closely because there is a time lag of twelve weeks between infection and the onset of severe illnesses for now it would appear that we have successfully weakened the link between infections and severe illnesses while we are making good progress in vaccinating our people we acknowledge that the recent reversion to phase two heightened alert has caused some confusion amongst members of the public they are asking are we still committed or is the mtf still committed to the path towards normalcy and living with covid nineteen the answer is a definite yes for that is the only way for singaporeans to regain our lives and livelihoods for singapore to reconnect with the world again for our young to look into the future with hope some countries like the uk have declared a freedom day recently where all social restrictions are lifted all at once others like israel and netherlands opened up and saw sharp increases in infections and hospitalization and have to dial back very quickly ours will be a controlled opening we are not going to do a big bang because predictably things will then blow up the mtf has been developing a roadmap comprising packages of measures to be implemented step by step over the next few months and with every step ensure that opening up is safe for the community but even as we do so we must bear in mind that until we reach a sufficiently high vaccination rate especially amongst our seniors we will continue to be vulnerable to unexpected setbacks just like what we are going through now a high rate of vaccination will provide us with a more solid and stable base as we proceed on this journey the higher the vaccination rate the more solid the ground we walk on so in a way this is the most peculiar period of our transition where we are clear about our mission our will is firm we have a broad plan mission our will is firm we have a broad plan but we do not have enough antibodies in all of us to ensure that we can follow through our plans without a hitch but let us not underestimate the progress we have made the roadmap is in fact being implemented as we speak our attention often is on the smms the safe management measures such as whether we can eat in restaurants but there are at least three other important aspects namely one restoring economic and social activities including connecting with the outside world two remodeling covid nineteen healthcare protocols which i feel is probably the hardest minister gan will speak about restoring economic activities while minister lawrence wong will speak more about enabling more social activities let me talk about healthcare protocols and our collective psychology as we learn to live with covid nineteen our healthcare protocols must be remodeled if covid nineteen is indeed endemic having 200 or more cases may not be an unusual thing at all during an influenza season our daily infection rates can go up to as high as 1000 a day imagine we treat influenza like we treat covid nineteen this is what will happen we will put everyone suspected of influenza infections through pcr tests and then long isolated stays in hospitals and then everyone they come into contact with will be quarantined 1000 cases a day this will disrupt the lives of many people further hospital beds will all be filled and many other patients who are sicker will be turned away the healthcare system will not be able to cope and that is clearly not the way to deal with an endemic disease so if we want to live with covid as an endemic disease we cannot carry on with the current healthcare protocols they need to shift closer to how we treat influenza today without extensive contact tracing and quarantine in dedicated facilities and hospitalizing only those who are very ill but that can only happen when the likelihood of developing very serious or life threatening disease as a result of covid nineteen infection has been significantly reduced by effective vaccination of our population especially amongst the vulnerable with our current rate of vaccinations we have started to take the 1st transition step to remodel our healthcare protocols as of last week we made the following changes 1st greater use of community care facilities instead of hospitals vaccinated individuals aged between 45 and 59 who tested positive for covid nineteen and showed no or mild symptoms can be directly admitted to community care facilities instead of going 1st to hospitals so these community care facilities currently for example is ntucd resorts as well as csc loyang this was already the practice for all cases aged between seventeen to 45 years but we are now expanding the protocol to people up to 59 years old and with this change we expect up to sixty of infected cases to recover in community care facilities instead of in acute care hospitals meanwhile we will plan for the next step because this is just the 1st step we will plan for the next one where perhaps eighty can be admitted to community care facilities and some can even start to recover at home 2nd change we have shortened the length of stay in hospitals and community care facilities our tests have shown that the viral load in infected persons who are fully vaccinated falls very rapidly to a very low level after nine days previously most people generally were discharged only after 21 days people generally were discharged only after 21 days we are now discharging fully vaccinated persons after fourteen days from the onset of illnesses with a seven day leave of absence in addition so long as their tests show that they are covid negative or have very low viral loads we are reviewing our policy to allow fully vaccinated patients to be discharged even earlier and to complete the rest of the isolation period at home if their home environment is suitable 3rd change is the greater use of home quarantine for fully vaccinated persons they can now serve their quarantine at home instead of a dedicated government facility provided that their home is suitable for isolation we expect up to forty of persons under quarantine can serve their quarantine at home and this will go beyond fifty in the coming few weeks as more people get vaccinated these are amongst the 1st steps that we will take in the healthcare transition in the meantime what we are experiencing in this current wave of transmission is also valuable because we are also witnessing a palpable shift in our collective psychology because we are also witnessing a palpable shift in our collective psychology the 1st i think is a shift away from always focusing on infection numbers we used to get a shock when we see high daily numbers because this will mean a week or two from then we will see more severe illnesses and deaths however in recent days that mental link is starting to be broken as we know that with vaccinations high infection numbers need not necessarily mean more sickness and deaths many people are now rightfully focusing on the number of people with severe illnesses as of today despite the higher infection cases over the past few days that number is fourteen and does not threaten our hospital capacity many friends including members of this house have been texting me asking me why do not we publish the number of people with severe illnesses so that we know that vaccination works actually the media have been publishing these numbers every day for quite a while now but our attention is always on the vaccination on the infection numbers but it is good that the attention is now shifting i would not say there is a huge psychological shift but i think the shift is starting to happen a 2nd shift is a greater acceptance of differentiated safe management measures between those who are vaccinated and those who are not there have been many calls to do this mister xie yaoqian has also asked about this this is something which the mtf has always intended to do and that was why we decided on the two five rule for restaurants when the ktv cluster broke out but it was scuttled with our reversion to phase two heightened alert when our whole society is very highly vaccinated and we have transitioned to living with covid nineteen we should make very little differentiation between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated but during this period of transition when we are still building up our resilience differentiation by vaccination status is a practical way to open up some activities 1st while protecting those who are still vulnerable mtf will visit this during our phase two heightened alert midpoint review and minister lawrence wong will speak more about that later let me address several other questions from members mister morelli pillay will be comforted to know that mof actively monitors international developments in medical treatment options for covid nineteen this is done through the national center of infectious diseases ncid and an expert committee they have developed national treatment guidelines which are constantly updated based on new evidence they provide guidance to our doctors on the use of evidence based medical treatment options for covid nineteen patients our local institutions have also been participating actively in international multi center trials investigating novel covid nineteen therapeutics these trials have generated important data on new covid nineteen treatments such as remdesivir we will continue to closely monitor developments in covid nineteen treatments proactively procure therapeutic agents which are shown to be effective and maintain a stockpile based on our population needs to mister leon pereira is question factors that affect covid nineteen vaccine efficacy are not yet known the covid nineteen vaccine is not yet in the test for risk factors and scientific papers on the correlations may be published in future antibody testing is not required after vaccination under singapore is national vaccination program and we are actively reviewing the need for vaccine boosters we are also continually reviewing singapore is portfolio of covid nineteen vaccines we plan to bring in non mrna vaccines that are robustly assessed for quality safety and effectiveness this should happen before the end of the year subject to supply and regulatory approval testing will remain very important even as we transit to living with covid important even as we transit to living with covid because it is only through testing that we can know if we are infected and then do the civic minded thing in excusing ourselves from work and then staying home but we have to make testing simple accessible affordable even more so than now so that we can all do our part i believe many members have done the breathalyzer testing just now so it is one example of a test that is non intrusive simple easy accessible and fast since mid june we have progressively rolled out regular fast and easy tests for staff working in higher risk settings this includes a network of sixteen quick test centers which we intend to expand further so in response to ms joan pereira is question the quick test centers will support small businesses by allowing their staff to walk in and get themselves tested and have their results recorded at some point i believe the quick test centers should also be using breathalyzer tests as we have gone through just now we will also continue to work with nea to deploy wastewater testing across singapore mister dennis tan asked about this currently nea has deployed 270 auto samplers across 200 sites so every site can have a few two or more auto samplers we are increasing this to 500 auto samplers across 400 sites by the end of the year wastewater testing is an increasingly strategic resource as we learn to live with covid nineteen where we place the sites are very important we can deploy them in areas where we suspect transmission is happening such as around all the markets that are currently affected now or we can deploy them to areas where we know many unvaccinated seniors are living there such testing is non intrusive and would give us valuable early warning when covid nineteen starts to take hold in the locality we know very early and that will prompt us to take further public health measures in the affected residential areas further public health measures in the affected residential areas mister darrell david doctor lim wee khiak and mister murali pillay asked about the safety of covid nineteen vaccines moh has been publishing monthly safety data updates on our website it also gave an age breakdown of the affected persons and indeed the majority are young people as of thirty june 2021 hsa has received twelve reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring in persons after receiving a dose of the mrna based covid nineteen vaccine based covid nineteen vaccine while there is a small increased risk among those in the younger age groups relative to the baseline rate the local incidence rate remains low one of the reported cases is a full time national serviceman in the saf who is below thirty years of age none of the cases are from the singapore police force or the sedf we implemented the vaccine injury financial assistance program or vfat to give greater peace of mind to people taking vaccinations but remember with or without vaccinations there is a baseline number of disease cases amongst our population since the vast majority of singaporeans have stepped forward to be vaccinated there will naturally be numerous incidents which just happen to coincide with vaccinations hence we have to do what is practical and reasonable which is to have the vfap applications reviewed by a panel of medical experts who will consider them against known evidence about the vaccines a few members have also asked about the sinovac vaccine the sinovac vaccine is called coronavac but we always just call it sinovac sinovac is the company the vaccine is coronavac but for simplicity i will sinovac sinovac is the company the vaccine is coronavac but for simplicity i will just refer it as the sinovac vaccine as at 25th july 2021 about 72000 persons have received at least one dose of the sinovac vaccine and about 17000 persons have received their 2nd doses amongst them 28 are singapore citizens and they are mostly young so for those who have taken the sinovac vaccine and are seniors above sixty years old only ten or in fact less than ten are singaporeans if the supply of 200000 doses which the government has procured is insufficient to cater to the demand private clinics can bring in additional supply as is the case for any other who eul vaccine under the special access route as of nine july 2021 hsa has received ten adverse event reports following vaccination with the sinovac vaccine the event comprises mainly allergic reactions such as itch and rashes as for concessions on safe management measures the data on the efficacy of the sinovac vaccine against the delta variant is still building up sinovac has also recently submitted the required safety data for their application for the pandemic special access route approval to hsa so the hsa and our expert committee are going through the various data when the evidence justifies it we will certainly want to extend the concessions to individuals who have received the sinovac or other vaccines which may qualify mister deputy speaker let me conclude as a government we need to recognize that our society is diverse with different segments of the population having different opinions needs and wants when these differences cannot be reconciled we agree to disagree we live and let live at the same time we do our best to unite and forge a consensus for what is a society without commonalities and without shared commonalities and this is what a responsible government needs to do across a range of issues from education healthcare public housing to racial harmony and free trade public housing to racial harmony and free trade we must always try to strike a balance between forging a consensus as well as respecting diverse views it is the same when it comes to learning to live with covid nineteen on the one hand we have the young vaccinated individuals who feel that we should open up and allow vaccinated individuals to enjoy more social activities on the other hand we still have a sizable segment of older singaporeans who for medical or other reasons are yet to be vaccinated and who remain vulnerable to be vaccinated and who remain vulnerable differentiated safe management measures is something we will have to put in place for public health reasons and to protect the unvaccinated but at the same time we must do our best to get more of the vulnerable vaccinated just now as i reported just now we are making progress as for the non vulnerable as more of you get vaccinated when you show more consideration to others you are also doing your part to better protect the vulnerable remember our children our nieces and nephews younger brothers and sisters under twelve will not be vaccinated for a while yet so when we work together as a people we will bring ourselves to a much stronger and more resilient position and our transition to living with covid will gather pace mister deputy speaker sir singapore is one of the few countries to have come through the last twenty months of the pandemic with very few fatalities and we can look forward with confidence to living with endemic covid nineteen because a high proportion of our population will be fully vaccinated most of the developing world still has little access to vaccines most of the developing world still has little access to vaccines and even amongst the countries and regions which have vaccines singapore is unique because we have one group including us uk israel many eu countries which went through major episodes of widespread transmission hospitals overwhelmed with many fatalities they are now highly vaccinated and opening up their economies and societies and then there is another group the likes of australia new zealand hong kong maybe south korea who kept the pandemic under control but are now finding it a challenge to get their people vaccinated partly because their lives have not been very threatened by covid nineteen and this will make us perhaps the only country in the world which has not suffered a collapse of our hospitals nor a high death toll and at the same time achieved a very high vaccination rate in our population and this uniqueness is due to the unity of our people the trust amongst them and between people and government mister deputy speaker we can look towards the road ahead with confidence and optimism thank you the minister for trade and industry and minister for finance will be making related ministerial statements i will allow members to raise points of clarification on all three statements after the 3rd statement minister gan thank you mister deputy speaker minister ong yi kang has given members an update on the covid nineteen situation let me now share with members our journey out of phase two heightened alert and towards a covid resilient state from the point of view of businesses about a month ago the mtf co chairs wrote a commentary outlining a future where singapore can live normally with covid nineteen the virus is likely to become endemic eventually like influenza with the vast majority of us protected against the severe outcome of the virus as long as we are fully vaccinated virus as long as we are fully vaccinated we are not there yet and we need to press on with vaccination especially among the elderly as we journey towards this destination we were never under the illusion that it would be straightforward and we expected to face a few bumps along the way the ktv and jurong fishery port clusters are cases in point like minister ong i received many questions on whether our decision to return to phase two heightened alert signals a reversal of our plan to transition to a covid endemic state the answer is a clear no we are determined to get to our destination of being a covid resilient singapore but our journey must take into account public health realities sometimes we may need to take a detour if we see hazards ahead this way we can ensure that we will get to our final destination safely even though it may take a little longer the last onefive years has been a very difficult ride for our businesses this is particularly so for sectors that are more affected by the tightening of safe management measures such as f b retail sports and gyms and performance arts i know that the impact on them must be very severe minister wong and i met the f b and retailers trade associations last week we appreciated their feedback which helped mti and mof design the support packages for them as well as for the other affected businesses at the same time i am also heartened to see that many businesses have adapted their operations in response to the challenges food establishments and retail shops have leveraged online platforms and gyms have turned to virtual classes or moved some of their classes outdoors nevertheless we know that these efforts are insufficient to fully compensate for the loss of income from their usual business model the aviation tourism and mine sectors have also been severely impacted due to travel restrictions with changi airport is passenger load at only around three of pre covid levels three not thirty three of pre covid levels demand in these sectors have plummeted some firms have pivoted to adjacent areas for example singapore airlines is now using some of its passenger planes to operate cargo flights to take advantage of the increase in cargo traffic while operators in the tourism sector have come up with new and creative products to attract local visitors as foreign tourists have dried up the singapore rediscover vouchers would have helped them somewhat the construction marine and process sectors are also under tremendous pressure they have had to make difficult but necessary worksite adjustments to protect workers health and safety at the same time they have had to deal with labor shortages as a result many have faced project cancellations and delays or shied away from taking on new projects we fully understand the challenges and uncertainties that our businesses and their workers are going through since the start of this pandemic mti has worked closely with industry and other government agencies to help businesses cope closely with industry and other government agencies to help businesses cope we delivered eight budgets over onefive years including the supplementary supply bill that we will be debating later to marshal resources to support businesses and protect jobs we introduced several schemes such as the job support scheme jobs growth initiative rental relief and tax rebates we ensured that firms that ran into cash flow problems could gain access to credit by enhancing our enterprise financing schemes and working with the banks to put in place a moratorium on loan repayment together these efforts have helped avert massive business failures a much deeper recession and higher unemployment businesses and workers have told us that while these support measures have been critical and helpful they can only serve as temporary pain relief they would much prefer to resume their business fully and for the economy to grow again many are therefore transforming their businesses to seek out new opportunities and prepare for the recovery i think this is the right attitude to have even as we manage the short term impact of the pandemic we should not lose sight of the future covid nineteen has wreaked havoc on almost every single economy in the world but those which can respond well and take the opportunity to adapt and transform quickly will emerge stronger and move ahead of others to ensure that we do not get left behind once the dust settles we must turn this once in a generation crisis into a once in a generation opportunity to transform our businesses develop new areas of growth and strengthen our connections to the global economy we recognize that it is not easy for businesses to juggle everyday challenges during the pandemic and the need to change and transform for the future we need focused efforts this is why we set up the emerging stronger taskforce or est at the height of the crisis in may last year to look at how singapore should refresh and reimagine our economic strategies going forward the est formed nine alliances for action as a new model of public private partnership to allow our businesses to move quickly and bounce back stronger some of the afa is have delivered promising results for example the afa on safe and innovative visitor experiences enabled us to test bait several ideas for safe mice events which provided some relief for the mice sector while also elevating its international profile the afa on supply chain digitalisation saw the growing demand for supply chain transparency and resilience and created sgtradex which stands for singapore trade data exchange as a digital infrastructure sgtradex allows businesses to share data with each other in a trusted and safe manner thereby allowing them to optimize their supply chain flows through singapore with more trades coming through singapore our position as a keynote in the global supply chain is further strengthened for sectors that are doing well despite the pandemic the government is focus is to add wind to their sails to help them create new products forge new partnerships and break into new markets these include the financial ict biomedical manufacturing and electronic sectors in particular the biomedical manufacturing sector expanded significantly by almost 25 last year while the electronic sector grew around twelvefive the afa on medtech product development is another good example of our new partnerships recognizing the increasing prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases it identified in vitro diagnostics as a key sub sector that we can grow we will continue to work closely with industry and partner businesses in this endeavor to give them the support they need to raise their productivity innovate and grow beyond our shores we will also help workers to be ready for the challenges in the new normal as businesses transform to remain competitive and seize new opportunities workers will also need to learn new knowledge and acquire new skills the need for workers to upgrade and upskill is more urgent than ever the government is committed to walking this journey with our workers every step of the way we introduced the skills future movement in 2015 and intensified our efforts through the sgunited jobs and skills package since the pandemic started we will work with the ministry of manpower and the unions to encourage and support workers to tap on these schemes to stay relevant in their current job or retrain to enter new jobs i also call on employers to continue working with the government and their tripartite partners to upgrade and redesign jobs and invest in workforce training even as we plan ahead we know that businesses are naturally concerned about what an endemic state means for their daily operations and the adjustments they may need to make as we get there let me sketch out the path forward and give businesses a sense of what to expect to help them plan ahead some of the details are still being finalized and we will share them in future as our vaccination coverage increases we will be in a much stronger position to ease our covid nineteen measures safely and confidently we will begin to adjust our safe management measures in stages while keeping an eye on the number of serious cases restrictions on social gatherings will ease and we can expect larger dining in group sizes and lower requirements and higher capacity for various events we will take a differentiated approach vaccinated individuals will be able to engage in a wider range of social activities and in larger groups while those who are unvaccinated will only be able to do so with a negative pre event test result with this f b retail and other businesses that provide in person services such as gyms and beauty services will see a return in demand sectors such as tourism cruise and mines will also get some relief as capacity limits are progressively raised although foreign tourists will also get some relief as capacity limits are progressively raised although foreign tourists will still take some time to return workplace restrictions will also be eased and progressively more workers can go back to office businesses will be able to conduct important face to face meetings or hold workplace events that are important for networking or team bonding businesses can do several things to prepare for reopening 1st encourage and facilitate all medically eligible employees especially those involved in high touchpoint activities to get vaccinated and deploy those who cannot be vaccinated to lower risk settings 2nd integrate the use of art self tests into your work processes especially for businesses that provide high touchpoint services or which tap on a pool of workers that frequently change encourage employees to self isolate and get themselves tested if they are not feeling well or if they suspect that they may have been exposed to covid nineteen doing so can help detect cases early and limit the extent of disruption to your businesses i know of several employers who have made bulk purchases of testing kits so their staff can easily access them if needed this is a good idea and i encourage more employers to do so and 3rd continue allowing flexible work arrangements and putting in place business continuity plans to strengthen operational resilience we are also looking at relaxing our border restrictions safely as a small and open economy we simply do not have the luxury of closing ourselves off to the world many parts of our economy require a steady flow of people in and out of singapore be it workers or visitors as a business hub many of our executives have to travel to manage and grow their regional businesses our tourism and mice industry as well as our air hub status also critically depend on international connectivity we should also not forget the international community based here many have not been able to return home to visit their family since the start of the pandemic this is because if they go home they may not be able to return to singapore there are also singaporeans whose loved ones are stranded overseas this has not been easy for many of them therefore as our vaccination coverage increases and the majority of residents here are protected against covid nineteen we will also progressively facilitate international travel with countries that have managed covid nineteen well and allow fully vaccinated persons to travel and to do business more freely this is a critical move that will allow us to reassert singapore is position as a business travel and talent hub we are working this out carefully and engaging our partner countries and will provide more details when ready we will continue to push for higher vaccination coverage and if the incidence of severe illness from covid nineteen remains low despite clusters emerging from time to time we will eventually be able to arrive at a truly endemic state practically all social and workplace restrictions can be lifted although some critical measures such as mask wearing and precautions for large events may remain this means that domestically infected cases will create much less disruption than they do today and our businesses can largely return to normal operations for the majority of cases businesses will not have to shut down their premises for deep cleaning and we need not commit huge resources towards contact tracing instead infected individuals with mild symptoms may be able to recover from home and close contacts will likely just be required to monitor their health without the need for quarantine or self isolation this is similar to how we treat influenza cases today globally singapore will likely be one of the highest vaccinated countries in the world we will be able to regain strong air and maritime connectivity to a large number of countries while ensuring that our healthcare system is well functioning and not overstretched by covid nineteen cases this will make us one of the best places to work and live in the region and across the world businesses have in fact continued to show confidence in our strong fundamentals during the pandemic despite the challenging environment investors committed $17200000000 in investment in 2020 the highest in twelve years in investment in 2020 the highest in twelve years more recently we also attracted significant investment from major biomedical and electronics companies such as sanofi in april biontech in may and global foundries in june but we cannot take this for granted we will continue to work hard to pursue projects that help companies grow and create new jobs and meaningful careers for singaporeans before i end i would like to thank singaporeans our businesses and our workers for walking this journey with us for the last eighteen months it has been tremendously difficult for many of you and we are deeply appreciative of the commitment and grit you have shown we are so close to reaching the end of the tunnel we will soon achieve a high vaccination coverage which will allow us to move decisively to a covid resilient state i want to appeal to everyone to not lose heart and work together to press on in our journey thank you minister wong mister deputy speaker sir like many countries around the world our fight against covid nineteen has been difficult and full of ups and downs the latest outbreak is a major setback for all of us many have been surprised at the size of these new clusters it shows how easy it is for the delta variant to spread and cause large outbreaks with the potential to overwhelm our hospital system furthermore in a mixed population of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons we are more likely to see large clusters because vaccinated persons can be infected but experience very mild symptoms consequently they may not realize they are infected and inadvertently become asymptomatic carriers by the time the cases pop up days or even weeks would have passed and the infection would have spread to many people because of these large clusters we faced a heightened risk of widespread community transmission before we attained adequate vaccine protection we must remember the proportion of people with two doses and with two weeks after their 2nd shot is still less than fifty this is when we moved into the heightened alert and we are especially worried about our seniors because there are still over 200000 seniors aged sixty and above who are not fully vaccinated if they catch the virus many will likely become severely ill or even succumb to the infection and that is why as you heard just now from my co chairs the mtf made the difficult decision to scale back activities and return to phase two heightened alert this will help to slow down transmission in the community and crucially this will give us time to push up vaccination rates further and protect our seniors i know the restrictions have caused much inconvenience to everyone we seek your forbearance and understanding i hope our explanations will help you understand why we had to reintroduce these painful but necessary measures to protect our seniors we also know these measures will be difficult for our workers and businesses painful but necessary measures to protect our seniors we also know these measures will be difficult for our workers and businesses and that is why mof announced a new $1100000000 support package last friday to cushion the impact i will elaborate on this in my statement later this afternoon on the supplementary supply bill and we hope the support measures will help affected workers and businesses tide over the heightened alert period as we bring the current outbreak under control and continue to speed up vaccinations we will be able to get our reopening plans back on track the key is to open up at the correct juncture some countries have decided to open up fully even though their vaccination rates are less than ideal for example the netherlands lifted all restrictions when 45 of its population was fully vaccinated cases surged tenfold to an average of 10000 a day within two weeks they have since reimposed restrictions the uk has about 55 of its population fully vaccinated although its coverage of its seniors is much higher at above ninety it lifted all restrictions on nineteen july its freedom day cases surged to 50000 a day more than two thirds of its peak in the last wave and are likely to rise further hospitalization and death rates are starting to creep up again almost entirely amongst unvaccinated individuals we are watching what is happening in these countries very closely what is clear to the multi ministry task force and our medical advisors is that we should be very careful about lifting restrictions when a significant proportion of our people are still not fully vaccinated especially our more vulnerable seniors while other countries may have come to terms with a certain level of covid nineteen cases and even deaths this is not the choice we want to make in singapore here we look out for one another and we take care of each other we do not want to see large numbers of covid nineteen patients in intensive care on oxygen supplementation let alone succumb to the virus so we must give our fellow singaporeans more time today many younger singaporeans are still waiting for their 2nd doses of vaccines and many of our seniors who had been hesitant about getting vaccinated are now starting to step forward so we will see continued improvements in our vaccination rates at the same time there is no need to wait for everyone to be vaccinated before we begin to open up that would mean holding back the entire reopening timeline until much later in the year which is not tenable so what is our approach let me explain we will synchronize our reopening with our vaccination coverage not just of the overall population but also amongst our seniors who are the most vulnerable and we will do so in a series of controlled steps so this is what we can all expect in the weeks ahead of controlled steps so this is what we can all expect in the weeks ahead in early august at the midpoint of the phase two heightened alert period we plan to review the current set of measures we will assess the overall infection situation we will also monitor the status of the infected cases to confirm that the link between infection and hospitalization has been weakened by the vaccines like in the chart just now which minister ong showed importantly by then two thirds of our population would have received two doses and we would have vaccinated about three quarters of our seniors aged seventy and above so if the clusters are under control and hospitalization rates remain low we will be able to ease some of the phase two heightened alert measures but the easing will be differentiated and extended to only vaccinated persons because they are much better protected against the effects of the virus against the effects of the virus this means that if you want to attend a large event or a religious service involving more than 100 persons you have to be fully vaccinated if you want to go out to dine in a restaurant or work out in a gym you have to be fully vaccinated by around early september we expect to vaccinate about eighty of our population with two doses and we hope to cover a similar proportion of our seniors aged seventy and above we will then be able to ease the restrictions further including allowing larger groups to get together especially if they are fully vaccinated we will also begin to reopen our borders especially for vaccinated persons to travel we will start by establishing travel corridors with countries or regions that have managed covid nineteen well and where the infection is similarly under control so fully vaccinated persons will then be able to travel to these countries or regions without needing to serve the full fourteen day stay home notice in a hotel when they return depending on the risk level of the country they visit we will either replace the shn with a rigorous testing regime or shorten the shn to seven days at home and this will allow vaccinated persons to travel more freely and this will allow vaccinated persons to travel more freely those who are not vaccinated can still travel but will be subject to the prevailing shn requirements beyond that we will continue with a series of progressive easings as we do so we must expect cases to rise partly because there is still ongoing cryptic transmission in our community which can easily break out into new clusters with increased activity levels also as we open our borders for people to travel without shn we will see more imported cases and infected persons slipping through from time to time but at that stage as you heard just now our main focus will no longer be on daily case numbers because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they catch the virus they are much less likely to become very ill instead our focus will be on the much smaller number of infected persons who need supplementary oxygen or require intensive care so at each stage of easing we will monitor the health outcomes especially the hospitalization and icu cases closely we will ensure that these remain acceptable and stable before we proceed to the next step but if hospitalization cases or worse severe illnesses were to shoot up we will have to be prepared to slow down or even pull back in particular we have to expect new variants to emerge which may be more transmissible more lethal or more successful at evading the present vaccines we will find solutions to these variants especially through booster shots or updated vaccines which we may need to roll out nationwide but we must be prepared that the new variants can lead to more severe outbreaks and may well force us to introduce restrictions again from time to time in short there are still considerable uncertainties about how the pandemic will unfold globally but our best bet is to push ahead with a high level of vaccine coverage for our people this will give us the best chance to resume more normal lives while keeping our morbidity and mortality rates low i have provided an overview of the roadmap for our transition to a covid resilient society where we learn to live with covid nineteen as part of our daily lives the mtf is still fleshing out the details and we will share more when ready i assure everyone that we are committed to seeing through these plans the current heightened alert is a temporary limited timeout with better vaccination coverage we will soon be able to resume our plans to reopen progressively while keeping everyone safe but i underline vaccination is key especially vaccination for our seniors if many among our seniors are not vaccinated we will continue to worry about our hospitalization and icu cases as well as fatalities so i make a special plea to all who remain unvaccinated or have not registered to be vaccinated especially our parents and grandparents please come forward and if you can not get out of the house we will send a team to your homes for the vaccination as part of our controlled and phased reopening safe management measures will still remain relevant and important basic smms like keeping a safe distance from others and wearing a mask can help reduce transmission effectively so we must stay disciplined and continue to maintain these practices even as we transition towards the new normal for example we would probably not want to do away completely with our mask requirements we may consider dispensing with masks when outdoors but it would still make sense to wear them in an indoor enclosed environment where transmission risks are greater so this may well be one of the last rules to go in the new normal at the same time we will continue with our regular enforcement checks and take strict actions against any breaches of the rules several members have asked questions about this especially how our nightlife establishments are monitored and i believe minister shamugam will be sharing more on this especially efforts by mha and the police later too but let me just say that our enforcement agencies are doing everything they can in very challenging circumstances since april last year a multi agency task force comprising various government agencies including the police have been coordinating the enforcement of safe management and safe distancing measures in public venues including f b outlets and massage and spa establishments they have been doing daily enforcement checks where laws were flouted offenders both operators and individuals have been taken to task and cases publicized our sdas and enforcement officers will continue to do their best and we should give them our full support most importantly we must all do our part and continue to exercise individual and social responsibility we cannot rely on enforcement efforts alone to get us through this pandemic our society would be much safer if we demonstrate social solidarity and a collective sense of responsibility to do the right things together there are a few simple but very effective precautions which we should all incorporate into our daily routines and we have said this probably like a 1000000 times but i think it is worth repeating practice good hygiene if you are not feeling well stay home see a doctor and get yourself tested do so even if you are vaccinated remember what i said earlier at the start that vaccinated persons can get infected and may feel very mild symptoms or even no symptoms so even if you are feeling unwell vaccinated feeling unwell but very mild symptoms get yourself tested if you receive an sms alert come forward to be tested as soon as possible and minimize your social interactions until you have a confirmed negative test result there is really no excuse not to be tested since testing is now more affordable accessible and convenient than it used to be and will continue to be so in the future the antigen rapid test kits the self test kits are widely available at all general retailers now if you buy and bulk it is cheaper too so you can buy a few and have it at home the mtf is also distributing these test kits to households we are starting with those who live near markets where large clusters have been identified and we will progressively scale up and distribute to everyone in singapore and as you heard just now we are also rolling out new methods of testing be it wastewater surveillance in our estates or breathalyzer tests at our checkpoints and now we have the breathalyzer test in parliament too before each parliamentary session so regular testing and the social consciousness to get ourselves tested regularly will protect us and keep us safe as we transit to the new normal mister deputy speaker sir we are all disheartened and upset when we hear of people breaking the rules acting irresponsibly and causing new classes to break out but over the past year and a half the vast majority of singaporeans have shown tremendous discipline many have also been working tirelessly in our fight against covid nineteen it is not just our healthcare workers like our doctors and nurses at our hospitals clinics and community care facilities it is also our fellow singaporeans on the front lines elsewhere some in less expected settings others in less visible places they include our safe distancing ambassadors food delivery riders cleaners and many more they work hard to keep singapore going and to keep all of us safe like mister lok chun kiat a cleaner with cbm private limited he attends to high risk locations where positive cases have been detected the cleaning work that he does is not easy under normal circumstances but now with the exposure to the virus he and his team have to put on full ppe and adhere closely to stringent procedures while they work it is because of people like chun kiat and his team that we are able to quickly deep clean our infected premises and minimize the risk of fomite transmission or ms siti zulaina binte muhammad syed a senior medical technologist with the national public health laboratory at the ncid she leads the team to investigate outbreaks and undertake testing surveillance it is mission critical work that requires long hours stretching into weekends and public holidays you can imagine the load coming through recently with the surge of cases we have had in the community it is because of people like siti and her team that we are able to detect and ring fence infections early there are many more chun kiats and siti is out there many more unsung heroes and heroines quietly and steadfastly contributing to our fight against covid nineteen i am sure the entire house will join me in saying to all of them a big heartfelt thank you sir these actions of our fellow singaporeans inspire us and give us confidence and hope that we will get through this together we are all disappointed by the latest outbreak and the heightened alert restrictions but we will recover and bounce back it is always darkest before the dawn so let us be strong and keep the faith the dawn is coming let us approach it with renewed strength as one people thank you mister deputy speaker i would like to address some of the questions that have been raised in relation to enforcement against ktv outlets specifically in this house and outside there have been a number of questions related to ktvs why were ktvs and nightclubs allowed to operate as f b outlets the enforcement regime in respect of these outlets the why were hostesses allowed in those places and the immigration status of those providing hostessing service at these places for example i can refer to a facebook post by mister alan john former editor of straits times raising some of these questions in a very succinct way and making a number of fair points based on his understanding of the facts and i will address these questions 1st why were ktvs allowed to change into fnb operations during the circuit breaker last year nightlife outlets were shut from 27th of march 2020 together with many other businesses from phase two which june 2020 many businesses were allowed to reopen including dine in at f b outlets massage establishments were also allowed to open with conditions but ktvs were not allowed to reopen we took a stricter approach with ktvs because singing was considered a high risk activity in an indoor setting and a higher risk of transmission in august of 2020 the singapore nightlife business association called them snba and the singapore entertainment affiliation sea other associations as well as individual businesses appealed for ktvs to reopen then for several months jobs livelihoods of those in the ktv industries the workers their jobs were at risk badly affected even with financial support from the government our assessment is that they probably employed about 10000 local workers as of end 2019 some of us met directly with the ktv businesses in august of 2020 listened to them there were several town hall sessions they asked to have singing dancing to resume and they proposed a pilot with a maximum of five persons in a room masks would be worn when not singing and disposable microphone covers would be used and they referred to other countries including south korea where this had been allowed others proposed changing their business models to f b outlets they needed help to get new permits change their use for f b and so on and for many the situation was desperate we considered their suggestions weighed the risks at one time we considered possibly allowing a pilot project for ktvs with very until now ktb operations remain forbidden it is illegal to have any kind of ktb operations we did not allow those then the group that had asked to move over to provide f b on a temporary basis we said okay to that again with several conditions why because basically anyone can offer and open an f b outlet and the government can not specifically say no to ktv outlets which want to become f b outlets provided they have the space to be an f b premises allow f b outlets and can get approval from sfa land use permissions and so on and conditions were imposed the pivoted businesses would need a food preparation area to prepare and serve food adequate indoor dining area for customers to be seated to have their meals with safe distancing in place and once converted to f b they were subject to the same safe management measures smms imposed on f b outlets meaning no intermingling amongst patrons and staff no live music no performances various other conditions so in summary from march 2020 until now one ktvs were not allowed to operate and two some ktvs were allowed to become f b outlets as well as some pubs and bars which they were also allowed to pivot to f b outlets so if you look at as of march of this year after several months of operations of these massage establishments former pubs bars ktv businesses pivoting to being f b outlets and so on situation was stable numbers of cases infections was generally low so that is the context in the background to why pubs bars ktv outlets were allowed to pivot and provide f b two it has been suggested that we should have assumed or known that ktv operators will cheat allow themselves to become semi brothels even though they were only allowed to provide f b and there have been suggestions ranging from we were in effect in cahoots with ktvs which is a suggestion in a recent quite unbalanced nikkei article or alternatively we were very naive not to realize what happens in ktvs the truth is we were neither in cahoots with the ktv operators nor are we as naive as some suggest let me explain i think most people will accept it will be wrong to treat all the 430 odd businesses ktv operators pubs bars who want to change to provide f b automatically as crooks several are genuine operators they want to pivot over to provide f b operators they want to pivot over to provide f b that is the only way they can survive if you ask snba sea there are ktvs which cater to families there are many which do legitimate business and they were crying out for help so more than 400 such businesses converted and about 100 exited the nightlife industry at the same time as we were considering this yes mtf government does know that there are some ktv operations pubs bars with dodgy reputations should we have said to them no you cannot convert to f b and for some if you look at their premises darkened rooms not the most optimal for dining and people might well say why would i want to go here for dining it appears commonsensical to say this is dodgy and doubtful but in law it is not so straightforward if the person comes to you and says yes i want to convert and i will keep to the rules you know this is how i was my business was perfectly legal in the past and now i will continue to be legal then the agencies will have to look him in the eye and say you can not get a license to become a food place because we do not think you are going to keep to the law in future we think you are going to break the law even though you have committed no offense and even though you confirm that you will follow the rules so i will come back to this later so in addition to seeing if we can say no to those with dodgy reputations part of the answer has got to be enforcement and i will also say realistically the people who are going to cheat going to do illegal things will do them anyway they will use lounges flats warehouses various places it has gone on and i am sure it goes on regardless of whether we allow the change to f b and there have been several illegal operations in different places outside of ktv outlets or ex ktv outlets which have been busted so as of november 2020 it was a risk assessed approach and in general it was working if you look at it as of march this year with a relatively low number of cases we then had the delta variant completely different transmissibility that variant came into the ktvs created a cluster there is some public confusion minister for health my colleague has spoken about it a number of times to clarify it the confusion that you know the ktv cluster was somehow the reason for the recent phase two heightened alert tightened restrictions imposed on 22nd of july that is not so he has clarified it that is not so if we had only the ktv cluster then we would not have had to move to phase two ha or the tightened restrictions in fact the mtf as he pointed out considered the ktv cluster and decided we can manage it without having to impose any additional restrictions and as he said in his speech the ktv cluster has been brought under control fairly quickly tracing testing ring fencing the cases so we have about five new cases linked to the ktv cluster each day for the past few days he gave you the figures i have the figures as of 24th of july 232 cases 49 in hospital none have been or are in icu so let me summarize by making three points about 430 businesses pivoted to f b for several months cases infections overall in singapore were low the new delta variant caused a ktv cluster that has been brought under control and three if we were facing only the ktv cluster there would have been no need for any tightened measures tightening of the measures is due to the cluster at the jurong fishery port they spread from the ports to the markets and the hawkers and into the wider community my colleagues have explained how this happened some are under the misimpression that the virus went from the ktvs to the fisheries port the evidence we have does not suggest that the virus seems to have come from the region to our port jfp now with this background there is a life issue which i will share with the members the snba has sent an open letter appealed for the industry to work more closely with the government to report illegal activities among other things and they have also pointed out pivoting has helped many legitimate businesses to survive so should we allow them to reopen and continue as f b operations this brings me to the earlier question i posed some of them when you look at the premises you do question if they can really be f b but it requires us to say flat out to the operators regardless of what you say i am not going to believe you and i am not going to allow you to operate an f b agencies are working on the conditions that can be imposed like cctvs various other conditions over and above what is applied to f b outlets they will also have to consult with the agc can we say no to an operator if we think it might be dodgy even if the operators undertake to comply with the conditions it is not so straightforward once these issues are assessed mtf has to decide on whether the opening or reopening can be allowed i will now deal with the questions which have been raised on enforcement in the period october 2020 to 10th of july 2021 the police conducted 202 operations against pivoted outlets as well as other outlets which were operating illegally so this is what i said earlier i assume we had said no to all pivoting of f b operations there would still be places which offer sex and meetup opportunities that was always going to happen so we had one police operation every single day on average since october 2020 so this i think should put to rest any questions about enforcement actions by the police one operation every day and that has resulted in the detection of 58 public entertainment act liquor control act infringements 595 smm breaches 142 arrests for offenses under various laws including the public entertainment act liquor control act employment of foreign manpower act immigration act not all in pivoted places but also in completely illegal operations to share a few examples in october of 2020 police raided units along ubi road and kalang pudding road 57 persons were investigated for breach of smms in november at genting lane 24 persons were investigated for breach of smms ten women were arrested for work path related offenses in february 2021 at emerald hill road and again at genting lane 88 persons investigated for breach of smms one man arrested for working without a valid work permit in april at kitchener road and verdon road 45 persons investigated for breach of smms seven men and one woman arrested in all the cases items such as karaoke equipment liquor were seized operators are being investigated enforcement operations were also conducted over twenty weekends at every single festive occasion since october of 2020 about 400 f b outlets including pivoted outlets were inspected in each operation to date agencies have imposed around 100 closure orders on f b outlets including on about forty pivoted outlets as i said to the house just now there were about 437 pivoted outlets so roughly ten have been acting illegally and about sixty other f b outlets also were in breach so sfa has permanently revoked the food license of seven pivoted outlets as of 23rd july let me now move to this business of hostesses since the onset of covid nineteen the rules are that hostessing is not allowed in any setting the women who were caught were likely in breach of their visit or work pass conditions and they were operating illegally and the 1st woman much attention has centered on her linked to the ktv cluster had come into singapore in february of 2021 through the boyfriend girlfriend category under the what we call the familial ties lane i will refer to it as ftl sponsored by a singapore citizen who applied for her on the basis that he was her boyfriend let me explain this boyfriend girlfriend category at the start of covid nineteen last year we banned short term visitors from coming into singapore so as of september last year the ban on short term visitors continued basically only singapore residents can come back some of their relatives and some business travelers october last year we introduced flexibility to allow boyfriends and girlfriends to come into singapore flexibility to allow boyfriends and girlfriends to come into singapore and why we had almost a complete ban on short term visitors so boyfriends girlfriends could not come in there were many appeals and for background reference you know in the ten years between 2000 to 2019 there were about 120000 singapore citizens who were in non resident marriages about one in four marriages were between singaporeans and non singaporean partners so it is quite common for singaporeans to have relationships with non singaporeans this boyfriend girlfriend category was specifically introduced in the context of the ban on short term visitors to allow singaporeans who are in relationships with foreign partners to be reunited because they had been separated for a long time due to border restrictions and this was after numerous appeals on this were received meanwhile there was a parallel development around september october 2020 we announced the unilateral opening to specific countries and regions which were of lower covid risk including vietnam brunei new zealand australia except victoria state our assessment was the risk of importation of the virus was assessed to be low vietnam specifically at a comprehensive public health surveillance system had displayed successful control over covid at that time and the last week four weeks of september 2020 it had zero local covid cases so under the unilateral opening travelers could seek entry into singapore by applying for an air travel pass and this means short term travelers from these countries were allowed to come in in february 2021 due to the worsening covid situation in vietnam we suspended the unilateral opening between singapore and vietnam which meant that short term travelers from vietnam could not come in from february 2021 under the unilateral opening ica then began to receive many applications for vietnamese to come into singapore under the boyfriend girlfriend category and people are quite skeptical no i was not going to say skeptical i was going to say inventive so to emphasize once we suspended the unilateral opening with vietnam in february of 2021 there were many applications under the boyfriend girlfriend category we looked at it scratched our heads the applications raised concerns because i just give examples and several examples you know there will be one vietnamese applicant and multiple sponsors claiming to be the lady is boyfriend there will be singaporean sponsors many who applied for multiple girlfriends it is possible but you know sponsors who already married to someone else applying many men claiming to be a single lady is boyfriend i mentioned it earlier and sponsors who are unable to substantiate when we ask questions what relationship do you really have with this person who is proposed to become sponsored but as members of parliament will know you know the residents will come to the mps and say i am a singapore citizen i have done national service why are you not allowing my girlfriend to come in we all have received such appeals ica received but when we looked at these applications for girlfriends and they were all primarily girlfriends to come in we decided this will not do we have to stop this so in march of 2021 this girlfriend boyfriend category was removed so you can no longer appeal for a boyfriend or girlfriend to come in so ica moved quite fast right february the unilateral opening with vietnam was suspended the next month in march the boyfriend girlfriend category was scrapped because we took the view that this was being abused so we created this boyfriend girlfriend during a pandemic last year october because we wanted to be compassionate now i mean if you wanted to rank the organizations in terms of compassion i do not think most people will put ica at number one on the list but an mha will not usually be accused of being the most compassionate either but we did want to try and be compassionate and helpful because of the number of appeals and people want their loved ones to come in and we want to try and help but if the system is abused then we have to stop it if it is mutated we have to stop it but unfortunately what that has meant is that many legitimate applications are now being refused ica has also taken action in respect of dodgy applications by rescinding the approvals barring the travelers from entry into singapore and suspending the sponsors and travelers from future applications apart from the ftl category we have other avenues for foreigners to enter into singapore during this pandemic but very limited they include mom is work pass holder lane and moe is student pass holder lane where applicants are required to submit their application to mom and moe is a student pass holder lane where applicants are required to submit their application to mom and moe respectively for entry approval and are subject to screening obviously there are also short term visitors who are already in singapore before the border controls were imposed in march of 2020 and for these persons ica assesses their application for extensions of their short term visit pass on a case by case basis it takes into consideration factors including restrictions on international travel flight availability and whether the applicants have family ties in singapore so tying that back to the police operations against nightlife outlets recent operations 29 women aged between twenty and 47 of various nationalities have been arrested for offenses under the employment of foreign manpower act and other laws permanent residents work pass holders s pass holders short term pass holders one who came in under the unilateral opening five who had come in under the girlfriend category long term visit pass holders other passers student pass dependents pass permanent residents unlikely to have committed any offense except for maybe safe distancing measures others on work pass would be in breach of their work pass conditions if they were performing services as hostess but those on visit passes would be in breach as well by working without a work permit but if they say they were not working then we have to show that they were in breach and it is often cat and mouse and as members will know we can not use a trace together data for this so so far sixteen women have had their passes canceled and they have been or will be deported investigations are ongoing in respect of the other women and of course the operators operations some of them are pivoted outlets several of them are not you know in other places in warehouses and so on and we continuously have to look for them rely on tip offs as well as our own intelligence and keep trying to keep it under control so i think i have dealt with many of the questions that have been raised thank you mister pritam singh thank you mister deputy speaker i have a few questions for minister mti mister gan kim yong and originally minister of health but i think i will direct them to the minister of home affairs the 1st series of questions pertain to the differentiated regime between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals which is part of the coming to terms with the endemic state of treating covid nineteen as endemic in the community this refers the query pertains to the negative pre event tests that unvaccinated individuals will be required to undertake unvaccinated individuals will be required to undertake i think a few days ago in israel the prime minister announced that the individual the unvaccinated individual there will pay for the test i do not believe minister clarified who pays for that test in singapore so it will be helpful for minister to clarify that the 2nd question directed at minister gan pertains to supply issues of the vaccine i think previously in updates that the mtf had given is this still a problem or are we on track to open the economy in concert with the plan the mtf has announced by i believe september now the question specifically on the ktv issues indeed as minister ong mentioned earlier lots of disappointment among singaporeans but i thought it would be important to have at least some understanding of common facts before coming to conclusions so the 1st question is with regard to the enforcement regime at the pivoted establishments was it a heightened sort of enforcement regime the minister mentioned a few numbers 202 enforcements from october last year to july this year but was there some specific attention paid on pivoted ktv establishments i think earlier on minister wong spoke in a facebook post about a cat and mouse game minister referred to that as well were additional conditions imposed on certain operators in view of their past record or reputation so to speak and in this regard again was there a differentiated regime from the enforcement agencies to pay more attention to some of these establishments ministers spoke of some i think a total of seven establishments and i stand corrected if i am wrong seven establishments that have seen their licenses revoked but that about ten of the establishment of the pivoted ktv establishments have been in breach of regulation so are the licenses for that ten which i think would extend to about forty establishments are going to be revoked as well and finally i received some emails from members of the public about warnings that they had given the authorities about some of these ktv establishments how many warnings or feedback how many pieces of feedback did not just mha but also moh and the other agencies receive on potential smm violations egregious smm violations in ktv establishments thank you minister khan the president and the key is to look at the progress in our vaccination program and our vaccination program as the minister for health explained just now is picking up momentum but it is important for us to focus a lot more on the vaccination of our senior population which is of greater concern to all of us and therefore i think we continue to be on track with our economic opening and once as soon as we are able to reach our vaccination rate of eighty and above around about september or october i think we will be able to move in a bigger way in the opening of the economy but i also also want to point out that we are not likely to have a big bang opening to allow everything to be done in one go because it is important for us as minister ong and i mentioned earlier to continue to monitor the impact on the severe cases because if we do have serious cases we will then have a problem with the capacity of a healthcare system which will then result in a high mortality rate so we need to continue to keep an eye on our number of serious cases look at the trend of these serious cases at the same time making sure that our vaccination rate is high then we will be able to progressively step by step open up our economy or open up our borders to allow travel in and out of singapore and as i mentioned in my speech these details are still being worked out and we will share more details later on i will ask mister wong to talk about testing because this relates to the national policy on testing thank you the question i believe was about who pays for the cost of tests if the person is unvaccinated to get into a venue well the rule will be the thinking is that the rule is for certain activities certain settings we will require vaccinated persons only and from the government side the rule will be that if the person is not vaccinated not fully vaccinated then he will have to produce negative tests confirm negative tests that is the requirement now how to go about that we will let venue operators and owners decide they may want to do it free they may want to set up an operation a restaurant might want to do that a venue operator might want to do that a mice event organizer might want to do that because he says look i want to do that to let unvaccinated persons come in if not then he may well say look it is up to the individual the individual has to go to the clinic get a test and then show me the results so the government sets a rule the framework i think individual organizations that then are looking at the framework can decide whether or not they want to provide the test for their customers or they would require the customers to get the test from a clinic mister sian moogam as i noted it i think there were four questions if i got it right from mister singh 1st on the enforcement regime i think mister singh wanted to know if it is heightened i think mister singh can assume that if there was one enforcement action per day it is quite intense and it has been so from october of last year to july of this year right from the beginning and this is quite apart from what safe distance ambassadors and so on do 2nd i think mister singh wanted to know was there a particular focus on pivoted outlets i gave the breakdown just now not all targeted pivoted outlets in fact there were a number who were not to be operating at all and in fact totally illegal operations and i would say in terms of seriousness those are particularly pernicious in terms of transmission the kind of activities and so on and nothing is supposed to be happening in the warehouse they set up and they do everything and so those kinds of operations were busted as well so a broad range and also f b operations which are not pivoted operations just simply reopening they also some of them have been breaching now do not mistake me to think that every single one was therefore engaging in what we might consider to be shadier activities sometimes they were breaches also but we needed to target a broad range also but we needed to target a broad range 3rd i think mister singh wanted to know seven have been closed but ten i pointed out that ten were in breach about forty odd out of the 400 odd which had pivoted are they going to be closed i assume mister singh is not asking for closing down every operation as long as there is any breach there is a framework depending on the nature of the breach there will be a penalty and the penalty is transparent and penalty will be imposed according to the kind of breach that has been committed and i think most people will know there is also a point system for breaches which leads to closure of course egregious breaches there will be closure but and i would not ascribe to mister singh the suggestion that police now should get even tougher and just close everyone down as long as there is one breach now the last point i think was whether warnings given by public were taken seriously now i do not do the operations obviously but i think most mps will know how in general police intel system is expected to work police have their own intelligence framework their own ground framework and public tip offs a lot of crimes are solved by public tip offs and they are important they are taken seriously and i assume that goes into the assessment framework on what operations to conduct thank you sir minister ong thank you there is a last question by mister singh on supplies supplies continue to be in shortage throughout the world many developing countries are still trying to secure supplies and in the earlier stage of the pandemic we too are short of supplies but fortunately we had negotiated for aps advanced purchasing agreements with major suppliers in the early stage of the pandemic and lately we were able to discuss and able to bring forward and confirm some of the delivery schedule so as of now for the past month or two actually we have not had a supply problem our constraint now is we need more especially our seniors to come forward and get vaccinated minister gan you have a clarification thank you mister deputy speaker i just wanted to add a point to what mister wong has explained on the testing strategy because as time goes on the testing system will also evolve say for example in time to come if you have gotten a negative test result you may be able to enter multiple events and multiple premises so it is not just one event to one test so you just have to bear that in mind mister s thank you deputy speaker and thank you to the ministers for the update i have two groups of clarification points the 1st is really stemming from a worry about discrimination and treatment between those who have been vaccinated versus those who are unable to and those who do not wish to be vaccinated and the treatment that they receive on one hand i empathize and hear the calls of those saying what is the point of being vaccinated if i am still you know faced with certain restrictions or why are we being penalized but at the same time i know full well the impact of some of those who are unvaccinated for various medical reasons in particular our seniors and the social impact of the isolation not being able to be involved in activities as such i wonder if in the trace together app for example we might consider amending it to show those who are vaccinated those who are not vaccinated and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and if there can be differentiation of treatment if so how and also how this might take into treatment if so how and also how this might take into account for example families who have seniors or children who are unable to be vaccinated moving on to my 2nd group of clarification points i think we have spoken about the ktv cluster but i would also like to ask about the jurong fishery port cluster as this spread has impacted stallholders workers and residents alike in both mai cheng san and chong boon markets as well as food centers firstly with the closure of jurong fishery port and seafood stalls in the markets what is the impact to the supply of our seafood and what are measures which have been taken to mitigate disruption to these supplies 2nd some are also very worried about the safety of eating seafood during this time could the minister please elaborate what led to the spread of covid nineteen in the jurong fishery port whether there are clearer findings on the mechanism of transmission of covid nineteen into the port and subsequently into our local markets and whether our seafood is safe for consumption and finally as we look towards reopening while we understand that there have been efforts to make the operations at the port contactless we also understand that it is hard work and working in the markets can be strenuous and there are inevitably close interactions between the workers markets can be strenuous and there are inevitably close interactions between the workers do our smm measures need changing and how can we ensure the safe reopening of jurong fishery port and our markets and hawker centers thank you minister ong thank you i will provide some answers then i will invite minister grace fu to supplement with her clarifications 1st on the differentiation i will not call it discrimination because there are good public health reasons to differentiate the treatment between those who are vaccinated and not vaccinated because the differentiation helps protect those who are not vaccinated because the differentiation helps protect those who are not vaccinated member asked about whether tracetogether app can indicate vaccination status i believe it already does mine does it says i am vaccinated you can check yours yeah it does 2nd is children or seniors who because of medical conditions are not allowed to be vaccinated whether they get left out earlier on when we came out with the 25 rules one of the criticism is that it is so confusing and indeed one of the confusions the confusion arises because of the exemptions we are trying to give that in a group of five all all vaccinated but you allow up to two children below twelve who can not get vaccinated but can join part of the group so i think when we devise when we do our mid term review we will also take into account these provisions and as for those who can not be vaccinated or unvaccinated for some reasons but want to join such a group we had earlier also allowed them to take a pet a pre event test if you are negative you can join the group and this is something we will consider as we do our midterm review lastly i do want to reiterate a point i made earlier when we get to a very high level of vaccination rate there should be very little differentiation between vaccinated and unvaccinated because collectively we will be very resilient by then there will probably be justification for lesser differentiation as for the point about seafood being safe seafood is absolutely safe to consume how did it get into the jurong fishery port how did it get into the jurong fishery port as i mentioned earlier phylogenetic studies show that there is likely to be multiple points of entries because there are slight genetic differences in the virus and in the infections across the cluster we will continue to see if we can trace the sources of the infections but as of now it does not help our public health measures it does not help us to suppress the cluster it helps us understand the infections infiltration how it happened and help us strengthen the safe management measures but as to controlling the cluster now those information does not help but we will continue to study them minister grace fu thank you deputy speaker for allowing me to address the clarifications that the cluster has on this topic i think it is important for us to give the house an account on jurong fishery port as well as our food supply and its impact on hawker centers and markets so with your permission deputy speaker may i address some of the pqs that members have filed on related subjects as well yes please members mister dennis tan and ms nadia samdin have filed pqs on the same subject sat down for a later sitting several members have also filed related pqs for a later sitting which i will address together for later sitting which i will address together so members yip hong wing mister dennis tan on measures taken to mitigate the transmission of covid nineteen at our official reports and key food facilities mister dennis tan on assistance given to the companies and workers at jfp mister daryl david on support given to storeholders and markets and hawker centers mister deputy speaker on support given to storeholders and markets and hawker centers mister deputy speaker on food resilience we have worked closely with industry partners over the years to build diversified food supply chains this includes our seafood supplies the jurong fishery port handles about thirty of our total seafood imports and is complemented by sinoco fishery port or sfp which handles about four of seafood imports the remaining two thirds of our seafood imports are distributed to the industry via other routes so it is a very diversified distribution platform our seafood supply has remained stable despite the closure of jfp and local disruptions at our markets following the closure of jfp on seventeen july singaporeans were understandably worried some had rushed to buy seafood over that weekend we saw an increase in food fall at supermarkets after the market seafood storeholders were required to get tested on eighteen july they could open their stores only after receiving a negative pcr swab test result all jfp workers were quarantined thus affecting the operations of many suppliers the phase two heightened alert restrictions on dining in moderated the demand the singapore food agency and enterprise singapore responded quickly to facilitate distributors and supermarkets to activate alternative arrangements these arrangements include diverting supplies directly to the supermarket is distribution centers and retail outlets supermarkets themselves increase their stock of fresh produce through their suppliers they have been keeping their retail shelves well stocked with a variety of seafood including the frozen seafood varieties meanwhile sfp sinoko remains in operation as the market seafood stores resumed operations some switched to sfp for their supply or sourced from alternative suppliers we have sufficient stocks of frozen seafood i visited the jurong coal store last wednesday which stores supplies of frozen shrimp sea bass and grouper among others the coal store facility serves many wholesalers supplying to the supermarkets and food establishments island wide at the same time retail food establishments are adjusting by switching to frozen alternatives thing by switching to frozen alternatives our local farms also produce a good variety of seafood such as sea bass tilapia and grouper and some of them have reported a manifold increase in inquiry and orders and they can be found online for example lazada is red marts fairprice online shop and at the supermarkets as well such as prime and fairprice i encourage singaporeans to broaden their choices of seafood and where they buy their seafood from we have been reviewing longer term plans for this sector since 2020 sfa has been conducting studies on enhancements to the wholesale fresh produce sector and is working with nea to study the wet market sector to better meet the future demands of consumers and industry we will factor in lessons learned from this episode to better future proof the sector this episode has truly tested the resilience of our supply chains our overall seafood supply situation has remained stable because of our diversified supply and distribution channels sfa and esg will work with industry partners to strengthen their business continuity plans and i also like to thank all the industry players for stepping up in this period of crisis next at jurong fishery port and key food facilities our fishery ports pasir panjang wholesale center abattoir and slaughterhouses are key nodes in our food supply chain sfa has begun working with the companies operating in these facilities to implement smms since the start of the covid nineteen pandemic our objectives are to protect public health by minimizing the spread of the virus and to ensure business continuity by minimizing the spread of the virus and to ensure business continuity to minimize risk of infection from foreigners contactless delivery for the truck drivers and boatmen was implemented controlled access to these facilities has been in place with only workers and registered trade visitors the president of the united states doctor david morgan and the united states department of health and human services managed to break through these defenses with many cases detected at jfp over the past month the cases further spread to the markets and hawker centers through the stallholders who had visited jfp in order to break the chains of transmission moh made a difficult but necessary decision to close jfp for two weeks from seventeen to 31 july with all 604 workers issued quarantine orders investigations by moh and sfa are ongoing to determine how transmission had taken place in jfp and we have all heard from the minister for health earlier on we are not waiting for that investigation to complete because as minister ong has mentioned it is important for us to act immediately to protect public health so on our own our preliminary review has identified some areas for improvement 1st the humid and laborious environment made it uncomfortable for workers to wear their masks for a prolonged period of time this meant a higher propensity for workers to adjust their masks or take them off momentarily 2nd the workers could have taken off their masks while they take their breaks smoking breaks for example and socialize in close proximity 3rd jfp being a marketplace meant that the workers and traders mixed freely throughout the facility it is just like a market that we are used to shoppers going around traders going around and sometimes between storeholders they mix as well as they move stocks from one to another some contactless delivery measures were not strictly followed finally we are investigating the possibility of formide transmission in jfp we will address these areas in our smms with practical solutions and enforcement before we reopen jfp the 1st round of deep cleaning of jfp was done on eighteen july and we will be conducting another round before it is reopened common areas and crates will be regularly cleaned during its operation sfa will work with companies to implement seven day rostered routine testing or rrt for all workers at jfp and all workers will be encouraged to get vaccinated contactless delivery protocols for truck drivers and boatmen will be stepped up trade visitors who are not on any covid nineteen testing regimes such as rrt will be subjected to an antigen rapid test art before entering more frequent patrols will be carried out to ensure compliance with the smms working closely with moh and informed by their epidemiological investigation we will adjust these enhanced measures if necessary to better protect both the workers and trade visitors sfa has audited the smm at sfp and pbwc it will progressively cover all the other key food facilities one time pcr swab tests of all workers is being carried out we are almost at the tail end i am very glad to report that we are not seeing big clusters in these facilities seven day rrt and enhanced smms will be rolled out to these facilities as soon as possible we will monitor the operation closely and take enforcement action for any non compliance with the smms at these facilities an alternative site is being made available for use in the event of another closure of the fishery ports or ppwc the delta variant is a formidable foe collective responsibility is required to keep everyone safe next on assistance extended to jfp and related businesses the relevant agencies are working with companies to provide the necessary assistance during this difficult period we have been facilitating companies to redirect supplies directly to the supermarket is distribution centers and retail outlets so that they can continue operations despite the closure of jfp we are also coordinating closely with the companies to ensure that their workers have been swapped and are healthy before we resume operations at jfp next week as announced by the ministry of finance last week the government will provide an additional four week rental waiver for qualifying tenants on government owned commercial properties eligible workers and self employed persons can apply for the covid nineteen recovery grant temporary those under quarantine can also apply to the ministry of health for financial assistance under the quarantine order allowance scheme as to support for stallholders in markets and hawker centers the government is committed to support our hawkers and work with them through this difficult period a one off cash assistance of $500 under the market and hawker center relief fund will be disbursed to each storeholder of cooked food and market stalls in centers managed by nea or nea appointed operators in august storeholders need not apply for this relief the money will be directly credited into the bank accounts of the storeholders this is on top of the 3rd month of rental waiver and subsidies for fees for table cleaning and dish washing services provided this year those under quarantine can apply for the quarantine order allowance scheme and those eligible may apply for the covid nineteen recovery grant temporary for hawkers that continue to face financial issues they can also approach nea who will review their case and provide case by case support on ms nadia samdin is question about measures to improve safety at our markets and hawker centers nea will be putting in place titan smm at all markets and hawker centers to ensure that they remain clean and safe for storeholders and patrons bear in mind that many of our hawker centers and markets are frequented by elderly patrons so we are taking extra precaution to make sure that their health and safety are protected so we will carry out rostered routine testing for stallholders once every fourteen days we will facilitate the testing such as setting up more quick testing centers as announced by moh and explore teaching hawkers to conduct self testing at steady seat mandatory safe entry check in will be implemented at all markets and hawker centers managed by nea or nea appointed operators to facilitate more effective contact tracing we have previously introduced e payments to go cashless and will encourage hawkers and patrons to use this mode of payment to minimize contact and also possibility of formite transmission about ninety of those working in markets and hawker centers this includes our stallholders our hawkers as well as our cleaners at the centers have received at least one dose of the vaccine so it is very high vaccination rate ninety and we are calling up encouraging those who have yet to do so to go for vaccination as soon as possible while we will continue to ensure the cleanliness of our hawker centers through regular cleaning and disinfection i also want to remind all patrons to adhere to smns and to observe personal hygiene when dining resumes patrons are reminded that they can do their part by returning their own used trays crockery and litter to help create a cleaner dining environment thank you deputy speaker doctor tan wu meng doctor tan wu meng i thank the ministers for their statements by way of clarification i would like to raise three questions a number of clementi residents feel very much affected by the recent outbreak our central market has had to close many worried parents seniors families concerned about the way forward the 1st question is relating to the jurong fishery port cluster what measures can we take to better identify workplaces that may have a higher risk of transmission compared to elsewhere have a higher risk of transmission compared to elsewhere three weeks ago i filed a pq on detecting covid nineteen in the built environment can i ask the task force what efforts are being made to look for other areas and workplaces that could be potential hotspots but which have not yet come to surface but which are still at higher risk 2nd question is on our schools a number of clementine parents have been watching the reports of some schools having students infected possibly by transmission at home and they want to know given the delta variant what measures are being taken to maintain the safety of students especially younger children who are not yet able to be vaccinated for example how soon can we roll out breathalyzers and tests which are easy enough for a child to do themselves and thirdly 3rd question sir even as we open up and transition i ask the ministries that we must maintain many of the capabilities built up during this pandemic and internalize the lessons learned because we know that a worse variant of covid or even a future disease x a worse pandemic is just a question of when rather than if so i thank the ministers for their efforts our public servants for their efforts and i seek these questions as clarification thank you minister wong so on the three questions firstly we are constantly looking at the landscape to identify areas of risk where we might want to take greater attention i would say there are three broad criteria number one anything that interfaces with the outside world is at risk and therefore we take greater attention that includes our airport our seaports the different interfaces with the external environment and there we want to put greater precautions safeguards including regular testing for the people who are working there number two any domestic or local activity that has high touch interactions with many people and where people are not wearing masks or potentially are in an indoor environment and that includes dining it includes your spas massage establishments your beauty services and that is why we have also identified this as higher risk settings and we have asked the people who are in these settings to be put on a regular testing regime using the antigen rapid test kits thirdly it is an assessment of areas where we think smms may not be effectively done so we look around and there is a qualitative assessment our sdas are out there enforcement officers are out there and if we see that potentially in this particular industry in this particular work site smms are not followed then that raises alarm bells and we would want to take a closer look at that so this is constantly being done and we are always looking at potential areas of risk where we would want to put more attention or require more testing to be done on schools that is also something we are watching carefully i think the school protocols have fortunately been very tight up to now in the recent outbreaks we have not had school based transmission we have had students who have been infected from their home from family members but not yet school based transmission we hope that can continue that is in part because our schools have been very stringent in keeping and complying with these protocols but still beyond us having safe management measures we would certainly look at putting in place a testing regime especially when there are more convenient methods of testing which can be scaled up and then finally we completely agree with doctor tan is point that we have to continue to build up our capabilities because the battle is not over yet new variants future pandemics we just have to continue this process of building better capabilities to protect ourselves thank you ms hazel pua thank you deputy speaker i thank the ministers for their statement i am asking this question on behalf of some seniors who have conveyed to me their frustration that while they are being urged to get vaccinated they are unable to get an appointment for a sinovac vaccination i think we do have a group of individuals who prefer vaccinations using the traditional approach and have reservations about newer technologies so given that we are especially concerned about vaccination for our seniors what avenues are there available for these seniors who prefer the traditional approach are there plans to further expand the sinovac vaccination thank you thank you i think 1st of all is try to explain to the seniors which i have tried a lot which is that the mrna vaccine actually has been developed for many many years it is not something so noble and so new it went through all the rigorous evaluation by different authorities and then approved and so far even in singapore a few 1000000s have taken it around the world even more and it is proven to be safe and effective every vaccine will have side effects including sinovac including mrna so it is a good vaccine and as far as possible we want to persuade everyone including our seniors to take the mrna vaccine but for those who are simply not comfortable or they are contraindicated for vaccine and they want to take the sinovac vaccine we now have made it available under the special access route they can make an appointment it may involve some waiting but they will eventually get their vaccinations i have reported just now that 71 72000 people have in fact gotten their doses so it is possible minority especially among seniors only ten chose the or rather for all those who take the sinovac vaccine and are senior above sixty years old only ten are singaporean so the great majority of singaporean seniors actually still prefer the mrna vaccine so make the appointment you have got to wait a while but you eventually will get the vaccine sorry minister i should clarify that they actually tried to make the appointment but they are told that it is fully booked zero it should not be the case but if you can give me the contact we are more than happy to help them facilitate and make an appointment there are twenty over clinics that are doing that now mister liang ing wah thank you mister deputy speaker so businesses especially the f b sectors are finding this start stop series of activities really disruptive and there are growing frustrations low morale fatigue setting in and they ask why is the f b sector seems to be bearing the brunt of each of the heightened measures so can i ask the minister why did we reverse on the nineteen july decision to have this fully vaccinated five dining it appears to be a reasonable proposition where the diners among them are fully vaccinated and this is indeed what the kind of scenario we are looking at and with that kind of de risking why do not we allow that to continue i would like to hear this from the minister mister gan thank you i thought i spent half an hour explaining why we need to revert back to phase two heightened alert and let me try again i think when we introduced the five two regime we were prepared to go ahead with it except when we found that there is a significant number of infections transmitting within the community and the vaccination rates of our seniors are still relatively low therefore the risk profile was significantly different from when we 1st started planning for fivetwo framework therefore we had to make a very painful decision i must share with you that we deliberated at length on this issue of course one option at length on this issue of course one option is to proceed with it come hell or high water but the risk that we are going to take is that you may see a significant number of seniors being infected and because they will still be unvaccinated and they will still have risk and they will still have risk severe outcome and even mortality and you may think that well it is okay then just do not allow the unvaccinated to go to the restaurants but you must also remember that those who go to the restaurants who are vaccinated may still be infected and bring the virus back home to the families where there are seniors who are unvaccinated and therefore it is important for us to weigh the pros and cons between proceeding with it or to make a painful decision to reverse the decision and to give us more time to allow the vaccination rate to improve both general vaccination rate as well as a senior is vaccination rate so we fully appreciate the challenges the f b sector is facing and is still facing today until we are able to restore dining in and therefore we appeal to them to work with us and i think we have been working with the minister of finance to roll out support packages to help them tide over this period of difficult and challenging phase and i think the minister of finance and i met them and tried to understand their concerns and to also reassure them that we are aware of their challenges and we will do what we can to help and support them aware of their challenges and we will do what we can to help and support them and i must also say that the reason they are facing usually face the brunt of our measures is because as mister wong pointed out earlier they are front facing and there is a lot of interaction within restaurants and f b outlets and the most critical difference is that their activities are masked off because when they eat and drink they have to remove their masks and therefore it is one of the very high risk settings and therefore we have to be extra careful and exercise additional caution and unfortunately when we have to tighten our measures in order to protect the community the f b will have to work with us mister gerald gham into the port and the exact mechanism for transmission is unclear up to now were these foreign fishermen required to take any covid nineteen tests or be vaccinated before entering the fishery port and if not can this be introduced immediately to prevent further import of the virus from countries where the pandemic is raging next regarding the sinovac vaccine is the relatively lower efficacy rate of the sinovac vaccine the reason why compared to the mrna vaccines is that the reason why those who got the sinovac vaccine are not considered fully vaccinated in singapore this lower efficacy rate has been known for some time so why did not moh make this clearer we make this known clearer so that they will not be giving the same recognition to sinovac as mrna vaccine yet for the purpose of differentiated measures because this could have blunted the demand for the vaccine which was mentioned earlier and convinced more people to get the mrna vaccines as we reopen our borders many more foreigners will be entering singapore are there plans to require vaccinations for both short and long term visitors so that they do not inadvertently reduce our overall vaccination rate and lastly a recent british study found that a longer period of eight weeks between vaccinations produces a higher immune response than a spacing of three weeks now in our haste to get people fully vaccinated where we are encouraging people to book the 2nd dose three weeks after the 1st dose will we be compromising on maximizing durable immunity minister grace fu mister deputy speaker i would like to address mister gerald giam is 1st question on crewmen indeed i think that there is minister would you like to take your mask off there is a hypothesis that the cluster may have come through punched through through an indonesian or through a fisherman on a fishery boat that hypothesis actually has not been confirmed at this point in time but we are not waiting for that so we are looking at how to strengthen the smm at the border we have already started contactless delivery since april we have already started contactless delivery since april that is along with the strengthened heightened smm at pasipanjang warehouse center wholesale center we have instituted that also for sinoko and jurong fishery port but with regard to the question about whether we should subject them to vaccination or art that is something that we are considering at this point in time whatever we do i think we are looking for practical solutions where we can do it without increasing the risks so if the crewmen right now they are actually contactless in other words they are not allowed to land they will stay on the vessel and they will use the vessel equipment to move their buckets of fish onto the shore and then our shore workers will take it over and we actually do not allow them to land on our shore so if we subject them to frequent tests that may be a way for them to actually be landing more frequently on our shore so we have to evaluate these options look for practical and effective solutions the president a couple of questions one on sinovac actually if one is vaccinated with sinovac now it does reflect in your health hub and it brackets sar so it is recorded that you are vaccinated with sinovac i think the question is whether it should then be conferred the concessions should we have differentiated safe management measures i would say that currently there are different vaccines and every vaccine has different efficacy and it would not be from a public health point of view it would not make sense to just treat every vaccine the same i mentioned in my statement just now the efficacy of sinovac against delta variant because of the places that it has been applied and administered that data is still being built up and at the same time the key issue is that sinovac when it applied to hsa for psar approval the data was not complete but those data has now been submitted so we have a lot of data now before us that data on efficacy against delta is building up we got data in hsa we will assess them robustly and once if it is approved under psar naturally it will be recognized the 3rd question if i get correctly is if we allow traveling travel lanes to open whether we will ensure that travelers to singapore are also vaccinated and explained by minister lawrence wong just now i think we have to open up travel very carefully and step by step and you do not want to inject infections that make things go out of control again so what is a natural so for example we have unilateral opening for very safe regions and so far it has not caused us community spreading because we assess those regions and know that they are very safe next step is for those regions that have also controlled their infections and have risk level about same as us we can for example open up for vaccinated travelers to and fro without the need for shn but require a series of tests so i think whichever step we whatever step we take always make sure that it does not raise our risk level but maintain or even lower our risk level that will be our approach mister alex yam thank you mister deputy speaker thank you mister deputy speaker i welcome the mtf is focus on future differentiated treatment for vaccinated and unvaccinated it is perhaps one of the tools in the kit to persuade encourage nudge and cajole those who are still considering however i wish to return to a suggestion i made at the very beginning of the national vaccination program which is to consider making vaccination mandatory a lot of effort has gone into encouraging singaporeans to be vaccinated because it makes sense and i therefore consider it our civic duty to be vaccinated if there are no medical grounds to refuse ultimately the fear is that the freedom of a minority to choose not to be vaccinated will affect the freedom of the majority who have chosen to be vaccinated for the sake of themselves their families and the community the 2nd clarification i seek is with regards to effectiveness of trace together and safe entry for contact tracing over the last few days with regards to the ktv cluster and also partially to the jurong fishery cluster we heard various issues not so much issues we heard some limitations vis a vis contact tracing because people who do not bring their phones with them or their dongles with them because of fear of being detected in certain places so whether or not the mtf can comment on whether contact tracing has been made more difficult recently and lastly on differentiated treatment i echo the comment that was made by a fellow member ms nadia samdin on differentiated treatment i welcome it how will we eventually distinguish between those who knowingly avoid vaccination and those who do not have a choice for example the young and the medically excused this is of course if we do not introduce mandatory vaccination thank you minister ong did not quite get the 2nd question so maybe minister lawrence wong can answer that later whether we can make vaccine i was busy copying the question whether we can make vaccination compulsory like we did for mmr and others it is not time yet to think about that proposition because as of now the use of the vaccines is under psar which is pandemic special access route so under emergency use in the pandemic situation to make it mandatory i think is not quite consistent in time to come when covid nineteen is really pandemic maybe it is a policy that governments around the world will have to consider on the 3rd question which is related to ms nadia samdin is question how do we distinguish between those who knowingly which is related to ms nadia samdin is question how do we distinguish between those who knowingly choose not to vaccinate versus those who cannot get vaccinated from a public health point of view they are actually the same they are equally vulnerable and so from a public health point of view we ought to treat them the same in terms of the differentiated treatment if you are not vaccinated to protect you best not to join the big events it cannot be that because your intention is different we let you join that would not make sense from a public health point of view having said that as i mentioned earlier we will think of measures such as you get yourself tested and you can join or in time to come when our vaccination rate is very high and our collective resilience is so strong we actually do not need much of that differentiation the 2nd question is on contact tracing the effectiveness of tracetogether and safeentry i would say generally even in the recent episode we have seen that the systems are in place most people vast majority are using the tracetogether tokens or app properly establishments are having proper gating check ins using safe entry and so overall we still find this to be very effective in doing timely contact tracing and ring fencing are there people who abuse who do not use the app and trace together yes obviously they are but by and large it has still been very effective and we want to make it even more effective which is why for markets and hawker centers previously we had not put safe entry check in requirements for all markets and hawker centers because we all know it is very difficult it is open it is porous people come in from all the different places so we only did it for the very popular markets but now we are planning based on the lessons we have learned and realizing how effective it is we are planning to put in safe entry centers it will lead to some inconvenience on the ground with many of your residents and i seek members understanding to explain to your residents why this is necessary in order for us to have effective contact tracing during this pandemic sorry mister deputy speaker i missed out one question by mister gerald guillaume just now he mentioned whether we are rushing those one and those two by keeping only a three week duration and whether a longer duration will make the vaccine more effective that is the hypothesis of one study and the conclusion is not conclusive there are many other studies that show that three weeks for pfizer biontech four weeks for moderna is an appropriate duration and gap between those one and those two for good efficacy so i think the conclusion is not definite ms joan pereira the quick test centers for the fast and easy testing can be opened for extended hours to cater to one man operations and other businesses who may have to go for their mandatory swab test every fourteen days outside of their operating hours thank you their operating hours thank you answer is yes i think the quick test center in time to come is likely to be almost a national infrastructure for living with endemic covid i can imagine buildings employers requiring that their employees should be tested once every fourteen days or seven days before coming to work as a precaution as part of living with covid and the easy way to do it either you buy a self test kit from the pharmacy or you walk into one of these quick test centers do a self swap or do a breathalyzer test and in that circumstance i think we need to study the demand pattern and if need be we will need to operate on more days of the week or for longer hours right now it is five days ten to five i think because many of the f b outlets find that weekends are not suitable for them but as we move into the next phase and judging by the demand we will have to adjust the timing associate professor james lim thank you deputy speaker earlier on minister ong had noted that the vaccination rate was progressing at an impressive one per day and that we could expect seventy coverage by around mid august and possibly eighty by september now i am wondering what the basis for such an optimistic projection is in part because once we factor in the under twelve in the population for instance that would not qualify for vaccination you get something in the order of ten to twelve so it only assumes an eight to nine vaccine hesitancy share of the population and elsewhere it has been demonstrated that at far lower coverage rates populations have seen a point of inflection where there is resistance so how i guess the question is how will we get this coverage to this eighty that i agree would certainly be welcome this eighty that i agree would certainly be welcome the basis of projection is because we watch the number every day i do and that right now those who have taken 1st jab is already 76 yeah and that is over the whole population including those under twelve and you break down by age bands it is well over eighty 85 88 except for the most senior group above seventy right now is i think 73 74 so these are the 76 thank you so just based on who has taken 1st dose and so long as they turn up for 2nd doses which they always do they tend to i do not think that will change by the time we reach national day we should be close to seventy receiving two doses and if we believe that that momentum continues by september i think there is a very good possibility that we will reach eighty associate professor james lim is right that if that comes about that means vaccine hesitancy in singapore is actually much lower compared to other countries and i think this is a function of us working together as a united front and as a united people trusting each other with trust between government and people and that is what helped us overcome vaccine hesitancy we still have a lot of work to do for those who are older but let us continue this work doctor lim wee kep i have two clarifications one is on sinovac i think when the task force announced that we are going to release the sinovac vaccine to the people many were rejoiced they were very happy about it announced that we are going to release the sinovac vaccine to the people many will rejoice they are very happy about it but this rejoice was short lived after when you announced that the sinovac once you are vaccinated is not considered as part of the national vaccination program i also understand that there are overseas singaporeans who have vaccinated with astrazeneca with other vaccines and i think moh is prepared to accept them if they do a serology test and if the serology test shows that they have immunity they can be included in the national registry so my question is that if a singaporean receives sinovac if they are willing to go through a serology test and the serology test shows that their immunity is there can you accept them into the national registration so when next month or the next month when the restrictions are lifted for the vaccinated can they be considered as part of the vaccinated instead that is the 1st clarification 2nd clarification is on the supply of vaccine i am very happy to hear that there is enough vaccine for all of us and by september we probably will hit about eighty i read in the papers our neighbors jb has about 23 vaccination as from last month and i think in batam sorry batam was 23 and jb was fifteen my question is that can singapore help our immediate neighbors with the vaccination once we hit our eighty because if our neighbors are not safe we are not safe as well thank you thank you on the issue of sinovac i explained earlier i think the easiest rather than doing serology tests and amongst our experts there are also different interpretation of serology tests i think the easiest thing is to go back to what i said just now as of 5th of july sinovac has submitted all the required data for us to do a proper evaluation under our pisa framework so let hsa do its work it is trying to do as fast as it can it may take a month from 5th of july month from 5th of july and once if sinovac gets approved under pisa or other vaccines in time get approved under visa naturally we will want to take a more inclusive approach in recognizing them as for helping our immediate neighbor all these purchase agreements have quite strict contractual requirements so we can not take delivery and then donate to another country or region and this all requires us to discuss with the suppliers but certainly where we can help we will want to help our immediate region because it is only when every country around the world and in the region recover from covid that we can really be able to live with covid as an endemic disease mister siew yau chin i thank the ministers for their statements and i am particularly heartened to hear the concrete roadmap that minister wong has provided as to how we will ease ourselves out of phase two heightened alert and the differentiation for vaccinated versus unvaccinated persons in this particular roadmap the clarification i like to seek pertains to the longer term so beyond immediate easing and reopening when we are truly and well into a new normal of endemic covid in this new normal as minister ong has noted we will have reached a high level of vaccination and therefore covid resilience in the population and the need for differentiation between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons will be less but minister wong has also said that as we reopen we must expect the case numbers to rise and so to take this a little bit further in the new normal there is still a possibility that we get a major flare up in infections from time to time and in such a scenario the few 100s of 1000s or half a 1000000 persons or so who remain unvaccinated will be the ones at greatest risk of severe illness and therefore at greatest risk of loading our healthcare system and so in such a scenario i would like to ask the mountain ministry task force how might we tame the flare up and would the ntf then consider in such a scenario a sharper differentiation albeit a transient or interim one a scenario a sharper differentiation albeit a transient or interim one in safe management measures between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons so that we can protect the unvaccinated but yet not cause a major disruption to normal life for the vast majority like we now have in phase two heightened alert and more to the point do we think we still need to pull back to use minister wong is words pull back sharply as a population from time to time in a new normal or can we finally expect to see the last of phase two heightened alert thank you minister wong mister deputy speaker sir i have tried to give some clarity on what we can expect in the weeks ahead mister sear would like clarity in the months forward unfortunately with the current situation being so fluid and uncertain it is very hard we do not have a crystal ball that is why beyond i said early august mid term of the phase two heightened alert we have one move i said early august midterm of the phase two heightened alert we have one move when we get to about eighty coverage we make another move maybe in september and beyond that we will consider sequential moves but each time we do so we do it step by step and we do it in a controlled manner not a big bang and whenever we make one move to ease we monitor health outcomes very closely precisely for the concerns that mister sear had highlighted that there will still be unvaccinated persons and we are concerned that when we make one step to open cases go up we have to watch the health outcomes and the hospitalization and icu cases if these were to spike then as i said we might either have to slow down on the next step of reopening or in the very worst case if indeed a lot of unvaccinated persons a lot of elderly turn up sick in the hospitals then we may really have to pull back as i mentioned the worst case in my mind is when a new variant strikes and i think no one knows exactly when this will happen what sort of new variants we will see but the risk is not trivial and if a new variant emerges down the road that is much more transmissible or worse lethal and more resistant to the current batch of vaccines then it is almost like you are dealing with a new virus frankly and therefore the defenses have all to go up again so while we are embarking on this journey of reopening so while we are embarking on this journey of reopening let us understand that there are still risks there are still uncertainties ahead and therefore we are taking this controlled step forward remain alert remain vigilant and continue to be flexible and adaptable in adjusting our posture based on the latest assessment of risk and the external environment and how the pandemic proceeds i will take two more clarifications before closing the debate mister leon pereira thank you mister deputy speaker just one clarification for the minister of health there will be some individuals who get both doses and who still have very low resistance to the virus due to they being immunocompromised for genetic reasons or other reasons or due to having certain risk factors is the government actively looking at and this kind of relates to the pq that i found is the government actively looking at giving a 3rd jab to such individuals if the science actually supports that that will help them to raise their resistance to the vaccine and i understand that the us centers for disease control is actively looking at this question right now us centers for disease control is actively looking at this question right now thank you if i am not wrong the us has not come to a conclusion and neither have we we are studying this actively whether we need a 3rd dose as a booster when and what kind of strategy whether you use back mrna or you use a heterologous strategy so these are all being studied and when the details are when we make a decision or when the expert committee has made a decision we will make them public ms tin pei ling thank you deputy speaker just a change to direct my question to min chan actually i had earlier filed a pq for a later sitting but thank you for answering it earlier so i just had a follow up question which is that given that there were rules to disallow hostessing and yet there were blatant disregard for the rules and now with the spotlight on these ktv or pivoted outlets i am just wondering whether there is a risk that more of these biased activities may then be driven underground to other settings vice activities may then be driven underground to other settings and therefore how will the surveillance and enforcement be stepped up to control this i know minister had addressed this in quite a detail but just wondering how will it the surveillance and enforcement be stepped up further given the current possibility and especially in areas such as industrial spaces where perhaps offices or factory spaces could be used for parties at night some of these anecdotal feedback that we have heard as well so to min shan thank you thank you mister tin for that question i think we have to rightly focus on the people who are the cause of the spread people who operate illegally and the people who patronize but look before the pandemic what was our framework singapore never made prostitution illegal because we knew that countries which have tried and for 1000s of years people have tried it is not going to work so you need to be realistic what is doable and what is not doable doable and what is not doable pimping was illegal pimping is illegal prostitution was neither illegal then nor is it now except i suppose when there are safe distancing measures when we allowed the nightlife outlets pubs bars ktvs those who wanted to pivot what was our understanding of the situation supposing we had said no to all of them there would have been a great deal of loss of jobs but does that mean that immediately all dodgy activities would have stopped ms tin is right precisely this issue it would have gone miss tin is right precisely this issue it would have gone underground much more and it would have been very difficult to trace so the pivoting is not the issue the issue is that there is money to be made in making available these services and there will always be people because there is a huge demand regardless of the rules and there is i will not say unlimited supply but there is some supply there will always be arbitraging opportunities make money and that is why flats industrial spaces warehouses people organize i mean you would you would have seen in the newspapers and other they even organize illegal ktv operations so we got to sort of remove the two issues it is not that one is one is not connected to the other the pivoting of some operators is not connected to illegal activities they go on and by definition because of our rules all these activities are quote unquote underground in the sense that they are not being opened and we have to go and use our intel to find and deal with them some are in these outlets some are in outlets that are not obvious we have to keep continuing at it and whatever rules we come up with this is not going to stop it is just a question of whether it is more or less the activities and you know it puts a heavy onus on the regulatory authorities we can urge everyone to be responsible but as you saw from the example i gave immediately after the unilateral opening was closed there were many girlfriends turning up with singapore sponsors for a variety of reasons and this will go on we just have to try and deal with them thank you order we have completed our proceedings on the ministerial statements on 5th thank you",
