            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is concise and focuses on the core information, stating that two classmates deliberately placed a thumbtack on Speaker1's chair, thinking they had taken their spot in a competition. The model's answer is similar, but it adds the phrase \"to cause harm\" which is not present in the reference answer.
