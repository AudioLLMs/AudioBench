            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is that Speaker2 believes trying new things reduces regrets, using a specific example of missing out on buying a favorite ice cream as a minor daily regret. The model's answer, on the other hand, states that Speaker2 encourages stepping out of comfort zones because it can lead to personal growth and development. While the model's answer is related to trying new things, it doesn't capture the specific reason mentioned in the reference answer, which is reducing regrets. The model's answer provides a more general and vague reason.\n\nRating: 2",

            "model_prediction": "Speaker1 uses POSB (Post Office Savings Bank) because their parents use it and they have been using it since they were young. They don't find the need to switch to any other banks because of its attractive interest rate. On the other hand, Speaker2 doesn't seem to have a clear reason for sticking with POSB.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer clearly states that Speaker1 uses POSB because of their parents, while Speaker2 sticks with it due to attractive interest rates and no minimum balance requirement. In contrast, the model's answer incorrectly states that Speaker1 uses POSB because of its attractive interest rate, and also implies that Speaker2's reason is unclear. I think the model's answer diverges significantly from the reference in accuracy and relevance.\n\nRating: 2",

Upon investigation, two of Speaker1's classmates actually did meet to do that and their reason for doing so was because they thought Speaker1 had stolen their sport in some competition that they didn't even participate in.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is brief and to the point, stating that two classmates deliberately placed a thumbtack on Speaker1's chair, falsely believing they had taken their spot in a competition. The model's answer, on the other hand, provides additional details, such as the absence of a visible thumbtack, the chair being pushed inwards, and the classmates' motive for their action. While the model's answer is more elaborate, it still captures the essence of the reference answer and provides accurate information.
