This is relatively low compared to the average retail profit margin of 25%. The speaker also notes that this strategy is possible for these companies because they have a huge number of products that they sell every day. Additionally, they also import goods directly, which means that they don't need to pay middlemen. As a result, they can sell their products at lower prices and still make a profit.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer provides specific details about Mustafa's business strategy, such as maintaining a 10-15% profit margin, importing goods directly, and purchasing in bulk. The model's answer summarizes the main idea but lacks precision and detail. For instance, it doesn't mention the specific benefit of importing goods directly (avoiding the cost of middlemen) and omits the connection between high volume sales and sustainability of the low-profit margin strategy. However, the model's answer still captures the essence of the reference answer, highlighting the low-profit margin and high volume sales.\n\nRating: 3",
