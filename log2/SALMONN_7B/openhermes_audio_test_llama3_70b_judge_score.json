The throne rejected him, for it could only be occupied by someone with a pure heart.\n\nVarick was furious and ordered his soldiers to destroy the throne. As they struck it with their weapons, the throne emitted a blinding light that enveloped the entire room. When the light faded, the throne was gone, and in its place stood the rightful heir to the throne, Princess Elara, who had been in hiding.\n\nWith the throne's magic, Elara defeated Varick and restored peace to the kingdom.
