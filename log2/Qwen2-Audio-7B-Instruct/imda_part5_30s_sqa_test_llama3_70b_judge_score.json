            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"Speaker2 suggests pushing out of one's comfort zone and trying new things to avoid having regrets\", while the model's answer is \"Speaker2 suggests that one should push out of their comfort zone to try new things to avoid regrets in daily life\". I think the model's answer is almost identical to the reference answer, with the addition of \"in daily life\" which doesn't change the meaning significantly.\n\nRating: 5",

The model's answer, however, only mentions that someone they trusted betrayed them, without providing any context about the evidence. While the model's answer captures the general idea of betrayal, it lacks the specific detail that makes the reference answer more concrete.\n\nRating: 3",

In contrast, the model's answer is more general, only mentioning that the speaker is confident with planning their finances and using cards, without highlighting the digital aspect or the friends' cash-only approach.

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is focused on the limited extent of an insurance agent's knowledge, specifying that they only know general information such as what is covered and how much the customer is being covered. The model's answer, on the other hand, suggests that agents may not be able to fully understand or go through policy contract wordings even if they have access to them, which is a different perspective. While related, the model's response doesn't directly address the question about the extent of an agent's knowledge. I think the model's answer is tangentially relevant but lacks precise accuracy.\n\nRating: 3",

            "model_prediction": "Speaker2 mentions that they have been using POSB since they were young and didn't find the need to switch because of its attractive interest rates and the fact that it doesn't require a minimum amount to be held in the account.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer provides two specific reasons for not switching to another bank from POSB: \"Attractive interest rate and no requirement for a minimum amount to be held in the account.\" The model's answer also mentions these two reasons, but phrases them slightly differently: \"attractive interest rates and the fact that it doesn't require a minimum amount to be held in the account.\" The model's answer is very close to the reference answer, with minimal rephrasing.\n\nRating: 5",

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"That they are human and have multiple sides to them\", implying that people should recognize the complexity and multifaceted nature of others. The model's answer is \"Speaker2 suggests that people should recognize that everyone has different perspectives and therefore should not be judged solely based on one aspect.\" I think the model's answer is a good paraphrase of the reference answer, conveying the idea that people should not be judged based on a single aspect, but rather considering their multiple perspectives.\n\nRating: 5",
