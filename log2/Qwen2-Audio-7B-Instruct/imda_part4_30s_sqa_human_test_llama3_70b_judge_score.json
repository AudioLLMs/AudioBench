The model's answer adds Speaker2's sentiment and also mentions the financial aspect, which is not present in the reference answer.

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer explains that people mistakenly believe all grants can be obtained at a Community Centre (CC) due to a lack of awareness and assumptions related to COVID-related government aid. In contrast, the model's answer only infers that people may think this way because the speaker mentions that 'not all grants are under CC', without providing any specific reason or explanation.
