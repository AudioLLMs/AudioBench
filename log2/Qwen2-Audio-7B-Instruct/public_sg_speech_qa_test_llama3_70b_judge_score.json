By stating \"we need more economics, not less,\" the speaker is suggesting that economic analysis should not be overlooked or minimized in healthcare discussions, but rather should be embraced as a valuable tool for addressing complex healthcare challenges. This implies that economic factors should be considered alongside non-economic factors, such as values and trade-offs, in order to make well-rounded and informed healthcare decisions.",
