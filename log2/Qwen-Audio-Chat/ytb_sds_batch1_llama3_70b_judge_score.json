            "reference": "In this clip, the female speaker explains Mustafa's business strategy for keeping their product prices low. Mustafa maintains profit margins of only 10%-15%, which is much lower than the typical 25% profit margin seen in average retail businesses. This approach is sustainable for Mustafa because they sell a high volume of products daily. By offering lower prices, they attract more customers, which results in higher sales. Additionally, Mustafa imports goods directly, avoiding the cost of middlemen, and purchases in bulk, which allows them to secure lower prices.",
