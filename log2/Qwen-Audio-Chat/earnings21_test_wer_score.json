thank you matt and good morning everyone nextera energy delivered strong 2nd quarter results and continue to perform well both financially and operationally while managing the ongoing impact of the covid nineteen pandemic as part of our core goal of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers we continue to operate under our pandemic plan that we activated last quarter despite the challenges created by the pandemic nextera energy is 2nd quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than eleven versus the prior year comparable quarter and we are positioned to meet our overall objectives for the year fpl increase earnings per share by ¢fifteen year over year and a strong execution continues across the board during the quarter fpl set a new system peak load of more than 24500 megawatts fpl is transmission and distribution systems continue to operate in line with our high reliability standards and our highly efficient ga generating facilities are made available to serve our customers fpl is continued strong execution is a result of the smart capital investments that we have made over the past several decades to enhance our customer valued proposition of low bills high reliability outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions consistent with enhancing its best of in class c customer value proposition last month fpl announced plans to retire scherer four its last remaining coal unit together with our joint interest owner jea and subject to certain approvals from the florida public service commission fpl intends to retire the 847 megawatt coal fired plant in early 202 the retirement of scherer four is projected to generate 100s of 1000000s of dollars in savings for fpl customers and prevent roughly 4000000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from this unit scherer four is retirement is the final step of the coal phase out strategy that fpl launched in 2015 and that will complete the complo clo closure of approximately 2700 megawatts of coal capacity including the highest greenhouse emitting gas power power plants in florida these transactions which will make fpl one of the 1st utilities to eliminate all of the coal from its generation portfolio demonstrate fpl is continued commitment and position as a clean energy leader we remain proud of our environmental track record particular the c two emissions reductions that we have delivered throughout florida and across the country and we continue to remain focused on building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable gulf power also had a strong quarter of execution the focus on operational cost effectiveness at gulf continues to progress well with year to day zero m costs excluding specific covid nineteen related expenses that declining by nearly ten versus the prior year comparable period and by approximately 25 relative to 201 gulf power also delivered further improvement in service reliability and continues its significant improvement in employee safely safety with no osha recordables year to date to the end of june we remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we have previously outlined at gulf power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years during the quarter we completed our annual storm drills for fpl and gulf power to prepare for the unprecedented situation of restoring power after a hurricane in the midst of the covid nineteen pandemic we spent two weeks drilling and challenging our teams to find ways to efficiently restore service to our customers without sacrificing safety the drills provided a number of lessons including how to leverage technology to quickly and safely screen personnel at various staging sites to help offset some of the challenges that will inevitably occur when performing storm restoration in the midst of a pandemic while we hope their service territories will avoid the impacts of hurricanes this year consistent with our culture that is focused on preparedness and execution we continue to do everything we can to ensure that we will be there for our customers when they need us most at energy resources adjusted eps increased by ¢thirteen year over year the energy resources team continue to capitalize on the terrific market opportunities for low cost renewables adding 1730 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call this continued origination success through the ongoing pandemic is a test testament to the energy resources significant competitive advantages including our best in class renewables development skills our engineering construction team also continues to execute commissioning roughly 650 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the remaining approximately 4400 megawatts of wind and solar projects that we expect to continue this year on track despite the significant supply chain challenges that are occurring both globally and locally while we are monitoring the situation closely we continue to expect that all of our planned 2020 renewables projects will achieve their in service dates this year in response to increased investor focus on environmental social and governance issues or esg next week we expect to publish nextera energy is updated esg report which includes reporting under the sustainability accounting standards board or sasb disclosures our company has been focused on all of the elements of esg for more than 25 years nextera energy is approach to governance and risk oversight combined with the way that we treat our people our customers our communities and the environment are proof that a company can be both sustainable and financially successful at the same time the new report highlights this alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenants of esg includes a robust discussion of risk oversight and incorporates new disclosures such as diversity and inclusion metrics diversity and inclusion matter deeply to us as a company both because we believe they are the right thing to do but also because diverse and inclusive teams deliver better business results for the diverse communities that we serve our commitment to having a diverse workforce and inclusive culture is not new and our diversity metrics are better than many of the companies in our industry however consistent with our focus on continuous improvement we are not satisfied and will continue our efforts to build an even more diverse and inclusive team going forward overall we are pleased with the progress we have made in nextera energy so far in 202 as we have entered the 2nd half of the year we believe we are well positioned to achieve the full year expectations that we have previously discussed even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic now lets turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl for the 2nd quarter of 2020 fpl reported a net income of $749000000 or a one52 per share which is an increase of $86000000fifteen per share respectively year over year regulatory capital employed increased by more that ten over the same quarter of last year and was a principle driver of fpl is net income growth of approximately thirteen fpl is capital expenditures were approximately $1800000000 in the 2nd quarter and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between $6500000000 and $6700000000 our reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately elevensixty for the twelve month ended june 2020 which is at the upper end of the allowed band of ninesixty to elevensix allowed under our current rate agreement during the quarter we utilized $7000000 of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory roe leaving fpl with a balance of $736000000 we continue to expect that fpl will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement during 202 as we previously discussed we expect that fpl and gulf will operate as a single larger florida utility company which will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers as result in may the company has filed an application with ferc for an approval of an internal reorganization whereby gulf would merge into fpl subject to ferc approval the companies will merge in january of 202 however during 2021 gulf power will continue to operate as a separate operating division serving its existing customers under separate retail rates we continue to expect the companies to file a combined rate case in the 1st quarter of next year for new rates effective january 202 turning towards development efforts all of our major capital initiatives at fpl remain on track and on budget during the quarter the final 300 megawatts of solar being built under the solar base rate adjustment or sobra mechanism as fpl is base rate settlement agreement were placed into service the 1200 megawatts of cost effective solar constructed under the sobra mechanism are expected to generate significant customer benefits and represent the early stages of fpl is rapid solar expansion and the next phase of its generation modernization efforts the next six solar together projects totaling approximately 450 megawatts remain on track to be placed in service later this year the final 600 megawatts of the roughly 1500 megawatt community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year beyond solar construction on the highly efficient roughly 1200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date in 202 additionally the 409 megawatt manatee storage facility will to be one of the world is largest battery storage plants is on track and on budget to be complete next year based on our ongoing analysis of the long term potential of low cost renewables we remain confident as ever that wind solar and battery storage would be usually disruptive to the energies existing the countries existing generation while reducing cost for customers and helping to achieve future c two emissions reductions however to achieve an emissions free future we believe that other technologies will be necessary and we are particularly excited about the long term potential of hydrogen consistent with the toe in the water approach we have previously utilized with solar and battery storage we are planning to propose a hydrogen pilot project at fpl this approximately $65000000 pilot project which subject to flo florida public service commission approval is expected to be in service in 2023 will utilize solar energy that would have otherwise been clipped to produce a 100 green hydrogen through a roughly twenty megawatt electrolysis system the hydrogen will be used to replace a portion of the natural gas that is consumed by one of the three gas turbines at the okeechobee clean energy center we believe that the project is a compliment to our ongoing solar and battery storage development efforts and highlights fpl is continued innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of the clean energy solutions available for its customers we continue to evaluate other potential hydrogen opportunities across our businesses and while our near term investments are expected to be small in context of our overall capital program we are excited about the technologies long term potential which should further support future demand for low cost renewables as well accel as accelerate the decarbonization of transportation fuel and industrial feedstocks we continue to expect that fpl is ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in the regulatory capital employed of approximately nine from 2018 through 2022 while further enhancing our best in class customer value proposition let me now turn to gulf power which reported 2nd quarter 2020 gap earnings of $55000000 or ¢eleven per share a decline of one per share relative to gulf powers adjusted earnings per share in the prior year period this quarter results include the impact of roughly $5000000 of after tax covid nineteen related expenses primarily reflecting the expected incremental bad debt expense as a result of the pandemic earlier this month the florida public service commission approved gulf powers request to record cost attributable to covid nineteen including bad debt expense as a regulatory asset on its balance sheet as a result the costs recorded during the 2nd quarter are expected to be reversed during the 3rd quarter as the regulatory asset is recorded gulf powers reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately tenforty for the twelve months ending june 202 for the full year 2020 we are targeting a regulatory roe of the upper half of the allowed band of nine25 to eleven25 during the quarter gulf powers capital expenditures were roughly a $170000000 and we now expect our full year capital investment to total between one and $1100000000 all of gulf major smart capital investments including the north florida resiliency connection and the plant called to natural gas conversion continue to progress well similar to other parts of the country the florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic recent economic data reflect an increase in florida unemployment rate and a decline in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes the national averages of each metric while it is still unclear at this point how severely the economy will ultimately be impacted we continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages with which florida entered the crisis and that continued attraction of the state to both new residences residence and new businesses will support a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us we remain deeply engaged in helping florida return from this stronger than ever we will continue to do our part to support that outcome including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economical development efforts which help create jobs provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best in class customer value proposition during the quarter fpl is average number of customers continued the recent trend of strong underlying growth increasing by approximately 75000 from the comparable prior year quarter fpl is 2nd quarter retail sales decreased by zeroeight year over year as customer growth and favorable weather were more than offset by a decline and underlying usage per customer based on our analysis the overall effect of the pandemic on underlying usage during the 2nd quarter were relatively muted fpl benefits from having its retail sales being heavily weighted towards residential customers in approximately forty of its load is cooling related and therefore important for both comfort and building maintenance during april when stay at home orders were broadly in effect fpl is weather normalized retail sales were down approximately four relative to our expectations as the economy began reopening in early may weather normalized retail sales improved and were above our expectations in june while the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage remain unknown at this time we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism to offset any fluctuation of retail sales or bad debt expense and support regulatory roe at the upper end of the allowed band of ninesixty to elevensix under our current rate agreement for gulf power the average number of customers increased approximately onethree versus the comparable prior year quarter gulf powers 2nd quarter retail sales declined by roughly sixtwo year over year as a result of the under of the unfavorable weather comparison and a decline in underlying usage per customer over the 2nd quarter gulf power experienced a more significant decline in underlying usage per customer than fpl but also experienced an improvement as the economy began reopening in may and june as a reminder unlike fpl gulf power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs so any variability will therefore have more impact on to gulfs earnings in roe than at fpl as a reminder as we have often discussed weather normalization is imprecise particularly when evaluating short periods of time additional details on on retail sales at gpl and gulf power are included in the appendix of today is presentation let me now turn to energy resources which reported 2nd quarter 2020 gap earnings of $481000000 or ¢zero97 per share and adjusted earnings of $531000000 or a one08 per share this is an increase in adjusted earns per share of ¢thirteen or approximately fourteen from last years comparable quarter results which have been restated to reflect the results of our nextera energy transmission business formally reported in corporate new investments added ¢eight per share contributions from existing generation assets increased ¢five per share as improved wind resource and increased ptc volumes from our repowering wind projects were partially offset by the refueling outage at the seabrook nuclear facility 2nd quarter fleet wide wind resource was 99 of the longterm average versus 93 during the 2nd quarter of 201 also contributing favorably was nextera energy transmission where contributions increased by ¢three versus 201 contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines were flat year over year these favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business which decline ¢four versus the particularly strong 2nd quarter last year all other impacts increased results by one per share as i mentioned earlier energy resources development team had another excellent quarter of origination success adding 1730 megawatts to our backlog since our last earning call we have added 708 megawatts of wind 844 megawatts of solar and a 178 megawatts of battery storage to our renewables backlog we also executed a build own transfer agreement for a 200 megawatt solar project which is not included in our backlog editions all our battery storage projects will be paired with either new or existing solar projects to take advantage of the itc and provide a more firm renewable product for our customers the continued strong demand for battery storage projects highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution we continue to expect that by the middle of this decade without incentives new near firm wind and new near firm solar will be cheaper than the operating cost of most existing coal and nuclear facilities and less fuel efficient oil and gas fired generation units producing significant long term renewables demand our current backlog now totaled approximately 14400 megawatts and is the largest we have ever had in our roughly twenty year development history to put our backlog into context it is larger than the current operating in wind solar portfolios of all the two other companies in the world as of year end 201 highlighting that nextera energy continues to be at the forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector only halfway through 2020 we are pleased to have already signed nearly 3500 megawatts of contracts for delivery beyond 2022 which is a reflection of the continued strong economic demand for wind solar and battery storage to ensure that we can take advantage of this significant demand in the coming years we had now have more than $2000000000 of safe harbor wind and solar equipment which could support as much as $40000000000 of wind solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 202 these purchases highlight the benefit of scale and the strength of our balance sheet that we leverage as a key competitive advantage in renewables development and position us well for continued long term growth the safe harbor equipment also support additional repowering opportunities including 700 megawatts of potential 2021 repowering projects which we are currently evaluating as i discussed earlier all of the 2020 renewables projects remain on track to achieve their targeted inservice dates this year as a result we do not expect these projects to rely on the updated treasury start of construction guidance that was released during the quarter beyond renewables we continue to make progress with mountain valley pipeline and work with our project partners to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for the pipeline is construction we were please with the supreme courts ruling regarding appalachian trail crossing authorization authority which resolve similar issues for mvp we were similarly pleased that the supreme court partially stayed with the montana federal court is decision related to the nationwide twelve permit program and are working with the army corps of engineers on this reissuance of the projects permit calling comprehensive restudy by the relevant agencies we expect issuance of mvp is to provide biological opinion shortly assuming timely resolution of the outstanding permitting issues we are now targeting a full inservice date for the pipeline during early 2021 and expect an overall project estimate in the range of fivefour to $5700000000 for the consolidated results for nextera energy for the 2nd quarter of 2020 definite income attributable to nextera energy was $1280000000 or $two59 per share nextera energy is 2022nd quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were 1286000000 and ¢two61 per share respectively adjusted earnings from corpra corporate declined by one year over year primarily as a result of higher interest expense nextera energy also delivered strong year to date operating cash flow growth and for the full year 2020 expect to generate roughly $8500000000 in operating cash flow to help support its strong financial position nextera energy maintains approximately $13000000000 in liquidity this is to support the largest capital investment program in our history since last quarters call we completed roughly $3000000000 in long term financing is it including a $2200000000 in capital holdings debentures over the course of the last few months we repaid nearly all of the term loans that we issued during march and april and converted these commitments to buy lateral revolving credit facilities included in these facilities is a total of more than $1000000000 in six month storm facilities at fpl and gulf power which similar to previous years we put in place to ensure sufficient liquidity in the event of a hurricane energy resources also closed to tax equity financing is including its 1st ever combined wind and solar portfolio financing and we expect to close on the balance of our tax equity financing is as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year our year to date financing activities are evidence of the great financial partnerships we have built over time which help provide ample liquidity and continued access to capital to support our outstanding growth prospects nextera energy is financial expectations remain unchanged we continue to expect that nextera energy is adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in a range of six to eight through 202 also the 2018 adjusted eps of $sevenseventy plus the accretion of ¢fifteen and ¢twenty in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the florida acquisitions for 2020 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of $eightseventy to $ninetwenty for 2022 we expect to grow adjusted eps in the range of six to eight off of the 2021 adjusted eps translating to a range of $ten to ¢ten75 per share from 2018 to 2022 we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly ten per year through at least 2022 of off a 2020 base while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider reasonable range of impact related to current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined in summary despite the challenges created by the covid nineteen pandemic all of our businesses continue to perform well and maintain their excellent prospects for growth going forward we have a long term track record of delivering result for our customers and shareholders and we will remain intensely focused on continuing that track record based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and their strong growth prospects we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020 2021 and 2022 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit metrics we continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and believe that nextera energy is well positioned to drive long term shareholder value over the coming years let me now turn to nextera energy partners which continued its strong start to 2020 with growth growth and adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution of approximately 23 and 46 respectively from the prior year comparable quarter on a year to date basis adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution have increased by 26 and 86 respectively versus 201 the strong operational financial performance that nextera energy partners highlights that nextera energy partners remained well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth pro objective yesterday the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of of ¢5775 per common unit or $two31 per common unit on an annualized basis continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top en of our twelve to fifteen per year growth range we were pleased to see pg e is emergence from bankruptcy earlier this month as expected all of our existing contracts were assumed without modification following pg e is emergence from bankruptcy nextera energy partners received a cash distribution of approximately $65000000 from our desert sunlight 250 and 300 projects which represent current distributions and those previously withheld as a result of the bankruptcy the release of the desert sunlight track cash supplements nextera energy partners liquidity which was approximately $650000000 including cash on hand at the end of the 2nd quarter the organic growth in investments at nextera energy partners continue to progress well the approximately 275 megawatts of wind repowering and the texas pipeline expansion both remain on track to be in service later this year we continue to expect to execute on additional attractive growth opportunities as nextera energy partner is portfolio further expands let me now review the detailed results for nextera energy partners 2nd quarter adjusted ebitda was $349000000 and cash available for distribution with a $166000000 up 23 and 46 respectively against the prior year comparable quarter now that the pg e bankruptcy has been favorably resolved and distributions from our desert sunlight projects have resumed cash available for distribution include all contributions from pg e related projects these new projects added $51000000 in adjusted ebitda and $36000000 of cash available for distribution existing projects also contributed favorably to this significant year over year growth and adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution as resource was favorable across the portfolio for the 2nd quarter when resource was a 100 of the long term average versus 94 in the prior year comparable quarter cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project level debt service primarily as a result of the early debt retirement to facilitate the wind repowerings the reduction in project level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results are met by the rc is since we treat these as an operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slide let me now turn to nextera energy partners expectations which remain unchanged nextera energy partners continues to expect december 31st 2020 run rate for adjusted ebitda to be in range of $1230000000 to $1400000000 and cash available for distribution in the range of $560000000 to $640000000 reflecting calender year 2021 expectations for the portfolio at the end of 202 now that the pg e bankruptcy has been favorably resolved we will no longer provide expectations including contributions e excluding the contributions from the desert sunlight projects as a reminder these expectations include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from the base of our 4th quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $twofourteen we continue to see twelve to fifteen growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 202 we expect the annualized rate of the 4th quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in february of 2021 to be in a range of $twoforty to $two46 per common unit similar to nextera energy while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impact related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with our overall expectations with a resumption of cash distributions from the desert sunlight projects we now expect to achieve nextera energy partners 2020 distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing twelve month ratio of approximately seventy highlighting this significant flexibility we believe next nextera energy partners has going forward as we previously discussed we will continue to be opportunistic nextera energy partners favorable positioning should give it flexibility to achieve its long term distribution growth objective without the need to make any acquisitions until 202 we are pleased with nextera energy partners year to date performance in 2020 and believe it continues to offer a best in class value proposition for investors the diversity and long term contracted nature of nextera energy partners clean energy portfolio helps insulate it from the broader economic conditions including impacts related to the covid nineteen pandemic with the flexibility to grow in three ways acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from 3rd parties nextera energy partners has clear visibility into its growth going forward following another strong quarter of origination energy resources portfolio of renewable projects now totals more than 27 gigawatts including the signed backlog of projects that energy resources plans to build in the coming years when combined with the prospects for future renewables development nextera energy partners long term growth visibility remains as strong as ever nextera energy partners cost of capital and access to capital advantages including significant demand from various low cost private infrastructure capital provide flexibility to finance this growth over the long term these strengths together with nextera energy partners favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights leaves nextera energy partners uniquely positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives going forward in closing we believe that the fundamental value proposition of nextera energy and nextera energy partners remains as robust as ever both companies remain resilient and well positioned to deliver on their commitments we continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and our continued and and our focus on delivering smart capital investments that enhance the value for both customers and shareholders and expands our position as the worlds leading clean energy provider that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open up the line for questions ladies and gentleman at this time if you would like to ask a question please press star and then one using a touch centered telephone to withdraw your questions you may press star and two if you are using a speaker phone we do ask you to please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers to ensure the best sound quality once again that is star and then one to ask a question we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster and our 1st question today comes from julien smith from bank of america please go ahead with your question hey and morning this is actually richie here for julien i just had a question around the the cafex rates and ftl and gulf what what was driving that is that more around undervaluing grid hardening or is that more on the solar side and how should we think about the cafex traj trajectory from 21 and beyond is that more in line with what you disclosed at your analyst day or shou should we expect it to be at more of these robust robust levels looking forward richie good morning and and thanks for the question i think it really reflects of you know consistency with what we have we have been talking about for a long time which is we keep finding terrific projects for our customers and investment opportunities and we are we are starting to put those in place as i highlighted in in the prepared remarks we do have a consistent expectations for the growth rate between 2018 and 2022 of a nine compound annual growth rate so obviously some projects move from one year to another but at the heart of it it is terrific investments for the benefit of our customers as far as beyond 2022 you know similar to comments that we have made in the past the growth opportunities that we see across all of our businesses but specific at fpl and and gulf power include the modernization efforts including the large deployment of solar over time as well as investments and grid hardening and under grounding is highlighted by the storm protection plan that we are in the process of of going through approvals and and and you know initial investments for that program so we are super excited about the opportunities for investing and again stay very focused on ensuring that these are good projects for the benefit of our customers got it thanks that is very helpful and then just around your comments around hydrogen i i think you have disclosed 65000000 for that pilot project what what are you seeing there on on that front is this more around transportation opportunities or is this around like pipeline and and being able to like blend with the pipes so we are really excited about hydrogen in in particular when we think about getting to a not a net zero emissions profile but actually a zero carbon emissions profile and for when you know when we look at this lets call it five ten years ago and we thought about what it would take to get to true zero emissions we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive for customers what makes us really excited about hydrogen particularly in the 2030 and beyond timeframe is that that has the potential to supplement significant deployment of renewables including wind and solar technologies complimented by short and and i will call it medium term duration batteries but then that last amount of emissions that that you would take out of the system to get down to zero could be most economically served by hydrogen so that is what makes us excited about doing a pilot project were very excited about the opportunity to present that to the florida public service commission as a way to you know further enhance fpl is ability to innovate and deliver these long term you know clean energy solutions to our customers and as part of that we will learn about the technologies and we will see what other opportunities there are potentially for the industrial and transportation sectors you know and and for us to be able to pro you know produce that the green energy to produce the green hydrogen is a potential signif significant opportunity for us we think we are at the early stages which is kind of consistent with our toe in the water approach we want to get some experience with it obviously do a lot of research and talk to folks in the supply chain and and get better equipped to deal you know take advantage of these opportunities but were really excited about it all right thanks a lot that is all the questions i had thank you richie our next questions comes from from guggenheim partners please go ahead with your question hi good morning it is actually cub who is here for charl as well i think actually it has been a great quarter it is a we have def definitely seen some impressive numbers in backlog additions and kind of contract increases for the 22 timeframe just kind of curious on kind of your thoughts around kind of new year is growth trajectory and kind of contributions to the business and i i it is kind of subsidive in kind of a from the reacting agency but just thoughts on kind of growing contributions from the new year versus balancing that from the regulated contributions you know does it are you thinking about or kind of any kind of drop downs accelerated from the new year just some thoughts around that thanks cub we appreciate you dialing in this morning we are really excited about pursuing opportunities for investment across the board and of course at fpl and gulf that is focused on investments that we need that we need to create value for our customers and our energy resources it is return focused along with you know delivering things for our customers there too so from a corporate perspective we do not want to limit any of our businesses when we find great investment opportunities which you know again i can highlight enough about how excited we are about the renewables development prospects at at energy resources so we are not going to constrain them in any way you know we will develop those opportunities that create value for shareholders and to the extent that we want to maintain balance over time we have got a lot of opportunities to do that that are created for shareholders including recycling of capital through nextera energy partners which is obviously a willing and excited acquirer of energy resources projects but energy resources has the ability to recycle capital to 3rd parties as well so there is plenty of ways to ensure that we can create the real you know value of creative opportunities and still think about it from a corporative perspective in a variety of different ways thanks that is no that is very helpful and kind of pivoting a little bit to to something a little bit longer term i guess can you tell me your thoughts on the november election and kind of the biden campaign has put out some plans and frameworks out there the clean energy support how is nextera positioned for kind of potential changes at a federal level so this is jim you know we we always position our business to try to win regardless of the outcome of elections and and so you know we i think if you can remember back three you know close to four years ago now there was some turmoil around our stock when president trump was elected we have managed completely fine under this administration in terms of being able to continue to grow our real business because you know what its all about economics right and and and the time for renewables is now and you know that kind of transcends politics frankly the economics and the and the need to you know and and and really the need to decarbonize not only the electric sector but the rest of the sectors in the economy are really you know really frankly transcend what happens in elections and so you know obviously we watch them closely we think good clean energy policies important and the right policy for for for america and the future and you know we continue i think to be positioned really well regardless of who wins in november okay that makes sense i will i will tell that to thanks so much thank you our next question comes from michael weinstein from credit swiss please go ahead with you question hi good morning guys hey on the same question jim are you what do you think is the most likely outcome from the congress these day tax credit extensions cash grants do you think a national renewable portfolio standard is a possibility i am just wondering of all those different alternatives what do you think might actually occur in the next four years yeah you know so i think its honestly too soon to tell michael i think you know a lot is going to depend on what happens in the election and is there a continued split government or is there not split government that will be i think a big driver of what policies happen and you know i think all of those ideas are on the table we we be consistent in in in what we have said which is that you know we think it is important to have you know good and fair clean energy policy going forward we also have said that it is that we think wind and and renewables with batteries will be you know are very competitive you know once the ptc is and the rtc is phase out in terms of competing against conventional generation it is just honestly really more a matter of the speed with which you want to decarbonize is what i going to ultimately drive the final i think policy choices and so you know we are you know obviously we are actively engaged in in the discussions and i think it is premature really to say what we think is going to happen cause i think you have an election in 45 months and as as you all know elections have consequences and and you know we will we will we will see what happens post the election in terms of what is going to be the policy when going for great hey on hydrogen do you think i noticed there is a lot of a lot more emphasis on renewables rather than gas turbines in your future construction plans at fpl i am just wondering if if hydrogen works out is that a message do you think you could actually build more put more gas turbines back into the plan if if hydrogen production becomes a viable economic alternative or do you think other alternative technologies are better suited such as fuel cells mike i think you know from a hydrogen perspective and specific to florida power and light company we are talking about potential hydrogen opportunities really in the 2030 and beyond timeframe and in that intervening time we deploy a significant amount of solar technology and then if we are right and if the cost come down for hydrogen and it is the best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions profile we would retrofit certain of our you know gas facilities to run on hydrogen or run on a portion of hydrogen so i think for florida power and lighting gulf power it is at this and again it we are talking about a long way into the future you would not necessarily need to build any new you know hydrogen gas turbines in that in that portfolio cause we have got a tremendously efficient fleet that is already in services on the investments we would make for really around conversion now whether or not that is true elsewhere in the country i think it is you know it might be a little bit different but we are talking about a long way down the road and a lot of things need to come together to have those types of conversation i think it is it is fairly preliminary gotcha and you know one final question this may you are coming on m a interest these days what is going on with sandy cooper et cetera so i think we this will not be surprising we remain interested in m a we think there is a lot that we can bring to the the table we you know i continue to believe that there is not a utility in the country that we could not run more efficiently and better for customers and i i truly believe that and and so you know we continue to look i think in terms of sandy cooper you know that process has been pushed to next year and we remain you know we remain very interested and and continue to be focused on trying to make that happen hey jim can you what region of the country are you focused on just curious we we continue to be focused on the mid west and the southeast gotcha all right thank you very much jim plus for regulated assets pretty much anywhere perfect okay thanks a lot thank you our next question comes from steven from morgan stanley please go ahead with your question hi thanks it is steve on for steven thanks for taking my question i have one quick followup just on the hydrogen topic wondering if you see a potential path for this to be a potential path for this to be an opportunity at newark and also in terms of kind of business model that you think you would envision being involved in owning the electrolysis function within in the supply chain and if so so you have a kind of a vision or views on what technology is ahead of others at this point thanks steve yeah i would say at this point we are looking fr opportunities across the portfolio obviously we talked about the pilot project fpl today but we are looking at other pilot types of investment opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio consistent with the way that we approach sol solar early on and of course batteries more recently so i think there will be opportunities over time for those type of pilot projects you know again where you think of it as actually being closed economic today are areas where there is already significant penetration of renewables because as you all know it is critical to find that low cost electricity supply in order to make it economic or close to economic and her in the us you know the economics certainly have to factor in that today there is a very low cost supply of natural gas making it you know the imperative that you you find a a cheap electricity supply you know it is early you know never say never on on you know where we might find opportunities to invest in the business but historically as you know we have not played in the space of owning you know being a vertically integrated you know owner of technologies or or projects we typically take in the best of manufactured equipment from other folks you know apply our scale and our ability to construct own and operate over the long term effectively is where we create value so again it is early but at this point i would not think that we would focus on vertically integrating it is more of you know applying hydrogen as a as a technology consistent the way that we have created value in the past so so the only i would add to that two things one is i would be disappointed if in john is business we do not make some kind of pilot investment in the next year were looking at a variety of things and i would be disappointed if we do not make some kind of pilot investment in the next year a very very much toe in the water like we did a decade ago in the battery storage business secondly you know clearly were not going to backward integrate into manufacturing electrolizers or anything like that but i would not i would not rule out us owning them as part of a integrated system that was integrated with renewables to manufacture hydrogen and and is you know our view would around that would be if we had a long term contract and obviously we have access to very efficient capital we know how to operate equipment we are you know and so a lot of that would would come to our i think our strategic advantages in terms of we how we are able to create value for folks so you know i think it i think it is early we are we are we are there is clearly an opportunity to you know five to you know five to ten years from now to displace the last ten of the carbon emissions out of the electric sector by manufacturing hydrogen in with renewables that is clear i think there is also clearly an opportunity to make renewables to displace diesel fuel and perhaps even other types of transportation fuel going forward and there is also i think clearly an opportunity to make green hydrogen to to representative to replace other types of hydrogen or and other feedstocks in industrial applications and so we are looking at all of that and we are not you know we are not being all of that in the end comes back to a very important thing which is this is going to drive gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts of renewable demand in this country and so there is no one better positioned than us to take advantage of that and we are going to be just like we were on battery storage we are going to be at the vanguard we are going to and we are going to this is a big strategic initiative for us and we are going to drive it and it is going to be very important for this company i think not you know over the next over the next decade we will not make any money on it in the next five years just like we did not make any money in batteries in the 1st five years and next year we are dep we are deploying a $1000000000 off batteries ten years later and so that is that is the way i think about this i think about this as is help powering the long term growth of this company into the back half of this decade and the and the next decade as well got it that is really helpful thank you so much for those comments i i just had one other quick m a followup i was just wondering if is there any path for texas to be a target of interest for you from an m a perspective or what would need to change there thanks so we we we we have spent a lot of time in texas obviously we own assets in texas and so we are great operative and and and we feel like we would bring an enormous amount of state we we own 1000000000 of dollars of assets in the state right and we are a great great partner for the state and so you know i would never say never you know obviously we were extraordinarily disappointed in the encore decision we think it was a mistake and shortsighted but you know that is what it is and so it is probably going to take a bit to get past that before i i am super excited about doing things in texas from a m a standpoint understood understood thank you very much our next question comes from michael from goldman sachs please go ahead with your question hi good morning everybody thank you for taking my question i want to turn to florida for a 2nd you are supposed to cases next year at both utilities and obviously the combination of it it will be a big fat subject is there any potential for being able to delay or defer the timing of the rate cases to a see what happens from a tax perspective in d c from a public policy perspective just so you do not have to go back to the regulator two or three times over a two or three year period and b is is there any scenario where you may bot even need a rate case or rate per week good morning michael and and we appreciate the the question as as i have commented i think even in these prepared remarks we do continue to believe that fpl and gulf would file for a combined rate case in early twenty 21 from rates effective in 202 as you highlighted there is there is some uncertainties and certain factors that can change but that is the reality of operating any business you know what you know those days and and you do the best you can for for planning for uncertainties and we certainly would contemplate changes that we are aware of at the time but you know you have got to keep running your business and what is most important from our perspective is continuing to have the ability to invest in florida power and light and to invest at gulf power in these great opportunities that we see for the benefit of out customers you know we continue to lead the industry in zero m cost we continue to lead the industry in reliability and customer service and the best way to keep doing that is execute and that means occasionally having rate cases we are excited about that prospect we have been preparing for it for a long time and we think we have a great story to tell and we welcome the opportunity to talk about the things that we have been doing at at fpl and gulf so we are right for now and you know what obviously things could change but for now we continue to have those plans to to file in 21 for a new lease effective 202 all right and one other question just on the florida utilities you you have been the industry leader in terms of cost management do you think the pace of change in zero m cost to clients will stay at at this level meaning the year over year change or decline rates would you think they are reaching a point where it will start to flatten out where the ability to take out as much cost as you have done every year will start to slow the shortest answer to that michael is we have got a very creative team and we have got a team that is focused on continuous improvement and not afraid of that but it let me also not underestimate you know what that requires and that requires the ability to identify those new technologies and take that cost out over over time so there is you know we have to work for it and so every year we would pull together and come up with our best ideas do we think over the long period of time that we have exhausted every opportunity no in part because i think technology will continue to enhance our ability to do that but it takes time to execute those opportunities so our discipline is there our creativity is there our innovation our commitment to continuous improvement and were going to do the best we can to to create the best value for our customers got it thank you rebecca much appreciated",

conference call in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission each of which can be found on our website next能源 dot com and nextenergypartners dot com we do not undertake any duty to update any forward looking statements today is presentation also includes references to non gaap financial measures you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying the presentation for a description of these measures nextera energy delivered strong 2nd quarter results and continue to perform well both financially and operationally while managing the ongoing impacts of the covid nineteen pandemic as part of our core goal of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers we continue to operate despite the challenges created by the pandemic nextera energy is 2nd quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than eleven versus the prior year comparable quarter and we are well positioned to meet our overall objectives for the year fpl increased earnings per share by ¢fifteen year over year and its strong execution continues across the board during the quarter fpl set a new system peak load of more than 24500 megawatts our transmission and distribution systems continue to operate in line with our high reliability standards and our highly efficient generating facilities remain available to serve our customers epb is continued strong execution is a result of the smart capital investments that we have made over the past several decades to enhance our customer value proposition of low bills high reliability outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions consistent with enhancing it is best of in class but customer service last month fpl announced plans to retire at sheriff four its last remaining coal unit together with our joint interest owner jea and subject to certain approvals from the florida public service commission fpl intends to retire the 847 megawatt coal fired plant in early 2022 the retirement of sheriff four is projected to generate 100s of 1000000s of dollars in savings for fpl customers and prevent roughly 4000000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from its unit shareholder four is retirement is the final step of the coal phase out strategy that fpl launched in 2015 and that will complete the closure of approximately 2700 megawatts of coal capacity including the highest greenhouse emitting gas power plants in florida these transactions which will make fpl one of the 1st utilities to eliminate all of the coal from its generation portfolio demonstrate fpl is continued commitment and position as a clean energy leader we remain proud of our environmental track record particularly the c two emissions reductions that we have delivered throughout florida and across the country and we continue to remain focused on building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable gulf power also had a strong quarter of execution the focus on operational cost effectiveness at gulf continues to progress well with year to date zero m costs excluding specific covid nineteen related expenses declining by nearly ten versus the prior year comparable period and by approximately 25 relative to 2018 gulf power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and continued its significant improvement in employee safety with no occupational safety and health administration recordables year to date through the end of june we remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we previously outlined for gulf power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years during the quarter we completed the sale of our non core assets and made significant progress on our previously announced strategic initiatives these actions are expected to enhance our financial flexibility and position us for future growth we completed our annual storm drills for fpl and gulf power to prepare for the unprecedented situation of restoring power after a hurricane in the midst of the covid nineteen pandemic we spent two weeks drilling and challenging our teams to find ways to efficiently restore service to our customers without sacrificing safety the drills provided a number of lessons including how to leverage technology to quickly and safely screen personnel at various staging sites to help offset some of the challenges that will inevitably occur while we hope that our service territories will avoid the impacts of hurricanes this year consistent with our culture that is focused on preparedness and execution we continue to do everything we can to ensure that we will be there for our customers when they need us most at energy resources adjusted dps increased by ¢thirteen per year every year the energy resources team continues to capitalize on the tremendous market opportunity for low cost renewables adding 1730 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call this continued origination success through the ongoing pandemic is a testament to the energy resources significant competitive advantages including our best in class renewables development skills our engineering and construction team also continues to execute commissioning roughly 650 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the remaining approximately 4400 megawatts of wind and solar projects on track we expect to complete this year on track despite the significant supply chain challenges that are occurring both globally and locally while we are monitoring the situation closely we continue to expect that all of our planned 2020 renewables projects will achieve their in service dates this year in response to increased investor focus on environmental social and governance issues or yeah esg next week we expect to publish nextera energy is updated esg report which includes reporting on a range of topics including climate change diversity and inclusion and human rights our company has been focused on all of the elements of esg for more than 25 years our external energy approach to governance and risk oversight combined with the way that we treat our people our customers our communities and the environment our proof that a company can be both sustainable and financially successful at the same time the new report highlights this alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenants our diversity and inclusion statement includes a robust discussion of risk oversight and incorporates new disclosures such as diversity and inclusion metrics diversity and inclusion matter deeply to us as a company both because we believe they are the right thing to do but also because diverse and inclusive teams deliver better business results for the diverse communities that we serve our commitment to having a diverse workforce and inclusive culture is not new and our diversity metrics are better than many of the companies in our industry we are not satisfied and will continue our efforts to build an even more diverse and inclusive team going forward overall we will please with the progress we have made in extra energy so far in 2020 at it into the 2nd half of the year we believe we are well positioned to achieve the full year expectations that we have previously discussed even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic thank you for the 2nd quarter of 2020 fpl reported net income of $749000000 or a dollar 52 per share which is an increase of $86000000fifteen per share respectively year over year regulatory capital employed increased by more than ten over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of fpl is net income growth of approximately thirteen fpl is capital expenditures were approximately $1900000000 we expect our full year capital investments to total between $6500000006700000000 our reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately elevensix for the twelve months ended june 2020 which is at the upper end of the allowed band of ninesix to elevensix allowed under our current rate agreement during the quarter we utilized $7000000 of reserve amortization target regulatory roe leaving fpl with a balance of $736000000 we continue to expect that fpl will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement during 2021 as we previously discussed we expect that fpl and gulf will operate as a single larger florida utility company which will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers in may the companies filed an application with ferc for an approval of an internal reorganization whereby gulf would merge into fpl subject to ferc approval the companies will merge in january of 2021 however during 2021 gulf power will continue to operate as a separate operating division serving its existing customers under separate retail rates we continue to expect the companies to file a combined rate case in the 1st quarter of next year for new rates turning to our development efforts all of our major capital initiatives at fpl remain on track and on budget during the quarter the final 300 megawatts of solar being built under the solar base rate adjustment or sober mechanism of fpl is base rate settlement agreement were placed into service the 1200 megawatts of cost effective solar constructed under the sober mechanism are expected to generate significant customer benefits and represent a significant step forward in our efforts to meet florida is growing solar energy needs we are currently in the 1st stages of nrg is rapid solar expansion and the next phase of its generation modernization efforts the next six solar together projects totaling approximately 400 and fifty megawatts remain on track to be placed in service later this year the final 600 megawatts of the roughly 150 megawatt community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year beyond solar construction on the highly efficient roughly 1200 megawatt danbury clean energy center remains on track additionally the 409 megawatt manatee storage facility which will be one of the world is largest battery storage plants is on track and on budget to be complete next year based on our ongoing analysis of the long term potential of low cost renewables we remain confident as ever that wind solar and battery storage will be hugely disruptive to the country is existing generation while reducing costs for customers and helping to achieve future c zero two emissions reductions however to achieve an emissions free future we believe that other technologies will be necessary and we are particularly excited about the long term potential of hydrogen consistent with the toe in the water approach we previously utilized with solar and battery storage we are planning to propose a hydrogen pilot project at fpl this approximately $65000000 pilot project will be submitted to the florida public service commission the florida public service commission approval is expected to be in service in 2023 we will utilize solar energy that would have otherwise been clipped to produce a 100 green hydrogen through a roughly twenty megawatt electrolysis system the hydrogen will be used to replace a portion of the natural gas that is consumed by one of the three gas turbines at the okachobee clean energy center we believe that the project is a complement to our ongoing solar and battery storage development efforts and highlights fpl s continued innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of the clean energy solutions available for its customers we continue to evaluate other potential hydrogen opportunities across our businesses and while our near term investments are expected to be small in context of our overall capital program we are excited about the technology s long term potential which should further support future demand for low cost renewables as well as accelerate the decarbonization of transportation fuel and industrial feedstocks we continue to expect that fpl is ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in the regulatory capital employed of approximately nine from 2018 through 2022 while further enhancing our best in class customer value proposition let me now turn to gulf power which reported 2nd quarter 2020 gap earnings of $55000000 or ¢eleven per share good morning members of the commission the staff of the federal energy regulatory commission has prepared this slide presentation to summarize the results of our review of gulf power is 1st quarter 2020 financial report as of march 31 2020 gulf power had one per share relative to gulf power is adjusted earnings per share in the prior year period this quarter is results include the impact of roughly $5000000 of after tax covid nineteen related expenses primarily reflecting the expected incremental bad debt expense as a result of the pandemic early this month the florida public service commission approved gulf power is request to record costs attributed to covid nineteen including bad debt expense as a regulatory asset on its balance sheet as a result the costs recorded during the 2nd quarter are expected to be reversed during the 3rd quarter as the regulatory asset is recorded gulf power is reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately tenfour for the twelve months ending june 2020 for the full year 2020 we are targeting a regulatory roe in the upper half of the allowed band of nine25 to eleven25 during the quarter gulf power is capital expenditures we are roughly $170000000 and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between onezero and $1100000000 all of gulf is major smart capital investments including the north florida resiliency connection and the plant crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to progress well similar to other parts of the country the florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic recent economic data reflects an increase in we continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages with which florida entered the crisis and the continued attraction of the state to both new residents and new businesses will support a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us we remain optimistic during the quarter apl is average number of customers continued its recent trend of strong underlying growth increasing by approximately 75000 from the previous quarter and approximately forty of its load is cooling related and therefore important during april when stay at home orders were broadly in effect fpcs whether normalized retail sales were down approximately four relative to our expectations as the economy began re opening in early may whether normalized retail sales improved and were above our expectations in june while the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage remain unknown at this time we continue to expect the flexibility provided by a reserve and risk mechanism to offset any fluctuation for gulf power the average number of customers increased approximately onethree versus the comparable prior year quarter gulf power is 2nd quarter retail sales declined by roughly sixtwo year over year as a result of the under of the unfavorable weather comparison and a decline in underlying usage for customer over the 2nd quarter gulf power experienced a more significant decline in underlying usage for customer than fpl but also experienced an improvement as the economy began re opening in may and june as a reminder unlike fpl gulf power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs so any variability would therefore have more impact to gulf power is earnings in roe than at fpl as a reminder as we have often said the utility industry is subject to a wide range of risks and uncertainties including changes in laws and regulations weather events and economic conditions let me now turn to energy resources which reported 2nd quarter 2020 gap earnings of $481000000 or ¢97 per share and adjusted earnings of $531000000 or a dollar and 08 per share this is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of ¢thirteen revenue for the quarter was approximately fourteen lower from last year is comparable quarter results which have been restated to reflect the results of our nextera energy transmission business formerly reported in corporate and other new investments added ¢eight per share contributions from existing generation assets increased ¢five per share as improved wind resource and increased ptc volume from our repower wind projects were partially offset by the refining outage at the seabrook nuclear facility 2nd quarter fleet wide also contributing favorably was nextera energy transmission where contributions increased by ¢three versus 2019 contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines were flat year over year these favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business which declined ¢four versus the particularly strong year in 20192nd quarter last year all other impacts increased results by one per share as i mentioned earlier energy resources development team had another excellent quarter of origination success adding 1730 megawatts to our backlog since our last earnings call we have added 708 megawatts of wind 844 megawatts of solar and 178 megawatts of battery storage to our renewables backlog we also executed a build own transfer transaction i am speaking on behalf of a 200 megawatt solar project which is not included in our backlog additions all of the battery storage projects will be paired with either new or existing solar projects to take advantage of the itc and provide a more firm renewable product for our customers the continued strong demand for battery storage projects highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution we continue to expect that by the middle of this decade without incentives new near firm wind and new near firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal and nuclear facilities and less fuel efficient oil and gas fired generation units producing significant long term renewables demand our current backlog now totals approximately 14400 megawatts and is the largest we have ever had in our roughly twenty year development history to put our backlog into context it is larger than the current operating in wind solar portfolios of all but two other companies in the world as of year 2019 highlighting the nexter energy continues to be at the forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector only halfway through 2020 we are pleased to have already signed nearly 350 megawatts of contracts for delivery beyond 2022 which is a reflection of the continued strong demand for our services to ensure that we can take advantage of this significant demand in the coming years we now have more than $2000000000 of safe harbor wind and solar equipment which could support as much as $40000000000 of wind solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024 these purchases highlight the benefits of scale and the strength of our balance sheet that we have the safe harbor equipment also supports additional rebuilding opportunities including several 100 megawatts of potential 2021 rebuilding projects which we are currently evaluating as i discussed earlier all of the 2020 renewables projects remain on track to achieve their targeted in service dates this year as a result we do not expect these projects to rely on the safe harbor provisions we were pleased with the supreme court is ruling regarding appalachian trail crossing authorization authority which resolved similar issues for mvp we were similarly pleased that the supreme court partially stayed the montana federal court is decision related to mvp we are working with the army corps of engineers on its reissuance of the project permit and are following a comprehensive re study by the relevant agencies we expect issuance of an nvbp revised biological opinion shortly assuming timely resolution of the outstanding permitting issues we are now targeting a full in service date for the pipeline during early 2022 and expect an overall project estimate in the range of fivefour to $5700000000 turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy for the 2nd quarter of 2020 gapnet income attributable to nextera energy was $1275000000 or $two59 per share nextera energy is 2nd quarter 2020 adjusted earnings and adjusted dps were $1286000000 and $two61 per share respectively adjusted earnings from corporate and other declined by one year over year primarily as a result of the impact of the covid nineteen pandemic nextera energy also delivered strong year to date operating cash flow growth and for the full year 2020 expects to generate roughly $8500000000 in operating cash flow to help support its strong financial position nextera energy maintains approximately $13000000000 in liquidity to support the largest capital investment program in our history since last quarter call we completed roughly $3000000000 in long term financings it includes our recent issuance of $1500000000 of senior notes $2200000000 in capital holdings to ventures over the course of the last few months we repaid nearly all of the term loans that we issued during march and april and converted these commitments to bilateral revolving credit facilities included in these facilities is a total of more than $1000000000 in six month storm facilities at fpl and englewood power which similar to previous years we put in place to ensure sufficient liquidity in the event of a hurricane energy resources also closed two tax equity financings including its 1st ever combined wind and solar portfolio financing and we expect to close on the balance of our tax equity financings as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year our year to date financing activities are evidence of the great financial partnerships we have built over time which help provide ample liquidity and continued access to capital to support our outstanding growth prospects next our energy efficiency financing which is part of our tax equity financing portfolio is also showing strong growth prospects for 2020 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of $eightseventy plus the accretion of ¢fifteen and ¢twenty in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the floor to acquisitions for 2020 we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of $eightseventy plus the accretion of ¢fifteen and ¢twenty in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the floor to acquisitions for 2022 we expect to grow adjusted dps in the range of six to eight off of the 2021 adjusted dps translating to a range of $ten to $ten75 per share from 2018 to 2022 we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted dps compound annual growth rate range we expect per share at roughly ten per year through at least 22 off of a 22 base while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined in summary despite the challenges created by the covid nineteen pandemic all of our businesses continue to perform well and maintain their excellent prospects for growth going forward we have a long term track record of delivering results for our customers and shareholders and we remain intensely focused on continuing that track record based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and their strong growth prospects we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 20202021 and 2022 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit metrics we continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and believe that nextera energy is well positioned to drive long term shareholder value over the coming years let me now turn to nextera energy partners which continued its strong start to 2020 with growth growth and adjusted ebitda of approximately 23 and 46 respectively from the prior year comparable quarter on a year to date basis adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution are approximately $1700000000 and $2500000000 respectively the strong operational and financial performance at nextera energy highlights the nextera energy partners remain well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives yesterday the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of ¢5775 per common unit or $two and 31 per common unit on an annualized basis we are pleased to see pg e emerge from bankruptcy earlier this month as expected all of our existing contracts were assumed without modification following pg e is emergence from bankruptcy nextera energy partners received a cash distribution of approximately $65000000 from our desert sunlight to fifty and 300 projects which represent current distributions and those of those who are involved the release of the desert sunlight tract cash supplements nextera partners liquidity which was approximately $650000000 including cash on hand at the end of the 2nd quarter the organic growth investments at nextera partners continue to progress well the approximately 275 megawatts of wind repowering and the texas pipeline expansion both remain on track to be in service later this year we continue to expect to execute as nextera energy partners portfolio further expands let me now review the detailed results for nextera energy partners 2nd quarter adjusted ebitda with $349000000 and cash available for distribution was $166000000 up 23 and 46 respectively against the prior year comparable quarter now that the pg e bankruptcy has been favorably resolved and distributions from our desert sunlight project have resumed cash available for distribution is expected to be significantly higher in the 3rd quarter new projects added $51000000 in adjusted ebitda and $36000000 with cash available for distribution existing projects also contributed favorably to the significant year over year growth in adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution as resource was favorable across the portfolio for the 2nd quarter when resource was 100 of the long term average versus 94 in the prior year additionally cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project level debt service primarily as a result of the early debt retirement to facilitate the wind repowering the reduction in project level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results are net of i d r fees since we treat these as operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slide let me now turn to our external partners expectations nextera partners continues to expect december 31 20202020 run rate for adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 1225000000 to $1400000000 and cash available for distribution in the range of 560000000 to $640000000 reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the portfolio at the end of 2020 as a reminder these expectations include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from the base of our 4th quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $twofourteen we continue to see twelve to fifteen growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024 we expect the annualized rate of the lp distribution to be consistent with the historical average of the lp distribution growth we are resuming cash distribution from the desert sunlight project and we now expect to achieve nextera partners we will maintain a trailing twelve month pay out ratio of approximately seventy highlighting the significant flexibility we believe nextera energy partners has going forward as we have previously discussed we will continue to be opportunistic nextera energy partners favorable positioning should give it flexibility to achieve its long term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022 nextera energy partners year to date performance in 2020 and believes it continues to offer a best in class value proposition for investors the diversity and long term contracted nature of nextera energy partners clean energy portfolio helps insulate it from the broader economic conditions including impacts related to the covid nineteen pandemic with a flexibility to grow in three ways acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from 3rd parties nextera energy partners has clear visibility following another strong quarter of origination energy resources portfolio of renewable projects now totals more than 27 gigawatts including the signed backlog of projects that energy resources plans to build in the coming years when combined with the prospects for future renewables development nextera energy partners long term growth visibility remains as strong as ever nextera energy partners cost of capital and access to capital advantages remain strong including significant demand from various low cost private infrastructure capital provide flexibility to finance this growth over the long term these strengths together with nextera partners favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights leave nextera partners uniquely positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives going forward in closing we believe that the fundamental value proposition of nextera energy and nextera energy partners remains as robust as ever both companies remain resilient and well positioned to deliver on their commitments we continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and are continued and focused on delivering smart capital investments that enhance value for both customers and shareholders and expand our position as the world is leading clean energy provider that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open up the line for questions thank you please press star and then one using a touchtone telephone to withdraw your questions you may press star and two if you are using a speakerphone we do ask that you please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers to ensure the best sound quality once again that is star and then one to ask a question we will pause momentarily to assemble a roster hello this is actually richy here for julian just had a question around the the catex rays at fpl and gulf what was driving that is that more around undergrounding grid hardening or is that more on the solar side and after we think about the catex trajectory from 201 and beyond is that more in line with what you disclosed at your analyst day or should we expect it to be at more of these robust robust levels going forward ritchie good morning and and thanks for the question i think it really reflects a you know consistency with what we have been talking about for a long time which is we keep finding terrific projects for our customers and investment opportunities and we are we are starting to put those in place as i highlighted in in the prepared remarks we do have a consistent expectations for the growth rate between 2018 and 2022 of a nine compound annual growth rate so obviously some projects move from one year to another but at the at the heart of it it is terrific investments for the benefit of our customers as far as beyond 2022 you know similar to comments that we have made in the past the growth opportunities that we see across all of our businesses but specific at at fpl and and gulf power include the modernization efforts including the large deployment of solar over time as well as investments in grid hardening and undergrounding is highlighted by the storm protection plan that we are in the process of of going through approvals and and you know initial investments for that program so we are super excited about the opportunities for investing and again stay very focused on ensuring that these are good projects for the benefit of our customers disclose 65000000 for that pilot project what what are you seeing there on that front is this more around transportation opportunities or is this all around like a pipeline and being able to like blend with pipes so when you know when we looked at this let us call it 510 years ago and we thought about what it would take to get to true zero emissions we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive for customers what makes us really excited about hydrogen particularly in the 2030 and beyond timeframe is that that has the potential to supplement significant deployment of renewables including wind and solar technologies complemented by and i will call it medium term duration batteries but then that last amount of emissions that that you would take out of the system to get down to zero could be most economically served by hydrogen so that is what makes us excited about doing a pilot project we are very excited about the opportunity to present that to the florida public service commission as a way to you know further enhance fpl is ability to innovate and deliver these long term you know clean energy solutions to our customers and as part of that we will learn about the technologies and we will see what other opportunities there are potentially for the industrial and transportation sectors you know and for us to be able to produce you know produce that the green energy to produce the green hydrogen is a potential significant significant opportunity for us we think we are at the early stages which is you know kind of consistent with our toe in the water approach we want to get some experience with it obviously do a lot of research and hello good morning it is actually constantine here for shar as well congratulations on a great quarter we have definitely seen some impressive numbers but the backlog additions and kind of contract increases for the 22 timeframe just kind of curious on kind of your thoughts around kind of near is growth trajectory and kind of contribution to the business mix and it is kind of subsided as a conversation point from the rating agencies but just thoughts on kind of growing contributions from near kind of versus balancing that from the regulated contributions and are you thinking about both on acquisitions or kind of any kind of drop downs accelerated from near just some thoughts around that thanks katherine we appreciate  appreciate you dialing in this morning we are really excited about pursuing opportunities for investment across the board and of course it is at fpl and gulf that is focused on investments that that you know need that need to create value for our customers and our energy resources it is return focused along with you know delivering things for our customers there too so from a corporate perspective we do not want to limit any of our businesses when we find great investment opportunities which you know again i can not highlight enough about how excited we are about the renewables development prospects at at energy resources so we are not going to constrain them at any way you know we will develop those opportunities that create value for shareholders and to the extent that we want to maintain balance over time we have got a lot of opportunities to do that that are created for shareholders including recycling of capital through next energy partners i am obviously a willing and excited acquirer of energy resources projects but energy resources has the ability to recycle capital to the 3rd parties as well so there is plenty of ways to ensure that we can create the real you know value of creative opportunities and still think about it from a corporate perspective in a variety of different ways thank you that is no that is very helpful i am kind of pivoting a little bit to to something a little bit longer term i guess so this is jim you know we we always position our business to try to win regardless of the outcome of elections you know we i think you can remember back three you know close to four years ago now there was some turmoil around our stock when president trump was elected we have managed completely fine under this administration in terms of being able to continue to grow our renewable business because you know what it is all about economics right and and the time for renewables is now and you know that you know transcends politics frankly the economics and the and the need to you know and and really the need to decarbonize not only the electric sector but the rest of those sectors of the economy are really you know really frankly transcend what happens in elections and so you know obviously we watch them closely we think good clean energy policy is important and the right policy for for america in the future and and and you know i think we continue to be positioned really well regardless of who wins in november that makes sense i will i will jump back in the queue thanks so much congratulations the most likely outcome from congress these days is tax credit extensions cash grants do you think a national renewable portfolio standard is a possibility and i am just wondering of all those different alternatives what do you think might actually occur in the next four years you know so i think it is honestly too soon to tell michael i think a lot is going to depend on what happens in the election is there continued split government or is there not split government that will be i think a big driver of what policies happen and you know i think all those ideas around the table we have been consistent in in what we said which is that you know we think it is important to have you know good and fair clean energy policy going forward we also have said that it is that we think wind and and renewables with batteries will be you know are very competitive you know once the ptc is and the itc is phase out in terms of competing against conventional generation it is just honestly really more a matter of the speed with which you want to decarbonize is what is going to ultimately drive the final i think policy choices and so you know we are you know obviously we are active i am engaged in the discussions and i think it is premature really to say what we think is going to happen because i think you have an election in four or five months and as you all know elections have consequences and and you know we will we will see what happens post the election in terms of what is going to be the policy landscape going forward and i am just wondering if if hydrogen works out is that a method do you think you could actually build more put more gas turbines back into the plan if hydrogen production becomes a viable economic alternative or do you think other alternative technologies are better suited such as fuel cells and then if we are right and if the costs come down for hydrogen and it is the best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions profile we would retrofit certain of our you know gas facilities to run on hydrogen or run on a portion of hydrogen so i think for florida power and light and lightheaded power you know it s at this and again if we re talking about a long way into the future you wouldn t necessarily need to build any new you know hydrogen gas turbines in that in that portfolio because we ve got a tremendously efficient fleet that s already in service and the investments we would make would be really around conversion now whether or not that s true elsewhere in the country i think is you know it might be a little bit different but we re talking about a long way down the road i think a lot of things need to come together to have those types of conversations i think it is it is fairly preliminary gotcha and yeah one final question just make your comment on mna interests these days what is going on with sante cooper et cetera so i think we this will not be surprising we remain interested in mna we think there is a lot that we can bring to the table you know i continue to believe that there is not a utility in the country that we could not run i think in terms of the transition of sandi cooper you know that process has been pushed to next year and we remain you know we remain very interested and and continue to be focused on trying to make that happen hey jim what regions of the country are you focused on we we continue to be focused on all right thank you very much plus for the regulated assets pretty much anywhere zero thank you our next question comes from steven bird from morgan stanley please go ahead with your question hi thanks that is dave arcaro on for steven thanks for taking my question i had one quick follow up just on the hydrogen topic wondering if you see a potential there so for this to be an opportunity at ner and also in terms of kind of business model but do you think that you would envision being involved in owning the electrolysis function within the supply chain and if so do you have a kind of a vision or a view on what technology is ahead of others at this point but we are looking at other pilot type investment opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio consistent with the way that we approached solar early on and of course batteries more recently so i think there will be opportunities over time for those type of of pilot projects you know again where you think of it is actually being close to economic today are areas where there is already significant penetration of renewables because as you well know it is critical to find a low cost and here in the us you know the economics certainly have to factor in that today there is a very low cost supply of natural gas making it you know the imperative that you you find a cheap electricity supply you know it is early you know never say never on on you know where we might find opportunities to invest in the business but historically as you know we have not played in the space of of being you know being a vertically integrated you know owner of technologies or or projects we have typically taken the best of manufactured equipment from other folks you know apply our scale and our ability to construct own and operate over the long term effectively is where we create value so again it is early but at this point i would not think that we would focus on vertically integrating it is more of you know applying hydrogen as  as a technology consistent the way that we do created value in the past so so the only thing i would add to that two things one is i would be disappointed if in john is business we do not make some and some kind of pilot investment in the next year we are looking at a variety of things and and i would be disappointed if we do not make some kind of pilot investment in the next year i would very very much tone the water like we did a decade ago in the battery storage business secondly you know clearly we are not going to backward integrate into manufacturing so i would not i would not rule out us owning them as part of an integrated system that was integrated with renewables to manufacturer hydrogen and as you know our view around that would be if we had a long term contract and obviously we have access to very efficient capital we know how to operate equipment we are you know and so a lot of that would be would come to our i think our strategic advantages in terms of how we how we are able to create value for folks so you know i think it is i think it is early we are we are there is clearly an opportunity to you know five to you know five to ten years from now to displace the last ten of the carbon emissions out of the electric sector by manufacturing hydrogen in that is clear i think there is also clearly an opportunity to make renewables to display diesel fuel and perhaps even other types of transportation fuel going forward and there is also i think clearly an opportunity to make green hydrogen to to replace other types of hydrogen or or feedstocks in industrial and so we are looking at all of that and we are not you know we are not being all of that in the end comes back to a very important thing which is this is going to drive gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts of renewable demands in this country and so there is no one better positioned than us to take advantage of that and we are going to be just like we were in battery storage we are going to be at the vanguard we are going to be this is a big strategic initiative for us and we are going to drive it and it is going to be very important for this company i think not you know over the next over the next decade we will not make any money on it in the next five years just like we did not make any money in batteries in the 1st five years and and next year we are we are deploying a $1000000000 of batteries ten years later and so that is that is the way i think about this i think about this is is helping power the long term growth of this company into the back half of this decade in the next decade as well that is really helpful thank you so much for those comments i just had one other quick m and a follow up i was just wondering if there is any path for texas to be a target of interest for you from an m and a perspective or what would need to change there thanks i am in texas obviously we own assets in texas and so we are a great operator and and we feel like we would bring an enormous amount of state we we own 1000000000s of dollars of assets in the state right and we are a great great partner for the state and so you know i would never say never you know obviously we were extraordinarily disappointed in the young core decision we think it was but you know that is what it is and so it is probably going to take a bit to get past that before i am super excited about doing things in texas from an mna standpoint understood thank you very much our next question comes from michael lapides from goldman sachs please go ahead with your question hi good morning everybody i want to turn to florida for a 2nd you are supposed to file rate cases next year at both utilities and obviously the combination of it through will be a big task is there any potential for being able to delay or defer the timing of the rate cases to see what happens from a tax perspective in dc from a public policy perspective just so you do not have to go back to the regulator two or three times over a two or three year period and b is there any scenario where you may not even need a rate case or rate relief but that is the reality of operating any business you know what you know those days and and you do the best you can for for planning for uncertainties and we certainly would contemplate changes that we are aware of at the time but you know you have got to keep running your business and then what is most important from our perspective is continuing to have the ability to invest in florida power and light and invest at gulf power in these great opportunities that we see for the benefit of our shareholders you know we continue to lead the industry in zero and m costs we continue to lead the industry in reliability and customer service and the best way to keep doing that is execute and that means occasionally having rate cases we are excited about that prospect we have been preparing for it for a long time and we think we have a great story to tell and we welcome the opportunity to talk about the things that we have been doing at at fpl and gulf so right for now and you know obviously obviously could change but for now we continue to have those plans to to file in 21 for new rates effective 2022 got it and one other question just on the florida utilities you you have been the industry leader in terms of cost management do you think the pace of change and zero and m cost decline will stay at this level meaning the year over year change or decline rates or do you think you are reaching a point where it will start to flatten now where the ability to continue to take out as much cost as you have done every year we will start the slide the shortest answer to that michael is we have got a very creative team and we have got a team that is focused on continuous improvement and not afraid of that but let it and let me also not underestimate what that requires and that requires the ability to identify those new technologies and take that cost out over over time so there is you know we have to work for it and so every year we we pull together and come up with our best ideas do we think over the long so our discipline is there our creativity is there our innovation our commitment to continuous improvement and we are going to do the best we can to create the best value for for our customers so thank you rebecca i much appreciate",

reminder ladies and gentlemen this conference is being recorded and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without permission from the company i would now like to introduce ms maureen mulholland senior vice president general counsel and secretary of monro thank you please go ahead thank you hello everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning is call before we get started please note that as part of the call this morning we will be referencing a presentation that is available on the investors section of our website at corporate monro com investors investor resources if i could draw your attention to the safe harbor statement on slide two of the presentation i would like to remind participants on this morning is call that our presentation includes some forward looking statements about monro is future performance actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today the most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in monro is filings with the sec and in our earnings release the company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law additionally on today is call management statements include a discussion of certain non gap financial measures which are intended to supplement and not be substitutes for comparable gap measures reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable gap measures will be included as part of today is presentation and in our earnings release with that i would like to turn the call over to our president and chief executive officer brett ponton brett thank you maureen and good morning everyone thanks for joining us i will get started today with a brief overview of our 3rd quarter results followed by an update on the progress we have made on our monro forward strategy as illustrated on slide three we reported comps down zeronine in the 3rd quarter as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic in october and the beginning of november we performed well against difficult comparisons in the prior year mild weather conditions towards the end of november and in december caused the slowdown across our core northern markets these conditions have continued into january with our comparable store sales down four during the month we do not like talking about the weather however it is impossible to ignore the impact it has on our business while we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter we are executing well against the areas within our control in particular we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and are confident we are on the right path we are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to deliver strong results no matter the external circumstances moving on to our performance by category in the 3rd quarter we were down one year over year in tire comparable store sales as higher ticket year over year was offset by a decline in tire volume we experienced more normalized retail price in this quarter and are focused on further refining our entire strategy to drive strength in our largest category importantly we are on track to roll out our tire category management and pricing system beginning in the 1st quarter of fiscal 2021 which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated approach to real time pricing i will provide more details on this shortly turning to our service and repair categories we saw a three decline in brakes year over year falling short of a difficult comparison in 3rd quarter last year in maintenance we were flat while front end shocks were down one and alignments declined three year over year overall our southern markets outperformed our northern markets as expected given the mild winter weather conditions we faced in this region new stores added 22700000 in revenue during the quarter including 20700000 from recent acquisitions regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter we saw a decline of twenty basis points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store sales which resulted in higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales our variable margin on the other hand expanded due to lower year over year material costs as a percentage of sales while slightly higher than the prior year quarter technician labor as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter this is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control we identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective action to drive improved results we will have additional opportunities to continue to improve results in this area as we implement our cloud based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust to changes in demand demand dynamics without sacrificing sales i would now like to turn to the progress we have made on our monro forward strategy beginning with our store rebrand and re image initiative on slide four this initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing standardized in store operating procedures which we call our monro playbook additionally we are rebranding select stores to a tire oriented banner where targeted demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing service revenues during the 1st half of fiscal 2020 we finalized the transformations of our 1st group of stores which includes 44 locations in rochester new york and the mid atlantic as well as the 2nd group which includes 43 stores in our southern markets during the 3rd quarter we continue to scale this initiative across our base and move forward with the transformation of 74 stores in four markets and 42 of our recently acquired california stores we have completed the transformation in the 74 stores and have substantially completed our california stores which are being rebranded under our tire choice auto service centers banner to drive higher awareness for tires turning to slide five i would like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic rationale as we transform our store base as many of you know we operate in two store formats our service brand stores which generate approximately $600000 per store in annualized sales and our tire brands stores which generate approximately 1200000 per store in annualized sales prior to any rebrand activity we operated 555 service brand stores and 734 tire brand stores and as we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores we are prioritizing the higher volume tire brands throughout this process we will be consolidating our regional brands focusing on shifting our service brands over to tire brands the lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity when we speak to re imaging stores this primarily means modernizing the appearance of our stores with no associated brand change as we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re imaging stores we are leveraging our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market looking at the bottom left of the slide you can see here the progress we have made so far we are very much in the early innings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially completed out of our portfolio we have separated these stores out between comp stores and non comp stores which helps us to evaluate their performance post refresh of our approximately 900 comp stores that we set out to transform we have completed 134 stores and of our approximately 150 non comp stores we have substantially completed 69 as we move forward with expanding this program across our base we will continue to prioritize markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and our approach will be measured in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum through the end of this fiscal year we are focusing on finalizing the transformation of our recently acquired california stores while starting the transformation of approximately eighty more stores that will be completed in q one of fy 21 moving on to the performance of the stores we have completed so far to help provide some additional granularity we separated out how rebranded stores have performed versus the stores that have just been re imaged importantly this data only includes comp stores that had a full quarter of performance following the completion of their transformation this is how we will speak to this performance excuse me of our transformed stores moving forward as you can see and in line with our expectations we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand stores this shift optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sales without sacrificing our service revenues the stores that have been re imaged were slightly down as these are located in our northern markets which were impacted by the mild weather conditions i mentioned earlier we believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits to come with a streamlined brand portfolio the 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation given they have not had a full quarter post transformation yet but we are still we are seeing early signs of strength at these stores and are pleased with the results while we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base to sustain performance we have seen at the stores that have completed the transformation to date underscores the impact of this important initiative turning to slide six and the remainder of our monro forward initiatives i would like to focus my discussion on the initiatives that are top priority which we believe will be critical to supporting our broader strategy in the 3rd quarter we began modernizing our store it infrastructure at all of our approximately 1300 locations this new infrastructure enables state of the art technology including our new digital phone and texting system which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience this system will allow us to better track customer execution driving a more consistent phone strategy and improve conversion our store infrastructure monetization will be completed by the end of the 1st quarter of fiscal 2021 allowing us to leverage our new phone system which will be critical to driving traffic to our stores another priority for us is the optimization of our tire category management we are on track and by the end of this fiscal year we expect our new pricing software will be operational we believe this will be critical to driving long term margin expansion by providing improved visibility into demand dynamics allowing us to better refine our assortments and execute our strategy to become the number one destination for tires at any price point finally we are right on track to roll out our cloud based store scheduling model pilot by year end gaining real time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective and strategic ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales or overstaffed when there is a lack of demand regarding our other teammate initiatives we have rolled out the monro university program to all of our teammates and are continuing to expand and enhance the course content we have also implemented mandatory onboard training to ensure that everyone who joins our team is trained on our monro playbook operating procedures in order to provide a quality five star experience to our customers moving on to slide seven while we are very focused on the rollout of monro forward acquisitions remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy during the quarter we closed the previously announced acquisition of three companies one with fourteen locations in las vegas nevada and four in boise idaho as well as two companies that include nine stores in northern california further solidifying our brilliant position in the western united states our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts as well as benefit from the high concentration of vehicles in this market and the potential long term consumership the acquisition in nevada and idaho which are new states to monro is expected to add approximately 20000000 in annualized sales representative sales make for 75 service and 25 tires the acquisitions in california expects to add approximately 25000000 in annualized sales representatives sales makes a 55 service and 45 tires these ac acquisitions are expected to be diluted to delude earnings per share in fiscal 2020 overall acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected 120000000 in annualized sales we operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive m a targets we currently have over ten nda signed with opportunities ranging from five to forty stores which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions further by continuing to execute our monro forward initiatives including our new brand standards and operating procedures we expect it integrate our new acquisitions more effectively and efficiently lastly we opened one greenfield location during 3rd quarter bringing our total greenfield store openings to seven in fiscal 2020 in conclusion we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in our business we are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in a platform capable of delivering sustainable longterm growth we are not there yet nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the transformation but we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control i would like to thank the entire team at monro for their exceptional work as we execute this strategy as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support with that i will turn the call over to our executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer brian d ambrosia who will provide additional detail on our 3rd quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook thank you brett and good morning everyone turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter sells increased sixtwo year over year to $329300000 driven by sales from new stores of $22700000 including $20700000 from recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately $800000 same sales in the quarter were down zeronine year over year the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days in line with the previous year period those margins decreased twenty basis points to 37eight in the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 from 38 in the prior year period this decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sale as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales however as brett mentioned we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material costs as a percentage of sales operating expenses for the quarter increased $5500000 to $92800000 or 28two of sales as compared with $87300000 or 28 one of sales for the prior year period the year over year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net new stores our operating income for the 3rd quarter was $31600000 which increased by twoeight as compared to operating income of $30700000 for the same quarter last year and decreased as a percentage of sales from ninenine to ninesix that interest expense for the 3rd quarter increased $200000 to $7000000 as compared to $6800000 in the same period last year the weighted average outstanding for the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by approximately $112000000 as compared to the prior year period the increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease that recorded in connection with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions in greenfield expansion as well as an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisition the weighted average interest rate for the 3rd quarter decreased by approximately 140two basis year over year due to lower libor and prime interest rates as well as lower borrowing rates associated with new leases our effective tax rate was 24 one for the 3rd quarter compared to fifteenthree for the same period last year the year over your year increase is primarily due to a one time income tax benefit adjustment we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change which was related to certain deductions that the irs accepted during an examination of our fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 tax returns that income for the 3rd quarter was $18900000 compared to $20500000 in the prior year period diluted earnings per share for the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 were ¢56 compared to diluted earnings per share of ¢61 in the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share which is a non gap measure for the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 was ¢sixty which excludes from diluted earnings per share ¢three of costs related to monro forward initiatives and one of cost related to acquisition due diligence and integration this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of ¢57 in the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2019 which excluded one of costs related to monro forward initiatives one of non recurring corporate and field management realignment costs and ¢six benefits from the one time income tax adjustment for more information on this non gap measure please see the reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release lastly we opened one greenfield location during the 3rd quarter as a reminder greenfield stores include new construction as well the acquisition of one to four store operations greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately $1000000 each annual sales as of december 28th 2019 the company had 1289 company operated stores and 99 franchise location as compared with 1186 company operated stores and 99 franchise locations as of december 29 2018 during the 3rd quarter we had a 27 company operated stores and closed none turning to slide nine we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we execute our growth strategy our capital expenditures were $42200000 in the 1st nine months of fiscal 2020 of which approximately $18000000 was related to investments in our monro forward initiative we are pleased with the progress of our monro forward strategy and we continue to expect an incremental $75000000 in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years to support investments in story image and technology additionally a creative acquisition support our our growth strategy during the 1st nine months of the year we spent approximately $104000000 on acquisitions including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our greenfield expansion strategy as brett mentioned acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected $120000000 in annualized sales i would like to provide some additional clarity here the $120000000 in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been fully integrated which as we have stated in the past is usually in year three post it is acquisition during years one and two following the acquisition we typically see a step down in sales given the process of onboarding new stores to our model moving on we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend program and paid approximately $22000000 in dividends in the 1st nine months of fiscal 2020 finally we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility to support our strategic growth initiatives we entered the 3rd quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial covenant we generated approximately $125000000 of cash flow from operating activities during the 1st nine months of fiscal 2020 and debt under our revolving credit facility increased by approximately $59000000 now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide ten we have updated our fiscal 2020 comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of one to flat to reflect the impact of our year to day performance based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently closed acquisition we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1000000000 $275000000 to 1000000000 $290000000 an increase of sixtwo to sevenfive as compared to fiscal 2019 sales this compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1000000000 $295000000 to $1000000000 $315000000 our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal 2020 given the impact of our year to day performance we expect fiscal 2020 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of ¢two25 to ¢two35 representing a decline of five one to zeroeight year over year compared to ¢two37 in fiscal 2019 this compares to the previous guidance of $two45 to ¢two55 on an adjusted basis which is a non gap measure the company when he expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of ¢two35 to ¢two45 representing a decline of oneseven to growth of twofive which excludes from diluted earnings per share monro forward initiative costs and acquisition due diligence and integration costs this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of ¢two39 in fiscal 2019 which excluded monro forward initiative costs non recurring corporate and field management realignment cost acquisition due diligence and integration costs and the benefit from the one time income tax adjustment acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be diluted to earnings per diluted share during the year at the midpoint of our guidance range we expect an operating margin of approximately tentwo interest expense to be approximately $29000000 depreciation and amortization to be approximately $65000000 and ebitda to be approximately $196000000 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60000000 this year this guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23five and is based on 34000000 diluted weighted average shares outstanding as always our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or greenfield store openings i will now turn the call over to brett to provide some closing remarks before we move to q and a thanks brian we are making strong strides in the execution of our monro forward strategy in particular our store rebrand and re imaging initiative the strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore our confidence in this initiative the store rebrand and re emerge program is further supported by our technological investments which we believe will help drive long term margin expansion in summary we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control we are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities ahead with that i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys once again that is one to register questions at the time our 1st question is coming from brian nagel of oppenheimer please go ahead good morning morning brian so i want to foc and i i apologize for focusing on the weather here but i do i do just want to dive a little deeper into sales trends in the quarter so brett you mentioned i think brian you did too on in your prepared comments just you made some comment commentary suggesting that you know to the degree to which weather impacted the business i was wondering if you could drill down a little further and say you know what that zeronine comp you know would have been had the weather cooperated and some of the other the other metrics you are seeing that really suggest the underlying businesses is trending better than what we saw in the in the weather affected fiscal q three yeah i will take the 1st part and i will let brian take the 2nd part of the question brian when we look at the performance in the quarter as we have talked about our northern markets certainly underperformed than southern markets and i will give you a little more granularity on that certainly our stores up in the northeast and the midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure to weather conditions like you have in the northeast certainly under perform i think it is difficult to say what we would have done you know certainly i think we were expecting you know positive comps in the quarter our internal expectations would have been closer to +one or +onefive assuming normalized weather conditions that we have seen in the past we felt really good coming out of october november given the strength of last year is performance that we were competing against and and did not get the cooperation from the weather in december that we were certainly expecting as i made the the comments in my prepared remarks we certainly do not like talking about the weather brian but we can not ignore the fact that when fifty of our business is tires and we have a high concentration of stores in the northeast and midwest we are going to have outsized exposure to our account performance brian would you mind maybe taking restating the 2nd part of your question well i think look i think you have covered right maybe i will just bounce right i have a follow up question if i if i could so the guide the the adjusted guidance and you you mentioned so in january you were did i think a four now if i am doing the math it looks as though that the adjusted guidance would suggest some type of pickup then in business in in february march i i guess the 1st question is is that assumption correct and then the following question is and i know we have seen this before with your business but you know at what point does because we still have a long we have potentially a long time in the winter the weather could still come but is there a point at which in in in the quarter where the the weather just comes too late yeah so so brian your assumption is correct regarding the regarding the implied comps so if you think about q four at the mid point of let us say down zerofive for the full year down zerofive that implies q four of down two which would be about february and march being down one in order to get to that down two so that that is the dynamic at the midpoint so there is an expectation of of a pickup in february and march and and brian maybe just to comment on the 2nd part yeah you know as we get deeper into the 4th quarter our 4th quarter and the 2nd half of the quarter in particular i think we have become less sensitive to the weather as you transition out of the pure winter conditions into spring certainly i think you know that later in the quarter you get snow falls certainly does not have the same impact on tire demand like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in october or november consumers are pretty thrifty with their money and i believe if you get snowfall late in the season they have a tendency to forgo that 1st purchase and push it out until next season in particular the other thing to call out as well as if you look at our store performance at the company december and january have always been the most volatile volatile months that we had to contend with and i think what we have seen in past performance here friends coming out of december january do not necessarily reflect what you see in the spring so given the the mild december january heading into the balance of the quarter we feel pretty good about the guidance range we provided as brian said our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our comp sales guidance that assumes run rate coming out of january which we certainly believe we are going to be better than that as we roll into fy 21 i i appreciate all the color thank you thanks brian thank you our next question is coming from jonathan lamers of bmo capital markets please go ahead thanks brett looking at your slide on the store rebranding you know the eighteen performance of the rebranded stores i think it is good i am i am curious from your analytic model how many years should it take a rebranded store to reach projected run rate sales well if you look at look at the top quadrant of that slide jonathan we have shared you know with investors the fact that our service stores do roughly $600000 in revenue and our tire stores do a 1000000 too so in a case where we are rebranding a service store your you are working off a base on average of 600000 and if we have seen i will call it a double digit comp improvement off of that base you can get to implied number certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp to the full maturity equally and the average sales performance of our tire branded stores and that is one of the things that is encouraging about the strategy for us so it is not that it is just a one time step up in sales this creates the opportunity to create multiple years of sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning our brand related to tires starts to mature keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years so if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires we will not be relevant necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out so so to put that on a timeline that you are looking at three to five years to certainly mature out to average sales performance of a tire brand store okay so just to circle up on that for the stores where you are rebranding there is nothing about their market like you you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand stores of the 1200000 is that correct yeah as a general statement that is correct i think certainly you are going to have markets that will exceed the average and you will have some markets that will be lower than that and that is part of the choices that we that we make using the analytic model but but on average as we look across our i will say the opportunity stores at the end of 555 i think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential of the onetwo over time as they mature thanks switching gears brian how much of a headwind to that revenue from acquisition were the conversions of the 42 california stores this quarter yeah i mean we we had you know some disruption there i would say you know we we have not really quantified that from a from a sales standpoint but you know that is a great point jonathan and that we have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the monro playbook and then shortly thereafter and in this case about six months get the re image in store brand standards in place so those in q three the 42 california stores went through that and there were substantially through that as of the end of q three so we are we have not quantified it but it certainly had some impact on their sales performance in the quarter okay and that 1800000 charge for monro forward initiative this quarter what was that for yeah it was all related to the store rebrand and re image and it falls into three primary buckets related to that the 1st is non capital items that we send to the stores so as we think about updated safety chains updated bay banners updated point of sale marketing materials all of these things to get the store initially to the standard that are not capital in terms of the actual work and construction done on the store that is the 1st bucket the 2nd bucket is non capital work that is actually done we get into these stores and we identify non capital repairs demolition as well as some of the fixed verse replaced items for example stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing a new floor those are things that make sense economically but you get different treatment from expense versus capital for so that is the 2nd bucket and the 3rd is just right off of existing leaseholds in the stores anything from counters to maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition when we initially branded the stores over to a monro brand those are the three primary buckets that that the the monro forward initiative costs consist of okay thanks for your comments thank you excuse me our next question is coming from bret jordan of jefferies please go ahead hey good morning guys morning bret morning bret hey back to slide five i guess if we look at the eighteen growth in rebranded stores if were to look at the comparable growth there you know x the new product lines you are adding how is the service comp against the service comp in those stores are you saying you know a pickup as you change the brand yeah maybe just to clarify though bret i think we are actually not adding any new products to the service menu right right yeah it is just a mix right so we even our service stores they sell tires it is only fifteen of their mix so we are certainly seeing growth more outsized growth in other tire sales and we have had success in maintaining the rate of growth that we have seen on the service side which has been part of our thesis is hold on to the service business that enjoyed it is high margin and then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the the tire category on both sides okay and i guess when we look at the re image how does that compare to you know comparable service stores in the network that had not been re imaged i guess sort of looking at it again sort of apples to apples you know against the old stores yeah i think if if you can figure out what stores we are talking about there the thirty stores are rochester i think yeah the rochester store certainly if they have been performing quite well relative to what our expectations were on re image we certainly did not expect to see double digit growth rates out of the re imaged store we set out to do this initiative but we were seeing a more positive growth out of the stores up until the last quarter given the exposure that we have had to the weather in the north but compared to other stores we are still pleased with what we are seeing from a customer service point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers facing similar i would say market backdrop from a weather point of view okay could you give us i guess sort of the the the spread between the southern store comp and the northern store comp you know how big a delta was it i mean it was it was a couple of 100 basis points of performance okay and i guess for housekeeping could you give us the monthly yeah so we were 12nd here bret we were down onetwo in october down oneseven in november and now zerofour in december okay and then one just this is the sorry add the questions on the supply chain side i mean just to throw the virus into it since that is popular these days you guys do a lot of direct sourcing you know the the white box product out of china do you see any impact on supply chain from what is going on we have not seen any to this point bret we are obviously working through contingency plans which we have had to develop actually related to the the tariff issues so we feel pretty confident that through the network of you know the multiple supply points that we will be able to overcome any particular issues coming from the virus yeah i am sorry bret go ahead i said no i was joking but i had to get mt 1st virus question in there yeah okay yeah all right thanks a lot guys okay thanks bret thanks bret thank you our next question is coming from rick nelson of stevens please go ahead all right thanks good morning like to good morning follow up on whether last year i think december january you also pointed to mild winter weather do you think this year was incrementally worse than than the prior year i think if you look at you know analyst reports that we have seen talking about i guess the impact of the mild winter has had on not only our category but i think other retail i think the data would indicate that this has been more mild certainly versus last year and i think we look at precipitation which was very important for us the form of snow with our entire business certainly it has been a much i think more mild winter this year relative to last year okay thanks and brett any update on your partnership with amazon what you are saying there on the install side and how you think your tire prices compare to theirs in the tire category over overall i am curious about what happened with units in the period and the market share yep so let us start with units well units were down two and average selling price was up one for the for the for the quarter how that compares we do not have a lot you know of syndicated data of course we can look to and give you definitive on that we lean on i guess our channel checks and information from our tire manufacturers that have good visibility across multiple brands and it feels like you know similar to other companies that have exposure to the north in particular northeast but to the degree that we do we feel like we are probably in line with what you know we picked up through suppliers and and others as it relates to amazon i think we are still you know pleased with our relationship with them as well as other online tire retailers we we will eventually expand on the relationship in fy 21 to include all stores we talked about last quarter our priority has been what i mentioned on today is call completing the entire category management pricing tool as well as the labor scheduling tool that are just for our organization i think a higher priority at this stage than expanding but we are committed to expanding that relationship going forward related to tire pricing as you know rick the tire category is very complicated you have you know over 30000 skews that that you need to manage effectively across multiple markets and one of the reasons why we have invested in the tire category management tool is that to do a couple of things one is give us much better visibility into demand dynamics defined by elasticity down to a skew level and by having that visibility it is going to create a much more granular approach that we are going to use for pricing it will allows us to price that the skew level in our industry with the intent theme strike that right balance between driving the right price to drive unit volume while preserving and expanding our entire margins through a right mix at right price i am encouraged we are in pilot form of that now we will be operational by q one of next year fully operational the rollout of that it is pretty small in scale because we control our pricing centrally so a small team of people will be trained up on using that system so between now and q one we will be testing in parallel to make certain we are confident with the results that we are seeing from the setup that that makes sense thanks for the color and good luck thanks rick be safe thank you once again ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask a question please press one on your telephone keypad our next question is coming from stephanie benjamin is of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead hi good morning thank you for the question morning i wanted to go back i know in the prior quarters when you started rolling out some of these story freshers you called out a hit or headwind to comps during that quarter really just from distraction you know it sense as you are in there kind of reworking and revamping the stores i believe you said it was about a seventy basis point hit last quarter did you quantify that this quarter or is there a way for you to kind of break that out or to whether overshadow that yeah i think we said last quarter stephanie that we i mean we walked everyone kind of through the the seven step process and and talked about how we were retooling it to take take a lot of that work or almost all that work off of the store team so we were able to effectively do that in in q three we did not expect that we were going to have to talk about a headwind and we really do not have to in terms of it from disruption related to the story image i think i think the california stores on the west coast maybe saw a little bit more in disruption just because we did put a little bit more on them based on their proximity you know lack of proximity to our our core resources that are doing the re image but for the 74 comp stores those were largely i would say undisrupted great and then just as a followup when we look at the tire category in general what are you seeing from the silver and in the inflationary environment i know it was inflationary earlier this year kind of reviewing how how you thought during the quarter and the expectation going forward as well yes stephanie when you look at go back to one of the things we commented on was just we saw some inflationary pricing on i will say the top end of the product category with more premium brands and the 1st part of the the 2nd quarter we did not see a lot of movement on the on the low end brands if you will opening price point brands we saw that change exiting q two and into q three and i think as you saw on we made the comments in our prepared remarks we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across all all price points relative to that point in q three i think our expectation for q four is pretty stable environment around pricing we do not expect you know meaningful or material changes in the next quarter you know i think we are we are very focused now on now optimizing you know our internal pricing relative to the market leveraging you know the category management price into what we talked about great and then just lastly for me kind of a more high level as you know we think through the strategy to expand your your tire services at some of those the mix changes that your service stores does that just by nature put you a little bit more susceptible to changes in weather on an annual basis you know to your point you said on the call that you know it is the tire category that we are if it is a more mild weather where you do not really see the the the volume during that period so does this mean that you know these conversations going forward whether could have a larger impact or similar to what we saw this year that maybe in prior year so maybe your thoughts on that this high level would be great thanks so much yeah thanks stephanie i think you know strategically i will i will start with this their strategy we like the business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that is focused on tires and full service i think you are not going to see us migrate to a tire only category as a broad sweeping strategy for all the reasons you just mentioned we like diversification in the services we like you know being very relevant on frequently purchased items like scheduled maintenance for cars and and certainly breaks another under car services i think as we increase our total business certainly we were going to pick up a little more exposure to tires as we convert more stores in the north i think do that however i think our broader company strategy is diversify our store footprint more into the south and out west and certainly in those regions of the country you do not see i think the level of volatility that comes with the tire business like you would find in in the northeast and midwestern markets great that is everything for me i appreciate it okay thanks stephanie thank you our next question is coming from scott stember of c l king please go ahead good morning and thanks for taking my questions good morning scott following up on that last question about you know high level about weather and i know the goal here was with all this heavy lifting that you are doing right now and all these new processes to get to the point where i guess we are not talking about weather having a work weather does not really dwell the quarter from a comp perspective could you talk about i mean just broadly speaking about how long do you think that will take for us to get to that point where weather could be a headwind but it is not going to be a determinant whether you are positive or negative from comp standpoint yeah i think you know given our our exposure to the northeast and as long as our store concentration is heavy in the midwest and northeast inherent in that is we pick up exposure i think to to the weather obviously we do not like to talk about this as you said our strategy is to diversify the footprint keep continuing to grow down south and that is reflected by our acquisitions we continue to build out florida and we have expanded now into louisiana and in tennessee and certainly out west is reflective of that desire to create more or less volatile volatility in our business due to the store store footprint now in our gore store markets we do not accept internally you know the volatility in our business and and we are we are invested in technology as we talked about to help us better execute in stores through better trained people executing better on the phones with our our phone upgrade that we are currently doing all of the initiatives under monroe forward are designed to drive performance in our stores regardless of weather that i think will help neutralize some of the impact that we see from from the volatility that comes with snow and colder temperatures got it and just a last question i know that there are certain things like tires that we will see an immediate impact from from weather but more on the side of mechanical parts typically you could see an impact from you know warmer weather or cold weather you know a few quarters down the road is there a chance that we could see an extended negative impact on the mechanical parts side in the next couple of quarters and that is all i have thanks yeah thanks scott i think as we commented in the quarter our breaks were down three in the quarter certainly we are up against strong comp from last year but also i would say we do sell a fair share of brake services through tires because if you take the consumers tires off their vehicle it gives you the chance to inspect their wheels their brakes and we do see some nice demand for conversion from tires in the breaks as a result of that as it relates to the downstream effect i think certainly more harsh winters have a tendency to tear up things on the vehicles however i will say one benefit of having a more mild winter is usually that leads to spring coming sooner that opens up a window i think for an extended spring selling season so look we are we felt feel like we are well positioned i think coming out of the winter given our strength and how we performed historically in the service categories and given the the emphasis that we have placed on good better best packages in store i think we feel confident that we will we will be well positioned going into the spring selling season got it that is all i have thanks thanks scott thank you at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest and support in monro we believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy and drive long term value for our shareholders we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter have a great day ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation

bret ponton bret thank you morning everyone thanks for joining us i will get started today with a brief overview of our 3rd quarter results followed by an update on the progress we have made on our monro forward strategy as illustrated on slide three overall copps down zeronine in the 3rd quarter as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic in october and the beginning of november we performed well against difficult comparisons in the prior year mild weather conditions towards the end of november and in december caused a slowdown across our core northern markets these conditions have continued into january with our comparable store sales down four during the month however it is impossible to ignore the impact it has on our business while we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter we are executing well against the areas within our control in particular we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and our confidence we are on the right path we are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to deliver strong results no matter moving on to our performance by category in the 3rd quarter we were down one year over year in tire comparable store sales as higher ticket year over year was offset by a decline in tire volume we experienced more normalized retail pricing in this quarter and are focused on further refining our tire strategy to drive strength in our largest category importantly we are on track to roll out our tire category management beginning in the 1st quarter of fiscal 2022 which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated approach to real time pricing i will provide more details on this shortly turning to our service and repair categories we saw a three decline in brakes year over year falling short of a difficult comparison in the 3rd quarter last year in maintenance we were flat while front end shocks were down one and alignments declined three year over year overall our service and repair business was down two year over year our southern markets outperformed our northern markets as expected given the mild winter weather conditions we faced in this region new stores added 22700000 in revenue during the quarter including 20700000 from recent acquisitions regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter we saw a decline of twenty basis points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store sales which resulted in higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales our variable margin on the other hand expanded due to lower year over year material costs as a percentage of sales while slightly higher than the prior year quarter technician labor as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter this is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control we identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective actions to drive improved results we will have additional opportunities to improve our performance continue to improve results in this area as we implement our cloud based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust the changes in demand demand dynamics without sacrificing sales i would now like to turn to the progress we have made in our memorial forward strategy beginning with our store rebrand and reimage initiative on slide four this initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing standardized in store operating procedures which we call our monroe playbook additionally we are rebranding select stores to a tire oriented banner where targeted demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing service revenues during the 1st half of fiscal 2020 we finalized the transformations of our 1st group of stores which includes 44 locations in rochester new york we have completed the transformation of the 74 stores and has substantially completed our california stores which are being rebranded under our tire choice auto service centers banner turning to slide five i would like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic rationale as we transform our store base as many of you know we operate in two store formats our service brand stores which generate approximately $600000 per store in annualized sales and our tire brand stores which generate approximately 1200000 per store in annualized sales prior to any rebrand activity we operated 500 stores we are prioritizing the higher volume tire brands throughout this process we will be consolidating our regional brands focusing on shifting our service brands over to tire brands the lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity when we speak to re imaging stores this primarily means modernizing the appearance of our stores with no associated brand change as we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re imaging stores we are leveraging our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market looking at the bottom left of the slide you can see here the progress we have made so far we are very much in the early innings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially completed out of our portfolio we separate these stores out between our legacy stores and our new stores of our approximately 900 comp stores that we set out to transform we have completed 114 stores and of our approximately 100 non comp stores we have substantially completed 69 as we move forward with expanding this program across our base we will continue to prioritize markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and our approach is to in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum through the end of this fiscal year we are focusing on finalizing the transformation of our recently acquired california stores while starting the transformation of approximately eighty more stores that will be completed in q one of fy 21 moving on to the performance of the stores we have completed so far to help provide some additional granularity we separated out how rebranded stores have performed versus the stores that have just joined us this slide will be updated as more stores are rebranded and reimage importantly this data only includes comp stores that have had a full quarter of performance following the completion of their transformation this is how we will speak to this performance excuse me of our transformed stores moving forward as you can see in in line with our expectations we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand stores this ship optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire share the stores that have been reimagined were slightly down as these are located in our northern markets which were impacted by the mild weather conditions i mentioned earlier we believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits to come with a streamlined brand portfolio the 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation given they have not had a full quarter post transform but we are still seeing early signs of strength at these stores and are pleased with the results while we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base the sustained performance we have seen at the stores that have completed the transformation to date underscores the impact of this important initiative turning to slide six and the remainder of our monro forward initiatives i would like to focus my discussion on the initiatives that are our top priority we believe will be critical to supporting our broader strategy in the 3rd quarter we began modernizing our store it infrastructure at all of our approximately 1300 locations this new infrastructure enables state of the art technology including our new digital phone and texting system which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience this system will allow us to better track customer execution driving a more consistent phone strategy our store infrastructure modernization will be completed by the end of the 1st quarter of fiscal 2022 allowing us to leverage our new phone system which will be critical to driving traffic to our stores another priority for us is the optimization of our tire category management we are on track and by the end of this fiscal year we expect our new pricing software will be operational we believe this will be critical to driving long term margin expansion by providing improved visibility into demand dynamics allowing us to better refine our assortment and execute our strategy to become the number one destination for tires at any price point finally we are right on track to roll out our cloud based store scheduling model pilot by year end gaining real time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective and strategic ensuring we are not understaffed than losing sales or overstaffed when there is a lack of labor regarding our other team mate initiatives we have rolled out the monroeville university program to all of our teammates and we continue to expand and enhance the course content we have also implemented mandatory on board training to ensure that everyone who joins our team is trained on our monroeville playbook operating procedures in order to provide a quality five star experience to our customers moving on to slide seven while we are very focused on the rollout of monroeville forward acquisition remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy during the quarter we closed the previously announced acquisitions of three companies one with fourteen locations in las vegas nevada and four in boise idaho as well as two companies that include nine stores in northern california further solidifying our growing position in the western united states our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts as well as benefit from the high concentration of vehicles in this market and a potential the acquisition in nevada and idaho which are new states to monro is expected to add approximately 20000000 in annualized sales represented sales mix of 75 service and 25 tires the acquisitions in california are expected to add approximately 25000000 in annualized sales represented sales mix of 55 service and 45 tires these acquisitions are expected to be dilutive to overall acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected 120000000 in annualized sales we operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive mna targets we currently have over ten mdas signed with opportunities we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively and efficiently lastly we opened one greenfield location during 3rd quarter bringing our total to 55 stores which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions further by continuing to execute our monro forward initiatives including our new brand standards and operating procedures we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively and efficiently lastly we opened one greenfield location during 3rd quarter bringing our total to 55 stores which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions we are opening greenfield stores on july seven in fiscal 2020 in conclusion we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in our business we are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in a platform capable of delivering sustainable long term growth we are not there yet nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the transformation but we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business i would like to thank the entire team at monro for their exceptional work as we execute this strategy as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support with that i will turn the call over to our executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer brian d ambrose who will provide additional details on our 3rd quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook good morning everyone turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter sales increased sixtwo year over year to $329300000 driven by sales from new stores of $22700000 including $20700000 from recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately $800000 same store sales in the quarter were down nine year over year 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days in line with the previous year period gross margin decreased twenty basis points to 37eight in the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 from 38 in the prior year period this decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales however as brett mentioned we are actively working to address these issues and are confident in our ability to drive improvement in our operating margin going forward we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material costs as a percentage of sales operating expenses for the quarter increased $5500000 to $92800000 or 28two of sales as compared with $87300000 or 28 one of sales for the prior year period the year over year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net new stores 3rd quarter was $31600000 which increased by twoeight as compared to operating income of $30700000 for the same quarter last year and decreased as a percentage of sales from ninenine to ninesix not interest expense for the 3rd quarter increased $200000 to $7000000 as compared to $6800000 in the same period last year the weighted average debt outstanding for the 3rd quarter was $zero 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by approximately $120000000 as compared to the prior year period the increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease debt recorded in connection with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions and greenfield expansion as well as an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisitions the weighted average interest rate for the 3rd quarter decreased by approximately 140 basis points our effective tax rate was 24 one for the 3rd quarter compared to fifteenthree for the same period last year the year over year increase is primarily due to a one time income tax benefit adjustment we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change which was related to certain deductions that the irs allowed during the examination of our fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 tax returns net income for the 3rd quarter was $18900000 compared to $20500000 in the prior year period diluted earnings per share for the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 were ¢56 compared to diluted earnings per share of ¢61 in the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share which is a non gaap measure was ¢35 for the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2020 with ¢sixty which excludes from diluted earnings per share ¢three of costs related to monroe forward initiatives and one of costs related to acquisition due diligence and integration this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of ¢57 in the 3rd quarter of fiscal 2019 which excluded one of costs related to monroe forward initiatives one of non recurring corporate and field management realignment costs ¢six benefit from the one time income tax adjustment for more information on this non gap measure please see the reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release lastly we opened one greenfield location during the 3rd quarter as a reminder greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition of one to four store operations greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately $1000000 each as of december 282019 the company had 1289 company operated stores and 99 franchise locations as compared with 1186 company operated stores and 99 franchise locations as of december 292018 during the 3rd quarter we had a 27 company operated stores and closed none turning to slide nine we continue to maintain our our our approach to capital allocation as we execute our growth strategy our capital expenditures were $42200000 in the 1st nine months of fiscal 2020 of which approximately $18000000 was related to investments in our monro forward initiative we are pleased with the progress of our monro forward strategy and we continue to expect an incremental $75000000 in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years to support investments additionally a creative acquisition support our or our growth strategy during the 1st nine months of the year we spent approximately $104000000 on acquisitions including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our greenfield expansion strategy as brett mentioned acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected $120000000 in annualized ifrs revenue i would like to provide some additional clarity here the $120000000 in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been fully integrated which as we have stated in the past is usually in year three post acquisition during years one and two following the acquisition we typically see a step down in sales given the process of onboarding new stores to our model moving on we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend program and paid approximately $22000000 in dividends in the 1st nine months of fiscal 2020 finally we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility to support our strategic growth initiatives we entered the 3rd quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial covenants we generated approximately $125000000 of cash flow from operating activities during the 1st nine months of fiscal 2020 and debt under our revolving credit facility and now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide ten we have updated our fiscal 2020 comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of one to flat to reflect the impact of our year to date performance based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently closed acquisitions we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1270000000 $1000000000 to $290000000 an increase of sixtwo to sevenfive is compared to fiscal 2019 sales this compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1000000000 to $1315000000 our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal 2020 given the impact of our year to date performance we expect fiscal sales to be in the range of $1000000000 to $1315000000 this compares to the previous guidance of $two45 to $two55 on an adjusted basis which is a non get measure the company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $two25 to $two35 year over year compared to $two37 in fiscal 2019 representing a decline of oneseven to growth of twofive which excludes from diluted earnings per share monroe ford initiative costs and acquisition due diligence and integration costs this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $two39 in fiscal 2019 which excluded monroe ford initiative costs non recurring corporate and field management realignment costs acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be dilutive to earnings per diluted share during the year at the midpoint of our guidance range we expect an operating margin of approximately tentwo interest expense to be approximately $29000000 depreciation and amortization to be approximately $65000000 and ebida to be approximately $199000000 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60000000 this year this guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23five and is based on 34000000 diluted weighted average shares outstanding as always our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or greenfield store openings i will now turn the call over to brent to provide some closing remarks before we move to q a thanks brian we are making solid strides in the execution of our monetization program energy in particular our store rebrand and reimage initiative the strong results with the locations that have completed this transformation underscore our confidence in this initiative the store rebrand and reimage program is further supported by our technological investments which we believe will help drive long term margin expansion in summary we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control we are excited hello and welcome to our conference call for the future and look forward to capitalizing on any attractive opportunities ahead with that i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handheld set before the question is answered thank you good morning everyone our 1st question is coming from brian nagel of oppenheimer please go ahead yeah i will take the 1st part and i will let brian take the 2nd part of the question brian when we look at the performance and the weather affected fiscal q three as we talked about our northern markets certainly underperform the southern markets and give you a little more granularity on that certainly our stores up in the northeast and the midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure to weather conditions like you have in the northeast certainly underperform expectations would have been closer to +one to +onefive assuming normalized weather conditions that we have seen in the past we felt really good coming out of october and november given the strength of last year is performance that we were comping against and and did not get the cooperation from the weather in december that we were certainly expecting as i made the comments in my prepared remarks we certainly do not like talking about the weather brian but we can not ignore the fact that when fifty of our business is tires and we have a high concentration of stores in the northeast and midwest we are going to have outsized exposure to our our  cop performance so in january you were did i think a four and if i am doing the math it looks as though that the adjusted guidance would suggest some type of pickup then in business and in february march so i guess the 1st question is is that assumption correct and then the following on question is yeah i know we have seen this before with your business but you know at what point does conclude we still have a long we have a potentially a long time in the winter the weather could still come but is there a point at which in in in the quarter where the the weather just comes too late yeah so so brian your assumption is correct regarding the regarding the implied coms so if if you think about q four at the midpoint of let us say down five for the full year down five that implies q four of down two which would be about february and march being down one in order to get to that down two so that that is the dynamic at the midpoint so there is an expectation of a of a pickup in february and march and brian maybe just to comment on the 2nd part you know as we get deeper into the 4th quarter or 4th quarter the 2nd half of the quarter in particular i think we become less sensitive to the weather as you transition out of say pure winter conditions into spring certainly i think you know the later in the quarter you get snowfall certainly does not have the same impact on the other thing to call out as well as you look at our historic performance at the company december and january have always been the most volatile volatile months that we have i can not compete with and i think what we have seen in fast performance here friends coming out of december january do not necessarily reflect what you see in the spring months so given the the mild december january heading into the balance of the quarter we feel pretty good about the guidance range we provided as brian said our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our comp sales guidance it assumes run rate coming out of january which we certainly believe we are going to be thanks i appreciate all the color thanks brent looking at your slide on store rebranding the eighteen performance of the rebranded stores i think it is good i am curious from your analytic model how many years should it take for a rebranded store to reach projected run rate sales we have seen i will call it double digit comp improvement off of that base you can get to implied numbers certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp to  the full maturity equaling the average sales performance of our entire brand at stores and that is one thing that is encouraging about the strategy for us is not that it is just a one time step up in sales this creates the opportunity to create multiple years of growth so sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning our brand related to tires starts to mature keep in mind the entire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years so if we rebrand right before a consumer makes that decision to buy tires we will not be relevant necessarily that consumer for two to three years out so so to put that on a timeline i think you are looking at three to five years to certainly mature out to average sales per month ok so just to circle up on that for the stores where you are rebranding there is nothing about their market like you you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand stores at the 1200000 is that correct yeah as a general statement that is correct i think certainly you are going to have markets that will exceed the average you know and you will have some markets that will be lower than that and that is part of the choices that we that we make using the analytic model but but on average as we look across our i will say the opportunity stores that be in the 505 i think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential of the onetwo over time as they mature yeah i mean we we had you know some disruption there i would say you know we we have not really quantified that from  from a sales standpoint but you know that is a great point jonathan in that we have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the munroe playbook and then shortly thereafter in in this case about six months we have opened all of those stores and  get the the reimage in store brand standards in place so those in q three the 42 california stores went through that and they are substantially through that as of the end of q three but we are we have not quantified it but it it certainly had some impact on their sales performance in the quarter but four yes it was all related to the store rebrand and reimage and it falls into three primary buckets related to that the 1st is non capital items that we send to the stores so as we think about updated safety chains updated bay banners updated point of sale marketing materials all of these things to get the store initially to the standard that are not capital in terms of the actual work and construction done on the store that is the 1st bucket the 2nd bucket is non capital work that is actually done we get into these stores and we identify non capital repairs demolition as well as some of the fixed versus replace items for example stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing a new floor those are the type of things that we look at things that make sense economically but you get different treatment from expense versus capital four so that is the 2nd bucket and the 3rd is just right off of existing leaseholds in the stores anything from counters to maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition when we initially branded the stores over to a monro brand those are the three primary buckets that that the the monro forward initiative costs consist of ok thanks for your comment thank you and excuse me our next question is coming from brette jordan of jeffries please go ahead yeah maybe just to clarify though brad i think we are actually not adding any new products to the service menu right but but you are hired up at the store right yeah it is just mixed right so even our service stores today they sell tires it is only fifteen of their mix so we are certainly seeing growth more outsize growth in other tire sales and we have had success in maintaining the rate of growth that we have seen on the service side which has been pretty consistent my thesis is hold on to the service business that we have enjoyed that is high margin and then add to that more relevance to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the tire category we are seeing growth on both sides okay and i guess we look at the reimage how does that compare to you know comparable service stores in the network that had not been reimagined i guess sort of looking at it again sort of apples to apples you know against the old stores yeah i think if  like you can figure out which stores we are talking about there are the thirty stores of rochester i think yeah the rochester stores certainly  they have been performing quite well relative to what our expectations were on reimage and we certainly did not expect to see double digit growth rates out of a reimage store when we set out to do this initiative but we were seeing more positive growth out of those stores up until the last quarter given the exposure that we have had to the weather in the north bucket bear to other stores we are still pleased with what we are seeing from a customer service point of view and from a cop sales point of view relative to their fears facing similar i would say market backdrop from a weather point of view okay could you give us i guess sort of the the dip the spread between the southern store cop and the northern store cop you know how big was delta was it i mean it was a couple 100 basis points of performance okay and i guess for housekeeping could you give us the monthly you know the the white box product out of china do you see any impact on supply chain from what is going on we have not seen any to this point brett we are obviously working through contingency plans which we have had to develop actually related to the the tariff issues so we feel pretty confident that through the network of yeah multiple supply points that we will be able to overcome any particular issues coming from the virus i said no i was joking i had to get my 1st virus question in there yeah i said no i was joking i had to get my 1st virus question in there alright thanks a lot guys super nice okay thanks a lot bro thank you our next question is coming from rick nelson of stevens please go ahead january you also pointed to mild winter weather do you think this year was incrementally worse than the prior year i think if you look at you know analyst reports that we have seen talking about i guess the impact that the mild winter has had on not only our category but but i think other retail like the data would indicate that this has been then more mild certainly versus prior years last year and i think we look at precipitation which is very important for us the form of snow with our tire business certainly it has been a much more mild  winter this year relative to last year thanks and brett any updates on your partnership with amazon what you are seeing there on the install side and how you think your tire prices are and compared to there and the entire category overall i am curious about what happened with units in the period and market check yes so let us start with units our units were down to average selling price was up  one for the for the quarter how that compares we do not have a lot of syndicated data course we can look to and give you definitive on that we lead on i guess our channel checks and information from our tire manufacturers that have good visibility across multiple brands and feels like similar to other companies that have  exposure to the north particularly northeastern to the degree that we do we feel like we are probably in line with what and we picked up through suppliers and and others as relates to amazon i think we are still and pleased with our relationship with them as well as other online tire retailers we yeah we will eventually expand the relationship in fyi 21 to include all stores we talked about last quarter or priority has been what i mentioned on today s call completing the tire category management pricing tool as well as the labor scheduling tool just for our organization on a higher priority at this stage than expanding but we are committed to expanding that relationship going forward our related to tire pricing as you know rick and the tire category is very complicated yeah you know over 30000 skews that you need to manage effectively across multiple markets and one of the reasons why we have invested in the tire category management tool is to to do a couple of things one is give us much better visibility into demand dynamics defined by elasticity down to a sku level and by having that visibility it is going to create a much more granular approach that we are going to use for pricing it allows us to price at the school level in our industry with the intent being to strike that right balance between driving the right price to drive unit volume while preserving and expanding our entire tire margins through right mix at right price i am encouraged we are in pilot form of that now we will be that is pretty small in scale because we control our operations centrally so a small team of people will be trained up on using that system so between now and q one will be testing in parallel and make sure we are more confident with the results that we are seeing from the system that makes sense thanks for the call good luck ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad our next question is coming from stephanie benjamin of suntrust robert humphries please go ahead hi good morning thank you for the question morning i wanted to go back i know in the prior quarters when you started rolling out some of these story refreshes you called out a hit or head when two comp during that quarter really just from distractions you know what makes sense as you are in there kind of reworking and revamping i believe you said it was about a seventy basis point hit last quarter do you quantify that this quarter or is there a way for you to kind of break that out or did weather overshadow that do that in in q three we did not expect that we were going to have to talk about a headwind and we really do not have to in terms of it from disruption related to the store reimage i think i think the the california stores and on the west coast maybe saw a little bit more in disruption just because we did put a little bit more on them based on their proximity you know lack of proximity to our our core resources that are doing the reimage but for the 74 comp stores those were largely i would say undisturbed great and then just as a follow up when we look at the tire category in general what are you seeing from this over in an inflationary environment i know it was inflationary earlier this year i am kind of reviewing how how you saw it during the quarter and your expectations going forward as well the top end of the product category with more premium brands and the 1st part of the the 2nd quarter we did not see a lot of movement on the the low end brands if you will opening price point brands we saw that change exiting q two and into q three and i think as you saw and we have made the comments and our prepared remarks we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across all all price points relative to that point in q three i think our expectation for q four is pretty stable environment around pricing we do not expect you know meaningful material changes in the next quarter yeah i think we are we are very focused now on now optimizing you know our internal pricing relative to the market leveraging you know the category management pricing tool we we talked about great and then just lastly for me kind of a more high level you know we think through the strategy to expand your your tire services at some of those the mixed changes that your service stores does that just by nature put you a little bit more susceptible to changes in weather on an annual basis you know to your point you said on the call that you know it is the tire category that if it is a more mild weather where you do not really see the the volume during that period so does this mean that you know and these conversations going forward weather could have  a larger impact similar to what we saw this year that may be in prior years so maybe your thoughts on that just high level would be great thanks so much yeah thanks evanie i think strategically i would i would start with this they are strategy of meroz we like the business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that is focused on tires and full service i think you are not going to see us migrate to a tire only category as a broad sweeping strategy for all the reasons you just mentioned now we like the business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that is focused on tires and full service i think as we increase our total business certainly we are going to pick up a little more exposure to tires as we convert more stores in the north i think through that however i think our broader company strategy is to diversify our store port front more into the south and out west and certainly in those regions of the country you do not see i think the level of volatility that comes with the tire business like you would find in the northeast and midwestern markets the speech is of a man speaking in a southern accent over the phone he is asking questions and making statements the topic of conversation is about the weather and heavy lifting the man mentions that he is not talking about the weather but rather the processes being used he asks if the speaker could talk about how long they think that will take i think for us to get to that point where weather could be a headwind but it is not going to be a determine whether you are positive or negative from a contest standpoint yeah i think given our our exposure to the northeast and as long as our store concentration is heavy in the midwest and northeast inherent in that is as we pick up exposure i think to weather obviously we do not like to talk about it scott as you said our strategy is diversify the footprints zero and our strategy is diversify the footprints continuing to grow down south and that is reflected by our acquisitions we continue to build out florida and have expanded now into louisiana and tennessee and certainly out west is reflected by that desire to create more or less volatility in our business due to the store store footprint now in our core store markets we do not accept internally you know the volatility in our business and and we are invested in technology as we talked about to help us better execute in stores through better trained people executing better on the phones with our our phone upgrade that we are currently currently doing all of the initiatives under monroeforward are designed to drive performance in our stores regardless of weather i think will help neutralize some of the impact that we see from from the volatility that comes with the snow and colder temperatures yeah i know that there were certain things like tires that that will see an immediate impact from from weather but more on the side of of mechanical parts typically you could see an impact from you know warmer weather or colder weather you know a few quarters down the road is there a chance that we could see an extended negative impact on the mechanical parts side in the next couple of quarters and that is all i have thanks thanks scott we commented in the quarter that our brakes were down three in the quarter certainly we are up against strong comp from last year but also i would say that we do sell a fair share of  brake services through tires because as you take the consumer is tires off their vehicle gives you the chance to inspect  their wheels their brakes and  we do see some nice demand for conversion from tires into brakes as a result of that as relates to the downstream effect i think  however i will say one benefit of having a more mild winter is usually that leads to spring coming sooner now that opens up a window i think for an expanded spring selling season so look we feel feel like we are well positioned i think coming out of the winter given our strength and how we performed historically in the service categories and given the the emphasis i placed on good better best packages in store i think we feel confident that we will we will be well positioned going into the spring selling season got it that is all i have thanks thanks scott scott thank you thank you at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter have a great day ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation this concludes today is event you may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day",

            "reference": "token good morning and welcome to q three 2020 conocophillips earnings conference call my name is sinara and i will be the operator for today is call at this time all participants are on a listen only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session during the question and answer session if you have a question please press star then one on your touch tone phone please note this conference is being recorded i will now turn the call over to ms ellen desanctis ms denc desanctis you many begin thanks sinara hello and welcome this morning to our listeners i will 1st introduce the members of the conocophillips executive team who are on today is call we have ryan lance our chairman and ceo matt fox our evp and chief operating officer bill bullock our executive vice president and chief financial officer we have dominic macklon our senior vice president of strategy exploration and technology and nick olds our senior vice president of global operation ryan will open this morning with some prepared remarks and then the team will take your questions before i turn the call over to ryan a few reminders in conjunction with this morning is press release we posted a short deck of supplemental material regarding the quarter onto our website that is available for your access next we will make some forward looking statements this morning based on current expectations as well statements about the proposed business combination announced last week between conocophillips and concho a description of the r risks associated with forward looking statements and other important information about the proposed transaction can be found in today is press release all of which are incorporated by reference for purposed of this call we will also refer to some non gap financial measures today and reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gap measure can be found in this morning is press release and also on our website thank you and now i will turn the call over to ryan thank you ellen and good morning to our listeners before we get into our 3rd quarter results i will take a few minutes to address last week is announcement of our combination with concho resources we spent a lot of time talking to the market over the past several days and i am pleased to say that the feedback has been positive by the way earlier this week we added some annotations to our transaction deck for clarification today is call is a great opportunity to reflect on our conversations and reiterate the compelling merits of the transaction for both sets of shareholders i will start at the highest level our announced transaction with concho combines two widely recognized leaders in the sector conocophillips has been a recognized leader in the returns on and returns of capital model for the business and concho has been a recognized leader in the permian pure play class yep while we are both best in class companies on a stand alone basis by scaling up our existing returns focused business model we are stronger and more investable within the sector characterized by frequent price cycles industry maturity capital intensity and esg focus we will be a nearly $60000000000 enterprise that is uniquely positioned to create sustained value by embracing what we believe are the three essential future mandates for our sector and these mandates are 1st providing affordable energy to the world 2nd committed to esg excellence and 3rd delivering competitive returns we believe the transaction accelerates our ability to successfully and simultaneously deliver on all three of these mandates that is how we will win now let me take these mandates one by one in the context of our transaction in all future energy scenarios we know the world will need hydrocarbons as part of the energy mix for a long time even as we see increasing adoption of low carbon energy sources however we also recognize that the energy transition means the winners will be those companies with resources that can be affordably developed in a transition in any transition scenario including a less than two degrees scenario that is the reason we have always been committed to having the lowest cost of supply resource base in the industry the company will have a 23 day resource base for the cost of supply less than $forty a barrel concho gets the benefits of our global diverse and lower capital intensity portfolio attributes conocophillips gets the benefits of adding some of the best resources in the world and by the way we have studied rock quality everywhere now let us move on to the next mandate a commitment to esg excellence in conjunction with last week is transaction we announced we are adopting a paris aligned climate risk framework we are the 1st u s based oil and gas company to do so our framework includes specific emissions intensity reduction goals a commitment to no routine flaring permanently installed methane monitoring and advocating for a well designed carbon price in the u s and this framework is inservice to our ambition to reach a net zero operational emissions target by 205 now we have been asked at our engagement meetings if this framework included the portfolio facts of the concho assets the explicit answer is no we were preparing to issue our new climate risk framework before the transaction was agreed however we see the addition of concho is assets as being consistent with and equative to these goals the production emission of the u s unconventionals are among the lowest ghg intensity assets in the world so the addition of these resources will be a benefit to our projections plans and targets now the 3rd mandate delivering competitive returns is an imperative for attracting and retaining investors to the sector our company has been all about returns and that will not change in fact the combined company will be uniquely positioned to deliver on the proven returns focused value proposition we know investors want from our sector because there is several advantage attributes and demonstrated priorities for example as i just described the transaction creates a massive resilient low cost of supply resource base i discussed this as part of mandate one but i will also add that low cost of supply is the best assurance by definition for delivering competitive financial returns through price cycles after the deal closes we will publish our combined cost of supply curve i have no doubt it will be best in class by the way we have been asked about how we view risk in the event of a change in leadership in washington our view is that while it might create some headwinds for the industry our company is global diversification and our mix of private state and federal leases in the u s assures that we are competitively positioned for that outcome and we accounted for this potential risk in our evaluation of the overall transaction diversification and low capital intensity matters and as i just mentioned we preserve those portfolio characteristics adding concho is unconventional assets into our portfolio will not make a material difference to our base decline rate that means we retain our diversification and low capital intensity advantage for the benefit of both shareholders we will apply our disciplined consistent approach to future investment programs capital will be allocated 1st on a basis of cost of supply and then based on secondary criteria such as flexibility capital intensity asset optimization affordability and free cash flow generation and our expanded permian program resulting from the transaction will be integrated within the total company plan to optimize overall outcomes and value the combination creates greater visibility on earnings expansion and free cashflow generation factoring in our announced 500000000 targeted cost and capital savings the transaction is lucrative on all key consensus financial metrics including earnings free cashflow and free cashflow yield finally our strong balance sheet plus free cashflow generation means we are even better positioned to give investors what they want from this business returns of capital the transaction enhances our ability to meet our stated targets of returning more than thirty of our cfo to our owners annually and this target is not an ambition it is what we have been doing for the past four years in fact we returned over forty of our cfo to owners over that period and it will remain a key part of our future offering the bottom line this transaction creates a best in class competitor scaled to thrive in a new energy future that is compelling for shareholders for both companies now a few comments on what to expect next our s four filing should be filed in the next couple of weeks you may expect the transaction to close in the 1st quarter of 202 integration planning is already underway dominic macklon will lead the effort for conocophillips and will giraud will lead the effort for concho both sides are excited and committed to a very successful integration as part of the integration planning we will begin to evaluate how best to optimize our future investment programs we would expect to announce pro forma capex for next year shortly after closing but directionally on a stand alone conocophillips basis we remain cautious on the pace and timing of recovery so as a place to start we are currently thinking we enter 2021 capex at a level that is roughly similar to this year is capital meaning little to no production growth on a stand alone basis of course we retain the flexibility to adjust as the year progresses we have the capital flexibility the balance sheet and the cash on hand to respond as necessary to changes in the macro while meeting our capital return priority and that brings me to a few comments on the 3rd quarter results it is certainly been a year for the business as we all know the company took some significant actions to respond to the downturn including production curtailments and over the past couple of quarters we also carried out our major seasonal turnarounds so a bit of noise in the 2nd quarter and 3rd quarter numbers but by the end of the 3rd quarter the curtailment program was behind us the seasonal turnarounds were complete and the underlying business was running very well as you saw in this morning is release 3rd quarter results were in alignment with expectations we have reinstated guidance that you should think of and you should take the 4th quarter as the new baseline for 21 capital and production though as i just mentioned that is subject to ongoing monitoring and market conditions we look forward to keeping you updated on integration progress and our future plans for the business and finally we hope everyone is safe and well and now i will turn it over to the operator for q a thank you we will now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press star then one on your touch tone phone if you are using a speakerphone you may need to pick up the handset 1st before pressing the numbers once again if you have a question please press then one on your touch tone phone waiting on standby for any questions and our 1st question comes from phil gresh from jp morgan please go ahead your line is open yes hello 1st question just wanted to ask about the quarter here it looks like there is some moving pieces around cash flows affiliate distributions and some other factors there so i was wondering if you could give a little bit more color there and help us think about how you would define a the clean cfo in the quarter yeah thanks phil i will let bill bill bullock can answer that for you thanks hi phil so yeah for the for the quarter cash from operations x working capital was about 1000000000 230000000 and we had a couple of one time benefits i in the quarter a a legal settlement and an audit settlement totalling 130000000 of that but we also had curtailments in the quarter of about 90000 barrels a day so the foregone cash flow for that would have been about $150000000 of cash so if you think of a a a clean run rate number for the for the quarter a good place to be thinking is about 1000000000 250000000 for the quarter now you you asked about equity distributions we did not have a distribution from aplng in the quarter we received distributions in through the 2nd quarter of about 500000000 from aplng and for the remainder of the year we are expecting a little under 200000000 in the 4th quarter that would give a full year distribution of somewhere around 680 700000000 for the year okay great very helpful i guess this kinda delv delves into my 2nd question which is you know we continue to get some questions here around this pro forma cfo guidance that you provided and so if i look at the res results you have just talked about the one25 and what concho reported the other night which i think ex hedges is around fifty perhaps you could help us bridge these results which i think are about $41 wti to to the 7000000000 $forty wti guidance that you provided yeah thanks phil i know there is a a number of moving parts there as you described and yeah we have had a few people point out that they thought the 7000000000 at $forty a barrel for the combined company looked a a little bit light so now that we have seen the 3rd quarter if you adjust for concho is hedging and what bill just described on our equity affiliates i think you get something closer to mid to high 7s you know at at $forty so maybe i will i will matt add a little bit of color to those details yeah the the if you if you look at the clean 3rd quarter and the for for both companies bill explained the the errors that we comply somewhere between sevenfive and seveneight at $forty a barrel now that the range is basically the based on the uncertainty in the equity affiliates distribution if you go similar distributions to eh eh this year we will be the top end in that range and these these these numbers also include the pro forma assumption that we get a full year of expected cost saving and that we are now 150000000 of cash and that is what shows up in these numbers is also the 150000000 of capital that does not does not affect cfo directly does that does that help phil i will take that as a yes i hope so thank you our next question comes from doug terreson from evercore isi please go ahead your line is open good morning everybody morning doug w one of the the hallmarks ryan of conoco and phillips before the merger and even after the split in 2012 has been incorporate agility is the way i would like to think about it and the ability to create value and strategic transactions over the near and medium term periods and on this point while you guys have been pretty clear about the operating and capital cost benefits that you are going to get as well as some of the enhancements that you are going to get form a higher quality investment portfolio my my question is whether there are areas that you are optimistic about that may or may not be as obvious to stand and deliver further upside areas that you are confident about similar to situations that you had in the past with other transactions and then 2nd what are the two to three most important things that you think that the new management group brings to the organization so two questions yeah thanks doug i will maybe start to let dominic add a few few comments you know when we put out the synergy number we we see a lot of other synergy numbers that people put out there and it seems like a fair amount of arm waving we want to be pretty specific about the $500000000 that that we describe but i if you are the 2nd page which i think is what you are alluding to a little bit then i can let dominic add on is we yeah we fully expect that we are going to get additional opportunity either through price uplift or various other forms to add add add incremental value to this transaction dominic maybe you could describe a little bit of what the integration team is going to be looking at yeah thanks thanks ryan and doug thanks for the question you know actually we are very focused on delivering the 500000000 that we have put out there as a commitment but certainly we see opportunity beyond that i think we can outline those in our in our in our deck i think just to talk more about those specifically i think the ones that we are most optimistic about you know on the marketing side concho typically sells product to the wellhead we sell further down the value chain to improve realization so you know we have a very strong commercial group at conocophillips so we are certainly exited about about that you know concho have been doing extremely well in the permian on the delaying completion costs the performance has been excellence and they are further down thee learning curve than us there so we do expect to see that accelerate you know the performance on on our acreage too and of course we expect to you know improve performance across the lower 48 from sharing best practices and technologies between eagle ford and the permian and the bakken and son on so definitely operational efficiencies and then on the supply chain side obviously we are going to have increased purchasing power scale flexibility so we are anticipating you know upside in all these areas and and some additional areas too that that w w w we will be working on in the in the coming months here so will and i are already talking about these we are pretty excited about it and we will be look forward to see how these develop through next year and maybe your last question doug so dominic mentioned will and then what tim you know what we really appreciate out of what they bring to our company is some incredible permian expertise and experience they have the networks they have broadened and deeper networks than we we really have in in the permian given their long time association and and presence there and what tim is built is a is you know two or three goes at it and what he is done over the last thirty years in the permian basin and i will tell you that i have a lot of conversation with ceos over the course of the last couple of years and what i have come to appreciate tim shares a a passion for this business and a vision for what is going to what it is going to take to be successful over the next decade and beyond that is really consistent with with my view or our view of what it is going to take to to really succeed and beat the competition so and then i would say finally probably you know we are both very committed to a successful deal and and we are both committed to getting the secret sauce that is conocophillips combined with the secret sauce that is concho and make something that is even better going forward thank you our next question comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open great thank guys i appreciate you guys taking the questions so the 1st is a follow up on d distributions including from aplng but just equity affiliates broadly just how do you how you think about that you made a comment in the deck that we should not expect that to be rateable can you talk about different oil price levels and and and how we should be thinking about modeling those distributions coming into the business yeah sure neil this is bill i think a a as you are thinking about equity affiliates that that we we have talked in the past at how they are not rateable you should be thinking about the distributions from aplng i in terms of being more significant in the 2nd and 4th quarter a and lighter in the 1st and 3rd but as you think about them going into next year and you look at more like strip prices for next year if you think in terms of the range of 600 800000000 from equity affiliates a at those kind of pricing that is going to that gets you in the the ballpark it obviously depends on how their performing 00 on in terms of the markets and how we are optimizing our capital over in aplng but that will get you pretty close great bill and and and ryan as a follow up and and just just as a reminder we just as a reminder neil we do have a sensitivity for that i in our price deck for the pricing that is right that is right yeah in the supplemental materials we included today great guys yeah go ahead neil you had a 2nd follow up yeah it w it was really just about alaska and i know we are a couple of days away from the elections but which is probably a very sensitive topic but just sort of your your temperature on on on the fair share act and just in general your your message around alaska as you think about the the cadence and spend and and investment there yeah you bet i will let matt is ma matt has been following that closely i have to but matt has got a can can answer yeah neil the the as you know the the the really three that are topical just now there is the ballot initiative to increase the production tax there is the status of the willow project and as the impact if any on of a change in administration if that happens on federal land permitting so probably should talk about so that we can hopeful clear up alaska with this w with this one eh one question the so as you know the ballot measure would impose a tax increase in production the and that is going to have two problems two adverse the effects it is going to reduce the competitiveness of investment in alaska and it is going to increase uncertainty and instability so that that is not going to be good and we have got years of development opportunities left in alaska but but a shift of capital from alaska to elsewhere is going to be rational if taxes are increased i mean this is a production tax and what you tax more you get less of so that should be expected if the if the if those advocating for this and voting for the proposal should understand that and we have been pretty clear to avoid any doubt in alaska that if the measure passes drilling in the big three fields they are the targets of the tax increase is not going to resume in 2021 and maybe beyond that so the you know alaska jobs contract labor all the associated services are going to be adversely impacted by this change and the contractors the unions all the other businesses up there understand us and they have opposed for the most part opposing the the change in the taxation but it is now up to the electorate to decide and elections have consequences so we are getting down to the wire here and we really feel as if we have to be we have to be clear with the alaska voters on the willow project itself the the we we passed like a big milestone earlier this week we got a favorable record of the session from the the dlm after more than two years of process so that keeps us on track with the project timeline and and it is worth understand that that that permit was received under the 2013 integrated activity plan for the national petroleum reserve and those are rules that were set under the obama admini administration so they should stand up well to scrutiny under a change in administration if that happens so we are we are working towards a a concept selection and moving to feed by the end of this year of course that assumes the ballot measure fails and taxes are not increased if it passes we will we will need to reconsider the timing because although willow is not directly targeted by the tax increases there is going to be knock on effects on the other fields because of the lack of available available capital and then the last one is the federal land permitting in alaska the you know more generally if there is a change in administration we would expect that to have a relatively limited impact on us i mean although 65 of our acreage is no federal land it only represents about five of the production now production gmt two in particular is on federal land but it is well underway 1st production will be at the end of next year so we do not accept that will will be affected at all willow is on federal land of course but neither willow nor gmt one or gmt two the federal land drill sites is conventional to simulation techniques so if the issue is about fracking they they should not be influenced by that so i guess we have been clear to the alaska electorate about the implications of ballot measure we except any implications of a change in administration to in d c to have a relatively limited impact on us thank you our next question comes from jenine wai from barclays please go ahead your line is open hi good morning and good afternoon everyone thanks for taking our call good morning jenine good morning maybe sorry just one more on alaska if i could real quick following up on neil is question it it is a little bit different but i mean last year on the analyst day you talked about how willow would be contingent upon selling down 25 of your position in alaska and we know that you need resolution on ballot measure 11st but is that 25 sell down still the case now that you have concho assets in the portfolio and then maybe just on that for the ballot measure one we know it is a citizen is ballot measure and do you think that it could be likely that the legislature would potentially overturn any decisions em yeah jenine this is matt matt again we did not we did not really say it was the explicitly willow decision to sell them they they but but we we are still anticipating that we will do a sell down in alaska we just slowed the timing of that down until we get some of these uncertainties resolved so it is still on the cards that we will make an adjustment to equity in the in alaska but but we may still continue to proceed with the project in the mean time so so so so the the timing of the project does not impinge on the sell down i guess is what i am i am saying on the ballot measure one and can the could the legislature overrule that not not really not not not for that they would have to come up with an alternative that was that was that was substantially similar or or or the they so it would not be i it is unlikely that there would be an overturn turn at the you know okay great that is really helpful thank you very much my follow up question is just on the cash allocation priorities you indicated in your prepared remarks that 2021 capex should be about similar to 2020 with little to know production growth the strip moves around a lot it is kind of moving against us all today but is the right way generally to think about it is that in the mid 40s threshold that that threshold that you have for production growth it is a hard and fast criteria that needs to be met or are there just a bunch of other considerations that we would need to factor into the decision making process yeah i think we you know as i t tried to describe we basically use cost of supply and i think is we is we think about the the forward curve or in thinking about our plans for 202 and again i i mentioned those on a stand alone basis for conocophillips that is kinda how we are thinking about it going into next year you know it is just not not cost of supply but it is also what what kind of cash flow are we projecting to to make and you know we we have the we have the benefit of a very strong balance sheet so we can use some of that should we need to but y certainly we would be also trying to balance the the cash we are making with the capex that we are spending and the and the dividend that today satisfies thirty of our return criteria and more given the kinds of prices that we are seeing so certainly some headwinds into the commodity price outlook right now some you know with covid resurgence some demand certainly has not started to recover and depending on what nopec or opec does on on the supply side and what the u s response is you know we are watching all of that really closely to make sure that whatever program we put in place for 21 we can balance with the cash flows that we expect and make sure that we are investing in the lowest cost of supply things that we have in the portfolio only thank you our next question comes from josh silverstein form wolfe research please go ahead your line is open thanks maybe just off that that last question there you mentioned that you know for capex it will be very similar on the year over year basis what would the look like relative to the the 4th quarter under that scenario yeah josh the the the we would we would be we would expect under that scenario to be similar to 4th q or 2nd half eh eh eh of the year that that sort of level so that would be r are roughly fourthree is what we are spending this year which is a bit above our sustaining capital the the so so let let me take the opportunity to clear that up the the the it is flat production and yet above our sustaining capital so let me try and maybe explain why that is different so if if we were if we were going to execute a long term sustaining strategy for the company the the we need about threeeight for for for for conocophillips to stand alone and that would sustain production a a at r roughly you know just below 1200000s the but but the low cost of supply that we have in the portfolio we do not expect our long term strategy will be to simply sustain production the the the the investment opportunities are are too competitive for that but what ryan is really indicating is that we could execute a tactical sustaining program much like we have this year and and and and start 2020 with that sort of tactical sustaining program and then see how demand recovery and supply responses shape out and what probably the the distinction between a s tactical and strategic sustaining program is in a tactic sustaining program we would still keep production flat but we will completely shut down projects like willow our exploration activity those those things will still continue like with the anticipation that the ultimately we would move away from simply sustaining back to some modest growth so those are the things that we are working through just now and the and the plan and as ryan said we we you should not expect us to communicate 2021 capital guidance certainly for the combined company till sometime after the transaction closed thanks matt thanks yeah and i would yeah and i would add add josh you know we have a lot of flexibility with the balance sheet which is why you know if we go in at a similar level of capital to this year and you know and maybe flat to modest growth so it does not necessary equal flat production at the at the capital level going in next year but that is something we will we will continue to watch is that is that macro evolves around us y yes sir and then you mentioned that the you know the lower 48 assets are i guess unconventional assets are the the lowest emission part of the portfolio and the concho assets only add to that i am curious what the highest emission asset and does any sort of you know from the international portfolio do you think about in in that regard as well as maybe those are candidates that kind of accelerates the goal towards getting to your your 2030 path yes so the the the the highest emissions assets on the portfolio in the operating portfolio is really is oil sands the that is why we are so focused on on looking at ways to bring oil sands is emissions down and and we have got a lot of in the file there we are going to we are going to extend our non condensable gas injection which brings down steam oil ratio by keeping heat in the reservoir and of course it is the steam oil ratio that that that drives the the emission intensity eh we are also going to be deploying more of these full control devices that bring that brings the steam oil ratio down we are moving to add some sustaining pads as some of pads get older the steam oil ratio increases when you put new pads on the will be very low steam oil ratio and there is other technologies that we are looking at there as well so what what we are doing basically across the board is we are looking at all of our greenhouse gases intensity across every asset that we have and were asking ourselves what can we do to cost effectively bring that down the the and that is what our we bring that process together in what we call our marginal abatement cost curve and we have about 100 projects in there just now like some of them desktop exercises they are feasibility studies we spent about $90000000 this year between capital and operating costs on those projects they are but but we look across the asset base to try and find ways to bring that down and our targets josh you know that we established the 35 45 reduction that does not require major portfolio changes to go do that so we are we are not talking about having to sell certain assets that that matt described that is that is things that we have identified inside the portfolio to work on with the portfolio being relatively constant over this time yeah it is actually that is a good point ryan it is mostly driven by the fact that we are s s s strategic where we are investing we are investing in lower cap greenhouse gas intensity places like the unconventionals in the u s and canada like willow up in alaska it is very low intensity as well so the percentage of of production that is very low intensity increases with time and when you combine that with reducing the emissions and transfer the existing assets like the oil sands that is how we deliver the the the reduction in emissions intensity over the next ten years it is not it is not and we have said that it is it is and matt described sort of the the cost and capital is is is small amounts to get to we are not talking about spending 100s of 1000000s in dollars capital to go to deliver this this is small projects that that are currently baked into our plans thank you our next question comes from rodger reed from wells fargo please go ahead your line is open hey thank you and good morning morning rodger just i would like to to kick on really kind of a follow up of what you are talking about with josh there as you think about 21 capex roughly applied you said you know you ought to be nimble next for for hat comes what what will be the things you would looking at i mean presumably not simply oil price up or down i mean it is i assume it is some macro factors maybe help us kind of understand some of the signals you might look for for getting more optimistic in two yeah i mean it would it would be macro we have to we have to see how the how the demand responds to you know what looks like the slower response than people were hoping for and especially with europe and possibly the u s coming so we we have to just be cautious about that we have look at how the the russian and opec can respond i mean they they they the have a coming up in the end of november and see i may go back to sort of drawing the the inventory so the beauty of our position is that we have got incredible flexibility we have got the low a low breakeven price to cover you know for flat production and to cover the dividends that is sustained when we put the two companies together so we are we are we are actually having that flexibility and ability to respond to for the market is is very helpful so we are not going to rush headlong into into trying to grown production that does not make sense to us we will see how things play here over the next you know several months and then we will make we will make adjustment the the the the between our low breakeven and our balance sheet we will be in we will be in very good shape to to to to assess that as we go through sorry i would add rodger that well it is it is it is not so much even just what what is the strip look like and what it looks like for next year it it is it is sort of the longer term trajectory back to what what we believe is is a reasonable mid cycle price and we will we will be reassessing what that mid cycle looks like depending on where the demand and supply fundamentals start to kinda shake out with the u s tidal going down you know what happens to the election in in alaska and then it is going to make it is going to make imminent amount of sense as we combine with concho to to optimize and and figure out what the what the right level of activity is between the two companies so there is you you are right there is a number of factors that we will be putting into the mix as we look at not only at 2021 plans but but then couple or three years look like as we as this business recovers back to a mid cycle and whether it overshoots or undershoots well it is the oil industry so it will definitely do one or the other and maybe both one quick kind of follow up unrelated to the 1st question but related to the merger some of the savings that you p that you cited were going to be you know exploration appraisal spending that does not have to happen i was curious for the assets that you will not be spending e a money on in the near future do they just go back into the resource base or is that something that maybe becomes more likely to be disposed of you know or monetized in a different way yeah rodger it is dominic here thank you so what we said was that we will continue focusing our exploration effort on our existing business units such as alaska norway and malaysia so that will allow us to about half our exploration capital from 300 fifteen so those those areas such as you know down in south america colombia argentina and so one we will be working sort of managed exists from those areas of course we have a lot of value there we see a lot of value there is a lot of good good acreage there but we will be working to preserve value as we think about how how to you know exit those areas in in the future so more a question of dispositions in a managed way rather than those resources staying in the portfolio we have such a strong portfolio we will with poncho you know that we just think it is appropriate that we focus the exploration effort and we manage those where there there is not the there is not excessive capital employed associated with those assets but we will as dominic said we will we are going to do everything we can to monetize them as as best we can and and we do not have any resource associated with any of those assets on the moment a a a on our supply curve there is no resource associated with thank you our next question comes from scott hanold from rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is open thanks could could you give us some color on you know na u s natural gas price has been pretty strong and and is there ability for conoco to flex you know for that a little bit or is there you know where where where is your opportunity outside of associated or or is that really the opportunity yeah i think the op main opportunity with us scott is associated gas we probably have a little bit in the anadarko basin but that is not capturing a lot of our capital right now so it it mostly for us we are still a pretty big big marketer so we we were moving you know over eight bcf of gas a day so we see see a lot of that so we are getting we are getting some up uplift on the commercial side of business with some of the transport capacity we have that takes gas from that takes gas from the permian to the west coast and dow down south to arizona and even even into mexico so that is how we are kind of taking advantage of of the kind of market as we see it today and but on just on absolute production side we are not looking to ramp up you know dry gas and it is mostly coming from the associated gas with the the unconventional production yeah could d do do you could you quantify some of the marketing you know benefits you all see let bill he is heard of our commercial organization to maybe provide a bit of color there yeah sure so scott we we have a very active commercial organization ryan mentioned that we are moving a little over eight bcf a day we are the 5th largest gas marketer in the u s and we provide a variety of services to various customers ranging from asset management agreements to to offtake agreements and that is provides an ability to one have insight into the market and also to gain margin across moving across pipelines so we we continue to look at that and continue to move and we we are shipping gas for a a a a profit so you know out of that 808 eight bcf a day you know 500000000 cubic feet a day of it i is ours the rest of it is 3rd party volume and so we are in and out the market on both sides on a daily basis thank you our next question comes form doug leggate from bank of america please go ahead your line is open zero thanks good morning everybody i wonder bill maybe i could start off with you and as you to maybe elaborate a little bit on ryan is comments around the potential election outcomes and i am thinking specifically about tax i am sure you guys have looked at this but the thing that strikes me as a little bit disturbing is the potential for a minimum fifteen p l tax that puts in wells you know you know under a bit of spotlight i am just wondering have thought any way about that any scenarios that you have run outcomes that you may expect yeah sure we have certainly taken a look a a at the various tax proposals out there including the biden tax proposal there is there is two primary elements of that that that would impact us doug and the 1st one is obvious the change in the corporate tax rate from 21 28 and the 2nd one that would be fairly significant would be removal of idcs particularly in our capital program a a and needing to depreciate those overtime those are the two main aspects as we look through it that really would have an impact on us yeah i guess i should have been clearer i was talking about a potential biden administration and m maybe as a as a follow up and i and i know it is something that is is a little too obvious but we do not maybe ask it enough ryan when when yourself and when matt put together the tidal wave scenarios and all the other scenarios that that you laid out at the strategy day we have now seen what we think is a lot of signs of a bottom you know cycle to coming to a a a bottom if you like with consolidation yourselves being part of that how how does this what you are seeing right now beyond covid influence your thoughts on longer terms supply demand as you think about scenario planning i will leave it there thanks yeah thank doug i will maybe add a few comments and matt can jump in as as well but yeah we we spent a lot of time trying to think about what the trajectory of the recovery looks like and probably a couple of competing factors we certainly see demand recovery we are uncertain whether it gets fully back to 100000000 barrels a day but probably taking a a bit of bit of time to to get there and then i think equally important and maybe overlooked a little bit is what is happening on the supply side maybe masked a little bit today by dark inventory but you know when the declines and the declines are hitting in and it was masked by curtailments coming back on you know there is going to be a drop in u s supply as well so i can matt can probably chime in and describe a little bit about the net effect to the scenarios that we are thinking about as we debate our capital program and how much to to put back to work yeah doug if i mean the the i think you and i have discussed this in the past that the if you look at the our expectations for the exit rate for this year for u s tight oil it is somewhere between sixfive and 7000000 barrels a day and the calibration on that as we approach the end of the year so that compare to over 8000000 barrels a day in december last year eighttwo and and and to some extent that that drop flatters to deceive because people were still bri bringing wells on in the 1st quarter and into the 2nd quarter at the so there is a significant underlying decline going on here if we model this the the strip price is in the in the low 40s we think the industry is going to struggle to maintain flat production at december is rates through 21 and into two 21 will get a bit of lift from the ducks and but the but but if is going live within cash flow there is going to be a real challenge to to see tight oil at 7000000 barrels a day and this is likely to be less than that in 2021 and 202 if you compare that to the trajectory we were on that is at least 4000000 barrels a day less than the pre covid trend and that is just u s tight oil we respond more quickly here because of the decline rates and the capital flexibility but that but the similar issues are happening elsewhere so also although there is definitely uncertainty on how much the demand effect will be it is likely to be less of a demand effect than a supply effect certainly over next few years so the the the premise of your question initially your are we setting up for the bottom of a cycle here w w w it certainly feels that way because and the now exactly when it turns will be dependent upon the demand and and the covid and how what opec do in the short term but the we are certainly setting up for a tight tighter supply demand balance in a year or so if not before that yeah so so short medium term all about demand medium longer term you know supply starts to enter the picture as matt described and huh we have a couple of a couple of 23 scenarios around how we how we think with that slope in trajectory looks like thank you our next question comes from paul cheng from scotiabank please go ahead your line is open hey guys good morning morning paul one is that maybe it is a little bit of a curve ball here if we look at trading and optimization or commercial operation historically that u s looking at that at a cost center mainly for facilitation the europeans on the other hand take a more aggressive and looking at it as a profit center and they seems doing quite well and have a good logic to trade around your physical assets so from that stand point will conoco should look at that operation and see whether that it will allow you to have a higher performance and higher return or that you think facilitation is better and you do not want to take on that swing in earnings and a higher risk so that is the 1st question the 2nd question with the let us for argument say if you decide your longer term ten year plan has changed due to different market conditions and that such that your future growth rate is going to be lower with the addition of the concho assets what other asset in your portfolio would take more of the back seat and seeing lesser capital investment you you can say say the the number one number on two on that if that is possible thank you yeah so let me take the the 1st one and maybe matt can chime in on the 2nd one on the capital investment so the 1st one yeah yeah we are looking at the commercial space and with the addition of concho you know it is a as you described paul kind of a cost center inside of the company but you know we are we are looking at expanding that you know as we think about the the future and what the concho assets brings i think as dominic described earlier they they sell mostly at the wellheads so we have got some opportunity to add value there to both the gas and the oil side we are building more export capacity as a company and and in fact we have done some sales to point sales to customers where we take the middle man out of the equation and we found that quite margin enhancing as we go forward as well so with the growing u s production that we would have with the combination with concho it absolutely represents a a big part of of how we can expand the commercial organization and think about it differently too i mean bill described the market share that we have already and that is only going to get bigger as as we go forward so we are looking for more contribution from the the commercial side across the whole whole portfolio maybe matt if you want to take the capital allocation as a result of integrating the concho assets you know again i got back to it is a it is a cost of supply primary criteria but matt can provide a bit more details about what what might fall out yeah paul a the the the as you know what we do is we try to optimize each of our individual each of an individual parts of a portfolio to get the optimum piece using a a set of decision criteria but the most important of which is that we are not going to invest above an incremental cost of supply of $forty a barrel and we described that at some length back in november of last year and so we look at the optimization of each and then we put it together and we and we maybe make a few adjustments but we are trying to honor the optimum in each of the assets now there is flexibility across the portfolio in the pace you can we can adjust the pace of any given project by you know so we can adjust the the rate of which we increase the ramp and the number of rigs so i would not call out any specific asset if we decide that we want to grow at two instead of four or you know something like that the then there is flexibility across the portfolio to do that and and still honor our our our criteria that that would not bust the criteria the obvious places are lower 48 to alaska that is where the flexibility mostly exists and maybe in in canada as well but i would not i would not really call it a specific asset we we we we are trying to do an we are trying to optimize across the portfolio but the the issue is if if you are not optimizing across a diverse portfolio then you are you are not maximizing the value that the diversification brings you so we we we we are that is what we are trying to do is to make sure that we are we are running each of these assets at their optimum thank you our next question comes form jeoffrey lambujon from tudor pickering please go ahead you line is open good morning thanks for taking my questions my 1st one is on esg and the the paris aligned climate risk strategy and i i think your commentary earlier answered a lot of what i am looking for you know with the oil sands specific examples and and just your comments on investments decisions but is there anything incremental you can share at this point on on other operational changes that you are undertaking and focusing on for the the broader portfolio just trying to get a sense for the the scope of some of these projects you have mentioned again in terms of what is in focus whether that is you know new technology around monitoring retrofitting equipment for emissions control or or what have you yeah thanks it is dominic here i will just take that you know you know recently i i i was pretty much involved in the lower 48 and and there is some really some some important progress we are making there i think you know i think that we we we a announced a couple of things here along with our new paris aligned strategy one was you you know commitment to zero routine flaring and that is the world bank initiative there so we are committed to that and the other was the introduction of continuous methane monitoring so this is a real break through for us we are able to do now this now at a very reasonable cost and we are able to now basically on our key sites we will have this implemented and g we will have about 65 of our lower 48 production covered by early next year and this technology at very low cost allows us to sample the emissions around sites looking for methane every fifteen seconds and from that we can respond very quickly to any aberrations that we can address very quickly so the the those are a couple of really important initiatives for us that contribute to that overall commitment we have to reduce our ghg intensity by 35 45 by 203 and we are really a fast mover on this as you know jeoff you know we were the 1st u s based oil g oil and gas company to set a ghg intensity target and were the 1st u s based oil and gas company to to commit to being paris aligned thank you our next question comes form pavel molchanov from raymond james please go ahead your line is open thanks for the question two quick ones both regarding europe guess it is about ten of your gas volumes you know n n no one is accustomed to seeing north sea gas prices below $three an mcf but we have had that the last two quarters is that a is that covid related demand situation or is there something more structural in that market i i think that this is bill i think that as you think about that that is that is more of what we have seen with covid related demand related issues right now as we think long term the macro supply around the world we we we would see markets tend to more arbitrage off of the u s gulf coast with lng markets starting to move volumes both into europe and into asia as the incremental barrel so i i think that what you are seeing it is a short term response to supply demand and not a long term structural change okay and to follow up on that in about six weeks the european climate law will be approved by the eu leaders which will make the north sea the the one part of your portfolio that that is covered by a a net zero mandate does that change anything in terms of you are thinking about that asset given the de carbonization targets for the eu as a whole no not not really i think we are continuing to make adjustments but what we are left with in the europe portfolio is our norwegian assets and you know it is some of the lowest carbon intensity assets that we have that are off shore and and looking at other options to continue to reduce our emissions through electrification and additions there but as we look at it it is it is it is minimal addition to the cost of supply and it is quite manageable and norway is still is very competitive in the portfolio sinara this is ellen we will go ahead and take our last question if you do not mind thank you absolutely thank you our next question comes from philips johnston from capital one please go ahead your line is now open hey guys thanks just one question from me and it relates to your future return of capital to shareholders in the last five years you guys have repurchased a little over $10000000000 worth of stock at an average price of around $62 a share but at today is share price the paper loss on that program is pretty substantial i realize you guys plan to repurchase more stock here in the 4th quarter but i wanted to ask if there is any appetite at the board level to s to scrap the idea of share repurchases and instead pursue a fixed plus variable dividend strategy that would target paying out a a certain percentage of your free cash flow directly to shareholders each quarters yeah i think the you know the most important things is your last piece of that where we are targeting over thirty of cash back to the shareholder that is what we have committed to and delivered on in excess over the last three to four years since we kinda came out to re establish a new value proposition for this business and i think the dividend today is certainly covering a a large share of that also think that buying our shares back at this kind of level is is an important thing to do too because shares are certainly well undervalued and certainly relative to where we think that cycle price should be so i do not think we will give up on share repurchases completely you made a real point i mean we we wanted to buy buy our shares through through the cycle and this was a pretty significant downturn with curtailed production and and the like going on in the 2nd quarter so we did suspend for for a while we wanted to restart up because the the benefit to really buying your shares in not just buy them when you are at at at at mid cycle price but continue to buy them through the low low low end of the cycle because that is what brings down the average cost of your your shares obviously so we still think it it is going to be a a piece of our return to shareholder pie and the question begins you know what happens on on future excess returns when if if there is another big cycle and we we start to exceed our mid cycle price call and we we we have had conversations around that with the market and we continue to look at all the different ways to do that and continue to open to all the different ways to that but the dividend more than satisfies our return to share holders thank you we have no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to ellen thank you great thanks sinara thanks to our listeners by all means reach back to us if you have any follow questions and we really appreciate your interest and support in conocophillips thank you thank you and thank you ladies and gentleman this concludes today is conference thank you for participating you may now disconnect",
            "prediction": "good morning and welcome to the q 32200 conoco phillips earnings conference call my name is donnara and i will be the operator for today is call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session during the question and answer session if you have a question please press star then one on your touch tone phone please note this conference is being recorded i will now turn the call over to ms ellen desantis the thank you you may begin thanks inara hello and welcome this morning to our listeners i will 1st introduce the members of the konica minolta executive team who are on today is call we have ryan lance our chairman and ceo matt fogg our evp and chief operating officer bill bullock our executive

will open this morning with some prepared remarks and then the team will take your questions before i turn the call over to brian a few reminders in conjunction with this morning is press release we posted a short deck of supplementary material regarding the quarter onto our website that is available for your access next we will make some forward looking statements this morning based on current information also statements about the proposed business combination announced last week between conoco phillips and conoco will be read a description of the risks associated with forward looking statements and other important information about the proposed transaction can be found in today is press release all of which are incorporated by reference for purposes of this call we will also refer to some non gapped financial measures today and reconciliations to the nearest comparable gaap measure will be provided in our next earnings release good morning you can find the announcement in this morning is press release and also on our website thank you and now i will turn the call over to ryan thank you all and good morning to our listeners before we get into our 3rd quarter results i will take a few minutes to address last week is announcement of our combination with concho resources we spent a lot of time talking to the market over the past several days and i am pleased to say that the feedback has been positive by the way earlier this week we added some annotations good morning this is our transaction deck for clarification today is call is a great opportunity to reflect on our conversations and reiterate the compelling merits of the transaction for both sets of shareholders i will start at the highest level our announced transaction with concho combines two widely recognized leaders in the sector concho phillips has been a recognized leader in the returns on and returns of capital model for the business and concho has been a recognized leader in the sector we are pleased to report that our pure play class will continue to lead the industry in our class companies on a standalone basis by scaling up our existing returns focused business model we are stronger and more investable within the sector characterized by frequent price cycles industry maturity capital intensity and esg focus we will be a nearly $60000000000 enterprise that is uniquely positioned to create sustained value by embracing what we believe are our core strengths we have essential future mandates for our sector and these mandates are 1st providing affordable energy to the world 2nd committed to esg excellence and 3rd delivering competitive returns we believe the transaction accelerates our ability to successfully and simultaneously deliver on all three of these mandates that is how we will win now let me take these mandates one by one in the context of our transaction we know the world will need hydrocarbons as part of the energy mix for a long time even as we see increasing adoption of low carbon energy sources however we also recognize that the energy transition means the winners will be those companies with resources that can be affordably developed in any transition scenario including a less than two degree scenario that is the reason we have always been committed to having the lowest cost of supply resource base in the industry the company will have a 23000000 barrel resource base for the cost of supply less than $forty a barrel kongo phillips gets the benefit of our global diverse and lower capital intensity portfolio attributes konico phillips gets the benefit of adding some of the best resources in the world and by the way we have studied rock quality everywhere now let us move on to the 2nd mandate a commitment to esg excellence in conjunction with last week is transaction we announce we were awarded the contract to provide esg services to the world is largest oil company our framework includes specific emissions intensity reduction goals a commitment to no routine flaring permanently installed methane monitoring and advocating for a well designed carbon price in the us this framework is in service to our ambition to reach a net zero operational emissions target by 2050 hello this is the general manager speaking our engagement meetings if this framework included the portfolio effects of the concho assets the explicit answer is no we were preparing to issue our new climate risk framework before the transaction was agreed however we see the addition of concho is assets as being consistent with and accretive to these goals the production emissions of the us unconventionals are among the lowest ghd intensity assets in the world so the addition of these resources will be a benefit to our projection now the 3rd mandate delivering competitive returns is an imperative for attracting and retaining investors to the sector our company has been all about returns and that will not change in fact the combined company will be uniquely positioned to deliver on the proven returns focused value proposition we know investors want from our sector for example as i just mentioned i will be speaking on the subject of the transaction that creates a massive resilient low cost to supply resource base i discuss this as part of mandate one but also add that low cost to supply is the best assurance by definition for delivering competitive financial returns through price cycles after the deal closes we will publish our combined cost of supply curve i have no doubt it will be best in class by the way we have been asked about how we view risk in the event of a change in leadership in washington and while it might create some headwinds for the industry our company is global diversification and our mix of private state and federal releases in the us assures that we are competitively positioned for that outcome and we accounted for this potential risk in our evaluation of the overall transaction diversification and low capital intensity matters and as i just mentioned we preserve those portfolio characteristics adding conscious unconventional assets into our portfolio will not that means we retain our diversification and low capital intensity advantage for the benefit of both shareholders we will apply our disciplined and consistent approach to future investment programs capital will be allocated 1st on the basis of costs to supply and then based on secondary criteria such as flexibility capital intensity asset optimization affordability and free cash flow generation and are expanded the transaction resulting from the transaction will be integrated within the total company plan to optimize overall outcomes and value the combination creates greater visibility on earnings expansion and free cash flow generation factoring in our announced 500000000 targeted cost and capital savings the transaction is accretive on all key consensus financial metrics including earnings free cash flow and free cash flow yield we have a balance sheet plus free cash flow generation means we are even better positioned to give investors what they want from this business returns of capital the transaction enhances our ability to meet our stated target of returning more than thirty of our cfo to our owners annually and this target is not an ambition it is what we have been doing for the past four years in fact we returned over forty of our cfo to our owners over that period and it will remain a key part of our business the bottom line this transaction creates a best in class competitor of scale to thrive in a new energy future that is compelling for shareholders for both companies now a few comments on what to expect next rfs for filing should be filed in the next couple of weeks and we expect the transaction to close in the 1st quarter of 2021 integration planning is already underway domenic macklin will lead the effort for conoco phillips and will gerro will lead the effort for kona both sides are excited and committed to a very successful integration as part of the integration planning we will begin to evaluate how best to optimize our future investment programs we would expect to announce proforma capex for next year shortly after closing but directionally on a standalone kona philip spaces we remain cautious on the pace and timing of recovery so as a place to start we are currently thinking we entered 2221 capex at a level that is roughly similar to this year is capital meaning little to no production growth on a standalone basis of course we retain the flexibility to adjust as the year progresses we have the capital flexibility the balance sheet and the cash on hand to respond as necessary to changes in the macro while meeting our capital return priority and that brings me to a few comments on the 3rd quarter results it is certainly been of all the year for the business as we all know the company took some steps to address the situation and improve the outlook for the future i would like to report on significant actions taken to respond to the downturn including production curtailments and over the past couple of quarters we also carried out our major seasonal turnarounds so a bit of noise in the 2nd quarter and 3rd quarter numbers but by the end of the 3rd quarter the curtailment program was behind us the seasonal turnarounds were complete and the underlying business was running very well as you saw this morning is release 3rd quarter results were in line with expectations we have resumed guidance i mean we should take the 4th quarter as the new baseline for 21 capital and production those i just mentioned that is subject to ongoing monitoring and market conditions we look forward to keeping you updated on our integration progress and our future plans for the business and finally we hope everyone is safe and well and now i will turn it over to the operator for q a thank you we will now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press star one hello this is the automated operator for your touch tone phone if you are using a speakerphone you may need to pick up the hand set 1st before pressing the numbers once again if you have a question please press star then one on your touch tone phone waiting on stand by for any questions and our 1st question comes from phil gresh from jp morgan please go ahead your line is open yes hello well just wanted to ask about the quarter here it looks like there are some moving pieces around cash flows affiliate distributions and some other factors there so i was wondering if you could give a little bit more color there and help us think about how you would define  the clean cfo in the quarter yeah thanks bill i will let bill bill bullock can answer that for you thanks hi phil so yeah for the quarter cash from operations ex working capital was x $231000000 and we had a couple of one time benefits in the quarter a legal settlement and an audit settlement totaling 130000000 of that but we also had curtailments in the quarter of about 90000 barrels a day so the forgone cash flow for that would have been about $150000000 in cash so if you think of a clean run rate number for the quarter good place to be thinking is about 1250000000 for the quarter now you you asked about equity distributions we did not have a distribution from apol and g in the quarter we received distributions in the 2nd quarter of about 500000000 from apol and g and for the remainder of the year we are expecting a little under 200000000 in the 4th quarter that would give a full year distribution of somewhere around 680 to 700000000 for the year so if i look at the results you just talked about the one25 and what concho reported the other night which i think is xhedges it was around 500 perhaps you could help us bridge these results which i think are about $41 wti to the $7000000000 wti $forty wti guidance you provided yeah thanks phil i know there is a number of moving parts there as you described and yeah we have had a few people point out that they thought the 7000000000 at $forty a barrel for the combined company looked a little bit light so now we have seen the 3rd quarter if you adjust for concho is hedging benefits and what bill just described on our equity affiliates i think you get something closer to the mid teens so maybe i will let matt add a little bit of color to those details yeah if you look at the clean energy 3rd quarter and for both companies bill explained that it would imply somewhere between sevenfive and 78 at $forty about now that range is basically based on the uncertainty in the equity affiliates if we got similar distributions to  this year we would be the top end in that range and these numbers also include a pro forma assumption that we would get the full year of expected cost savings and that we announced which was 350000000 of cash and that is what shows up in these numbers there is also the 150000000 of capital that does not then does not affect cfo directly does that help phil our next question comes from doug tarrison from evercore isi please go ahead your line is open good morning everybody good morning doug the ability to create value and strategic transactions over the near and medium term periods and on this point while you guys have been pretty clear about the operating and capital cost benefits that you are going to get as well as some of the enhancements that you are going to get from a higher quality investment portfolio my question is whether there are areas that you are optimistic about that may or may not be as obvious that stand to deliver further upside areas that you are really confident about similar to situations and then 2nd what are the two to three most important things that you think that the new management group brings to the organization so two questions so we are talking about a $100000000 that that we described but if you are the 2nd page which i think is what you are alluding to a little bit that i can let dominick add on is yeah we fully expect that we are going to get additional opportunity either through price uplift or various other forms to add add incremental value to this transaction dominick maybe you could describe a little bit of what the integration team is going to be looking at yeah thanks so thanks ron and doug thanks for the question you know actually we are very focused on the we have put out there as a commitment but certainly we see opportunity beyond that i think we kind of outlined those in  in our in our deck i think just to talk more about those specifically i think the ones that we are most optimistic about you know on the marketing side concho typically sells their product to the wellhead we sell further down the value chain to improve realization so you know we have a very strong commercial group concho phillips so we are certainly excited about about that you know concho have been doing extremely well in the permian on their drilling completion costs the performance has been excellent and they are further down the learning curve than us there so we do expect to see that to accelerate you know the performance on on our acreage too and of course we expect to you know improve performance across the lower 48 from sharing best practices and technologies between eagle ford and the permian and and the bakken and so on so definitely operational efficiencies and then on the supply side obviously we are going to have increased purchasing power scale flexibility so we are anticipating you know upsides in all these areas and and some additional areas too that we will be working on in the in the coming months here so william and i already talking about these we are pretty excited about it and we will be look forward to see how these develop through next year what we really appreciate out of what they bring to our company is some incredible permian expertise and experience they have the networks they have broader and deeper networks than we we really have in the permian given their long time association and and presence there and what tim is built is  as you know two or three goes at it and what he is done over the last thirty years in the permian basin now not to tell you but i have had a lot of conversations with ceos over the course of the last couple of years and what i have come to appreciate tim shares a passion for this business and a vision for what is going to what it is going to take to be successful over the next decade and beyond that is really consistent with with my view or our view of what it is going to take to to really succeed and beat the competition so and then i would say finally probably you know we are both very committed to a successful deal and and we are both yeah committed to getting the secret sauce that is concho phillips combined with the secret sauce that is concho and make something that is even better going forward our next question comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open great thanks guys appreciate you taking the questions so the 1st one is a follow up on a distribution including from apolg but just equity affiliates broadly how do you think about that you made a comment in the deck that we should not expect that could you elaborate a little bit more bill yeah sure neil this is bill i think as you are thinking about equity affiliates but we have talked in the past about how they are not rated you should be thinking about the distributions from apn and g in terms of being more significant in the 2nd and 4th quarter and lighter in the 1st quarter but as you think about going into next year and you look at more like strip prices for next year if you are thinking by the range of 600 to 800000000 from equity affiliates  at those kind of pricing that is going to that is going to get you into the ballpark it obviously depends on how they are performing on how they are performing on terms of the markets and how we are optimizing our capital over an ap l and g but that will get you pretty close great bill and  ryan has a follow up just just as a reminder just as a reminder deal we do have a sensitivity for that in our price deck for the pricing that is right that is right yeah in the supplemental materials we included today great case go ahead and follow up yeah it was really just about alaska and i know we are a couple days away from the elections but that is probably very sensitive topic but just sort of your temperature on the fair share act and just in general your your message around alaska yeah you bet i will let matt is  matt has been following that closely i have to but matt has got a could not get an answer yeah i knew that they i mean as you know that there are really three moves they are topical just now there is the ballot initiative to increase a production tax there is the status of the willow project and there is the impact i mean of a change in administration if that happens on federal land permits so i probably should talk about all three of them so that we can hopefully clear up alaska with this with this one but with this one question they so as you know the ballot measure would impose a tax increase in production and that is going to have two problems two adverse effects it is going to reduce the competitiveness of investment in alaska and it is going to increase uncertainty and instability and so and we have been pretty clear so that we would avoid any doubt in alaska that if the measure passes drilling in the big three fields it is not going to resume in 2021 and maybe beyond that so the yeah you know alaska jobs contract labor all the associated services are going to be adversely impacted by this change and the contractors the unions all the other businesses up there understand this and they oppose for the most part opposing the change in the tax regime but it is now up to the electorate to decide and then elections of consequence so we are getting down to the wire here and we really feel that we have to be we have to be clear with the  alaska voters on the willow project itself the we have we passed that a big milestone earlier this week we got a favorable record of decision from the the blm after more than two years of process so that keeps us on track with the project timeline and and it is worth understanding that that permit was received under the 2013 integrated activity and those are rules that were set under the obama administration so they should stand up well to scrutiny under a change in administration if that happens so we are working towards a concept selection and moving to feed by the end of this year but this assumes the ballot measure fails when taxes are not increased if it passes we will only need to reconsider the timing because although willow is not directly affected targeted by the tax increases there is going to be knock on effects on the other fields because of the lack of available capital then the last one is the federal land and permits in alaska the yeah and you know more generally if there is a change in administration we would expect that to have a relatively limited impact on us i mean although 65 of our acreage is on federal land it only represents about five of our production now some coming production g m t two in particular in particular is going to be impacted the federal land is well underway 1st production will be the end of next year so we do not expect that to be affected at all willows on federal land of course but neither willow nor g m t one or g m t two the federal land drill sites use anything other than conventional stimulation techniques so if issues are about fracking they should not be influenced by that we have been clear with alaska electric about the implications of ballot measure one we expect any implications of the change in administration in dc to have a relatively limited impact on us so but good morning maybe sorry just one more on alaska if i could real quick following up on neil is question it is it is a little bit different but i mean last year on the analyst day you talked about how willow would be contingent upon selling down 25 of your position in alaska and we know that you need resolution on ballot measure 11st but is that 25 sell down still the case now that you have concho assets in the portfolio and then maybe just on that for the ballot measure one we know it is a citizen ballot measure and do you think that it could be likely that the legislature would potentially overturn any decision so it is still on the current so we will make an adjustment to equity and in alaska and but we may still continue to proceed with the project in the meantime and so so the timing of the project is not contingent on the sell down i guess is what i am saying when they ballot measure one and then can the legislature overrule that and not really not really no not going to take a little bit better time for that they would have to come up with a solution ok great that is really helpful thank you very much my follow up question is just on the cash allocation priorities and you indicated in your prepared remarks that 2020 21 capex should be about similar to 2020 with little to no production growth the strip moves around a lot kind of moving against us all today but is the right way generally to think about it is that in the mid 40s threshold that that threshold that you have for production growth it is a hard and fast criteria that needs to be met or are there just a bunch of other considerations that we would need to factor into the decision making process and i was thinking about our plans for 2020 and again i mentioned those on a standalone basis for conoco phillips that is kind of how we are thinking about it going into next year you know it is just not not cost to supply but it is also what what kind of cash flow are we projecting to to make and you know where we have the we have the benefit of a very strong balance sheet so we can use some of that should we need to but certainly we would be also trying to balance the the cash we are making with the capex that we are spending in the in the dividend that we are spending in the it satisfies thirty of our return criteria and more given the kinds of prices that we are seeing so certainly some headwinds into the commodity price i will look right now some you know with covid resurgence some demand certainly has not started to recover and depending on what notepac or opec does on the supply side and what the us response is you know we are watching all of that really closely to make sure that whatever program we put in place for 21 we can balance with the cash flow i want to make sure that we are investing in the lowest cost to supply things that we have in the portfolio only thank you our next question comes from josh silverstein from wolf research please go ahead your line is open so what would the chronic care standard of care look like relative to the 4th quarter or the 2nd half of the year so let me try and explain why that is different so if we were if we were going to execute a long term sustaining strategy for the company we would need about threeeight for for conoco phillips stand alone and that would sustain production at one point i think that our financial situation is a bit below $1200000 and the but with the low cost of supply that we have in the portfolio we do not expect that our long term strategy will be to simply sustain production the investment opportunities are too competitive for that but what ryan is really indicating is that we could execute a tactical sustaining program much like we have this year in 2020 with that sort of tactical and sustain program i think the distinction between a tactical and strategic and sustainment program is in a tactical sustainment program we would still keep and production flat but we would not completely shut down projects like willow or exploration activity and those things would still continue with anticipation that they ultimately we would move away from simply sustaining back to some modest growth those are the things that we are working through just now in the  and the plan goes right so we should not expect us to communicate 20211 capital guidance certainly for the combined company until sometime after the transaction closes so yeah i would add that josh you know we have a lot of flexibility with the balance sheet which is why you know if we go in at a similar level of capital to this year it you know it may be flat to modest growth so it does not necessarily mean necessarily that we are going to be able to provide guidance it is flat production at the at the capital level going in next year but that is something we will we will continue to watch as the as the macro evolves around us okay and then you mentioned that the the the lower 48 assets or i guess the unconventional assets are the the lowest emission part of the portfolio and the but concho assets only add to that i am curious what the highest emission asset is and is any sort of you know i am getting it something in the international portfolio yeah so the the highest emissions assets in the portfolio just now in the operated portfolio is really it is  oil sands that is why we are so focused on on looking at ways to bring oil sands emissions down and and we have got a lot of the the islands in the fire there we are going to extend their non condensable gas injection which brings down steam oil ratio by keeping heat in the reservoir and of course it is the steam oil ratio that drives the emissions intensity and we are also going to be deploying more of these flow control devices and that brings the steam oil ratio down we are moving to add some sustaining pads as some of the pads get older their steam oil ratio increases when you put new pads on that is what we are doing now that is what we are doing now we have a low steam to heat ratio and there is other technologies that we are looking at there as well so what we are doing basically across the board is we are looking at all of our greenhouse gas intensity across every asset that we have and we are asking ourselves what can we do and to cost effectively bring that down and that is what our marginal abatement cost curve and then we have about a 100 projects in there so some of them are desktop exercises you know feasibility studies and we spend about $19000000 this year between capital and operating costs on those projects but but we have looked across the whole asset base to try and find ways to to bring that down so we are we are not talking about having to sell certain assets that the matt described but that is that is things that we have identified inside the portfolio to work on with the portfolio being relatively constant over this time yeah it is actually that is a good point line it is mostly driven by the fact that we are it is a sort of strategic shift where we are investing we are investing in lower capital greenhouse gas intensity places like beyond conventional in the us and canada and so the percentage of our production that is very low intensity increases with time and when you combine that with reducing the emissions intensity of our existing assets like our oil sands that is how we have delivered the reduction in emissions intensity over the next ten years it is not it is not a the cost in capital is small amounts to get this plan we are not talking about spending 100s of 1000000s of dollars in capital to go deliver this this is a small project that that are currently baked into our plans thank you our next question comes from roger reed from wells fargo please go ahead your line is open hey thank you and good morning peter rogers just  i would like to to kick on really kind of a follow up where you are talking about with josh there is you think about 21 capex roughly flat and you said you know you ought to be nimble next year for for what comes what  what would be the things you would be looking at i mean presumably not simply oil price up or down i mean it is yeah i assume it is some macro factors maybe help us kind of understand some of the signals you might look for for getting more optimistic in 2021 yeah i mean it would be natural we have to see how they yeah how they demand responds to you know what looks like  a slower response than people were hoping for and especially with europe and possibly the us coming so we we have to just be cautious about that we have to look at how the russia and opec respond so they have a move coming up to the end of november and see when we get back to sort of drawing down the inventory so the beauty of our position is that we have got incredible flexibility we have got the low low break even price to cover you know for flat production and to cover the dividend that is sustained when we put the two companies together and so we are we are actually having that flexibility and the ability to respond to and for the the market well we have had some people say that having a short conversation with you is very helpful so we are not going to rush headlong into trying to grow production into this that does not make any sense to us we will see how things play out here over the next several months and then we will make adjustments that is the way it works between our low break even and our balance sheet we will be in very good shape to assess that as we go through well it is it is it is not so much even just what what the strip looks like or what what it looks like for next year it is it is sort of a longer term trajectory back to what what we believe is as a reasonable midcycle price and we will be reassessing what that midcycle looks like depending on where the demand and the supply fundamentals start to kind of shake out with the us title going down you know what happens to the election and and alaska and then you know it is it is going to be tough that is it is going to make imminent amount of sense as we combine with concho to to optimize and and figure out what the what the right level of activity is between the two companies so there is you are right there is a number of factors that we will be putting into the mix as we look at not only 2021 plans but what the next couple three years look like as we as this business recovers back to a mid cycle and whether it overshoots or undershoots it is the oil industry so it will definitely do one or the other and maybe both one quick kind of follow up unrelated to the 1st question but related to the merger some of the savings that you pulled that you cited were going to be you know exploration appraisal spending that does not have to happen i was curious for the assets that you will not be spending e and a money on in the near future do they just go back into the resource base or is that something that maybe becomes more likely to be  disposed of you know monetized in a different way argentina and so on we will be working sort of managed exits from those areas of course we have a lot of value there we see a lot of value there is a lot of good good acreage there but we will be working to preserve value as we think about how to you know exit those areas in the future so more a question of dispositions in a managed way rather than those resources staying in the portfolio we have such a strong portfolio we will with poncho  you know that we just think it is appropriate that we do something with it we manage those assets rather than whether there is excessive capital employed associated with those assets but as dominick said we are going to do everything we can to monetize them as best we can and then we do not have any resource associated with any of those assets in the moment in our supply curve there was no resource associated with them hello from rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is open thanks so could you give us some color on you know us natural gas prices have been pretty strong and is there their ability for conoco to flex you know for that a little bit better or is there you know where is your opportunity outside of associated gas or is that really the opportunity yeah i think the opp without scott is we probably have a little bit in the anadarko basin but that is not capturing a lot of our capital right now so it is mostly for us we are still a pretty big big marketer so we we were moving you know over eight bcf of gas a day so we see see a lot of that so we are getting we are getting some uplift on the commercial side of our business with some of the transport capacity we have that takes gas from the permian to the west coast and down south to arizona even in new mexico so that is how we are kind of taking advantage of of the kind of market as we see it today and but on just an absolute production side we are not looking to ramp up you know dry gas and it is mostly coming from the associated gas with the unconventional production yeah sure so scott we we have a very active commercial organization where ryan mentioned that we are moving a little over eight bcf a day where we are the 5th largest gas marketer in the us and we provide a variety of services to various customers ranging from asset management agreements to to off take agreements and that provides an ability to one have insight into the market and also to gain margin across moving across pipelines and so we we continue to look at that and continue to move and we were i am sorry i am not sure what you are asking up 808 bcf a day 500000000 cubic feet a day of it is ours the rest of it is 3rd party volume and so we are in and out of the market on both sides on a daily basis thanks so good morning everybody i wonder bill maybe i could start off with you and ask you to maybe elaborate a little bit on ryan is comments around the potential election outcomes and i am thinking specifically about tax i am sure you guys have looked at this but the thing that strikes me as a little bit disturbing is the potential for a minimum fifteen pnl tax that puts in a wells i am just wondering if you guys have thought anywhere about that any scenarios that you run outcomes that you may expect yeah sure we have certainly taken a look at at the various tax proposals out there including the biden tax proposal there is there is two primary elements of that that that would impact us doug the 1st one is obviously change in the corporate tax rate from 2128 and the 2nd one that would be fairly significant would be removal of idcs particularly in our capital program and and needing to depreciate those over time those are the two main aspects as we look through it that really would have an impact on us too obvious but we do not maybe ask it enough ryan when when yourself and when matt put together the tidal wave scenarios and all the other scenarios that that you laid out at the strategy day we have now seen what we think is a lot of the signs of a bottom yeah cycle coming to a bottom if you like with consolidation yourselves being part of that how does this what you are seeing right now beyond covid influence your thoughts on longer term as you think about scenario planning i will leave it there thanks yeah thanks doug i will maybe add a few comments matt can jump in as well but yeah we we spent a whole lot of time trying to think about what the trajectory of the recovery looks like and probably competing factors we certainly see demand recovery uncertain whether it gets fully back to a 100000000 barrels a day but probably taking a bit of a bit of time to get there and then i think equally important than maybe overlooked a little bit is what is happening on the supply side maybe masked a little bit today by duck inventory but you know when the declines and the declines are hitting in and it was masked by curtailments coming back on you know there is going to be a drop in us supply as well so i can matt can probably chime in and describe a little bit about the net effect to the scenarios that we are thinking about as we  doug if i mean the did they i think you and i discussed this in the past if you look at our area expectations for the exit rate for this year for us tight oil it is somewhere between sixfive and 7000000 barrels a day and we will be able to get better calibration on that europe as it approaches the end of the year that compares to over 8000000 barrels a day well in december last year eighttwo and and to some extent that that drop flatters to deceive because people were still bringing wells on in the 1st quarter and into the 2nd quarter so there is a significant underlying decline going on here when we model this in another way you do the strip prices in the in the low 40s and we think the industry is going to struggle to maintain flat production at december is rates to 21 if you compare that to the trajectory we were on that is at least 4000000 barrels a day less than the pre covid trend and that is just us tight oil and we respond more quickly and that but the similar issues are happening elsewhere so although there is definitely uncertainty in how much the demand effect will be it is likely to be less of a demand effect than the supply effect set in over the next few years so to the premise of your question initially you know are we setting up for the bottom of the cycle here but certainly feels that way because and there are no exact way in terms of timing this will be dependent upon the i think we are going to see a demand for the medium term medium to longer term you know supply starts to enter the picture as matt described and we have a couple of couple 23 scenarios around how we how we manage that what does that slope and trajectory look like thank you our next question comes from paul chang from scotiabank please go ahead your line is open hey guys good morning morning paul why is that it may be only a little bit of the curve ball here if we look at the trading and optimization or commercial operation we can see that it is very important to optimize the commercial operation in order to get the best return on investment historically that the us looking at that as a core center mainly for facilitation the european on the other hand take a more aggressive approach and looking at it as a profit center and they seem to be doing quite well and have a good logic to trade around your physical asset so from that standpoint wheelonico should look at that operation and see whether that it could allow you to have a higher performance and higher revenue or that you think facilitation is better and you do not want to take on that swing and earn and the higher risk so that is the 1st question the 2nd question with the less for arguments sake if you decide your longer term ten year plan has changed due to different market conditions and that is such that your future growth rate is going to be lower with the addition of the cost asset  what what would you do the asset in your portfolio will take more of the back seat and seeing lesser capital investment if you can say the number one number two on that if that is possible thank you yeah so let me take the 1st one in and maybe matt can chime in on the 2nd one on the capital investment so the 1st one yeah you know we are looking at the commercial space and with the addition of concho you know it is as you described and then  kind of a cost center inside the company but you know we are we are looking at expanding that you know as we think about the future and what the contra asset spring i think as dominick described earlier they they sold mostly at the wellhead so we got some opportunity to add value there to both the gas and the oil side we are building more export capacity as a company and in fact we have done some sales point sales to customers where we take the middleman out we found that margin enhancing as we go forward as well so with the growing us production that we would have with the combination with concho it absolutely represents a big part of of how we can expand the commercial organization and think about it differently too i mean bill described the market share that we have already and that is only going to get bigger as as we go forward so we are looking for yeah paul is at the table as you know what we do is we try to optimize each of our individual portfolios maybe matt if you want to take the capital allocation as a result of integrating the contra assets you know again i go back to our it is a cost to supply primary criteria but matt can provide a bit more detail about what might fall out so we look at the optimization of each and then we put it together and we and we maybe make a few adjustments but we are trying to honor the optimal in each of the assets now now flexibility across the portfolio in the pace you can we can adjust the pace of any given project by a unit of show we can adjust the the rate at which we increase the ramp in the number of rigs so i would not call out any specific asset if we decide that we want to go at two instead of four or you know something like that the yeah then the flexibility across the portfolio to do that and then still honor our our criteria that that would not bust the criteria the obvious places are lower 48 alaska so that is where the flexibility mostly exists and maybe in canada as well but i would not i would not really call it a specific asset but we are trying to do and we are trying to optimize across the portfolio but the issue is if if you are not optimizing in across a diverse portfolio then you are you are not maximizing the value that the diversification brings you so we are we are trying to do is to make sure that we are we are running each of these assets at their optimal thank you our next question comes from jeffery lambojum from tutor pickering please go ahead your line is open yeah so i am undertaking and focusing on for the broader portfolio just trying to get a sense for the scope of some of these projects you have mentioned again in terms of what is in focus whether that is new technology around monitoring retrofitting equipment for emissions control or what have you and progress we are making there i think you know i think that we we yeah you know announced a couple of things here along with our new paris aligned strategy and one was you know a commitment to zero routine flaring and that is the world bank initiative there so we have committed to that and the other one was your introduction of continuous methane monitoring so this is a real breakthrough for us we are able to do this now at very reasonable cost and we are able to now basically on our key sites we will have this implemented i think it will have about 65 of our low 48 production covered by early next year and this technology at very low cost allows us to sample the emissions around sites so looking for methane every fifteen seconds and from that we can respond very quickly to any aberrations that we can address very quickly so those are a couple of really important emissions thank you jeff i appreciate that and i think it is important for us to contribute to that overall commitment we have to reduce ghg intensity by 35 to 45 by 2030 and we are really a 1st mover on this as you know jeff you know we were the 1st u s based oil and gas company to set a ghg intensity target and we were the 1st u s based oil and gas company to commit to being paris aligned our next question comes from pavlo malchano from raymond james please go ahead your line is open your line is open thanks for the question both regarding europe i guess it is about ten of your gas volumes you know no one is accustomed to seeing north sea gas prices below $three in ncfc but we have had that the last two quarters is that a covid related demand situation or is there something more structural in that market yeah i think that this is bill i think that just you think about that that is that is more what we have seen with covid related to demand related issues right now as we think about long term the macro supply around the world we would see markets tend to more arbitrage and the us gulf coast with lg markets are starting to move volumes both into europe and into asia as the incremental barrel so i think that what you are seeing is a short term response to supply demand and not a long term structural change no no not really i think we are continuing to make adjustments but we are overlaid within your portfolios our norwegian assets and you know it is some of the lowest carbon intensity assets we have that are offshore i am sorry but i am not sure i understand what you are asking could you please rephrase your question hi this is phillips johnson from capital one please go ahead and find it now open hey guys thanks just one question for me that relates to your future return of capital to shareholders in the last five years you guys have purchased a little over $10000000000 with the stock at an average price of around 62 a share so at today is share price the paper will also net that program is pretty substantial i realize you guys plan to purchase more stock here and the 4th but i wanted to ask if there is any appetite at the board level to to scrap the idea of share repurchases and instead pursue a fixed plus variable dividend strategy that would that would target paying out a  a certain percentage of your free cash flow directly to share holders each quarter i think in excess over the last three to four years since we kind of came out to reestablish a new value proposition for this business and i think the dividend today is certainly covering a large share that i also think that buying our shares back at this kind of level is is  is an important thing to do too because the shares are certainly well under valued it is certainly relative to where we think mid cycle price should be so i do not think we will give up on share repurchases completely you made a real point i mean we we wanted to buy our shares through through the cycle and this was a pretty significant downturn with curtailed production and and the like going on in the 2nd quarter so we did suspend for for a while we wanted to restart up because the the benefit to really buying in your shares is not just buy them when you are at at at midcycle price but continue to buy them through the low low end of the cycle because that is what brings down the average cost to your your shares obviously so we still think it is going to be  a piece of our return you know what happens on on future excess returns when if there is another big cycle and we we start to exceed our mid cycle price call and we have had conversations around that with the market and we continue to look at all the different ways to do that and continue to be open to all the different ways to do that but at this ten seconds so the dividend more than satisfies our return to shareholders thank you we have more questions hello thank you for calling i would like to turn the call back over to ellen thank you great thanks in advance and thanks to our listeners by all means reach back to us if you have any follow up questions and we really appreciate your interest in support thank you thank you and thank you ladies and gentlemen and this concludes

rent increases committed by new york city rent rent guidelines board although none of eliminating overcharged liability altogether this ruling is expected to limit our financial exposure in this

the property maintain high occupancy ending the quarter over 96 leased rent per square foot was a record $25ten at the end of the quarter we continue to proactively streamlined the business and manage

confirm guys did you say that outside of tribeca where you gave the update that that occupancy had improved to 83 you mentioned flatbush that that all the other properties had seen anywhere from 380 to 610 basis point occupancy since the 3rd quarter yes yeah hi craig how are you when at the end of the 2nd quarter some of the properties as we said aspen ten west and clover house they were all in the mid 90s percent occupancy range 95 to 97 by the end of the 3rd quarter they had dipped a bit to ninety but since the end of the 3rd quarter between end of september and today we see a bump back up on those properties anywhere from three to four to five so the aspen ten west and clover house has properties currently are least ranging from 92 to 95 okay great and i just wanted to follow up on and h h h have rents trended basically flattened in here in the in the in the 4th quarter or has has there been any rent concessions to get those folks back j j do you want to talk through that sure so the rents have pretty much stayed a drop below what they were prior simply because we are trying to recapture occupancy so that we are well well you know positioned for when the market does come back to stop pushing rents again so for now we are doing the best we can and making sure that we do not lose any opportunities to rent apartments so there is a slight downtick in the rent per square foot because of that got it and and just one more for me you know are you tracking or able to track whether you know as the folks moved out from 2nd to 3rd quarter are they are they staying in market or are these people that are basically just exiting the markets maybe they will come back at some point in the future but are no longer in the greater new york msa to answer that again without the exact detail numbers the answer is a significant amount of them are moving out of out of the cities some of them depending on the property they are moving to let us say 2nd homes that they have in the suburbs many of them tell us when on the way out they say you know we wish this did not come to this we we hope to be back soon we really liked the the property and we are looking forward to when things get back to normal so we can return to the city okay well that is that is encouraging that is it for me thanks guys if there are any remaining questions or comments please indicate so now by pressing star one okay next question is coming from buck horne buck you lines live yeah hey thanks hey mike could you just quantify what what the bad debt expense was in the quarter i do not know if you ever did you break that up the operating expenses absolutely as a refresher in the 2nd quarter as you as you know we took about a $600000 bad debt expense and now into the 3rd quarter here again given the high collections rate collection rate as j j said we are still in this sort of in the high 90s so what we have seen is actually to date pretty good and strong performance even as the pandemic lingers all in all in the 3rd quarter we took approximate $660000 charge for bad debt so about a ten increase over the 2nd quarter but again given everything that has been going on with the

reminder we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow up to allow for enough time for other participants at this time i will now turn it over to vicente reynal chief executive officer thanks vik and good morning to everyone on the call i would like to kick off today is presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by covid nineteen and all the dedicated healthcare workers 1st responders and volunteers who are on the front lines all over the world battling this pandemic i would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the ingersoll rand employees around the world the pictures on slide four are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce who have adapted to the of the work environment to continue to serve our customers every day i hear of new example of our businesses providing mission critical products to our customers and i am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times while there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future one thing i am sure about is that ingersoll rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities and serving our customers at the center of everything we do and that would not be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees moving to slide five i would like to grind everyone on the critical priorities we are following during these challenging times when we closed the transaction a little over two months ago we could have never anticipated that within a matter of weeks we would be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruption to our customers supply chain and the day to day operations of the company our response speaks to how the irx toolkit has effectively helped us plan accelerate and adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities 1st ensuring the safety of our employees customers and the community 2nd around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain time and finally continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple capitalists to drive ongoing body creation the strength of ingersoll rand team align around these three priorities we will position the company to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more unified company the next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine that we call irx are really at the heart of how we operate as a company especially in these unprecedented times during the integration process we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company is purpose one that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better this purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams live on a daily basis creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company and the basis of how we do it is the ingersoll rand execution excellence process the simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across ingersoll rand to slide seven i would like to briefly update you on the company is response to the covid nineteen crisis since it has been swift and focused around two major components 1st is a health and safety and wellbeing of our employees customers our communities and 2nd business continuity not only within operations but across a larger supply chain starting 1st with health and safety we activated our covid nineteen passports in february and had a full coordinated company approach in early march just weeks after the creation of the new company our execution approach has served us very well as we are able to quickly implement enhanced site safety protocols and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely and it is very encouraging that our quick actions have been successful as we currently have had fewer than thirty confirmed cases of covid nineteen amongst our more than 17000 global employee base for is more than just implementing safety protocols it is also about supporting and engaging the employee base as a result we have implemented a number of measures including a global outreach program to employee feedback employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas not only did our team volunteer to take individual pay cuts furloughs and forgo vacation time this year they have thoughtful in depth suggestions many of which we are actively implementing today from a business continuity perspective starting 1st with our operations as we previously communicated we have seen plans largely in china italy and india impacted due to covid nineteen china was largely impacted in the month of january and february and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through march and into april as things are now largely back to normal italy and india saw about two month lag to china with operations being impacted in late march and into april and in these time our sites around the globe are 98 operational with india still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work the supply chain has seen a similar trend as the impact in china is largely behind us and we currently have no meaningful deliveries issues the americas and regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the u s and italy have started to come back online in the past few weeks we have seen the number of impact of suppliers drop by more than half which is a very good sign and we are supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible much like our operations india continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of may when governmental restrictions begin to ease we are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control so let me tell you about what we are doing here starting with slide eight through the use of irx we have been able to build the cost synergy funnel to over $350000000 with increases across all major savings categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity as a reminder we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost synergies of approximately $250000000 by the end of year three after closing we expect to incur approximately $450000000 of expense in connection with both achieving these cost synergies and the associated stand up of the new company as we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done we have dramatically increased the pace having already executed on $90000000 of annualized structural cost reductions with approximately $17000000 savings expected to be delivered in 2020 the majority of this savings are coming from headcount actions already taken in the past two months as we streamline the company and reduce the years within the organization in addition we have deployed the 1st wave of procurement initiative with rfqs for nearly 13rd of our historical direct materials span base already launched as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed in total we are now expecting to deliver approximately 35 of our overall synergy target in 2020 which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of ten to fifteen realization we are keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250000000 over a three year timeframe at this time to remain prudent on volume dependent synergies like procurement and i to be given the current environment it is not only the structural costs that we have taken out but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short term cost reductions to protect margins so let us move to slide nine to talk about that in q one despite the fifteen revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis we were able to limit adjusted ebitda incrementals to less than thirty with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments we expect that these additional actions would yield forty to $50000000 of incremental cost savings in the p l this year with the majority coming in the 2nd quarter and 3rd quarter we will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if the main environment does not accelerate in the 2nd half of the year we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly while we are making some top decisions to control costs one area that we are not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise much like we did back in 2015 at gardner denver when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains and new broad opportunities we are following the same playbook today investments in r d are being maintained at similar levels as prior years and we continue to fund target the commercial initiatives such as demand generation and now iot platforms this is all part of a strategy to play offense now especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration moving to slide ten let me talk about liquidity the company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity at the time of the merger we took the opportunity to reprice our legacy debt for placing the new $1900000000 firm loan to close the transaction all of our debt is a term loan based structure with very attractive pricing as the components are 175 and the euro component is +200 so some loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective and there are no maturities until 2027 liquidity also remains strong at $1600000000 as we finished the quarter with $556000000 of cash on the balance sheet and over a $1000000000 of capacity on our existing credit facilities as we look ahead we continue to see several opportunities to the cash as we remained very prudent on preserving liquidity opportunities exists across working capital and cash taxes and we will continue to see tailwinds from entrance expense in the 2nd half of the year as all $825000000 of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by september of 2020 even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper we are evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles given the attractive rate and covenant environment turning to slide eleven our commitment to our long term strategy remains unwavering you have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy as we are building the culture of ingersoll rand with our employees at the core we will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity and at the same time we will position the company for future growth both organically and through opportunistic targeted bolt on m a our business operates in a very fragmented markets and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio and importantly our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launch several of our esg orienter initiatives already overall we have several value creation levers as we look ahead and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain micro economic landscape i will now turn it over to emily to walk you through the financials emily thanks vicente on slide twelve you will see the as reported financials for the company as a reminder the reported financials include three months of legacy gardner denver and one month of the legacy ingersoll rand industrial segment in q one 2020 and only the legacy gardner denver businesses in q one of 2019 as a result the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction i will not spend a lot of time on this page as a result other than to mention that the as reported net income in the quarter includes $197000000 of amortization acquisition restructuring and other adjustments which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation turning to slide thirteen to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened as of january one 2018 from a total company perspective fx adjusted revenue in orders declined fourteen and seven respectively and were impacted by covid nineteen regionally we saw notable declines in asia pacific as well as sharp declines in the us and europe towards the end of the quarter most notably in the itns segment this led both to bill to finish at oneeleven for the quarter the company delivered 208000000 of adjusted ebitda a decline of 24 driven mostly by the volume declines in itns and the expected downturn in the hps segment adjusted ebitda margins were sixteenfour down 200 basis points from last year however our proactive cost controls within the business limited detrimental to 29 in terms of adjusted ebitda composition for the company the legacy gardner denver business delivered 97000000 as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately a 100000000 which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment the legacy ir businesses delivered 51000000 of adjusted ebitda in march as opposed to a combined 60000000 for january and february moving to slide fourteen the cash flow for the quarter was $60000000 on an as reported basis including $8000000 of capex the q one free cash flow includes $63000000 of outflows related to the transaction comprised of 38000000 of synergy delivery and stand up related costs and another 25000000 of transaction fees we also paid $38000000 of debt issuance costs in the quarter which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement bringing our total transaction related outflows in the quarter to a $100000000 from a leverage perspective we finished at twosix times and while we do expect to see some short term increase to leverage we have shown the ability to deliver historically as you can see on the right side of the page we will remain extremely disciplined on cash and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically specifically internal reinvestments for growth prudent debt pay down and opportunistic bolt on m a we have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time i will now turn it back to vicente to walk through the segments vicente thanks emily starting 1st with industrial technologies and services in slide fifteen the itns segment 1st quarter adjusted order intake was $889000000 down nine versus prior year excluding effects adjusted revenues in the quarter were $796000000 down seventeen excluding effects and leading to a book to bill ratio of onetwelve times from a regional perspective asia pacific revenues were down in the mid 30s with europe down fifteen and americans down seven all excluding effects we use these trend in as an indication of how q two could potentially play out meaning that the apec decline in q one is what we expect to see in americas in the near term this is the baseline we are using to plan the cost controls for our business but we are staying highly active with demand generation activities and pricing controls while we continue to demonstrate discipline in price generating over one in the quarter for these markets are more opaque than historically we are using our unique data acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment we break these out into two areas aftermarket and original equipment for aftermarket a leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data as we can see the hourly usage of 1000s of compressors worldwide that are connected to our remote monitoring system in america than europe we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few weeks of march of nearly thirty with some recovery in the past few weeks of april we are now using these as a way to know where our service teams need to focus while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity which is approximately fifty of the compressor business today for original equipment we are using demand generation leads we said in the past that demand general was the leading indicator of orders that we are will be getting in the next six to eight weeks with more than a 1000 leads per week we have a load of commercial insight in our system what we saw in the later weeks of march was a drop of thirty versus what we saw earlier in the quarter with similar trends in america and europe we have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of april but still approximately twenty to 25 off from the highs in the early part of a year let me give you now some color from a product line perspective we have seen very similar trends across compressors blowers and vacuums where we saw orders down in the mid to high single digits we have spoken about 3rd party industry reports in the past and the q one data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies according to a leading 3rd party report the market in the us was down mid single digits in dollars in the 1st quarter gardner denver were flat and ingersoll rand was down high single digits but when you look into the details you see the power of the two companies as gardner denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines while ingersoll rand took share on high horsepower compressors this was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal and we see these as a way to leverage the technology portfolio as well as the direct and indirect channels that both companies have power tools and lift which is part of the segment had a very tough quarter with orders and revenue down both over twenty the business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases that online retailers typically make in the 1st quarter to support 1st half of the year revenue however this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market many online retailers switch their focus to household essentials moving to non gaap adjusted ebitda itns deliver $135000000 in the quarter which was down 25 non gaap adjusted ebitda margin was seventeen which was down 150 versus points from the prior year other cost mitigation efforts help limit decremental to 25 in a segment that typically has basic incrementals of 35 to forty before cost actions moving to slide sixteen to the precision and science technology segment overall the segment have solely performance in these economic environment as adjusted orders were 219000000 off two x of x adjusted revenue was 192000000 down nine x of x on strong prior year comes up twelve x of x growth and shipment delays due to covid nineteen this platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets in the 1st quarter we saw orders growth high single digits in the legacy medical pump business as we are leading key player in several applications like oxygen concentrators respirators and liquid handling you can see many of the applications that our medical pump go into at the bottom of the page our team have been working 247 providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight covid nineteen now and in the future the remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down two x of x with the majority due to covid lockdowns in january and february in china and towards the end of the quarter in india what is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and all this activity across many of the prog lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in a more industrial end market moving to non gaap adjusted ebita pnac delivered $53000000 in the quarter which is down six non gaap adjusted ebitda margin was 27seven up 120 basis points driven by strong cost controls and productivity leading to the incremental margins of only fifteen moving to slide seventeen and the specialty vehicle technology segment priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner we see that these segment can expand margins with the use of the same irx tools we have used across all the segments and expect to see improvements of these business moving forward having said that this business performed very well in the 1st quarter adjusted orders were $230000000 you know and adjusted revenue was $185000000 up eight and seven respectively with the to bail of onefifteen growth was driven by the strength in gold connectivity and consumer product line the business saw strong double digit order momentum in early january and february but as the pandemic hit the us we saw sharp decline in the 2nd half of march while there is a lot to be excited about we are expecting q two to be down compared to last year for a couple of reasons 1st last year was a tough comp as a business had some supplier issues in the 1st quarter where some problem was shifted to the 2nd quarter of 2019 and two the business is not immune to this current environment while april orders were down here a year we are starting to see some sequential improvement in orders we feel this is driven by a couple of factors 1st in the consumer we deem people to quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques wildly used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate and 2nd with the work we have done on proactive covid prevention across all of our locations we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed moving to non gaap adjusted ebita specialty vehicles deliver $18000000 in the quarter down one non gaap adjusted ebita was ninenine which was down eighty basis points due to strategic growth investments ampword mix moving to slide eighteen and the high pressure solution segment in the business perform above our expectations in a tough operating environment with adjusted orders of $84000000 and adjusted revenues of $96000000 down 26 and 29 respectively i suspected the revenue base and the business was nearly ninety aftermarket and the team executed very well commercially with sequential adjusted orders up six and sequential adjusted revenues up 26 versus the 4th quarter of 2019 we continue to see shared gain opportunities in the aftermarket and specifically consumables where we saw orders and revenue up double digit sequentially these allowed us to deliver non gaap adjusted ebita of $24000000 and margins of 24six which was down from last year level of thirtyeight but sequentially better by over 400 basis points as we peep to the 2nd quarter and rest of the year the key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity we can measure that in multiple ways but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market as a reminder each frac fleet has about sixteen to eighteen trucks with each truck carrying one pump each pump has a fluid and every fluid end utilizes consumables while q one at 2020 on average we saw 318 active fleets the exit rate in march was 240 we expect to see a substantial drop in the 2nd quarter where we believe is the active leads due to the recent dynamics in the market with the over supply and lower pricing for our info impact on revenues within the segment and because of that we are taking very proactive stands to drive the proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come moving to slide nineteen we wanted to provide a quick overall the total company is down approximately twenty in orders if the month began very slow particularly in us and european mar by the order momentum throughout april we expect total revenue to be low in terms of orders both industrial technology and services and specialty vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average while precision and science technology is performing considerably better with positive year over year orders performance thus far as a result of continuous strength in medical pumps and not surprisingly the high pressure solution segment is not a as the market resets for what will likely be a prolonged downturn that we expect will last for a number of quarters as we look forward due to the uncertain environment that we find ourselves in we will not be providing q two or total year for the best manage our business and make sure we are taking the right steps to manage multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impact on cash flows a current model shows that the business will in annual basis to be cashflow breakeven using certainly conservative assumptions around working capital and capex couple with the cost sactions we have taken thus far we feel that these puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compared to current order trends and coupled with our current liquidity position for instance like twenty for some concluding remarks i want to say that we will win manage through what we will no doubt be of top 2nd quarter we feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has not changed ingersoll rand is a premier industrial company over our transformation we have multiple levers for accelerating creation while being very focused on the current our liquidity with opportunities to increase these by onlooking cash as well as taking advantage of the current rate environment we will continue to drive a culture of execution and we will continue to pay attention to the particularly on the current condition is to be strategic on bolt on acquisition with this we will turn to q a at this time i would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question number one on your telephone key pad if you would like to remove yourself from the queue you may press the pound yourself to one question and w your 1st question comes from andy caplets from citigroup your line is open good morning guys how are you morning andy vicente can you give us more color into the april order decline you are seeing and your your largest segment in itns 1st of all how long do you think the change in customer behavior from that power tool business now have you know smaller optio and exposure in it now so there are discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses given it is their more project versus the industrial compressor business yeah andy let me just give you a little bit of color i mean as you saw we said roughly you know april total orders down twenty book to bill greater than one from a book to bill perspective you know the industrial technology and the position on science where we are greater than one and obviously leading the way i will say you know in terms of in terms of ips in particular you know i will categorize it as you know the the short cycle was mostly most impacted in the quarter and continue to see you know some relatively weakness here moving forward i mean it is it is it is mostly correlated to i guess maybe the pmi you know from from the down in the mainstream which is what we consider to be more on the loan cycle i will say you know comparatively a bit more stable in the 1st quarter and and and we kind of continue to see maybe some of that in the month of april again typically we tend to get the orders for that loan cycle now in the 1st half of the year in order to get shipments in the 2nd half and and and and from a ppl p from a power tool perspective yeah i mean rough rough quartering in the in the in in q one as as i alluded i mean last year they we are seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion into online retailers and and you saw that in the 1st quarter many of these only reta retailers they moved to having other kind of more household goods or or or critical needs to fight covid covid nineteen and clearly you know these business saw some of the impact i would say april sale is relatively slow so we have not seen the the the people that with the momentum of of the power tool business so that that is helpful vicente and i am sure you you expected us to ask about decremental margin in some way so so let me just ask it like this obviously you know good result in q one of close to thirty you know how do i think about decrementals with high pressure solutions you know the orders down eighty can you hold decremental there in the mid 40s at what point you know the fixed costs become a problem i know you talked about accelerating the rest of the business can the rest of the business hold thirty decrementals with the twenty decline that you are seeing overall in the rest of the business yeah so so i will say andy i mean that is that is kinda what we are targeting for and i mean as you have seen you know we have performed well in the down cycles in the past i think we have a good solid playbook that we that we executed in the in the fifteen sixteen that included both not only the in industrial downturn but also an upstream downturn you know base decrementals they tend to be around forty across the business with a slightly higher in in businesses like the high pressure as you mentioned as well as the precision and signs because of the nice high gross margins that both businesses have and you know lower on the specialty vehicles and the indulgent technologies they tend to play in that kind of forty pers forty range you know your seeing that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies and the short term actions to protect the margin we saw as we have mentioned you know some very good 1st quarter results for the total business under thirty and and q two we clearly see a bit more pressure from a topline perspective but we will continue to manage decrementals with the target being closer closer to that thirty of of of of of of the and you know when you think about the actions we are we are clearly taking much more aggressive actions in the high pressure around course actions based on what we see here with a lot of our data points and and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have very helpful vicente stay well thank you you too andy your next question comes from julian mitchell from barclays your line is open hi good morning good morning julian m morning maybe just a a 1st question on that point on decremental margins so if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the year and also of that forty to 50000000 of of other costs out actions and should those mean that decremental margins narrow or not necessarily depending on mix and some other things he maybe break it down into the two buckets as as you suggest to me on the forty to fifty that we spoke about that are kind of more related to discretionary or kind of volume related those are largely 2nd quarter and the 3rd quarter with a good majority i would say more more so on the on the 2nd quarter from my from the cost synergy perspective $1000000 you know probably eighty to $90000000 of end year you know growth and downturn i would say that it is kind of consistent 3rd quarter and 4th quarter while the other roughly you know ten to $20000000 that comes from procurement it is really more weighted towards that kind of q three and q four then maybe just my 2nd question for you or for emily around the free cash flow is that a good performance in q one just wondered you know you the assumptions around a a break even free cash but assume we play out you know what kind of you know of sales are down called it twenty 25 for the year what type of free cash flow conversion should we expect you know how do you see working capital moving you heard i think in the free cash that $63000000 of transaction and separation cash cost in q one what is the rough assumptions for the year yes we are very pleased with with the q one cash performance as you as you saw there julian and we have been managing cash you know from to put in good processes and strong controls around it given the current crisis we we we expect cash to still be to move forward but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move through wi and we are really managing you know payments as to the collections were receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions you know what the future holds a lot of that is you know going to depend zero for sure but we know we will maintain our cash position in our liqui and how about the cost is there any very rough g i would post for the year in light of about 63000000 in q one there will be some some incremental i do not have the i do not have the figure at my fingertips at the moment julian but i can i can get back to you on that your next question comes from michael holleran from viad good morning everyone hope everyone is doing well so so could we just talk about the the synergy funnel you referenced you know what what are some of the incremental sources zero you originally identified 250 m maybe talk about the difference you have seen no longer terms some of the revenue synergy opportunities you see yeah a a a as you recall you know we always said that that we were going for you know as we with sixty days pays into into into into the transaction we have all these serviceability as to what that funnel could could could potentially be roughly the a $100000000 comes from a combination of structural savings a rationalization kind of non manufacturing alluded to on the investor side we have now a pretty good database zero all the the locations across the world and that is given us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize not so much the m are coming year two year three but more more the the older kind of perspective so so the 2nd part of the question liquidity is in a strong position you know some of the the one off things is operation you know and and some of the extra things emily just referenced what would it take for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the with the cash outflow and then secondarily are you to do that that we are going into some sort of recession here who knows how long opportunity is going to few deploy capital more toward the m and a s side of things over the next couple of years and are you positioned for that today and any kind of thoughts on how you are you are thinking really about that that capital side over the next 69 plus months yeah no absolutely mike i mean i think y y you know clearly over the next couple of years continue to be a a really part of our strategy you know we see it is a very unique environment right now we still see at this point in time some very good funnel on also very good funnel around you know ingersoll technologies but they are really more related towards thank you your next question comes from nigel co from wolfe research your line is open good morning how are you guys yeah good thanks so technical performance so a little bit performer performance and it seems like most of that came from the legacy ir businesses can you just maybe just kind of spell out in a bit more detail how much that can be explained by the of the industrial of the i also what happened with service during the quarter nigel what happened to what yeah well what happened to s our service yeah yeah i think tell me china was definitely impacted largely in in in january and february the legacy ir business they have a printer with sizeable china exposure you know in terms of in terms of the service you know we we we still serve as better typically we typically we sold roughly about two times from a percentage perspective better performance than that than the original equipment and just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here particularly as as you know ways of comparing some of the you know the industrial technology is composed of multiple technologies compressors vacuums and blowers and a c compressor business is clearly within the when we are specifically compare to some other competitors couple of data points that we look at so the 3rd party report at the same time you know to just to give you a further perspective the legacy gardner denver business in q one orders were down in the low single in the market and you know since since we since we did not own the legacy ir for the full quarter we just tend to not comment on what we saw specifically you know i mean in february that they sold from an order perspective but that hopefully gives you a good perspective as to how on even on the legacy great thanks thanks v vicente business this this business is so small na that is so much involvement but if if if if it is down eight in the quarter implies you know i mean is it possible to to given that you are kind of expecting this business to to be k kind of like for longer yeah would you expect revenues to kind of like just bounce on the trough here so for next several quarters i mean any any count that would be helpful yeah and i also so for sure you know that is what we are targeting to be you know the bre breakeven and even even positive i mean we are taking some pretty pretty aggressive actions a 100 after market and consumable so that that kind of carries a much better margin profile too as well and you know those factories that are kind of not not not needed based on volume i mean we are basically keeping them close or or very very low exposure so he had a good playbook on how how to navi have done extensive work a and you know i think we we see that we can definitely overcome these kind of long term term and our plan is that it is going to be down for a while and and to the same question you know i mean clearly it is a it is a it is a market that as you saw we just invested in a new fluid and technology so and you know we can be ready for capturing s great thanks very much our next question comes from jeff sprague from vertical research partners thank you good morning everyone morning to you w why do not we just come back to service for a moment vincente interesting comment about the utilization down from thirty but how do we actually interpret and a a apply that to a forward sales are going to be down thirty and the serv does not believe i do not know if you have enough data historically to kind of piece that together but what does that down thirty tell you yeah jeff great question i hinted so in terms of the historical data we do not have a lot of historical because as you know as you can imagine a lot of these remote monitoring systems and connectivity with the iot platforms that we both companies have now is fairly new but we have enough data to to then break it down by the specific sub and market the indication here is that it finally know where are those market that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective so it is helping us to redirect the teams it is also helping us to really better serve our customers and making sure that we are still more resilient from that perspective you know in terms of in terms of being down thirty i mean i think we just see that as as a bit of indication as to what could happen here here but as you he was a great correct correlation of we do not have a lot of historical data to so what we are doing is just taking that data point to keep focusing them on those areas regions and markets that that we are still seeing some very good utilization of their compressors and and any answers you noted its obviously includes more than compressors that are you suggesting that those other sort of products ar areas outside of vacuums and blowers were substantial yes so for sure yes i mean for sure the the power tool and the lifting business was one that it was worse than that i mean the power tools as cats they have two main product lines i mean it is that tool business but also they have a a lifting business that is kind of more related to to factory consumption or factory rationalization so i think you know that that was impacted more so and then china as a region was definitely heavily impacted and you know from from the other product lines in terms of the longer cycle which these are kind of brands like a nash gil and liko green vacuums those are more longer cycle and those were i would say more stable and resilient right thank you your next question comes from david rosseau from evercore isi your line is open good morning my question is about in the its the inventory and the channel and you think about some of the recent improvement you have seen can you give us some sense on any sequential improvement sort of a leader lag okay and also the mix so your business is being short cycle versus long cycle can you just give us some sense of the inventory in those channels the the lag you would need to see or that you would experience if if say the pmi has got better for example yeah there i mean i think you know when when look when we look at the inventory in those channels i mean there is just no these from a from a compressor perspective which is obviously the one that has the biggest size of the distribution that work and and it is also a more particularly towards the gardner denver branded products you know we do not tend to have a lot of inventory because these these are particularly smaller distributors more so more than localized they do not tend to to put a lot of cash upfront to have compressors on the shelf so to speak i mean maybe on the smaller compressors they they may but not on the medium to high level compressors and and the inventory will come in more on consumables aftermarket i am really move fairly fa fairly well i mean they turn pretty quickly vicente just so i am clear is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in its or have you seen some you know little improvement in order sequentially and i will be curious is that more short cycle or long cycle yeah i know yeah great question yeah it is i would i would categorize it as a set of civilization and initially and then obviously when you look within the month i mean a at the month of april you know there some slight improvement on the 2nd half of april c but again was that more short cycle improvement short cycle yeah more short cycle yeah short cycle all right thank you v thank you very much appreciate it sure your next question comes from josh poklinsky f is open hi good morning all morning josh so vicente i guess you know e everyone here on the call kind of have same most questions tha so we covered a lot of ground already but i guess you know just with some of the commentary around utilization and with the comments you made around supply chain interruption how much of the decline that you are seeing and yeah i guess this comment is mostly an itns comment is related to you know customer shut downs or supply chain interruption in in some form like you know the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back cause i i i think some of these points on you know service or utilization that maybe that is not the the the steady state you know state of the world there yeah just i will say more so i i i in in china if i if you want to think about it kind of that disruption completely also in the in the 1st quarter maybe some disruption from the perspective of in in europe particularly in italy i mean we do have some very good manufacturing base in italy and and and we although we stayed operationally i mean most of our suppliers had to shut down i i would say that now as kind of the comment that i made before we see kind of these lower demand level kind of getting more stabilized but but you know still you know not seeing that that kind of recovery and we are just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will will play out okay then switching over to the to the synergy funnel i mean it sounds like the the year three a pipeline of activity you know kind of has to stay there as you know back on other things 1st since we are manufacturing centric fair to say that the incremental step up in synergies than in the year two is it is smaller i guess is you know it is just more of a pull forward from year two or or you kind of implicitly saying hey we think there is more than 250 here we are just you know we are working on this as fast as we can and we will update you as we know more yeah i mean i think that is exactly the case we think we think we want to keep it at 250 just because we think it is prudent and and we think it is prudent because we are we are i mean clearly focused on a lot of the internal funnel and execution you see how we accelerated and we executed i mean this is not just talking about the executed but there is a component around procurement and and and i to be savings innovative value that is going independent and when we did a 250 mi $1000000 customers in your funnel it was on based on 2019 kind of runway level so to speak or spend levels so we just want to be prudent from from kind of going out there and saying that the 250 will increase you know once we are we are ready we will definitely and when we see as kind of more stability or noma normalization in the markets maybe we come back with that but at this point in time we are we are accelerating what we can control and we know that we can control that structural head countdown and that is exactly what we executed we know we can control a lot of the quick gains in procurement because commodities are lower and we are executing that and we know we can control a lot of discretionary spend and that is exactly what we also executed so we are very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute right appreciate the color your next question comes from nathan jones from stiefel your line is open morning everyone morning nathan hey you know revenue down eightsix x fx margins up 120 basis points so clearly some very good control lag on what drove the very good decremental there how do you say the decremental is going forward and and maybe any color you can give us on what you think the long term margin opportunities in that business hey nathan this is you know i will i will say some very good cost controls but also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical business if you remember last year when we talked about the medical business we were seeing upwards of 200 basis points margin improvement and the medical business finishing last year at roughly you know thirty 31 ebitda margin so again very good momentum from that business and and and clearly as we saw some suppliers in the market the team continued to execute those targets that they needed they needed needed to get done you know i think e when when when when when you look at this business that i mean has some very nice gross margins and you know the decremental the base decrementals are typically you know 45 or so i mean pretty good job that the team data here in order to get that decremental down to the fifteen and i will say you know from a long term perspective we will we will definitely come come back with with with giving some kind of medium to longterm perspective i will just do a quick comparison then you can see that medical we were able to you know not not only you know just a few years ago that medical business was not the 25 26 ebitda margin and we finished you know last year in the 31 ebitda margin and there is a just a lot of good commonalities between the medical and the legacy you know pfs on aero business that are within this segment okay maybe just a one on receivables when you look through that do you see any customer credit risk any colonel risk there i guess it is particularly an upstream comment given the way given the way that market is going but anywhere else you see you know any potential issues in receivables how are you going about managing customer credit those kinds of things i mean i would say not necessarily they i mean i think it is r it is one that we we we we we live by day by day i mean clearly the on the on the high pressure solution which is as you just mentioned the most exposed i mean customers are still paying they take longer to pay but they still pay you know they they they also realize that you know from an upstream perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again so we have been pretty strict in in many cases that that we need to see the payments or we will stop shipments and then we seize to to provide any type of any type of output of products e either now or later in the in the future so i think we are we are we are we are we are really executing a good playbook here on on collections for the teams excellent thank you thank you your next question comes from nicole deblase from deutsche bank your line is open yeah thanks good morning guys good morning nicole so a lot of this has been answered we have covered a lot of ground so far but i just wanted to ask one into next year as we think about you know approaching or recovery there is clearly a lot of moving pieces here we have got you know more structural cost savings coming through presumably you have temporary costs probably coming back to the business and then just kind of dovetailing all of that with typical incremental margins i am not sure you know how best you can do this vicente but it would be really you know helpful to kind of characterize the way you see incrementals coming out you know on the other side of this downturn yeah i know so yeah that that is so great i mean i think i think you know we typically see kind of the base what i call the base level of incremental to be you know for the total business between 35 to forty again you know when you look at precision and science maybe higher than that specialty vehicles lower than that where maybe industrial technology is about that level you know definitely we will we will we will see a little bit of a headwind as we see a lot of these structural activities that we are doing to to come through fruition we also see a lot of you know tailwinds i am sorry we see tailwinds that a lot of these kind of structural costs come out we see some of some of the headwinds but you know as as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we kind of work work with the teams we will definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin obviously to be at a minimum at bad days or more okay your next question comes from john wells from credit suisse your line is open sorry your next question is from markus nitton meyer from ubs your line is open yeah hi good morning everybody good morning markus one more on the on the hi hi good morning on on synergies i i do appreciate that obviously procurement is volume dependent but you flag your ten to 20000000 savings realized in 2020 what you currently assume a sort of food run rate savings how is that wave one have to spend which i think it is a it is a 3rd of your overall spend and how should we think about more medium term for the other two thirds if you assume that at some point in a normalized road get back to that 2019 level le let us start here yeah i think if you think about it ten to twenty you know coming in in in in this year as you go into 2021 assuming maybe kind of current volume levels it will be twenty to 40000000 so that is maybe at least that what you can see here coming from wave one on a on an annualized level that current volumes and not only this it is only covering you know a portion of the total span with ways 21 way three coming off here in the 2nd half of the year right and i is there sort of an estimate you can give us what that would have been at nineteen volume levels that sort of you know twenty to forty i mean it will definitely be much a little bit higher than that i mean i i i i would not you know i think i think at this point in time you you could say you know forty to fifty could be upwards of sixty okay okay and then and then 2nd question on on capital allocation you flagged in the slides was interesting bolt on in pst it is obviously pretty fragment market you probably have a sheriffs call it sixteen in in that space how do you how do you think about this how does that segment look like in a few years i mean it is it is you know from an after market to stick this i know it is a design win and replacement business so the the aftermarket dollars per sale share it it is relatively small compared to your company average but but but how do you think about this sort of it just struck me that it was it was slides specifically in the slides yeah i mean i think i think this is a segment we like a lot by the by the way that that th these businesses are kind of so kind of niche and and very very solid market positions and and it has just a load of great descriptors such as you know kind of high gross margins and and and very specialized bombs that that are kind of really solidly mission critical in the in the in the processes where they where they apply you know we we continue to see that there is a lot of potential not only in organic but also organically and we are doing a lot of work on that whether you take technologies like the arl and combine that with the with the like a either a haskell branded product or a milton roy product and then you can actually create some uniqueness in terms of applications and then enter some new markets and that is what what a lot of the team are doing is you know how do we are being thoughtful and mindful on on some of those vertical markets and kind of new niche adjacent tech areas that we want to play in and not only do that organically but then see what other technologies from a bolt on perspective we can we can acquire so so a lot of a load of really great work strategically going on on this segment to really picture these on how do we kind of build up thanks a lot good luck thank you your next question comes from john walsh from credit suisse your line is open hi good morning sorry about that i had some technical difficulties earlier i am glad to hear everyone is doing well you know maybe just one question here you alluded on the call to to share gains on kind of both the legacy gdi and and i our businesses wondering if you could put a little more color around what is driving those something on the the product side is the you know some of the end market strategies you were doing previously around you know more niche markets like paper and maybe some competitive pressures from smaller guys just any kind of color you could provide there would be helpful sure johnny so e and and i categorize it i mean what i what i said on the call is that it is on specific horsepowers and and what we saw that we liked is that this is in the u s based on the 3rd party report and and and and we liked it because it was not very very complimentary so if you look at the legacy gardner denver we sold some share takes in the low to medium horsepower while we saw the ingersoll rand some shared take on the higher kind of larger horsepower compressors i will categorize that as you know ingersoll rand has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the on the larger horsepower while as you know you know from a gardner denver perspective we have been more focused on the medium to small compressor and and i think you know this is what i mentioned on the call that this is a great hypothesis that we had on these great merge and and combining the two companies because now we have great new complimentary products and spectrum of technologies that that you know a lot of these that i mentioned is on the oil lubricated which is very good solid kind of corporate look nine but as we spoke about during the april call now also the oil free frontline spectrum so so again it is it is it is it is new technology new products and and be able to to to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the program the teams are launching great i appreciate taking the question thank you john there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to the company thank you i do want to close out by saying thanks to everyone for for your interest in ingersoll rand i want to do another shout out and thank you to our employees that are always there doing a lot of work here to stay health stay safe to safety and at the same time you know provide to our customers the mission critical pros that that that are needed in these kind of current market conditions so hopefully everyone stays safe and and healthy and we will look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect",

off  today is presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by covid nineteen and all the dedicated healthcare workers 1st responders and volunteers who are on the front line i would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all all the international english 1st employees around the world the pictures on slide four are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce who have adapted to the new realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers every day i hear of new examples of our businesses providing mission critical products to our customers and i am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times well there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future one thing i am sure about is that ingersoll rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities and serving our customers at the center of everything we do and that would not be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees moving on to slide five i would like to grant everyone on the critical priorities we are following during these challenging times when we closed the transaction a little over two months ago we could have never anticipated that within a matter of weeks the world would change so dramatically our response speaks to how the irx toolkit has effectively helped us plan accelerate and adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities 1st ensuring the safety of our employees customers and the community 2nd around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain times and finally continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation the strength of our english ordnance team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more unified company the next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine that we call irx are really at the heart of how we operate as a company especially in times of crisis during the integration process we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company is purpose one that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better this purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams live on a daily basis creates the framework of what we want to achieve as a company and the basis of how we do it is the ingersoll rand execution excellence process the simplicity of this process is the key to our success good morning everyone my name is john and i am the ceo of xyz company i would like to take a moment to address the current situation and how it affects us the speed and flexibility of this company allows us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across our entire organization as of today i would like to briefly update you on our company is response to the covid nineteen crisis since it has been swift and focused around two major components 1st is the health and safety and well being of our employees customers and communities 2nd business continuity not only within operations but across the larger supply chain thank you we activated our covid nineteen tax force in february and had a full coordinated company approach in early march just weeks after the creation of the new company our execution approach has served us very well as we were able to quickly implement enhanced site safety protocols and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely and it is very encouraging that our quick actions have been successful as we currently have fewer than thirty confirmed cases of covid nineteen as a result we have implemented a number of measures including a global outreach program to solicit employee feedback our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost saving ideas not only did our team volunteer to take individual pay cuts furloughs and forgo vacation time but we also have implemented a number of the suggestions that were provided they had thoughtful in depth suggestions many of which were actively implemented today from a business continuity perspective starting 1st with our operations as we previously communicated we have seen plans largely in china italy and india impacted due to covid nineteen china was largely impacted in the month of january and february and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through march and into april as things are now largely back to normal the italian and indian operations saw about a two month lag to china with operations being impacted in late march and into april and in this time our sites around the globe are 98 operational with india still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work the supply chain has seen a similar trend as the impact in china is largely behind us and we currently have no meaningful than ever issues the americas and emea regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers are stabilizing in the past few weeks we have seen the number of impacted suppliers drop by more than half which is a very good sign and we are supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions wherever possible much like our operations india continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain and we expect the situation to improve in the latter half of may when governmental restrictions begin to ease we are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control let me tell you about what we are doing here so speaking with slide eight through the use of irx we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over $350000000 we increases across all major categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity as a reminder we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost energies of approximately $250000000 by the end of year three after closing we have approximately $450000000 of expense in connection with both achieving these cost synergies and the associated stand up of the new company as we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believed we could accelerate based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done we have dramatically increased the pace having already executed on $90000000 of annualized structural cost reductions $70000000 in savings expected to be delivered in 2020 the majority of these savings are coming from headcount actions already taken in the past two months as we streamlined the company and reduced layers within the organization in addition we have deployed the 1st wave of procurement initiatives with rfqs for nearly 13rd of our historical direct materials spend base already launched as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed we are now expecting to deliver approximately 35 of our overall synergy target in 2020 which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of ten to fifteen realization we are keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250000000 over a three year timeframe at this time to remain prudent on volume dependent synergies like procurement and i to be given the current environment it is not only the structural cost now let us move to slide nine to talk about that in q one despite the fifteen revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis we were able to limit adjusted ebitda decrementals to less than thirty with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments we will yield forty to $50000000 of incremental cost savings in the pnl this year with the majority coming in the 2nd and 3rd quarters we will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if the demand environment does not accelerate in the 2nd half of the year we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly but we are making some tough decisions to control costs one area that we are not cutting back on is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise just like we did back in 2015 at denver when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains and new product opportunities were following the same playbook today investments in r and d are being maintained at similar levels as prior years and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as demand generation and our iot platforms this is all part of the strategy to play offense now especially as we bring the two companies together moving on to slide ten let me talk about liquidity the company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity at the time of the merger we took the opportunity to reprice our legacy debt while placing the new $1900000000 term loan to close this transaction all of our debt is a term loan b structure with very attractive pricing as a us component our libor +175 and the euro component is a eurodollar +200 the term loans have no financial covenants from a main street perspective and there are no maturities until 2027 liquidity also remains strong at $1600000000 as we finished the quarter with $556000000 of cash on the balance sheet and over a $1000000000 of capacity on our existing credit facilities as we look ahead we continue to see several opportunities to on lend the cash as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity opportunities exist across working capital and cash taxes and we will continue to see telwinds from interest expense in the 2nd half of the year as all $802500000 of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by september of 2020 even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper or evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles given the attractive rate and covenant environment turning to slide eleven our commitment to shareholders remains unwavering you have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy as we are building the culture of english oak ranch with our employees at the core we will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity and at the same time we will position the company for future growth both organically and through opportunistic targeted bolt on m a our business operates in various fragmented markets and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio and importantly our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launch several of our esg oriented initiatives already overall we have several value creation levers as we look ahead and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain macroeconomic landscape i will now turn it over to emily to walk you through the financials emily thanks on slide twelve you will see the azz reported financials for the company the reported financials include three months of legacy gardner denver and one month of the legacy ingersoll rand industrial segment in q 122 and only the legacy gardner denver businesses in q one of nineteen in addition includes $197000000 of amortization acquisition restructuring and other adjustments which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation turning to slide thirteen to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened as of january 12018 from a total company perspective fx adjusted revenue and orders declined fourteen and seven respectively and were impacted by covid nineteen regionally we saw notable declines in asia pacific as well as sharp declines in the us and europe towards the end of the quarter most notably in the itns segment this led book to bill to finish at oneeleven for the quarter the company delivered $282000000 in revenue adjusted ebitda of $1000000 a decline of 24 driven mostly by the volume declines in itns and the expected downturn in the hps segment adjusted ebitda margins were sixteenfour down 200 basis points from last year however our proactive cost controls within the business limited detrimental to 29 in terms of adjusted ebitda composition for the company we have the legacy gardener denver business delivered 97000000 as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately 100000000 which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment the legacy ir businesses delivered 51000000 of adjusted ebitda beyond march as opposed to a combined 60000000 for january and february including $8000000 of capex the q one free cash flow includes $63000000 of outflows related to the transaction comprised of 38000000 of synergy delivery and standup related costs and another 25000000 of transaction fees we also paid $38000000 of debt issuance costs in the quarter which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement bringing our total to $620000000 our net action related outflows in the quarter to a $100000000 from a leverage perspective we finished at twosix times and while we do expect to see some short term increase to leverage we have shown the ability to delever historically as you can see on the right side of the page we will remain extremely disciplined on cash and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically specifically we are looking at a leverage ratio of twofive times internal reinvestments for growth prudent debt paydown and opportunistic bolt on m a we have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time i will now turn it back to vasente to walk through the segments vasente thanks emily starting 1st with industrial technologies and services on slide fifteen the itn segment 1st quarter adjusted order intake was $808900000 we use this trending as an indication of how q two could potentially play out meaning that q two should be a period of growth and potentially better results this is the basis we are using to plan the cost control for our business but we are staying highly active with the man generation activities and pricing controls but we continue to demonstrate this discipline in price generating over one in the quarter while these markets are more opaque than historically we are using our unique data acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment for after market a leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data as we can see the hourly usage of 1000s of compressors worldwide that are connected to our remote monitoring systems in america and europe we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last three weeks of march of nearly thirty with some recovery in the past three weeks of april we are now using these as a way to know where our service teams need to focus we are using it as a leading indicator for after market activity which is approximately fifty of the compressor business today for original equipment we are using the demand generation leads we said in the past that demand generation was a leading indicator of orders that we would be getting in the next six to eight weeks with more than a 1000 leads per week we have a lot of commercial insight in our system what we saw in the latter weeks of march was a drop of three versus what we saw earlier in the quarter with similar trends in america and europe we have seen also early signs of improvement over the past three weeks of april but still approximately twenty to 25 off from the highs in the early part of the year let me give you now some color from a product line perspective we have seen very similar trends across compressors blowers and vacuums where we saw orders down in the mid to high single digits we have spoken about 3rd party industry reports in the past and the q one data speaks well for the overall outcome according to a leading 3rd party report the market in the us was down mid single digits in dollars in the 1st quarter garner denver branded products were flat and ingersoll rand branded products was down high single digits but when you look into the details you see the power of the two companies as garner denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines while ingersoll rand took share on high horsepower compressors this was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal the business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases that online retailers typically make in the 1st quarter to support 1st half of the year revenue however this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market many online retailers moving to non gap adjustment at itns the lever was $135000000 in the quarter which was down 25 non gap adjustment at itns margin was seventeen which was down 150 basis points from the prior year other cost mitigation efforts helped limit decrementals to 25 in a segment that typically has base decrementals of 35 to forty before cost actions overall the segment has solely performed in this economic environment as adjusted orders were 218000000 off two xfx adjusted revenue was 192000000 down nine xfx on strong prior year coms of twelve xfx growth and shipment delays due to covid nineteen this platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets in the 1st quarter we saw orders grow high single digits in the legacy medical pump business as we are a leading key player in several applications like oxygen concentrators respirators and liquid handling you can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into at the bottom of the page our teams have been working 24 seven providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight covid nineteen now and in the future the remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative order performance down two good morning everyone the majority of the decrease is due to covid lock downs in january and february in china and towards the end of the quarter in india what is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in the more industrial end markets moving on to non gap adjuster pnst delivers $53000000 in the quarter which is down six non gap adjuster pnst delivers $53000000 in the quarter which is down six thank you we see that this segment can expand margins with the use of the same irx tools we have used across all other segments and expect to see improvements in this area having said that this business performed very well in the 1st quarter adjusted orders were $230000000 and adjusted revenue was $185000000 up eight and seven respectively with a book to bill of onefifteen growth was driven by the strength in gold connectivity and consumer products lines the business saw strong double digit order momentum in early january and february but as the pandemic hit the us we saw sharp decline well there is a lot to be excited about we are expecting q two to be down compared to last year for couple reasons 1st last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the 1st quarter where some product was shifted to the 2nd quarter of 2019 and two the business is not immune to this current environment while april orders were down year over year we are starting to see some sequential improvement in orders we feel this is driven by a couple factors 1st in the consumer products good morning this is a message from the ceo of xyz corporation we are pleased to announce that our team has quickly leveraged demand generation techniques widely used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate secondly with the work we have done on proactive covid nineteen prevention across all of our locations we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed moving on to non gaap adjusted ebita special vehicles deliver $18000000 in the quarter down one non gaap adjusted ebita was ninenine moving to slide eighteen and the high pressure solution segment in the business performed above our expectations in a tough operating environment with adjusted orders of $84000000 and adjusted revenues of $96000000 down 26 and 29 respectively with sequential adjustments of orders of six and sequential adjustments of revenues of 26 versus the 4th quarter of 2019 we continue to see share gain opportunities in the after market and specifically consumables where we saw orders and revenues up double digits sequentially as we proceed into the 2nd quarter of the year a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity we can make sure that in multiple ways but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational on the market as a reminder each frac fleet has about sixteen to eighteen trucks with each truck carrying one pump each pump has a fluid end and every fluid end utilizes consumables well q one through q twenty on average we saw 300 to 180 active fleets in march the rate was 240 we expect to see a substantial drop in the 2nd quarter where we believe fifty active fleets due to the recent dynamic in the market with oversupply and lower pricing for all grades of oil impacting revenues within this segment and because of that we are taking very proactive stance to drive proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarter to come moving to slide nineteen we want to provide a quick snapshot of our performance and the total company is down approximately twenty in orders that the month began very slow particularly in us and european markets by the order momentum throughout april we expect total revenue to be lower in terms of orders both industrial technology and services and specialty vehicle segments were right inline with the total company average but precision and science technology is performing considerably better with positive year over year orders performance thus far as a result of continuous strength in medical pumps and not surprisingly the high pressure solution segment is now at the bottom of the market as the market resets for what will likely be a prolonged downturn that we expect will last for a number of quarters as we look forward due to the uncertain environment that we find ourselves in we will not be providing q two or total year to best manage our business and ensure we are taking the right steps to manage multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impact on cash flows a current model shows that the business will on an annual basis be cash flow break even using fairly conservative assumptions around working capital and capex couple with the cost actions we have taken thus far we feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compared to current order trends and couple with our current liquidity position speaking to slide twenty for some concluding remarks i am going to say that what we managed through what we will know that will be a tough 2nd quarter we feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has not changed angostura is a premier indigo company we have multiple levers for accelerating value creation but being very focused on our liquidity with opportunities to increase this by unlocking cash as well as taking on debt hello this is the current rate environment we will continue to drive a culture of execution and we continue to pay attention to the market particularly on the current condition is to be strategic on both bolt on acquisitions for this we will turn off the audio on your telephone if you would like to remove yourself from the queue please press one thank you you may press the pound to yourself to one question and one your 1st question comes from andy kapelats from citigroup your line is open good morning guys how are you hey andy can you hear me vicente can you give us some more color into the april order decline you are seeing and your largest segment in itn as 1st of all how long do you think the changing customer behavior from that power tool business will take they do not have you know smaller exposure to it so are there discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses given they are more project versus the industrial compressor business yeah andy let me just give you a little bit of color i mean as you saw we said roughly you know april total orders down twenty booked to build greater than one from a booked to build perspective you know the industrial technology and the decision and science were were greater than one and obviously leading the way i will say you know in terms so in terms of ideas in particular you know i will categorize it as you know the the short cycle was mostly most impacted in the quarter and continue to see you know some relatively weaknes here moving forward i mean it is it is mostly correlated to i guess maybe the pmi you know from  from the down and the mainstream which is what we consider to be more and long cycle i will say you know relatively a bit more stable in the 1st quarter and and we kind of continue to see maybe some of that in the month of april again typically we tend to get the orders for that long cycle now in the 1st half of the year in order to get shipments in the 2nd half and and and from a ptl but from a power two perspective yeah i mean rough rough quarter in the in the in q one as as i alluded to i mean last year i saw some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion into online retailers and and you saw that in the 1st quarter many of these online retailers moved to having other kind of more household goods or or critical needs to fight covid nineteen and clearly you know this business saw some of the impact i will say april sales is relatively slow so we have not seen the the pivot over with the momentum of the powerful business so that is helpful to send in i am sure you you expect us to ask about detrimental margin in some way so so let me just ask it like this some obviously you know good result in q one of close to thirty you know how do i think about detrimental with high pressure solutions you know the orders down eighty can you hold detrimental there in the mid forty s at what point yeah that is fixed cost becomes a problem i know you talked about accelerated the rest of the business can the rest of the business hold yeah so so say andy i mean that is that is kind of what we are targeting for and i mean as you have seen you know we have performed well in the down cycles in the past i think we have a good solid playbook that we that we executed in the in the 1516 that included both not only in industrial downturn but also an upstream downturn you know based on our documentation they tend to be around forty we are in business with slightly higher in businesses like the high pressure as you mentioned as well as the precision and science because of the nice high growth margins that both businesses have and you know lower on the specialty vehicles and the industrial technologies they tend to play in that kind of 4040 range you know you have seen that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies and the short term actions to protect the margin we saw as you have mentioned you know some very good news our 1st quarter results for the total business on the thirty and and q two will clearly see a bit more pressure from a top line perspective but we will continue to manage the decrementals with the target being closer closer to that thirty of of the avita and you know when you think about the actions we are clearly taking much more aggressive actions in the high pressure around cost actions based on what we see here with a lot of our data points and and the long duration of the downturn that we expect hi very helpful on sunday stay well you are doing a great job your next question comes from julian mitchell from barclays your line is open hi good morning morning julian maybe just a 1st question on that point on decremental margins so if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the year and also that forty to $50000000 and to those mean that decremental margins narrow or not necessarily depending on mix and some other things maybe break it down into the two buckets as you suggested me the point to fifty that we spoke about are largely 2nd and 3rd quarter with more so on the 2nd quarter from  from the cost synergy perspective a $1000000 you know of the eighty to $90000000 in a year you know roughly that is kind of consistent 3rd quarter and 4th quarter while the other roughly you know ten to $20000000 that comes from procurement it is really more weighted towards that cannot wait to talk to you i am going to try to be brief 1st of all thank you for taking the time to talk with me my 1st question is you know i have been reading about the free cash flow and i was wondering if you could give me some more information about that and then maybe just my 2nd question for you is around the free cash flow you had a good performance in q one just wondered you know you know your assumptions around the break even and how that plays out you know what kind of if sales are down call it 225 what kind of assumptions do you have around that and what is like the free cash flow conversion should we expect you know how do you see you working capital moving you had i think in the free cash that is $63000000 of transaction and separation cash cost in q one what is the rough assumption for the year hi this is julian and we have been managing cash you know from to put in good processes and strong controls around it given the current crisis we expect cash to still be to move forward but certainly a longer cash runway as we move through what we are doing and we are really managing you know payments as through the collections we are receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity position you know what the future holds and a lot of that is you know going to depend on time for sure but we know who maintain our cash position and our liquidity and how about the costs yeah any very rough gut feel i posted for the year in light of about 63000000 in q one u one we will be some some incremental costs i do not have the figure at the moment julian but i can get back to you on that your next question jim comes from michael hollaran and from baird morning everyone hope everyone is doing well so so could we just talk about the synergy funnel you referenced what are some of the incremental sources that you originally identified 250 maybe talk about the differences you are seeing in longer term some of the gaps yeah as you recall you know we all agreed that we were going forward you know as we were with sixty days into the transaction we have all these visibility as to what that funnel could potentially be roughly the $100000000 comes from a combination of structural savings rationalization hello on the investors call we have now a pretty good database of all the the locations across the world and that is giving us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize not so much the demographic but i mean the market coming year two year three but more more the other kind of perspective so 2nd part of the question liquidity is in a strong position you know some of the one off things just operations you know and some of the extra things that i mentioned what would it take for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the cash outflow and then secondarily related to that that we are going into yeah no absolutely like i mean i think you know clearly over the next couple years continue to be a really hard part of our strategy you know we see it is a very unique environment right now we still see at this point in time some very good follow on also very good follow on around you know industrial technologies but they are really more relatorily back end ones good morning how are you guys yeah good thanks so i am a former performer and it seems like most of that came from the legacy ir businesses can you maybe just kind of spell that out in a bit more detail how much of that can be explained by the jokes of the industrial of the ir also what happened with service during the quarter you know majer was out on vacation and then we had the iir business they have pretty significant china exporture you know in terms of you know we we saw service better typically we saw roughly about two times from a percentage perspective better performance than the original equipment and just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here particularly as you know the ways of comparing some of the you know industrial technology is composed of multiple technologies compressors vacuums and blowers and are conservatively businesses clearly within the traditional commercial banking space when we specifically compare to some of the 1st couple of data points that we look at so of the 3rd party report at the same time you know just to give you a further perspective the legacy gardner denver business in queue one orders were down in the low single digits in the market and you know since since we did not own the legacy ir for the full quarter i mean is it possible to to break given the fact that you are clear you know in terms of the direction that you are going in in terms of the business i mean we are taking some pretty aggressive actions a 100 after market and consumables so that that kind of carries us much better we are basically keeping them closed or or very very low exports so yeah good playbook on how to navigate have done extensive work and you know i think we we see that we can definitely overcome these kind of long term determinants our plan is that it is going to be down for a while and to the 2nd question you know i mean clearly is  is a market that as you saw we just invested in a new fluid and technology so and you know we can be ready for capturing so great thank you very much our next question comes from jeff sprawls from vertical research partners interesting comment about utilization down from thirty but how do we actually interpret and apply that to a forward looking where our sales are going to be down thirty in the service business but i do not believe we have enough data historically to kind of piece that together but what does that down thirty tell you yeah jeff great question i mean so in terms of the historical data we do not have a lot of historical because as you know as we can imagine a lot of these remote monitoring systems and connectivity with the iot platforms that we both companies have now is fairly new but we have enough data to to then break it down by the specific sub and markets the indication here is that it is telling us where are those markets that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective so it is helping us to redirect the teams it is also helping us to really better serve and making sure that we are still more resilient from that perspective you know in terms of in terms of being down thirty i mean i think we just see that as as a bit of indication as to what could happen here but as you use you know it gives us a great correlation we do not have a lot of historical data to so what we are doing is just taking that data point to be focusing them on those areas regions and markets that but that we are still seeing some signs of recovery i think the utilization of the compressors was very good i mean the power tools is cats they have two main product lines i mean it is that tool business but also they have a lifting business that is kind of more related to to factory consumption or factory rationalization and so i think you know that that was impacted more so and then china as a region was definitely heavily impacted you know from  from the other product lines in terms of the longer cycle which these are kind of a background good morning my question is about in the itf budgetary process in the channel and you think about some of the recent improvements you have seen can you give us some specifics yeah i mean i think you know when we look at the inventory in those channels the lag you would need to see or that you would experience if say the pmis got better for example i mean there is just not really i mean there is just not really any direct advantage from  from a compressor perspective which is obviously the one that has the biggest sites of the distribution that work and it is also more particularly towards the garner denver branded products you know we do not tend to have a lot of inventory because these these are particularly smaller distributors more sub regionalized more localized they do not tend to put a lot of cash up front to have compressors on the shelf so to speak i mean maybe maybe there is a little bit of an advantage in terms of the size of the compressor but it is not really significant hi i am calling from the compressor plant we make compressors but not on the medium to high level compressors and the inventory will come in more on consumables after market and really moved fairly well i mean they turned fairly quickly you have seen just from home clear is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in its or have you seen some little improvement in orders sequentially and i would be curious is that more short cycle long cycle yeah no yeah great question yeah it is out of category that has the step stabilization initially and then obviously when you look at it within the month i mean at the month of april you know there is some slight improvement on the 2nd half of april but again was that more short cycle improvement or was it some short cycle all right thank you very much appreciate it your next question comes from john paul kalinski from the front is open hi good morning all so for the weekend i guess you know everyone here on the call kind of the same list of questions but so we covered a lot of ground already but i guess just with some of the commentary around utilization and with the comments you made around supply chain interruption how much of the decline is it and yeah i guess this comment is mostly an 19s comment is related to customer shutdowns or supply chain interruptions and in some form like you know the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back because i think to some of these points on service or utilization that maybe that is not the the steady state you know state of the world there yeah josh i will say more so in in china if you want to think about it kind of that disruption completely also in the in the 1st quarter maybe some disruption from the perspective of in europe particularly in italy i mean we do have some very good manufacturing facilities in italy and and we although we stayed operationally i mean most of our suppliers had to shut down i would say that now as kind of the comment that i made before we see kind of these lower demand levels kind of getting more stabilized but you know still you know not seeing that that kind of recovery and we are just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will will play out okay and then switching over to the  to the synergy funnel i mean it sounds like the the year three pipeline of activity you know kind of has to stay there as you have to act on other things for versus more manufacturing centric fair to say that the incremental step up in synergies then in the year two is i guess it is you know is this more of a pull forward from year two or are you kind of implicitly saying hey we think there is more than 250 here we are just you know we are working on this as fast as we can and we will update you as we know more yeah i mean i think that is exactly the case we think we think we want to keep it at 250 just because we think it is prudent and we think it is prudent because we are we are i mean clearly focused on a lot of the internal funnel and execution you see how we accelerate it and we execute it i mean this is not just talking about being executed but there is a component around procurement and and an itb savings innovative value that is volume dependent and when we did the $250000000 cross industry funnel it was done based on 2019 kind of runway levels so to speak or spend levels so we just want to be prudent from  from kind of going out there and saying that the 250 will increase you know once we are we are ready we will definitely and when we see kind of more stability or we are normalizing in the markets maybe we come back with that but at this point in time we are accelerating what we can control and we know that we can control that structural headcountout and that is exactly what we executed we know we can control a lot of the quick in procurements because commodities are lower and we are executing that and we know we can control a lot of discretionary spending and that is exactly what we also executed so we are very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute your next question comes from nathan jones from stifel your line is open good morning everyone revenue down eightsix xfx margins up a 120 basis points so clearly some very good control leverage on what drove the very good decrementals there how you see the decrementals going forward and maybe any color you can give us on that what you think the long term margin opportunities are in that business and also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical business if you remember last year when we talked about the medical business we were seeing up to 200 basis points margin improvement and the medical business finishing last year at roughly you know 33 ebitda margin so again very good momentum from that business and and clearly as we so so some stuff was going on in the market and the team continued to execute those targets that they needed to get done you know i think when when you look at this business that i mean had some very nice growth margins and you know the decrementals the base decrementals are typically you know 45 or so i mean really good job that the team did here in order to get that decremental down to the fifteen and i will say you know from a long term perspective we will we will definitely come come back with with giving some kind of medium to the market ok i will do a quick comparison and you can see that medical we were able to you know not only just a few years ago that medical business was not the 25 26 ebitda margin and we finished you know last year in the 31 ebitda margin and there is just a lot of good commonality between the medical and the legacy you know pfs and aro business that are within this segment okay maybe just one on receivables when you look through that do you see any custom customers i mean i think it is well it is one that we we live by day by day i mean clearly on the on the high pressure solution which is as you have mentioned the most exposed i mean customers are still paying but they take longer to pay but they still pay you know they they they also realize that you know from an upstream perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again so we have been pretty strict in in many cases that that we need to see the payments or we will stop shipments and then we cease to to provide any type of any type of of output of products either now or later in the in the future so i think we are we are really executing a good game plan hi this is steve here on on collections with the teams excellent thank you your next question comes from nicole deblais from deutsche bank your line is open yeah thanks good morning guys so a lot of this has been answered we have covered a lot of ground so far but i just wanted to ask one into next year as we think about you know approaching our recovery there is clearly a lot of moving pieces here we have got you know more structural changes we have got a lot of moving pieces here we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know

changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have got you know more structural changes we have yeah i know yeah that is great i mean i think i think you know we typically see kind of the base what i call the base level of incremental to be back to the business you know for the total business between 35 to forty again you know when you look at precision and science maybe higher than that specialty vehicles lower than that with maybe industrial technologies about that level you know definitely we will we will see a little bit of a headwind as we see a lot of these structural activities that we are doing to come through the provision we also see a lot of you know telwinds sorry with the telwinds that we have seen this kind of structural cost come out within some of the headwinds but you know as we kind of get closer to commenting out here to our budgets and how we kind of work with the teams we will definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin obviously to be at a minimum at that base or more your next question is from john walsh from credit suisse your line is open your next question is from mark nitin mehta from ubs your line is open hey good morning everybody i just wanted to point out one more on the  hi hi good morning on synergies i do appreciate that obviously procurement is volume dependent but you fly here ten to 20000000 is that correct i think you currently assume a sort of full run rate savings out of that wave one of the spend which i think is a 3rd of your overall spend and how should we think about more medium term for the other two thirds if you assume that a better compound in a normalized flow get back to about 2019 levels let us let us start here so maybe a current volume of twenty to 40000000 so that is at least what you can see here coming from wave one on an analyzed level at current volumes and that is only covering you know a portion of the total spend with waves two and three coming up in the 2nd half of the year i mean it will definitely be a little bit higher than that i mean i would not you know i think at this point in time you could say you know forty to fifty could be all the way up to sixteen yeah i mean i think this is a segment we like a lot by the way that but these businesses are kind of so niche and and very very solid market positions and it has just a lot of great descriptors such as you know kind of high growth margins and and and very specialized bonds that that are kind of really solidly mission critical in the in the processes where they where they apply you know we we continue to see that there is a lot of potential not only in organic but also organically and we are doing a lot of work on that whether you take technologies like and the aro and combine that with the like  either a half cooked branded product or a milton roy product and then you can actually create some uniqueness in terms of applications and then enter some new markets and that is what what a lot of the team are doing is you know how do we are being thoughtful and mindful on on some of those vertical markets and kind of new niche adjacent areas that we want to play in and not only do that organically but then see what other technologies from our partners can help us to enhance that so a lot of really great work strategically going on on this segment to really picture this on how we can kind of double it thanks a lot good luck you know maybe just one question here you eluded on the call to to share gains on kind of both  the legacy gdi and and ir businesses wondering if you could put a little more color around what is driving those is it something on the the product side is it you know some of the end market strategies you were doing previously around you know more niche markets like paper and pulp maybe some competitive pressure hi this is john and i am calling from smaller guys just any kind of color you could provide there would be helpful sure john yeah so at and in that category i mean what i what i sent in the call is that it is on specific horsepower and and what we saw that we liked is that this is in the us based on the 3rd party report and and and we liked it because it was very very complementary so if you look at the legacy garnet denver we saw some share takes in the low to medium horsepower while we saw on the ingersoll rand some share takes on the high kind of larger horsepower compressors i will categorize that as you know angus oliven has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the on the larger horsepower while as you know you know from a gardner denver perspective we have been more focused on the medium to small compressor and and i think you know this is what i mentioned on the call that this is a great hypothesis that we had on this great merge and and combining the two companies because now we have great new complementary products and spectrum of technologies that are you know a lot of these that i mentioned is on the oil lubricated which is very good solid kind of core product line but as we spoke about during the april call now also the oil free product line spectrum so so again it is it is new technology new products and and be able to to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the products that the teams are launching great i appreciate taking the question thank you john there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to the company thank you i just want to close out by saying thanks to everyone for for your interest in ingersoll rand i want to do another shout out and thank you to our employees that are always doing a lot of work here to stay healthy stay safe and to provide to our customers the mission critical products that are needed in this kind of current market conditions so hopefully everyone stays safe and healthy and we will look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference call thank you for participating you may now

information on risks associated with our business we refer you to the risk factors described in our ten k filed on march 2nd 2020 as well as the company is subsequent filings with the sec also during this call we will refer to certain non gaap financial measures which we consider to be an important measure of company performance these non gaap financial measures are provided in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaaps the only difference between gaap and non gaap results is stock based compensation expense but please refer to the press release issued today for a detailed reconciliation between our gaap and non gaap financial results i would now like to turn the call over to rajesh please go ahead thank you leanne good afternoon we appreciate you joining us today and hope that all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy during these unique times even with the challenging macro backdrop sitime continue to execute demonstrated by a record quarterly revenue of 32700000 for 3rd quarter 2020 which was above our updated guidance range of 31 to 32000000 our results demonstrate the diversity of our end market segments our customer base and the exceptional dedication of the sitime team all of which have benefited sitime during the current environment during this 3rd quarter revenue grew 52 sequentially compared to our 2nd quarter 2020 revenues we anticipate that continued strength in the 4th quarter will allow for sitime to set another quarterly revenue record and art is going to discuss our 3rd quarter financials and 4th quarter outlook later in the call now sitimes fabulous model and multi source strategy continue to provide a competitive advantage in this market while at the same time providing added assurance of quality and reliability to our customers in contrast we believe that the quartz industry infrastructure has several points of failure which can cause supply disruptions some of which we have heard about through recent industry commentary additionally within the timing market responsiveness is becoming the key theme and we believe that many competitors in quartz may not be set up to support industry needs and requirements for the future in infrastructure applications our speed of response to environmental disruptors such as temperature change minimizes the system level impact in mobile iot our kilowatts products help reduce radio power by turning it on and off more quickly and precisely something that is unique to sitime on the supply side our programmability continues to enli enable the flexibility speed and delivery required by our customers with the recent introduction of our apexmems family of resonator products sitime now offers all three categories of timing products which are the oscillators the clocks and the resonators as of the 3rd quarter we have cumulatively shipped almost 2000000000 oscillators all of them with an embedded mems resonator our combined knowledge of the mems the analog chips the package and the materials is unique to the industry and offers a system level understanding for our resonator customers as well now we know that the manufacturing mems products in high volume is not easy mems product leaders in other markets non timing markets maintain their leadership position because they invested early focused on developed innovative solutions at a rapid pace as well and we believe today that sitime is in a similar position for the timing market as we continue to build upon this market leadership our apexmems resonators are ideally suited for high volume space constrained mobile and iot applications such as bluetooth high speed connectivity interfaces asset tracking and microcontrollers in addition to these applications other system on a chip vendors can use our apexmems resonators that could be core packaged with their chips just like we do in our oscillators given a broad knowledge of timing market solutions across all three categories we believe our system timing our system level timing solutions save customer design time increase the end products performance and reliability while also reducing their overall board pri footprint creating value moving to five g in five g the opportunities available to sitime continue to drive the company is expansion into the communications market our products continue to see solid design traction in five g applications at tier one manufacturers of telecommunication equipment in addition we had previously mentioned oran which is open radio access networks and we continue to see significant interest in oran hardware solutions that are being developed for greenfield operators as well as the traditional carriers oran is getting traction because it gives operators best in class equipment and performance while driving better deployment economics and the need for successful interoperability of equipment from different suppliers is a driving factor for sitime success we are getting significant traction with oran customers worldwide across the entire radio networks including our use small sale and distributed units in the area of five g optical transport where we are engaged with 100 to 800 g optical and soc suppliers with our sit 9505 9501 products we find that we are able to offer unique value with high performance in the smallest form factor in conclusion sitime is uniquely positioned to disrupt the market as the 1st company that continues to provide system level timing solution that said this is the only the 1st step of a multi year strategy to extend our market leadership in timing solution we remain a results driven company with a culture that encourages creativity leadership and a strong commitment to our customers which continues to be reflected in our recent quarterly trends i would now like to turn the call over to art as we will discuss as he will discuss in more detail our 3rd quarter results and our outlook for the 4th quarter art thanks rajesh and good afternoon everyone we are very pleased to be holding our 4th financial results conference call as a public company and during my review today i will discuss 3rd quarter 2020 financial results and we will provide guidance for the 4th quarter i will focus my discussion on non gaap financial results and refer you to today is press release for a detailed description of our gaap results as well as reconciliation of gaap to non gaap results which excludes stock based compensation and related payroll tax expense so 1st of all q three was really an excellent quarter for us we had strong revenue growth significant gross margin expansion and very positive non gaap net income as you know at the end of august we increased our revenue guidance for the quarter by more than ten and i am happy to report that actual results exceeded the high end of that revised guidance revenue for the quarter was $32700000 up 52 sequentially and up 29 over the same quarter a year ago to provide some color on end markets our report sales by market group as i have in the past the 1st is mobile iot and consumer which consists primarily of sales into mobile phones wearable devices and consumer products this was the segment most impacted by the global slowdown in q two but it came back strong in q three sales were $20900000 or 67 64 of total sales up 105 sequentially and up nineteen over the same quarter a year ago the 2nd is industrial automotive and aerospace which goes into industrial automotive aerospace military applications and includes broad based sales sales were $6400000 or twenty of sales up five sequentially and up 23 over the same quarter a year ago the 3rd is communications and enterprise which consists of wireless infrastructure including five g data center and networking this was the fastest growing segment over the same quarter last year sales were $5400000 for sixteen of sales up three sequentially and up 103 year over year we had just one end customer where sales exceeded ten and sales to that customer were 45 of total sales we have had a number of initiatives within the company to expand gross margins and those initiatives are paying off non gaap gross margins during the quarter were 52 one up 530 basis points over q two non gaap operating expenses were $12500000 up five sequentially comprised of 7000000 in r d and 5500000 in sg a expense the interest expense was $100000 and this generated non gaap net income of $4400000 or ¢23 per share and that is compared to a loss in the prior quarter of 2200000 or ¢fourteen a share stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes were $5100000 this was higher than the 3400000 in q two due to the higher stock price some new higher stock grants and the establishment of an executive performance stock bonus plan trade receivables were $17200000 that was up from 13000000 in q two due to the higher revenue but dsos decreased from 58 days in q two to just 49 days in q three inventory was $15200000 up slightly from 14800000 in q two we generated $4200000 in cash from operations and used 2500000 for the purchase of assets we had $35000000 in bank debt going into the quarter but we paid this off entirely and finished the quarter with no bank debt we then ended the quarter with $69200000 in cash and equivalents i would now like to provide some guidance for the 4th quarter of 2020 we expect q four to be another great quarter with continued sequential revenue growth gross margin expansion and increasing net income we expect 4th quarter revenue will be up ten to fifteen sequentially at the midpoint this would put revenue at about $36800000 or thirty higher than the same quarter last year we expect continued gross margin expansion with non gaap gross margins increasing to approximately 53 plus or minus a point operating expenses are expected to increase between eight and ten sequentially which at the midpoint would be approximately $13700000 we will not incur any interest expense since we no longer have any bank debt income taxes will be nominal and less than fifty k for the quarter the basic share count in q four will be approximately 17000000 shares in addition the diluted impact of employee rsus will add approximately 2200000 shares taking the total diluted share count use for our eps calculation to approximately 19200000 shares stock based compensation expense will be approximately $5500000 up from q three due to the higher stock price and a few new higher grants so based on the guidance just given we expect 4th quarter non gaap eps will be between ¢28 and ¢32 per share so in summary we have an exceptional workforce that is performing extremely well working from home we have truly differentiated products that address large and growing markets we have a number of new products in the pipeline an enviable list of tier one customers a strong balance sheet and we are looking forward to a very strong q four so with that i would like to turn the call back to the operator for q a operator at this time i would like to inform everyone in order to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad again that is star one to ask a question we have your 1st question from blayne curtis from barclays your line is open good afternoon guys this is tom zero malley on for blayne curtis congrats on the really nice results my 1st question was around the improvement throughout the quarter obviously you updated guidance in late august possibly and then you are you are now coming ahead of that range now what most materially improved between now and then and then if you could look out into december you are obviously guiding for some more expansion there could you give us a little color on segments between the three where you are seeing that growth sequentially so from q two to q three as as i mentioned the most significant growth was in our mobile iot group right part of that is seasonality but we just had real strengths kind of across the board with our customers in that in that segment we also mentioned in our revised in our press release with our revised guidance in august that we had won a design win a phone design win that also contributed you know we are not going to report that the the phone revenue specifically one because we are not allowed to but i will provide some color to that when we increased our guidance in august about half of that increase was related to that new phone design win and the the balance was obviously then strength in non phone so that that was kinda what happened in in the 3rd quarter in the 4th quarter we are seeing very strong revenue growth as i mentioned our guidance is that revenue will be up ten to fifteen i will mention the phone again not specifically but phone revenue will probably account for about a 3rd of that sequential improvement and therefore non phone basically accounts for the balance of that but we are we are expecting growth in all of our market segments going from q three to q four great that is super helpful and then my follow up is just really around the lar the largest customer for you guys that obviously stepped up materially into september along with that margins clearly stepped up as well can you talk about what is driving that better margin performance clearly you are you are seeing some accretive gross margin dollars as that customer steps up but can you talk to your other segments as well is is there a material part of that uptick that is also coming from the comms enterprise and the auto industrial space as well as as those products move a little move a little 00 ab absolutely ab absolutely you know we have talked for a long time about the gross margin drivers in our business you know our newer products generally are higher asp and higher performance as as those newer products become a larger percentage of our sales that drives higher blended gross margins that is twelve we are taking more of our sales direct that cuts out the distributor that improves our gross margins we have made a lot of progress in reducing our product material costs that would be wafer costs that improves gross margins our ops group has done a great job at of improving sort and test yields and package costs that improves gross margins volume helps us our our manufacturing overhead even though we are fabulous we have a certain amount of manufacturing overhead that is relatively fixed so as the volume goes up that manufacturing overhead is percent of sales decreases that helps gross margins and so you know we we have been working on this now for for a while and you know we saw very significant gross margin expansion from q two to q three as i mentioned gross margins increased 530 basis points from q two to q three and i have guided for at least another point of improvement plus or minus going from q three to q four great congrats again on the next results guys thank you thank you we have your next question from from your line is open yes thank you and congratulations on the record results rajesh you you you called out some some challenges in the in the quartz industry you know your competitors could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on that and what what does that really mean for sort of new engagements and new design wins for for sitime yeah i think we talked a little bit about it last time basically the quartz industry as we know has done a stellar job in the last seventy years of providing product to everybody in the electronics world but i think that it is still a batch process it is a fab process it is a factory process or everybody has to invest in factories and these factories are purpose made so they can not be used they do not have the scale and they do not have the flexibility that a fabulous company like sitime which uses semiconductors can get i mean as a reminder when we build our mems resonators we can a a a 1000000 sorry 10000 wafers should give us about a 1000000000 units and these are 180 nanometer technology wafers so not really that difficult to get so we it is fundamentally their supply chain is batch made and i think it has these issues with it there were some reports of some stumbles in fabs in in in the asian markets and i think we saw a spike in demand coming that did not impact q three by the way i am just talking that we we saw spikes in people because people get nervous when that happens and this is not the 1st time ten years ago there was a big a big problem with ceramic packaging as you know all quartz made products with the oscillators the resonators are quartz packaged because to because they are fragile and they want to to keep a very strong packaging those quartz packaging ceramic packages come from only two people in the world and sometimes there is a shortage so i think they have these multiple points of failure potentially and that is what i was pointing out too and yeah there have been some there have been some you know anecdotal events in the last few months and in the continuing we expect to see that it it is just a it is just a reminder to our customers it does not significantly change our revenue but what it does is in the medium to longer term it gets our customers a reminder that they they are probably better off in moving to more stable supply chains yeah that is that is great perspective thank you for that and as my follow up congratulations on on entering the the resonator market and now obviously you you are covering the entire gamut of of the timing market i know in the past you have talked about targeting about a $10000000000 if you kind of combined all three sub segments could you update us where your sum is now with your penetration with new products into the resonator market yeah our sum is it is still around 1000000000 to 1200000000 it might be a little bit higher depending on when when we introduce products and so on but it is certainly less than 2000000000 it is also mostly concentrated right now in in oscillators so while we do have resonators that have been introduced while we do have analog clocking solutions that have been introduced our ramp into that from a revenue point of view we have already set expectations will be relatively slow i think our entry into these markets is significant for customers in the following way in the way that they can then come and have conversations with us on all of these products and not every customer wants to talk to us about every one of them sometimes they want to talk to us only about resonators or oscillators or clocking and then that becomes an entry point to talking about other products so it is a it is from a tam point of view we are still pretty tiny you know 1500000000 in tam out of a $8000000000 total market at 1500000000 out of an 8000000000 total tam and of course sitimes revenue is you know still pretty pretty small in comparison you know at around 100000000 so we still even if we maintained and did not grow our very much we would still probably have a long way to go before we fill out those boots thank you for that rajesh and congratulations again we have your next question from quinn bolton from needham your line is open hey guys congratulations on the on the nice results wanted to start off with the supply chain issues you have you talked about with quartz i believe that was one of the factors that led to the to the phone win that that you announced last quarter you know if you look forward do you think that those quartz supply chain issues are positioning you to potentially win additional skews either at at that customer or other large smartphone vendors i think that will have some impact quinn but i do not think that it is forecastable i think it is a it is a general slow trend and i have talked about this several times it is a general slow trend it is it is it is not at the point where it is gotten that snowball has become very big but it is a trend that we see and we have always said that people design us in for performance reasons as well as for supply chain but overwhelmingly they design us for performance reasons just to just to pick you know i would say less than fifteen of the time we get designed in for supply chain reasons but those supply chain reasons are important because when people look at their supply chains and see these that happen from time to time and these by the way these perturbations are not new they have been going on for for a long time but but customers did not have an alternative now that they do have an alternative it just becomes one more faster in their thinking particularly when they are looking further out in time particularly for example in automotive or or or or you know longer term industrial products that have a slow ramp in multiple years many of them start to think it might be prudent to do that but i would still push on our performance benefits as being the primary reason for adoption great and the 2nd question i know with with the recent introduction of the apexmems family you are you are moving into the resonator market are you targeting select frequencies you know where you know high volume frequencies with the initial resonators and i guess a related question you know since you design this in silicon do you need new mask sets every time the frequency changes in those resonator structures thank you yeah yeah absolutely we to answer the 2nd question 1st we do need a new mask set but sometimes those are very similar they are not the the the design of the resonator is not very different for example between a 24 megahertz and a 26 megahertz it is not going to be very different however between a 24 megahertz and 76eight megahertz i think it could be different but generally the good news is that the se the resonator industry has worked around the quartz limitations in the past and there are basically a handful maybe two handfuls so i will call it a dozen qu quote unquote popular frequencies that exist and and so i think that makes our task easier as we go from one frequency to the other and you are absolutely right we will target the most popular ones but we will target the ones where the frequency is one thing but where we bring the combination of size of of resilience of environmental stability and clearly of high volume because these are low priced products they are sub ¢twenty products in price and so obviously the volume has to be opportunity has to be in the 10s of 1000000s for it to be interesting for us those are some of the key key reasons to do it now there is another thing that is going to happen over time as frequencies of socs increase the the requirement for frequencies beyond say 75 megahertz increases and that is an area where we think that quartz technology has has difficulty getting to a high volume high frequency high reliability small size product and that is where also we would shine and i am thinking 234 years out particularly in consumer products perhaps some phone applications got it great thank you for that additional detail and then just quickly for art you mentioned each each of the segments would grow in the 4th quarter just wondering if you might be able to rank order if one is growing much much faster than the others or do you expect all of them to to grow about the same rate thank you sure fair fair question i do not think we wanted to get that detailed in our in our guidance we do expect a growth in each one of those segments and i will leave it at that and and we will we will announce that segment growth in in more detail when we actually announce the 4th quarter understood thanks art thanks quinn we have your next question from from your line is open congratulations on the strong results so perhaps for art would be increasing mobile content you have now can you in this framework we are thinking about seasonality going forward 1st half 1st 2nd half 1st q versus maybe before you know coming into this year sure well if you look at the seasonality in our business and we do have seasonality go back to last year 2019 right 2nd half of the year much stronger than 1st half people can go back and and quantify that we saw pretty much the same thing this year you know the back half of this year much stronger than the 1st half of this year q two of course was was somewhat depressed in our mobile and iot segment because of the global slowdown and the fact that so many retail stores were closed and i think next year it is going to be somewhat similar in terms of 1st half versus 2nd half obviously we expect year over year growth you know q one next year should be nicely higher than q one of this year and q two over q two and three and three and four and four so we we expect you know next year we will have good growth we are not quantifying that at this point but in terms of the seasonality it is going to look i think similar to how it looked last year and this year okay art that is very helpful and then perhaps on the the infrastructure side five g wireless infrastructure in particular are you having design wins kinda showing up every quarter that that be a steady growth driver or might you ebb and flow with the five g build out puts and takes yeah i think it is a slow steady of products you know our our products are also showing up you know we talked about the 9501 we in the optical module business that is clearly showing up the oran that i referred to earlier i think we have 10s of design wins that showed up in the last in the last few months yeah so so it is just a steady growth and what i am excited about is the breadth of where five g touches so again as i said it is not just the distribute the digital unit or the it is it is the mid haul the back haul the microwave the you know it is in the servers it is in it is all it is in so much of the infrastructure and as i have mentioned before this is probably a 57 year rollout and should be a very very solid place for sitime helpful color thank you rajesh we have your next question from from william blair your line is open sure maybe a quick question for art just on operating expenses can you update us on the long term operating mar model and how we should be thinking about it you guys have really had our done a tremendous job growing revenue the last couple of quarters with very little opex flow through yeah so i am wondering how to think about it yeah great great great question well revenue kinda got ahead of our expenses so that is that is a good thing you know our kind of stated longterm goal is that we would grow opex at about half the rate of top line growth so just for sake of mathematical example if we were to grow revenue year over year by twenty then i would expect opex to grow by about ten so that is kind of a a a generalized long term goal if you look at the last couple of quarters you know q two our revenue went up 52 sequentially but only five but opex only went up five sequentially so you know we we could not ramp expenses quite fast enough my guide for q four we are guiding revenue up ten to fifteen and i am guiding opex up eight to ten so that is a little more than half the top line rate but that is because of a little bit of a catch up because we were s so low in terms of opex growth in q two so does that does that kind of frame it for you yeah that helps and then and i i i have a i have a comment i have a comment on that and that comment is that a reminder that sitime is an analog semiconductor company and when you think of other semiconductor companies that are using seven nanometer tape outs we are doing 180 130 65 nanometer tape outs when you think of other companies doing a bunch of software in opex in scaling that we are not in the software business or not meaningfully in that on the other hand the number of opportunities that are coming at us are coming pretty thick and fast so we always would like to retain the ability to invest at a at a greater rate you know within reason to the model that was put out by art understood that that is helpful and a helpful reminder on the on the geometries and then just one more question i believe last quarter when you announced the cascade product the clock ic product that you expected revenue to really be you know a 2021 and then probably ramping beyond that as we look at the standalone resonator product should we thinking about the timeframe to revenue in a in a similar fashion or what are the puts and takes from a customer standpoint yeah i would say that is even slower okay i would say that you know be because there is two kinds of design wins we would have we would have standalone design wins so we would go to oems and sell them resonators that is one and then the other one would be to go to soc vendors the ones we sort of for example gave and they would design it into their products both of them particularly the 2nd one take a long time so the gestation period for that for meaningful revenue is easily twice as long as the clocking business so yeah so of course there can be other times when it can happen very fast but but generally that is a good rule of thumb that is helpful that is it for me thank you thanks alex we have your next question from ch chris castle from raymond james your line is open yes thank you good evening i guess the question on on margins and i i i guess as we go forward into next year there is a lot of different factors with seasonality some of the different margin profiles or the different segments that are going to move in seasonality could you give us a sense of you know what what should we expect as we go through the year particularly in the 1st half of next year as some of the consumer related products you know typically would be seemingly weaker yeah great great question so you know our longterm goal for gross margins that we have talked about is getting gross margins somewhere closer to sixty and that is going to take us two to three years give or take so you know if you just kinda do that math you know we are we are targeting gross margin expansion of maybe three points a year now we obviously did much better than that going from q two to q three but you know just for the next couple of years if we can add three points we get to sixty margin you know in in two to three years within a year there are some dynamics that affect gross margins by quarter and you are right in the 1st half of the year generally our mobile iot and consumer business which is somewhat lower gross margin not that much lower but a little bit lower would argue that gross margins would be a little higher in the 1st half of the year just because of mix but the counter to that is we have this leverage on our manufacturing overhead so the lower volumes actually hurt us on that side so taking all of that into account just like we have dynamics this year of gross margins being nicely higher in the back half of the year versus the 1st half i would expect the same thing next year so if you are modeling this i would model gross margins to what you think it would be for the year in total margins will be higher in the back half than they will be in the 1st half right and and that is as the the the the the poor mix is offset by the higher at manufacturing efficiencies in the 2nd half of the year right and and the volume is is a little heavier weighting so i would actually expect gross margins to to pull back just a little bit in the 1st half of next year but i expect them to be much stronger in the back half of next year even stronger of course than they are in the back half of this year all right that is very helpful thank you a as a follow up perhaps you could talk to us about you know kinda what you are targeting for next year and there is a lot of opportunities in in front of you you know wha in in in terms of what do you expect wha what do you expect to drive the growth next year and the the the there is a lot on your plate there is a lot of opportunity there what are the things we should be paying attention to most closely as we go into next year i think the market that we the market trends that we have outlined continue so purely comms enterprise data centers are a big play we are continuing to find more traction in automotive as more and more electric vehicles show up cause a lot of automated driving is happening in that we have a nice little story and connection growing in the middle aerospace market and then finally the mobile iot piece the consumer the mobile iot piece of it is always a natural place for sitimes growth because you know the size the resiliency the performance so i i think we are also continuing to expand our customer base you know five years ago we were addressing about 2000 customers today we are about five x that maybe a little bit more and so i think the expansion of customer base this is not the big customers this is customers that are of much much smaller size where we are working in the channel to to connect with them i think that is a that is a good initiative for sitime as well so i think those are some ways that we think about it great very helpful thank you great thanks chris i am showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to mister arthur chadwick sir please continue great well we want to thank everybody for joining us today on the call and we hope that you have a great day and thanks again for all your support thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference call thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day

these unique times even with the challenging macro bracket drop sycamore continues to execute demonstrated by a record quarterly revenue of 32700000 for the 3rd quarter i would like to report on our results for the 3rd quarter of 2020 our updated guidance range of 31 to 32000000 was above our updated guidance range of 31 to 32000000 our results demonstrate the diversity of our end market segments our customer base and the exceptional dedication of our site team all of which have benefited siteone during the current environment during this 3rd quarter revenue grew 52 sequentially compared to our 2nd quarter 2020 revenues we anticipate that continued growth will be realized in the future now cyient is fabulous model and multi source strategy continue to provide a competitive advantage in this market while at the same time providing added assurance of quality and reliability to our customers in contrast we believe that the course infrastructure has several cause of failure which can cause supply disruptions some of which we have heard about through recent industry commentary additionally within the timing market responsiveness is becoming a key team and we believe that many competitors in courts may not be set up to support industry needs and requirements for the future in infrastructure applications our speed of response to environmental disruptors such as temperature change minimizes the system level impact in mobile iot our kilohertz products help reduce radio power by turning it on and off more quickly and precisely something that is unique to siemens on the supply side our programmability continues to enable the flexibility speed and delivery required by our customers with the recent introduction of our apex men is family of resonator products siemens now offers all three categories of timing products which are the oscillators as of the 3rd quarter we cumulatively shipped almost 2000000000 oscillators all of them with an embedded menlo resonator are combined knowledge of the menlo the analog chips the package and the materials is unique to the industry and offers a system level understanding for our resonator customers as well now we know that manufacturing menlo products in high volume is not easy menlo product our leaders in other markets non timing markets maintained their leadership position because they invested early focused on developed innovative solutions at a rapid pace as well and we believe today that sitime is in a similar position for the timing market as we continue to build upon this market leadership our apex menasor resonators are ideally suited for high volume space constrained mobile and iot applications such as bluetooth hearables high speed connectors our interfaces asset tracking and microcontrollers in addition to these applications other system on a chip vendors can use our apex mems resonators that would be co packaged with their chips just like we do in our oscillators given our broad knowledge of timing market solutions across all three categories we believe our system timing our system level timing solutions save customer design time increase their end products performance and reliability we also reducing their overall board footprint footprint creating value moving to five g in five g the opportunities available to ciena continue to drive the company is expansion into the communications market our products continue to see solid design traction in five g applications at tier one manufacturers of telecommunications equipment in addition we previously mentioned oran which is open radio access network which is a key area of growth for ciena we continue to see significant interest in oran hardware solutions that are being developed for greenfield operators as well as the traditional carriers oran is getting traction because it gives operators best in class equipment and performance while driving better deployment economics and the need for successful interoperability of equipment from different suppliers is a driving factor for site time success we are getting significant traction with oran customers worldwide across the entire radio networks including our our use small cells and distributed units in the area of five g optical transport where we are engaged with 100 to 800 g optical and soc suppliers with our so f i t 95059501 products we find that we are able to offer unique with high performance in the smallest form factor in conclusion site time is uniquely positioned to disrupt the market as the 1st company that continues to provide system level timing solution that said this is the only the 1st step of a multiyear strategy to extend our market leadership in timing solution we remain a results driven company with a culture that encourages creativity leadership and a strong commitment to our customers which continues to be reflected in our recent quarterly trends i would now like to turn the call over to art as we will discuss as he will discuss in more detail our 3rd quarter results and our outlook for the 4th quarter art thanks rajesh now good afternoon everyone we are very pleased to be holding our 4th financial results conference call as a public company and during my review today i will discuss 3rd quarter 2020 financial results and will provide guidance i will focus my discussion on non gap financial results and refer you to today is press release for a detailed description of our gap results as well as reconciliation of gap to non gap results which exclude stock based compensation and related payroll tax expense so 1st of all q three was really an excellent quarter for us we had strong revenue growth significant gross margin expansion and very positive as you know at the end of august we increased our revenue guidance for the quarter by more than ten and i am happy to report that actual results exceeded the high end of that revised guidance revenue for the quarter was $32700000 up 52 sequentially and up 29 over the same quarter a year ago to provide some color on end markets a report sales by market group as i have the 1st is mobile iot and consumer which consists primarily of sales into mobile phones wearable devices and consumer products this was the segment most impacted by the global slowdown in q two but it came back strong in q three sales were $20900000 or 67 64 of total sales up 105 sequentially and up nineteen year over year the 2nd is industrial automotive and aerospace which goes into industrial automotive aerospace military applications and includes broad based sales sales were $6400000 or twenty of sales up five sequentially and up 23 over the same quarter a year ago the 3rd is communications in enterprise which consists of wireless infostructure including five g data center and networking this was the fastest growing segment over the same quarter last year sales were $5400000 for sixteen of sales up three sequentially and up 103 year over year we have had a number of initiatives within the company to expand gross margins and those initiatives are paying off non gapped gross margins during the quarter were 52 one of 530 basis points over q two non gapped operating expenses were $12500000 of five sequentially comprised of 7000000 in r and d and 5500000 now interest expense was $100000 and this generated non gap net income of $4400000 or ¢23 per share and that is compared to a loss in the prior quarter of 2200000 or ¢fourteen per share stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes were $5100000 this was higher than the $3600000 in the prior year some new higher stock grants and the establishment of an executive performance stock bonus plan trade receivables were $17200000 that was up from 13000000 in q two due to higher revenue but dsos decreased from 58 days in q two to just 49 days in q three up slightly from 14800000 in q two we generated $4200000 in cash from operations and used 2500000 for the purchase of assets we had $35000000 in bank debt going into the quarter but we paid this off entirely and finished the quarter with no bank debt we then ended the quarter with $69200000 in cash i would now like to provide some guidance for the 4th quarter of 2020 we expect q four to be another great quarter with continued sequential revenue growth growth margin expansion and increasing net income we expect 4th quarter revenue will be up ten to fifteen sequentially at the midpoint this would put revenue at about $36000000000 we expect continued growth margin expansion with non gap gross margins increasing to approximately 53 plus or minus a point operating expenses are expected to increase between eight and ten sequentially which at the midpoint would be approximately $13700000 we will not incur any interest expense since we no longer have any bank debt income taxes will be nominal and less than fifty k for the quarter the basic share count in q four will be approximately 17000000 shares in addition the dilutive impact of employee rsus will add approximately 2200000 shares taking the total dilutive share count used for our eps calculation to approximately 19200000 shares stock based compensation expense will be approximately $5500000 up from q three due to the higher stock price and a few new higher grants so based on the guidance just given we expect 4th quarter non gapped eps will be between ¢28 and ¢32 per share so in summary we have an exceptional workforce i have truly differentiated products that address large and growing markets we have a number of new products in the pipeline an enviable list of tier one customers a strong balance sheet and we are looking forward to a very strong q four at this time i would like to inform everyone in order to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad again that is star one to ask a question we have your 1st question from blaine curtis from berkeley your line is open and then you are you are now coming ahead of that range now what most materially improved between now and then and then if you could look out into december you are obviously getting for some more expansion there could you give us a little color on segments between the three where you are seeing that growth sequentially kind of across the board with our customers in that in that segment we also mentioned in our revised in our press release with our revised guidance in august that we had won a design win a phone design win that also contributed you know we are not going to report that the  the phone revenue specifically one because we are not allowed to but i will provide some color to that when we increased our guidance in august about half of that increase i was related to that new phone design win and the the balance was obviously then strength in non phone so that that was kind of what happened in in the 3rd quarter in the 4th quarter we are seeing very strong revenue growth as i mentioned our guidance is that revenue will be up ten to fifteen i will mention the phone again not specifically but phone revenue will probably account for about a 3rd of that strength i think the main improvement and therefore non phone basically accounts for the balance of that but we are we are expecting growth in all of our market segments going from q three to q four great that is super helpful and then my follow up is just really around the the largest customer for you guys that obviously stepped up materially into september along with that margins clearly stepped up as well can you talk about what is driving that better margin performance clearly you are you are seeing some accretive as that customer steps up but can you talk to your other segments as well is there a material part of that uptick that is also coming from the comms enterprise and the auto industrial space as well as as those products move over absolutely absolutely you know we have talked for a long time about the gross margin drivers in our business you know our newer products generally are higher asp and higher performance as as those newer products become a larger percentage of our sales that drives higher blended gross margins that is twelve we are taking more of our sales direct that cuts out the distributor that improves our gross margins we have made a lot of progress and reducing our product material costs that would be wayfarer costs that improves gross margins our ops group has done a great job at improving sort and test yields and package costs that improves gross margins volume helps us our even though we are fabulous we have a certain amount of manufacturing overhead that is relatively fixed so as the volume goes up that manufacturing overhead is a percent of sales decreases that helps grow our margins and so you know we have been working on this now for for a while and you know we saw very significant growth in margins expansion from q two to q three as i mentioned gross margins increased 530 basis points from q two to q three and i have guided for at least another point of improvement plus or minus going from q three to q four great congratulate each other on the nice results guys thank you thank you yeah i think we talked a little bit about it last time basically the quartz industry as we know has done a stellar job in the last seventy years of providing product to everybody in the electronics world but i think that it is still a batch process it is a fab process it is a factory process everybody has to invest in factories and these factories are purpose made so they can not be used for anything else they do not have the scale and they do not have the flexibility that a fabless company like sycamore which uses semiconductor materials can get i mean as a reminder when we build our mems resonators we can a 1000000 sorry 10000 wafers should give us about a 1000000000 units and these are 180 nanometer technology wafers so not really that difficult to get so it is fundamentally their supply chain is batch made and i think it has these issues with it there were some reports of some stumbles in fabbs in in in the asian markets and i think we saw a spike in demand coming that did not impact q three by the way i am just talking that we we saw spikes in people because people get nervous when that happens and this is not the 1st time ten years ago there was a big a big problem with ceramic packaging as you know all quartz products whether oscillators or resonators are quartz packaged because to because they are fragile and they want to to keep a very strong packaging those quartz packaging ceramic packages come from only two people in the world and sometimes there is a shortage so i think they have these multiple points of failure potentially and that is what i was pointing out to and yeah there have been some there have been some you know anecdotal events in the last few months and in the continuing we expect to see that it is just a it is just a reminder to our customers it does not significantly change our revenue but what it does is in the medium to longer term it gets our customer so a reminder that they are probably better off in moving to more stable supply chains yeah that is that is great perspective thank you for that and that is my follow up congratulations on on entering the the resonator market and now obviously you are covering the entire gamut of the timing market and then in the past you have talked about targeting at about a $10000000000 tag if you kind of combine all three sub segments could you update us where you are at annie is now with your penetration with new products into the resonator market yeah our sam is still around a 1000000000 to a 1000000000two it might be a little bit higher depending on when when we introduce products and so on but it s certainly less than 2000000000 it s also mostly concentrated right now in in oscillators so while we do have resonators that have been introduced while we do have analog clocking solutions that have been introduced are ramp into that from a revenue point of view we have already said expectations will be relatively slow i think our entry into these markets is significant for customers in the following way in the way that they can then come and have conversations with us on all of these products and not every customer wants to talk to us about every one of them sometimes they want to talk to us only about resonators or oscillators and then that becomes an entry point to talking about other products so it is  it is from a tam point of view we are still pretty tiny yeah you know 1500000000 in tam out of a $8000000000 total market sam at 1500000000 tam out of an $88000000000 total market and of course site times revenue is you know still pretty pretty small in comparison you know at around a 100000000 so we still even though we are not the biggest we still have a lot of potential to grow we maintained and did not grow our sam very much we would still probably have a long way to go before we fill out those boots thank you for that information congratulations again great thank you tor we have your next question from queen bolten from meadham your line is open hey guys congratulations on the on the nice results wanted to start off with the supply chain issues you talked about with quarts i believe that was one of the factors that led to the to the phone when that you announced last quarter you know as you look forward do you think that those court supply chain issues position you potentially when additional sku is either at that that customer or other large smartphone vendors i think that will have some impact when but i do not think that it is forecastable i think it is  it is a general slow trend and i have talked about this several times it is a general slow trend and it is it is not at the point where it is gotten that snowball has become very big but it is a trend that we see and we have always said that people design us in for performance reasons as well as for supply chain but overwhelmingly they design us for performance reasons just to just to pick a you know i would say less than fifteen of the time we get designed in for supply chain reasons but those supply chain reasons are important because when people look at their supply chains and see these perturbations that happen from time to time and these by the way these perturbations are not new they have been going on for for a long time but but customers did not have an alternative now that they do have an alternative it just becomes one more factor in their thinking particularly when they are looking further out in time particularly say for example in automotive or i think it might be prudent to do that but i would still push on our performance benefits as being the primary reason for adoption great that 2nd question i know with the recent introduction of the apex membrane family you are moving into the resonator is that correct are you targeting select frequencies you know where you know high volume frequencies with the initial resonators and i guess related question you know since you design this in silicon do you need new mask sets every time the frequency changes in those resonator structures thank you yeah yeah absolutely we to answer your 2nd question 1st we do need a new mask set sometimes those are very similar they are not the the the design of the resonator is not very different for example between a 24 megahertz and a 26 megahertz it is not going to be very different however between a 24 megahertz and  76eight megahertz i think it could be different but generally the good news is that the set the the resonator industry has worked around the quartz limitations in the past and there are basically a handful maybe two handfuls so let us call it a dozen but quote unquote popular frequencies that exist and and so i think that makes our task easier as we go from one frequency to the other and you are absolutely right we will not only target the most popular ones but we will target the ones where the frequency is one thing but where we bring the combination of size of of resilience of environmental stability and clearly of high volume because these are low price products they are sub ¢twenty products in price and so obviously the volume has to be opportunity has to be in the 10s of 1000000s for it to be interesting for us those are some of the key there are several reasons to do it now there is another thing that is going to happen over time as frequencies of socs increase the requirement for frequencies beyond say 75 megahertz increases and that is an area where we think that quartz technology has has difficulty getting to a high volume high frequency high reliability small size product that is where also we would shine and i am thinking 234 years out particularly in consumer products perhaps in phone applications i do not think we wanted to get that detailed in our in our guidance we do expect growth in each one of those segments and and i will leave it at that and we will announce that segment growth in more detail when we actually announce 4th quarter results so perhaps for art with the  increasing mobile content you have now can you use this framework for thinking about seasonality going forward 1st half 1st half 2nd half 1st quarter versus maybe before you know coming into this year sure well if you look at the seasonality in our business and we do have seasonality go back to last year 2019 right 2nd half of the year much stronger than the 1st half people can go back and and quantify that we saw pretty much the same thing this year you know the back half of this year much stronger than the 1st half of this year q two of course was was somewhat depressed in our mobile and iot segment because of the global slowdown and the fact that so many retail stores were closed and i think next year it s going to be somewhat similar in terms of 1st half versus 2nd half obviously we expect year over year growth you know q one next year should be nicely higher than q one of this year and q two over q two and three and three and four and four so we we expect you know next year we will have good growths we are not quantifying that at this point but in terms of the seasonality it is going to look i think similar to how it looked last year and this year okay that is very helpful and then perhaps on the the infrastructure side five g wireless infrastructure in particular are you having design wins kind of showing up every quarter that help that be a steady growth driver or my yeah i think it is a slow steady drumbeat of products you know our our products are also showing up we talked about the 9501 in the optical module business that is clearly showing up the oran that i referred to earlier i think yeah 10s of design wins that showed up in the last in the last few months yeah so so it is just a steady growth and what i am excited about is the breadth of where five g touches so again as i have said it is not just the distribute the digital unit or the  ru it is it is the mid hall the back hall the microwave the you know it is in the servers it is in it is all it is in so much of the infrastructure and as i have mentioned before this is probably a 57 year roll out it should be a very very solid place for site time okay helpful caller thank you for jess hey great great phone call we have your next question from alisanne d arcy from william blair your line is open yes sure maybe a quick question for our just on operating expenses can you update us on the long term operating model and how we should be thinking about it you guys have really had our due diligence tremendous yeah great great great question well revenue kind of got ahead of our expenses so that is that is a good thing you know our kind of stated long term goal is that we would grow opex at about half the rate of top line growth so just for sake of mathematical example if we were to grow revenue year over year by twenty then i would expect opex to grow by about ten so that is kind of a   generalized long term goal if you look at the last couple of quarters you know q two our revenue went up 52 sequentially but only five but opex only went up five sequentially so yeah we we could not ramp expenses quite fast enough my guide for q four we are guiding revenue up ten to fifteen and i am guiding opex up eight to ten so that is a little more than half the but that is because of a little bit of a catch up because we were so low in terms of opex growing q two too so does that does that kind of frame it for you when you think of other companies doing a bunch of software in opex and scaling that we are not in the software business or not meaningfully in that on the other hand the number of opportunities that are coming at us are coming pretty thick and fast so we always would like to retain the ability to invest at  at a greater rate you know within reason or to the best of our ability model that was put out by art understood that that is helpful and a helpful reminder on the on the geometries and then just one more question i believe last quarter when you announced the cascade product the clock i see product that you expected revenue to really be at you know a 2021 event beginning and then probably ramping beyond that as we look at the standalone resonator product should we be thinking about the timeframe to revenue you know in a similar fashion or what are the puts and takes to there for the customer standpoint yeah i would say that is even slower alex i would say that you know because there is two kinds of design wins we would have we would have standalone design wins so we would go to oems and sell them resonators that is one and then the other one would be to go to scc vendors the ones we sort of for example gave and they would design it into their products both of them particularly the 2nd one take a long time so the gestation period for that for meaningful revenue is easily twice as long as the clocking business so yeah so of course there can be other times when it can happen very fast but but generally that is a good rule of thumb that is helpful zero that is it for me thank you thanks guys we have your next question from chris castle from raymond james is your line open yes thank you good evening i guess question on on margins and i guess as we go forward into next year there is a lot of different factors with seasonality some of the different margin profiles of the different segments that are going to move in seasonality could you give us a sense of you know what what should we expect as we we go forward yeah great great question so you know our long term goal for gross margins that we have talked about is getting gross margins somewhere closer to sixty and that is going to take us two to three years give or take so you know to just kind of do that math we need to get our cost structure down and get our gross margins up we are targeting gross margin expansion of maybe three points a year now we obviously did much better than that going from q two to q three but you know just for the next couple of years if we can add three points we get to sixty margin you know in in two to three years within a year there are some dynamics that affect gross margins by quarter and you are right in the 1st half of the year generally are mobile iot and consumer business which is somewhat lower gross margins i would argue that gross margins would be a little higher in the 1st half of the year just because of mix but the counter to that is we have this leverage on our manufacturing overhead so the lower volumes actually hurt us on that side so taking all that into account just like we have dynamics this year of gross margins being nicely higher in the back half of the year versus the 1st half i would expect the same thing next year so so i would model gross margins for what you think it would be for the year in total margins will be higher in the back half than they will be in the 1st half i think they will be much stronger in the back half of next year even stronger of course than they are in the back half of this year that is very helpful thank you as a follow up perhaps you could talk to us about you know kind of what you are targeting for next year and there is a lot of opportunities in front of you you know in terms of what do you expect what do you expect to drive the growth next year and there is a lot on your plate there is a lot of opportunity there what are the things we should be paying attention to i think the market that we the market trends that we have outlined continue so clearly comms enterprise data centers are a big play we are continuing to find more traction in automotive as more and more electric vehicles show up because a lot of automated driving is happening in that we have a nice little story and connection growing in the middle aerospace market and then finally the mobile iot piece of it less the consumer the mobile iot piece of it is always a natural place for side times growth because you know the size the resiliency the performance so i think we are also continuing to expand our customer base you know five years ago we were addressing about 2000 customers today we are about five x that maybe a little bit more and so i think the expansion of customer base this is not the big customers this is customers that are off of much much smaller size where we are working in the channel to to connect with them i think that is  that is a good initiative for cytex as well so i think those are some ways that we think that is great very helpful thank you great thanks chris i am showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to mister arthur chadway sir please continue ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference call thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day you may all disconnect",

eight k filed today it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to mark thank you janet and good morning and happy new year to you all it is hard to believe it has been a full year since my 1st earnings call as ceo of bed bath and beyond and what an exceptional year of change it has been at that time i clearly stated that fiscal 20193rd quarter results were unsatisfactory and underscored the imperative to change i declared that we must respond to the challenges we face as a business including pressured sales and profitability and reconstruct a modern durable model for longterm profitable growth today we stand in a very different position as a company than we did just a mere twelve months ago firstly we continue to execute on our digital 1st on the always strategy and they have delivered a 2nd consecutive quarter of comparable sales and ebitda growth through strong margin management secondly responding to our customers wherever they needed us growing out omni capabilities to accelerate profitable digital growth and grow our customer base thirdly we continue to strengthen an already strong balance sheet and remain focused on ensuring liquidity optimizing costs and significantly reducing debt while driving positive cash flow generation and while we drive overall business results we also completed our non core bene monetization plan with the final transaction set to close in our fiscal 2024th quarter these efforts will help fund our transformation and put us in a position to start fiscal 2021 with a more cohesive set of core businesses our favorable sales results are also starting to be reflected in market share data month by month we have been minimizing our share differentials versus the market and encouragingly in the most recent mpd data for october and november we achieved market share gains in the bed category with improving trends in both bath and kitchen categories we expect to see continued improvement in market share trend as our strategy continues to take hold additionally we continue to show strong market share strength in wedding registry where we believe we are very well positioned as a market leader when we get back to celebrating important life moments such as getting married all of this has been achieved this quarter despite the significant headwinds of covid nineteen during our call today gustavo arnal chief financial officer and treasurer will review at the quarter financial results and then provide some perspective on our 4th quarter and our outlook for fiscal 2021 then rafeh masood chief digital officer will speak about the quarter from a digital 1st and customer perspective and then john hartmann chief operating officer and president buybuy baby will do the same for our operations including the progress on our plans to close underperforming stores and invest in our remaining portfolio we will then take questions gustavo thank you mark and good morning everyone today i will cover two key topics 1st i will provide perspective on the performance of our 3rd quarter as well as on december sales trends and then i will provide visibility on the current 4th quarter as well as on our outlook for fiscal year 2021 to begin it is important to note that our 1st qua 1st quarter runs through september october and november and consistent with last year the saturday of thanksgiving weekend was the last date of the period we delivered strong results despite extensive and widely reported covid related headwind these included lower foot traffic trends shipping capacity constraints and much higher freight costs further during a challenging holiday period we strengthened our commercial plans to drive significant digital demand while remaining focused on delivering gross margin expansion positive comp sales growth was led by our core bed bath and beyond banner which was up five it was fueled by exponential digital growth of 94 which more than offset stores declined of fourteen growth was healthy and broad base across five key destination categories which grew eleven and represented two thirds of revenue total enterprise comparable sales grew two also driven by strong digital comp growth up 77 as you will hear from john in a few minutes covid related headwind disproportionally impacted store sales in our baby business during the quarter yet encouragingly we saw a return to growth in december following some key interventions the strength of our digital growth has been powered by the investments we have made in omni capability including bopus curbside pickup and same day delivery which are all completely new this year bopus orders represented sixteen of total digital sales in the quarter these service offerings provide ease and convenience and allow us to further gain trust from our customers including the approximately 7000000 new online customers gained this year our digital capabilities are becoming a key driver of results net sales were 2600000000 an expected reduction of five primarily due to the impact from banner divestitures and the continuation of our bed bath and beyond store network optimization initiatives this has been a holiday season like no other as outlined by 3rd party data sources including sense or madec and adobe analytics market wide black friday in store traffic was down by over fifty and online spending was up 22 similarly for the six week holiday period market wide in store traffics fell between 34 and 36 we performed strongly against this reported trends during the competitive intense five day holiday sales period from thanksgiving through cyber monday overall comp sales demand for our core u s bed bath and beyond banner was up double digits versus last year and delivered digital comp sales growth of approximately 69 more than outfitting store comp sales decline of 24 and during the six week holiday sales period from november sixteen to december 27 our total enterprise comp sales grew low single digits led by significant digital growth of more than ninety which more than offset store com sales declined more than twenty i will now continue with our 3rd quarter financial results on a gap basis including the non cash loss from banners divested or held for sale we reported a net loss per diluted share of ¢61 our gaping sales include approximately $86000000 from favorable impacts which are excluded from adjusted results to provide better perspective on the underlying performance of our business these include special items such as losses on the sales of businesses including cost plus world market which has helped for sale as well on non cash charges for the impairment of certain long lived assets plus restructuring and transformation expenses adjusted gross margin increased 310 basis points to 35four this expansion was driven by 180 basis points of favorable strategic engineering of promotion and markdown expense including data driven coupon optimization 120 basis points of favorable product mix from higher margin categories such as bedding and bath and 210 basis points of leverage from distribution and fulfillment costs these benefits were partially offset by 200 basis points impact from channel mix due to the anticipated larger proportion of total sales from digital channels versus the prior year this impact also includes around eighty basis points from higher shipping expense associated with industry wide outbound freight rate increases particularly in the latter part of the quarter the significant year over year improvement and our adjusted gross margin reflect the management themes focus on driving the components of margin while delivering explanation growth in digital sgna expense declined $41000000 versus the prior year driven primarily by lower payroll related expenses including savings from our comprehensive restructuring actions earlier in the year adjusted ebitda increased 168 to $121000000 which is almost three times higher than the prior year period this was driven by digital sales growth coupled with gross margin expansion once again this results demonstrate that our efforts to transform the business and build a modern durable business model are working turning now to some cashflow and balance sheet statements we unlocked $244000000 in positive cashflow generation cashflow from investments was $200000000 positive that it included proceeds from non core asset monetization net of operating cash flow of $44000000 was also positive in spite of seasonal dynamics we continue to carefully manage working capital this quarter with ending inventories of 1800000000 on a sequential basis inventories were thirteen lower versus the 2nd quarter and thirty lower than last year this was primarily due to the impact from banner divestitures including seasonal inventory purchases for the holiday selling period we are tracking at a faster pace to deliver our previously stated 2021 goal of $1000000000 in inventory reduction at retail compared to 2019 our capital expenditures in the quarter were only 38000000 that said we have plans to significantly ramp up our cap expanding starting in fiscal 21 in support of our digital 1st transformation during the 3rd quarter we also improve our gross debt balance with a reduction in operating lease liability of about half a $1000000000 from non core banner divestitures and store closures taken together with a half a 1000000000 in debt reduction we achieved in the 2nd quarter we have reduced total gross debt by about $1000000000 so far this year a reduction of about 25 we remain in a strong net cash position with an ending cash and investment balance of 1500000000 this is in line with the balance at the end of the 2nd quarter even after returning cash to shareholders in the form of accelerated share repurchases we have also maintained a strong liquidity of $2200000000 including our abl so capitalizing on this strong financial position we launched the 225000000 accelerated share repurchase in late october and in december in conjunction with the announcement of a definitive agreement to divest cost plus world market we reported plans for a 2nd asr in the amount of 150000000 these two programs totaling 375000000 are expected to be completed on or before the end of our fiscal 4th quarter next month in february and will result in a reduction of our shares outstanding of approximately fifteen at current stock price levels our authorized level for share repurchase at this early stage of the planning period is now up to $825000000 over the next three years these actions reflect our balanced capital allocation principles strong liquidity and competency in our strategic growth plan in summary our 3rd quarter performance shows consistent execution of our strategy which drives sales and ebitda growth coupled with strong cash flow generation and the reinitiation of capital return to shareholders now moving on to our outlook i will start with some direction of on our expectations for q four and then provide perspective from fiscal 2021 it has been widely reported that covid nineteen related headwinds continue to impact the retail industry in this context we will not be providing specific sales and earnings guidance for the current 4th quarter that is it we feel positive about the parts of the business we can control and expect to deliver year year adjusted ebitda margin improvement in q four this despite low stores shopping and shipping constraints accompanied by higher freight costs in terms of the top line comp sales are expected to be approximately in line with last year we expect consistent strength in digital to be tampered by covid related headwinds impacting stores december sales show positive total enterprise comparable growth including continued strength across key destination categories importantly we are planning for a double digit on favorable impact on q four total net sales versus last year even the divested banners and the ongoing store optimization initiative in terms of growth margin in spite of the anticipated drag from significant freight cost increases in q four we are driving cost optimization actions to manage the impact of these pressures so we expect gross margin to be above in line with the same period last year again we expect to deliver a year on year adjusted ebitda margin increase in q four with absolute ebitda figures in line with the prior year now i will turn to fiscal 2021 our initial outlook included fiscal year 2019 as the base year at the time our portfolio banner review was still underway we had already divested four banners but we did not have a signed deal for cost plus world market yet now we do and we expect this transaction to close imminently today we are providing additional visibility on the significant we shape of our p l as a result of these divestitures and the closure of under performing stores our significant portfolio transformation will lead to fewer better performing stores and will include a healthier core revenue base with a larger proportion of a faster growing digital business we are now tightening our projected fiscal 21 revenue range to approximately eight to 8200000000 looking at quarters starting with the 1st quarter which will not be on a comp basis we expect to recapture the lost sales opportunities from the store closures in 2020 due to covid nineteen during quarters two through four which will be on a comp basis we expect to sustain comparable sales levels in relation to the solid console space of fiscal 2020 our sales forecast for financial planning purposes assumes total enterprise comparable sales to be in line with fiscal 2020 we are reiterating our expectation for adjusted gross margin of approximately 35 which represents a more than 200 basis point improvement versus proforma 2019 we are enhancing adjusted fiscal year 2021 ebitda to a range of between 500 to $525000000 this represents a twenty increase from the proforma 2019 ebitda base of 425000000 the drivers of the adjusted ebitda range are consistent with the ones we have previously shared including cost savings from planned store closures product sourcing and restructuring actions and the impact from re investments and channel shift and shipping costs and as i said earlier we have assumed comp sales to be in line versus fiscal 2020 for modeling purposes as we are not requiring sales growth to deliver the higher ebitda range but needless to say we will strive for continued top line growth in a highly competitive environment our performance to date gives us confidence in our longer term goal of achieving between 850 and $1000000000 in adjusted ebitda by fiscal 2023 importantly our portfolio transformation coupled with store closures is driving significant balance sheet improvement to reduction of $1000000000 this would resolve in a gross debt to ebitda ratio below threefive times which puts us well on our way to our midterm goal or below three times we have a strategic and disciplined pathway for driving sales and margin growth generating cash and investing our business plan to drive shareholder value creation and it is working i will now turn the call over to rafeh masood chief digital officer rafeh thank you gustavo with covid as a headwind to our store traffic we have stepped up our strategy as an omni always retailer and it is paying off during the 3rd quarter we delivered digital growth of 77 our 3rd consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 75 this year our bed bath and beyond banner alone posted digital com sales up 94 almost doubling last year sale with this momentum and based on current trends we are on track to exceed our digital sales goal of $3000000000 by the end of fiscal 2020 we have laid out a transformation plan to unlock the potential of our omni always growth strategy by elevating customer experience building out our omni capabilities and evolving to a digital 1st culture the goal of this initiative is to meet customers wherever they are i am pleased to report that the company is now incredibly equipped to do that the benefits are coming through not only in digital sales growth but also in customer metrics during the quarter we gained 2200000 new online customers of which the bed bath banner alone added 1800000 year to date we have gained approximately 7000000 new online customers and not only are we attracting new customers we are seeing them return at a higher rate than ever before in the 3rd quarter 21 of our bed bath and beyond customers placed more than one online order compared to about sixteen versus last year so what is driving the sticky customer experience for online customers we believe the true hero for us is buy online pickup in store since introducing bopus and contact lists curbside pickup services earlier this year we have seen a rapid rate of adoption by our customers in the 3rd quarter approximately 1200000 customers placed a bopus order representing sixteen of our total digital revenue in the bed bath and beyond banner bopus orders represented fifteen of total digital sales and seventeen of total digital orders and sixty of our bopus orders are were ready within thirty minutes surpassing our two hour promise this fast and convenient experience has earned bed bath and beyond a net promoter score of eighty for our bopus services up from 49 in may when we 1st introduced the service our stores are now a competitive advantage of our omni strategy fulfilling a total of 36 of all digital sales in the 3rd quarter this muscle was not in place last year now we are connecting our stores with our online platforms and the power of omni is enabling us to better serve our customers however they choose to shop we know omni channel is the future of retail and we are making the right investments that are resonating with our customers the fast paced transformation of our digital offering and elevated customer experience has resulted in a 25 lift in our online conversion rate for the 3rd quarter as compared to the pre prior year key drivers of the increase include 1st the relaunch of our mobile sites and mobile apps we implemented a new framework of an optimized experience that drove a 33 increase in conversion and mobile sales growth of 107 versus the prior year period during the five day holiday shopping period from thanksgiving to cyber monday our mobile homepage loaded 74 faster than the same period last year we also relaunched bed bath and beyond and buybuy baby mobile apps resulting in over 800000 downloads this quarter our bed bath and beyond mobile app was launched over 15000000 times during this quarter and revenue more than doubled versus last year we have also seen the rate of app uninstalls continue to improve further underscoring the stickiness of our customer experience 2nd in order to ensure that we were firing on all cylinders going into the holiday season we launched same day delivery on bed bath and beyond com and buybuy baby com to provide our customers another convenient and cost effective way to shop this service was introduced in q three results are preliminary but we have seen 100s of 1000s of our customers take advantage of this new convenient way to shop we also began to offer same day delivery service through the launch of bed bath and beyond and buybuy baby stores on shipped and instacart with both marketplaces each reaching more than eighty of u s households harmon face values was recently added to the instacart marketplace and we are pleased with its initial launch and continued positive response from customers on this platform 3rd we implemented over a 100 improvements to make our shopping experience more convenient and easier to use including a faster checkout process and due payment type options this includes buy now pay later options like afterpay and paypal is payinfo as well as extending apple pay from store only to our mobile apps during the quarter we also focused on optimizing our experiences and speed to place orders on our site making it even easier convenient and faster for our customers to shop with us again each of these initiatives were geared to customers with the goal of meeting them where they are and creating multiple options for payment and delivery as we look at our digital program holistically is a true revolution from where we were a year ago and has become part of the fabric of how we operate at bed bath and beyond the customer environment is rapidly changing and we are there to greet them at every turn through our enhanced services speed and focus on engagement our customer perception continues to improve our omni always strategy is working and was a key driver of our 3rd quarter sales performance our strength in digital has more than compensated for the headwinds of the pandemic and has fast track our transformation as we moved into the important holiday season this year and sets us up for success moving forward we have delivered an elevated customer experience launched meaningful capabilities and pivoted digital from a laggard tactic to a strategic asset and a profitable growth engine that has delivered another strong quarter of growth with that i will turn the call over to john hartmann our chief operating officer and president of buybuy baby john thank you rafeh we made exceptional progress across our operations in the 3rd quarter specifically as it relates to our supply chain reformation optimizing our real estate portfolio in advancing our technology roadmap modernizing our business remains a key focus and we are evolving our store formats our distribution and fulfillment capabilities alongside leveraging our unique data and insights to meet the changing needs of our customers and deliver an exceptional shopping experience i will start with supply chain while we remained focused on mid to long term capability building we made very substantial pivots in the 3rd quarter as rafeh mentioned our stores fulfilled 36 of total digital sales in the 3rd quarter well last year we did not have bopus curbside pickup or same day delivery in our offering not only do these new capabilities provide ease and convenience to our customers they also help us to partially alleviate current shipping constraints and additional cost pressures in the supply chain during the quarter we also added a secondary national carrier in several regional parcel delivery carriers which helped to offset an over twenty cost increase from our primary carrier fedex and importantly we continue to focus intently on the health and safety of our associates working in our fulfillment centers by instituting daily covid cleaning procedures in our facilities concurrently we launched an evaluation of a number of potential 3rd party logistics providers who will partner with us to establish new regional distribution centers and to manage the efficient flow of domestic distribution we anticipate that using 3rd party logistics operators will also provide increased financial flexibility and reduce capital expense this is the cornerstone of the transformation of our supply chain network and will increase our capacity for fast store replenishment while continuing to leverage the store network for omni fulfillment by making the replenishment process more efficient our store teams will have a more predictable and faster flow of the products we sell most in turn this will allow us to meet the increased demand for bopus curbside and same day delivery services while also reducing the time our store team spend managing deliveries so they can spend more time with our customers also core to our transformation is technology and we are taking a disciplined approach to our investments in building a technology infrastructure that will enable us to personalize the service for our customers improve our ability to predict and meet demand make it easier to collaborate across teams and drive down inefficiencies in our business over the next three years we plan to invest approximately $250000000 to modernize the application and technology landscape to a cloud empowered foundation last quarter we talked about our expanded multi year partnership with google and deloitte to enhance our omni channel shopping experience this quarter we defined our plans for a new erp system we will also be pursuing a product life cycle management solution in support of our own brand initiative and an inventory management capability to improve inventory productivity these plans will all start in 2021 and our foundational parts of building out our technology infrastructure in other activities we are making significant progress toward the targets we have previously highlighted regarding our real estate portfolio including our store network optimization and store remodel plans let me start with our network optimization program which is designed to not only ensure our stores remain a strategic asset for us but also to ensure that we have them in the right locations to deliver more sustainable sales growth improved margins and greater cash generation as part of this work we are well underway in the process of closing approximately 200 under performing bed bath and beyond stores by the end of fiscal 2021 initially we identified about 13rd of these stores to be closed by the end of the fiscal year we have since accelerated the pace of targeted store closings this year from seventy to about 120 stores with certain stores closing earlier than planned due to having efficiently sold down store inventory during the closing process in the 3rd quarter we closed four bed bath and beyond stores and in december we closed another 75 and we are currently liquidating an additional 42 stores we are very please with our progress to date and completing the store closure program during fiscal 2021 remains a priority turning to our bed bath and beyond store remodel program we have advanced from the initial prototype phase to active iteration within ten stores in our houston markets these proof of concept stores highlight our destination categories bed bath kitchen and storage we expect to complete this phase of the remodel program by the end of february 2021 additionally we will take all the visual signage enhancements and immediately apply them to the entire fleet of stores on the same timeline next we will take our learnings from houston and move into our 1st expanded wave of renovations in 2021 which includes approximately 150 stores in total our store remodel plan involves $250000000 of investment over the next three years and touches over 450 stores representing roughly sixty of our revenue in addition we will utilize strategic sourcing methods to procure necessary remodel components at a lower cost and leverage economies of scale with this overall initiative instead of the legacy store by store one off approach of the past we have established a unified planning process to identify prioritize and sequence all aspects of the remodels these store remodels and our network optimization plans are crucial steps in building an omni always organization that serves our digital 1st customers with an intuitive and modern shopping experience we look forward to reporting our progress along the way before closing let me provide some perspective on the quarterly performance of buybuy baby which represented approximately ten of total enterprise reported sales in the 3rd quarter this included strong growth in digital of approximately forty which represented more than half of the sales in the quarter it remains a challenging environment for our new or soon to be parents who are particularly vulnerable to the perceived challenges associated with in store shopping due to covid nineteen as a result we saw a disproportionate level of store traffic declines from our baby customers this quarter then across our other banners these covid related headwinds have also a short term impact on the registry component of our business which is highly correlated to in store activity while we have seen overall growth in the registry digital registries created online currently tend to carry a lower average value than those created in store enhancements to the digital registry experience are addressing this opportunity to assist our customers and building more well rounded baby wishlist covid headwinds have also constrained inventory levels in certain of our key categories such as furniture and gear as a result of disruptions in the global supply chain we have made key pivots here including sharing improved forecasts with our vendor partners well into 2021 so as consumer behavior shifted we pivoted and leaned into digital to create an enhanced online experience with a more convenient suite of checkout options including afterpay payinfo and apple pay we also upgraded and relaunched our buybuy baby app in november strengthening the choices we offer our customers who connect with us digitally year to date we have gained nearly 2000000 u s online customers an increase of 46 over the last year including more than a half a 1000000 new online customers in the 3rd quarter in all nearly two thirds of our baby customers only shopped online this quarter as young parents take safety into consideration this year our new omni capabilities allowed us to meet them where they are with bopus curbside in same day delivery services digital orders fulfilled by our baby stores represented a significant portion of total orders in the quarter with bopus orders representing approximately half of all store fulfilled orders while the holiday period is traditionally not a big baby season except for gift giving or needs of families getting ready for or just having had a baby we did see strong digital demand comp growth of 49 year over year during the five day holiday period from thanksgiving to cyber monday this growth was driven by top performing baby categories including toys playroom furniture and apparel these positive sales and category trends accelerated in december we believe in this business and we are now ready to double down on and significantly invest in expanding sales and margin and growing our market share we plan to accelerate our growth in baby over the next several years including introducing own brands aging up into toddler in younger children as well as expanding into categories like toys and educational as well as furniture enhancing our registry and leading with new partnerships we will also invest scale our footprint nationwide with about fifty new stores over the next three years fiscal 2021 will mark the true beginning of the transformation of this banner as we execute our three year plan and unlock the value of this brand earlier this week we announced the appointment of patty wu as senior vice president and general manager for buybuy baby patty is exceptional experience will help accelerate our plans and drive meaningful change we look forward to sharing our progress in future conference calls mark i will turn it back over to you now for closing remarks thank you john a strong performance this quarter across several key performance metrics including positive comp sales growth gross margin expansion positive cash flow generation and growth debt reduction is evidence of our transformation taking hold even despite the significant headwinds of a global pandemic yet what i saw beyond the numbers was even more impressive our team was planning modifying and executing in an aligned and disciplined way like never before they were learning and improving in real time as the customer and conditions changed showing true agility in motion these newly acquired muscles extended from product and price through messaging and digital expression to south floor and distribution center i am truly grateful to all our associates that rallied around this call to action to demonstrate that strengths and opportunities as the new bed bath and beyond team and what has been an exceptional year of change so far we still continue to make bold pivots to reconstruct renovate and restore our company simply put we are delivering more than what we said we would do in simple we put a team in place that would have the right talent and expertise to execute our new vision and inject new ideas and that we would create the right organizational structure to facilitate more streamlined decision making and we have done that we said we would lean into the digital space and make it easier and more convenient for our customer to shop with us and we are doing that we said we reset our cost structure modernize for growth and refine our organization and we have done that and continue to focus on gross margin improvement we said we had a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omni channel home destination and that we would use customer inspired and market insights to develop a new customer value proposition and we are doing that we said we would evaluate our asset base and how best to optimize its value for the business on a go forward basis and we have done that and finally we said our mission is to ensure the bed bath and beyond is well positioned to long term success and we are doing just that i am proud of what our teams have achieved and i thank them for their continued dedication and commitment to the long term success of our company our results it is quite a setup from base from which we will continue to drive out bold transformation and seek to deliver on our three year strategic and financial goals shared at our 2020 investor day we have many bold and exciting plans to fiscal 2021 such as launching your own brands that will help differentiate us in our key destination category remodeling approximately 150 stores under our store network optimization program introducing new and unique digital services designed to enhance our omni always experience modernizing our technology and operation and reinventing our supply chain for the future investing to further strengthen our buybuy baby and harmon and continuing to unlock and deliver shareholder value in a year like no other we are embracing and driving transformative change staying curious and bold and so much more i am proud of the commitment our team has shown and what we have achieved together with that we will now take your questions thank you we will now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press star then one on your touch tone phone if you wish to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key there will be a delay before the 1st question is announced if you are using a speaker phone you may need to pick up the handset 1st before pressing the numbers once again if you have a question press star then one on your touch tone phone and our 1st question is from kurt zero neal from bank of america good morning thanks very much for for taking my questions yeah so the 1st one is you know understand how you know very constrained shipping and freight was an issue for on our holiday margins but yeah how long do you think this pressure carries into 21 it sounds like at least for the full year you do not think it is an issue since you are still targeting twenty i am sorry 35 gross margins in in 21 and then just have a fall after that yeah good morning too thanks look we you know we know that the blood pressure you know across retail is here to stay and we have built that into our future plans so we see that our margin stability and the offset so we have created currently in the proof of concept of those over both q two and q three of this year really standards in good stead to deliver that 35 margin so we feel really comfortable around that okay so maybe just you know again for your march maybe give this a quick update on some of the big merchandising initiatives you guys have outlined in october and such as you know lower sourcing vendor costs and then you know starting to roll out improved and or merchandi or more exclusive product and you know how much of an impact that will make in 21 or we will just had to think about the cadence of those things you know in 2021 yeah i mean the good news is that we have already built a firm foundation with these results now the actions and trends we add here in terms of margin bought across the board are really substantial and sustainable and then we are going to add into those the rolling benefits as you outlined good so the sourcing benefits that we have undertaken throughout 2020 are really going to be evidenced in 1st quarter onwards in 2021 and then we begin in march with the rollout of our own brands and we are going to be sharing more clothes in the pagination of that flow throughout the year several brands will be launched but the key news is that in the 1st half of 2021 we will be addressing the majority of our big key categories we are already seeing strength and growth in reinventing those with own brands and also the introduction of opening price point items and are arranged there which has been a huge missing part of our equation in terms of being truly competitive in the marketplace to build our authority so the step changes the the the consistent management of promotions the mix management now we are going to lay in the incremental benefits of sourcing an own brand so we are excited about that progression in 2021 our next question is from morgan stanley good morning thanks for taking my question can you talk about where your expectations were a couple of months ago for the 4th quarter in sales and now and and i know the outlook for next year in bed flattish does that change now that you are going to be lapping at something that may be potentially weaker in this year is 4th quarter yeah i think again we had robust plans for q four of this year we feel good about how we are executing on those but there is no doubt that the covid headwinds and the impact that that has had on foot traffic and overall consumer confidence is something that we have had to factor into our plan tents while we talked about the agility about saying through q three and now q four to respond to those challenges and so we think we have met those in in you know what has been the table on time and we really look forward to the lapping those next year in a very different way okay thanks for that and then my follow up can you talk about q four you mentioned the frayed headwinds and but offset by some optimization on i think the gross margin and in terms of promotion and pricing can you talk about the promotional environment and then you know thinking about how much margin opportunity there still is i think for next year is guidance revision that is it looks like it is more of a function of the margin changing as opposed to the top line just to confirm yeah i think that you know we would stress that we did not become more promotional during the quarter in q three or in q four we have actually reshaped and re engineered our promotional activity we had opportunity to do so but that is really paying dividends in terms of generating gross margin and helping to create that balance and exceeding equation on the on the margin differentials from shipping and freight so we are less promotional we are more focused on reg price we are winning customers and we see that progressing forward as gustavo had outlined we are not putting pressure on the the working sales plan to generate even we believe that we can do that through a number of the different initiatives we have through cost control and definitely margin growth in 2021 as we outlined in that three day plan our three year plan sorry our next question is from bobby griffin from raymond james morning buddy thanks for taking my questions i guess we will start with mark the 1st thing i wanted to talk about was you know looking at the range for next year it is a fairly tight range of 500 to 525000000 ebitda you know was still a lot of uncertainty out there so can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you see in the business now that really gives you confidence and tightening that range up and as a 2nd part of that where what what could be the driver that would cause that range to underperform is it sales is it margin what what gives you the most concern there hi bobby gustavo here so definitely there is still a lot of uncertainties as we look forward but we feel very confident in our plans we have clarity on the drivers of gross margin expansion which is why we are reiterating a gross margin of 35 next year in spite of the reason headwinds that we are seeing on freight costs as mark mentioned we are being more data driven in managing our promotion and our mix and with that we will offset it it is a tighter range than the why the one we provided on investor is day but we set that as we completed the portfolio work the monetization of non core assets we would tighten that and that is what we are coming for to you right now on your question of what can throw us off it is not sales we are prudently assuming for financial planning purposes that we would have sales comp sales in line with prior year and buy with that we would deliver significant ebitda growth yeah bobby just i would just add that i think that the plan we are placing is a responsible plan based on changing circumstances in the market any threat or a consent would really be a macro market issue not an internally caused issue and again i think 2020 is exemplified how you know everyone gets affected by those things so we are monitoring things very carefully by working by quarter we feel our pla plan is responsible and achievable and we are looking forward to delivering that all right thank you i guess my 2nd question would be for the december commentary you mentioned that the enterprise did show some growth for comparable sales but then i guess for the entire quarter you are you are kind of calling for flattish versus last year or in line of believes that we are wording can you maybe just talk a little bit about what is going in there is something popped up in the last couple weeks has given you concern or is that just a little bit of you know a function of being conservative given the level of uncertainty that is still out there in the world yeah bang on there it is definitely around we have seen positive signs in december remembering that our 4th quarter is december january february we still had 24 months to complete this process there is a lot going on on the world and we want to make sure that we are being responsible in our planning and you know we look forward to kind of sharing more in the 4th quarter thank you very much best of luck once again if you have a question press star then one on your touch tone phone and our next question is from chris horvers from jp morgan thanks good morning guys so my 1st question is a follow up as you think about you know you talk about you know things evolving and changing as you thought about you know your your 21 plan is it fair to say that covid changed in terms of the recent surge are you assuming that this will sort of lasts longer until we actually get to a vaccine so what was the change there and also was the other change the freight costs i mean presumably as a holiday the volume surcharges should come down as you get into a more normalized sort of shipping environment here so is there something structural within that freight that you are that you are assuming sticks around yeah i think that i think it is prudent to to think about an environment i mean we saw an acceleration of change in behavior between you know our our q two in september october results and then november results based on covid and based on foot traffic to stores customers being concerned around what the future held and real uncertainty in the market really began around the election period so we a big prudent in thinking through you know with the vaccine rollout it is still underway it is still very early we want to be able to monitor that and its impacts we have not affected anything in terms of seamless checks and their impact on the business because again that is being so uncertain as only just being used so just ensuring that the level of uncertainty and volatility that that has or could bring is built conservatively into our plans and that we can balance out any of those headwinds you know i think it has been interesting that there has been a lot of discussion around the home category experiencing these great tile wins from you know the covid moment all of a sudden retail and baiting facing incredible headwinds and confusion and and consent from the customer that we have had to buy so i feel really positive that we are delivering positive comps profit ebitda in the face of that uncertainty and want to ensure that we have got a balanced plan going into 2021 got it so understood and then in terms of the 4th quarter i mean just relative to history for gross margin rate to be you know worse in the 4th quarter than it was in the 3rd quarter just trying to really understand that you mentioned not being you know more promotional in december is it you know you get about our math about 140 bibs from the accounting shift between cost of goods and sgna so is the shipping surcharges are going to be charged can be much larger than the eighty basis points that you saw on three q you lap at 180 basis points of markdown pressure and obviously you know it seems like a very inventory so just trying to understand that dynamic on a you know sort of a year a year and sequential basis in gross margin such that it would be flattened in the 4th quarter year over year sure chris it is right on what you said about the shipping costs part of the reason in the prepared remarks we talked about eighty basis points impact in q three that was just the latter part of the quarter what we are asking maybe in q four is over 150 basis points impact and we are committed to offsetting that again through discipline promotion management and mix and that is what we will do but the incidents on the shipping costs it is much larger in q four and that is why we are being prudent on that go ahead sorry cause i will just also add if you are looking at q four versus q four last year the thing you have just got recognized in that as a consumer behavior and the impact of digital purchasing versus store purchasing you know it is not like the like and it is definitely accelerated and that is brought with it natural pressures to margin a mix as we have shared that we are offsetting that and mitigating that to be stable i think is a real achievement so these are you know it is it is a q four like now are there and the consumer behavior that digital pivots and therefore what that is meant for margin inclusive shipping is part of what we are balancing on and again one month into our our three month quarter but we want to make sure that we are being prudent understood thanks so much guys and our next question is from peter benedict from baird hey guys thanks thanks for taking the question 1st i am just curious on on the adoption of bopus and i know it has been around six months and and you know the curbside but i mean how is that trending relative to expectations and and what kind of what are your plans or goals to drive continued adoption of that in the in the months ahead that is my 1st question yeah peter great question i i think what we have seen you know we showed an overall statistics for q three but i am packing that you see an escalation and a movement into the new muscle remembering we only introduced this in may so what we are seeing now is we have an nps score of eighty you know we are able to provide about a two hour assurance on our order fulfillment store level on that it is actually in real terms around thirty minutes customers are loving it i think in a total industry level both us as a muscle on it and a new methodology is very accepted by the customer and we are benefiting from that as well we saw out right in the december period escalate week in week out as customers became more concerned around delivery shipping times and really ensuring that i had a joyous holiday period that i could secure the president under the tree and so we really went into creating ease and convenience for our customer that they really responded to and we are very grateful for we believe these are constants now and they muscles in the business that we want to maintain and for us we know that a bopus order fulfilled by store is almost equivalent to a store by profitability so the differential helps us and has helped us through q three and will help us in q four in terms of shipping and profitability costs so we think it is here to stay it is one of the sticky outcomes all not just the the progression in bopus but how covid has fortified this is a new muscle for most retailers okay thanks thanks for that mark and then i guess shifting you guys brought registry a couple of times during your prepared remarks and i am not sure how much you are willing to share quantitatively on on the size of those businesses but maybe it does not quote more qualitative comments baby versus wedding and i mean you talked a little bit about basket size but just curious kind of how you how you see those two businesses or that business across the two segments as part of your outlook over the next couple of years on the opportunities thanks yeah i it is a it is a great point i would actually differentiate between a moment in time experience versus the cardboard experience and the moment in time experience as john outline a baby registry is very strong product but it has been more reliant on an in store experience and when we do that we build a bigger basket it is more sticky and higher customer engagement and so we have been pivoting to strengthen our digital registry and we will invest there further but for us we see complete upside in 2021 with you know the return to a more normalized shopping environment in stores and digital into the true omni when we turned to bed bath and beyond the story is even better we are consistently in the top of the ranking in and have held market share in most recent data in terms of registries now we have not had the benefit of that in our 2020 or current numbers because of the covid moment and people are just not having wedding ceremonies in 2021 there is going to be pick up demand and transfer into into that year for weddings to occur and because we are number one in those spaces and well placed with held market share and that the stats are good we feel like that as a runway for growth over the next couple of years is one of our solid strengths that has not existed in our 2020 or current numbers and we are going to be doubling down and investing there even further the next question is from steven forbes from guggenheim good morning so i wanted to focus on the trends within the categories maybe outside of the top five that you noted in the release so so mark just curious how how these categories are performing i know it is early but performing and within some of the new concept stores or remodels and and or if you could just speak to some of the initiatives right that set around the dressing the performance here right cause although it is the lower percentage of sales is still 13rd here so i would love to see how you are thinking about improving in those specific categories and yeah in the structure that is within them yeah thanks steven it is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to soul based traffic the digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again we in our remodel stores that we have been testing our personal care business is booming and actually showing a huge differential to our control and when we get the traffic we get the trade and i think what we saw in in the end of q three and and somewhat in q four is this sort of suppression of foot traffic in stores that has a direct correlation and that is a business that either is a great basket build business or is just part of a trip to store that is just not occurring at this moment as frequently it has in the past i think of a couple of key areas to where we have had some some softness i i think cleaning is a really good example for us an area that is normally been strong i think getting supply product has been an issue it is it is constrained across the globe and and we just have not been firing in that space but at the same time we also cleared out of smaller categories like food to kind of clean up our assortment that we build into that impact so we are really focused on doubling down as strengths categories you see that coming through and consis consistent through q three q four and our efforts and strategically in 2021 but we are definitely focusing on a couple of key categories where we can really ramp up our inventory and our focus and we are already starting to see positive sides of that in january thanks we are going to its just a quick follow up for you gustavo yeah obviously we know the minimum wage rate increases that are transpiring this year and yeah potential some pressure right from other retailers announcing you know the path to fifteen so curious how you guys think about you know that as a pressure point right on the business and and what is incorporated right in the financial guidance as it relates to wage investments for 2021 we definitely see the emerging trends and the and the evolution we are looking at you know change of leadership and how that can impact on that no news on that today other than the way of looking at it very very carefully want to be competitive in the marketplace and we will be absorbing that into our roll up cost and financial plans going forward thank you best of luck our next question is from carla casella from jp morgan hi cou d you just give us an update on what how much of your cost savings did you achieve in the quarter from your overall goal yeah we are on track with the path that the objective we have of 200 to $215000000 going next year we expect about 125 at least in the current quarter we saw savings as you saw in the building blocks right 180 basis points from product margin and savings including leverage a distribution costs of 210 basis points okay so we could kind of go towards the cost savings program okay that is great and also did you provide overall same store sales at buybuy baby or harmon i know you gave some details but i do not think i heard the same source sales number overall well we did not provide that i mean historically for the 3rd quarter no we have not no we said in the prepared remarks is in the 3rd quarter same store sales were down in buybuy baby and then recovered in december the reason where they were down temporarily in the quarter is some of the dynamics that john spoke about just keeping mind store sales store traffic particularly in buybuy baby slowed down significantly in november and it was partly compensated by the strengthened digital but still that recovery started happening in december okay great and if you are how much of your if you look at the bed bath and beyond business alone how much of that business was done by digital i know you talked about digital growth there but i am wondering you gave it for the overall company but how has that in bed bath and beyond versus last year what did share that that digital growth there is 94 for the quarter carla so exceptionally strong i guess i was wondering with what percentage is the digital sales not the growth of the overall company okay 3rd think about yeah i think that the reference point to that carla is is that we are and so and that was a growth and growth at the prior year at six to eight so you can see that exponential growth of remembering that only includes the november portion of holiday periods so and our next question is from mike lasser from up ubs good morning thanks a lot for taking my question mark you mentioned several times about the importance of driving in store traffic to the bed bath model whether it is through the wedding registry or some of the personal care products in one of the long lasting outcomes that this situation is that they are just going to be a higher penetration of e commerce in retail and some of the initiatives that you are rolling out like i pick up and ship to ship to home are going to drive less traffic to your stores so how are you going to balance that over the long run and generate some of your sales productivity initiative well we thanks for your question now we saw when things started to normalize in the middle of the year before the 2nd wave came through we saw really great competent stores and the omni channel benefit of stores and digital really came together in a positive way you know for us in our food planning that we provided for the three year plan we have actually shown we have actually factor in a very high digital right into that so that our financials remain stable but we see that the driving to store phase really does come from an omni channel environment i think there is a number of great retailers exemplifying this with alignment and a trip to the store whether it be for bopus or for a true trip both generate a sense of the store in your community as part of your network and part of your needs lifestyle so we look forward to a more normalized base we think our stores will be ready when that come through with new visual merchandising your assortment your planning and in 150 doors plus are a completely new environment and what we have seen in those new environments is that when we provide that the differential to our control is very very strong and that we see sales growth but we are a firm believer in stores we are investing in stores and then we think that our assortment our presentation and our remodels will really help us even further there okay my follow up question is in the bridge that you provided for your gross margin for twenty 2019 to 2021 you talk about the positive drivers is sourcing own brands better promotions and markdowns and coupons upset by some channel shift and freight costs in that there is there is no real discussion around reinvestment in in pride or other traffic driving initiatives and this is going to be at a time where arguably i mean debatable that some of the tailwinds at the home related category are going to fade in a reopening environment yeah i think the reason why that is not in there is that work has been done i mean we are already showing that the indices on the for our key categories that we are showing great everyday parody to our key comp set we have have promotions that we using now are taking hold and actually we have using them more effectively so we are seeing cost savings in the promotion they are getting much more effectiveness we have believed that these muscles which we have displayed in the last two quarters that have really driven great gross margin growth are sustainable or inside the mix mike i think that the the promotional expectation of 2021 i feel as i have stated i think we see great data that shows that the home trend will be sticky this is a part of people is lives now and their expectation of creating joy and comfort at home and and we do not believe that there is going to be an exceptional chase into a promotional activity but our financials and our promotional cadence that we have and the balance we have created this year is ready for that in 2021 and our last question is from seth basham from wedbush securities and good morning my 1st question is just on your ebitda guidance for 2021 could you give us some color as to what the impact from the banner sales is specifically cost +and and christmas tree shops in that forecast so the guidance we are providing a 2021 is already on our core banner basis it is it only includes bed bath buybuy baby bed rest and harmon we showed in the bridge what would be the proforma 2019 posed those banners of and that is the starting point of $425000000 okay that is even ongoing basis yes that is one of the things that we were not able to do at the investor day and we share with many of you after was that we had to include in full our cost plus world mind that business in terms of the ebitda projection but we did not include in the projection so what you see now with that sale is that from a range of being presented based on the true pro proforma of 2019 again still with that responsible attitude to ebitda for the full year based on some of the early changes in half on the communica but you know it was a secondary pivot that we can provide to be even more definitive on the wider further growth and i know this but it is a tighter range on revenue now when you compare net sales 2021 there is a report of sales in 2020 to 2019 it is not comparable that is why we want to provide the guidance on a comparable basis and we are going to see some of that dynamic in q four already while we have mentioned that q four net sales are going to be down double digits my reporting basis between fifteen up to twenty just simply the impact of the ban on divestitures it is a significant information going on this is a totally different shape of the p l next year on concepts on sales on stores understood my follow up questions related to the mix of online versus in store sales that you are expecting in 2021 when you expect that mix of in store sale to increase from 2020 and if so why do you expect so much channel shift headwind is it just because of freight rate increases yeah i mean we do i mean there is a natural pivot back to stores that there just will be you know and again it has been such an exceptional year we think that the digital penetration will continue to be strong and we have got great offsets to that you know including where we were sharing that 36 of all the digital loaners were actually fulfilled by stores in the quarter was just incredible agility there so we are going to be offsetting some of the costs we see some freight permeating in 2021 but we are factoring in the high digital penetration ring thank you very much and that is all the time we have for questions i will now turn the call back over to janet barth for closing remarks thank you and thank you all for participating in our call today please feel free to contact me or felix with any additional questions have a great day and stay safe thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes today is call thank you for participating and you may now disconnect",

strengthen an already strong balance sheet and remain focused on ensuring liquidity optimizing costs while significantly reducing debt while driving positive cash flow generation and while we drove overall business results we also completed our non core banham monetization plan with the final transaction set to close in our fiscal 224 quarter these efforts will help fund our transformation and put us in the position to start fiscal 221 with a more cohesive set of core businesses our favorable sales results are also starting to show month by month we have been minimizing our share differentials versus the market and encouragingly in the most recent npd data for october and november we achieved market share gains in the bed category with improving trends in both bath and kitchen categories we expect to see continued improvement in market share trends as our strategy continues to take hold additionally we continue to show strong market share strength we believe we are very well positioned as a market leader when we get back to celebrating important life moments such as getting married all of this has been achieved this quarter despite the significant headwinds of covid nineteen during our call today gustavo aranow chief financial officer and treasurer will review our 3rd quarter financial results and then provide some perspective on our 4th quarter and our outlook for fiscal 2021 good morning everyone today i will cover two key topics 1st i will provide perspective on the performance of our 3rd quarter as well as on december sales trends and then i will provide visibility on the current 4th quarter as well as on our outlook for fiscal year 2021 despite extensive and widely reported covid related headwinds these included lower food traffic trends shipping capacity constraints and much higher freight costs further during a challenging holiday period we strengthened our commercial plans to drive significant digital demand while remaining focused on delivering growth margin expansion positive comp sales growth was led by our core bed business it was up five it was fueled by exponential digital growth of 94 which more than offset store declines of fourteen growth was healthy and broad based across five key destination categories which grew eleven and represented two thirds of revenue total enterprise comparable sales grew two also driven by strong digital comp growth of 77 as you will hear from john in a few minutes covid related headwinds disproportionately impacted store sales in our baby business during the quarter yet encouragingly we saw a return to growth in december following some key interventions the strength of our digital growth has been powered by the investments we have made in omnichannel capability including bopis curbside pickup and same day delivery which are all completely new this year bopis orders represented sixteen of total digital sales in the quarter these service offerings provide ease and convenience and allow us to further gain trust from our customers including the approximately 7000000 new online customers gained each year our digital capabilities are becoming a key driver of results net sales were 2600000000 an expected reduction of five primarily due to the impact from banner ads this has been a holiday season like no other as i outlined by 3rd party data sources including sensormatic and adobe analytics market wide black friday in store traffic was down by over fifty and online spending was up 22 similarly for the six week holiday weekend marketwide in store traffic fell between 34 and 36 we performed strongly against this reported trend during the competitive ten day holiday sales period from thanksgiving through cyber monday overall comp sales demand for our core us that bath and beyond banner was up double digits versus last year and delivered digital comp sales growth of approximately 69 more than last year during the six week holiday sales period from november sixteen to december 27th our total enterprise count sales grew low single digits led by significant digital growth of more than ninety which more than offset store count sales declines of more than twenty our net loss from banners destroyed or hell for sale we reported a net loss per diluted share of ¢61 our gap results include approximately $86000000 from unfavorable impacts which are excluded from adjusted results to provide better perspective on the underlying performance of our business these include special items such as losses on the sale of businesses including cost plus wall market i will also mention non cash charges for the impairment of certain long lived assets plus restructuring and transformation expenses adjusted gross margin increased 300 and ten basis points to 35four this expansion was driven by a 180 basis points of favorable strategic engineering of promotion and markdown expense including data driven optimization this benefits were partially offset by a 200 basis points impact from channel mix due to the anticipated larger proportion of total sales from digital channels versus the prior year this impact also includes around eighty basis points from higher shipping expense associated with the anticipated larger proportion of total sales from digital channels versus the prior year i am going to give you a quick overview of the freight rate increases particularly in the latter part of the quarter the significant year over year improvement in our adjusted growth margin reflect the management team is focus on driving the components of margin while delivering exponential growth in digital i would like to start off by saying that our adjusted ebitda increased 168 to $121000000 which is almost three times higher than the prior year period this was driven by digital sales growth coupled with growth margin expansion once again these results demonstrate that our efforts to transform the business and build a modern durable business model are working we unlocked $244000000 in positive cash flow generation cash flow from investments was $200000000 positive as it included proceeds from non core asset monetization net of taxes operating cash flow of $44000000 was also positive in spite of seasonal dynamics we continue to carefully manage working capital this quarter with ending inventories of 1800000000 on a sequential basis inventories were thirteen lower versus the 2nd quarter and thirty lower than last year this was primarily due to the impact from banner divestitures including seasonal inventory purchases for the holiday selling period we are tracking at a faster pace to deliver our previously stated 2021 goal of $1000000000 in inventory reduction at retail compared to 2019 during the 1st quarter we were able to cut our operating losses by $38000000 from non core banner divestitures and store closures taken together with the half a $1000000000 in restructuring charges we were able to reduce our operating losses by about half a $1000000000 we achieved in the 2nd quarter we have reduced total gross debt by about $1000000000 so far this year a reduction of about 25 we remain in a strong net cash position with an ending cash and investment balance of 1500000000 this is in line with the balance at the end of the 2nd quarter even after returning cash to shareholders in the form of accelerated share repurchases have also maintained a strong liquidity of $2200000000 including our a v e so capitalizing on this strong financial position we launched a 225000000 accelerated share repurchase in late october and in december in conjunction with the announcement of a definitive agreement to divest cost plus world market we reported plans for a 2nd a s r in the amount of 150000000 these two programs totaling 375000000 are expected to be completed on or before the end of our fiscal 4th quarter next month in february and will result in a reduction of our shareholders outstanding of approximately fifteen at current stock price levels our authorized level for share repurchase at this early stage of the penny period is now up to $825000000 over the next three years these actions reflect our balanced approach to capital management capital allocation principles strong liquidity and confidence in our strategic growth plan in summary our 3rd quarter performance shows consistent execution of our strategy which drives sales and ebitda growth coupled with strong cash flow generation and the reinitiation of capital return to shareholders now moving on to our outlook i will always start with some directional color on our expectations for q four and then provide perspective it has been widely reported that covid nineteen related headwinds continue to impact the retail industry in this context we will not be providing specific sales and earnings guidance for the current 4th quarter that said we feel positive about the parts of the business we can control and expect to deliver year over year adjusted ebitda margin improvement in q four this despite the year over year decline in comparable store sales we expect traffic and shipping constraints accompanied by higher freight costs in terms of the top line comp sales are expected to be approximately inline with last year we expect consistent strength in digital to be tampered by covid related headwinds impacting stores december sales show positive total enterprise comparable growth including continued strength across key destination categories importantly we are expecting stronger sales in q one 2022 for a double digit favorable impact on q four total net sales versus last year given the divestiture banners and the ongoing store optimization initiative in terms of growth margin in spite of the anticipated drag from significant freight cost increases in q four we were driving cost optimization actions to manage the impact of these pressures so we expect growth margin to be about inline with the same period last year we expect to deliver a year on year adjusted ebitda margin increase in q four with absolute ebitda figures inline with the prior year now i will turn to fiscal 2021 our initial outlook included fiscal year 2019 as the base year at the time our portfolio banner review was still underway we had already divested four banners but we did not have a material impact on our results now we do and we expect this transaction to close imminently today we are providing additional visibility on the significant reshaping of our pnl as a result of these divestitures and the closure of underperforming stores our significant portfolio transformation will lead to fewer better performing stores and will include a healthier core revenue base we are now tightening our projected fiscal 21 revenue range to approximately eight to 8200000000 looking at quarters starting with the 1st quarter which will not be on a comp basis we expect to recapture the lost sales opportunities from the store closures in 2020 due to covid nineteen during quarters two through four we expect to sustain comparable sales levels in relation to the solid comp sales base of fiscal 2020 our sales forecast for financial planning purposes assumes total enterprise comparable sales to be in line with fiscal 2020 we are reiterating our expectations for adjusted gross margin of approximately 35 which represents a more than 200 basis point improvement we are enhancing adjusted fiscal year 2021 ebitda to a range of between 500 to $525000000 this represents a twenty increase from the performer 2019 ebitda base of $425000000 the drivers of the adjusted ebitda range are consistent with the ones we have previously shared including cost savings and revenue growth as i said earlier we have assumed companysales to be in line versus fiscal 2020 for modeling purposes as we are not requiring sales growth to deliver the higher ebitda range but needless to say we will strive for continued top line growth in a highly competitive environment our performance to date gives us confidence in our longer term goal of achieving between 850 and $1000000000 in adjusted ebitda by fiscal 2023 importantly our portfolio transformation coupled with store closures is driving significant balance sheet improvement through gross debt reduction of $1000000000 this will result in a gross debt to ebitda ratio of approximately threefive times at the end of fiscal 2023 i want to thank you for your support and your understanding we have a strategic and disciplined pathway for driving sales and margin growth generating cash and investing our business plan to drive shareholder value creation it is working i will now turn the call over to raffi masoumian chief digital officer raffi thank you gustavo with covid as a headwind to our store traffic we have stepped up our strategy as an omnialways retailer and it is paying off during the 3rd quarter we delivered digital growth of 77 our 3rd consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 75 this year our bed bath and beyond banner alone posted digital comm sales up 94 almost doubling last year is sales with this momentum and based on current trends we are on track to exceed our digital sales goal of $3000000000 by the end of fiscal 2020 we have laid out a transformation plan to unlock the potential of our omnichannel always growth strategy by elevating customer experience building out our omnichannel capabilities and evolving to a digital 1st culture the goal of this initiative is to meet customer needs i am pleased to report that the company is now incredibly equipped to do that the benefits are coming through not only in digital sales growth but also in customer metrics during the quarter we gained 2200000 new online customers of which the bed bath beyond banner alone added 1800000 year to date we have gained approximately 7000000 new online customers and now i would like to introduce our ceo mark tritton we are seeing them return at a higher rate than ever before in the 3rd quarter 21 of our bed bath and beyond customers placed more than one online order compared to about fifteen versus last year so what is driving the sticky customer experience for online customers we believe the true hero for us is buy online pick up in store since introducing bopis and contactless pick up we have seen a significant increase in customer satisfaction we have seen a rapid rate of adoption by our customers in the 3rd quarter approximately 1200000 customers placed a bopis order representing sixteen of our total digital revenue in the bed bath and beyond banner bopis orders represented fifteen of total digital sales and seventeen of total digital orders and sixty of our bopis orders are were ready within one hour surpassing our two hour promise this fast and convenient experience has earned bed bath and beyond a net promoter score of eighty for our boba services up from 49 in may when we 1st introduced the service our stores are now in a competitive advantage of our omni strategy fulfilling a total of 36 of all digital sales in the 3rd quarter this muscle was not in place last year now we are connecting our stores with our online platforms and the power of omnichannel is enabling us to better serve our customers however they choose to shop we know omnichannel is the future of retail and we are making the right investments that are resonating with our customers the fast paced transformation of our digital offering and elevated customer experience has resulted in a 25 lift in our online conversion rate for the 3rd quarter as compared to the prior year key drivers of the increase include 1st the relaunch of our mobile site and mobile apps we implemented a new framework with an optimized experience that drove a 33 increase in conversion and mobile sales growth of 107 versus the prior year period during the five day holiday shopping period from thanksgiving to cyber monday our mobile homepage loaded 74 faster than the same period we also relaunched bed bath beyond and beyond buy buy baby mobile apps resulting in over 800000 downloads this quarter our bed bath beyond and beyond buy buy baby mobile app was launched over 15000000 times during this quarter and revenue more than doubled for the 1st half of last year we have also seen the rate of app uninstalls continue to improve further underscoring the stickiness of our customer experience we launched same day delivery on bedbathbeyond com and buybuybaby com to provide our customers another convenient and cost effective way to shop this service was introduced in q three results are preliminary but we have seen 100s of 1000s of our customers take advantage of this new convenient way to shop we also began to offer same day delivery service through the launch of bedbathbeyond com and beyond 1st we are proud to announce that our stores on shipt and instacart each reached more than eighty of us households harmon face values was recently added to the instacart marketplace and we are pleased with its initial launch and continued positive response from customers on this platform 3rd we implemented over a 100 improvements to make our shopping experience more convenient and easier to use including a faster checkout process this includes buy now pay later options like after pay and pay pal pay in four as well as extending apple pay from store only to our mobile apps during the quarter we also focused on optimizing our experiences and speed to place orders on our site making it even easier convenient and faster for our customers to shop with us again each of these initiatives were geared to customers with the goal of meeting their needs as we look at our digital program holistically it is a true revolution from where we were a year ago and has become part of the fabric of how we operate at bed bath beyond the customer environment is rapidly changing and we are there to greet them at every turn through our enhanced services speed and focus on engagement our customer perception continues to improve our omnialways strategy is working and was a key driver of our 3rd quarter sales performance our strength in digital has more than compensated for the headwinds of the pandemic and has fast tracked our transformation as we moved into the important holiday season this year and set us up for success moving forward we have delivered an elevated customer experience launched meaningful capabilities and pivoted digital from a laggard tactic strategic acid and a profitable growth engine that has delivered another strong quarter of growth with that i will turn the call over to john hartman our chief operating officer and president of bye bye baby john thank you raffi we made exceptional progress across our operations in the 3rd quarter specifically as it relates to our supply chain reform optimizing our real estate portfolio and advancing our technology roadmap modernizing our business remains a key focus and we are evolving our store formats our distribution and fulfillment capabilities alongside leveraging our unique data and insights to meet the changing needs of our customers and deliver an exceptional shopping experience i will start with supply chain while we remain focused on mid to long term capability building we made very substantial pivots in the 3rd quarter as ravi mentioned our stores fulfilled 36 of total digital sales in the 3rd quarter while last year we did not have bopis curbside pickup or same day delivery in our offering not only do these new capabilities provide ease and convenience to our customers they also help us to partially alleviate current shipping constraints and additional cost pressures in the supply chain during the quarter we also added a secondary national carrier and several regional parcel delivery carriers which helped to offset an over twenty cost increase from our primary carrier fedex and importantly we continue to focus intently on the health and safety of our associates working in our fulfillment centers by instituting daily covid cleaning procedures in our facilities concurrently we launched an evaluation of a number of potential 3rd party logistics providers who will partner with us to establish new regional distribution centers and to manage the efficient flow of domestic distribution we anticipate that using 3rd party logistics operators will provide significant benefits in terms of cost savings and improved service levels will also provide increased financial flexibility and reduced capital expense this is the cornerstone of the transformation of our supply chain network and will increase our capacity for fast store replenishment while continuing to leverage our store network for omni fulfillment by making the replenishment process more efficient our store teams will have a more predictable and faster flow of the products we sell most in turn this will allow us to meet the increased demand our main focus is on curb side and same day delivery services while also reducing the time our store team spends managing deliveries so they can spend more time with our customers our also core to our transformation is technology and we are taking a disciplined approach to our investments in building a technology infrastructure that will enable us to personalize the service for our customers improve our ability to predict and meet demand make it easier to collaborate across teams drive down inefficiencies in our business over the next three years we plan to invest approximately $250000000 to modernize the application and technology landscape to a cloud empowered foundation last quarter we talked about our expanded multiyear partnership with google and deloitte to enhance our omnichannel shopping experience this quarter we defined our plans for a new erp system we will also be pursuing a product life cycle management solution in support of our own brand initiative and an inventory management capability to improve inventory productivity these plans will all start in 2021 in our foundational parts of building out our technology infrastructure in other activities we are making significant progress toward the targets we have previously highlighted regarding our real estate portfolio including our stored network optimization and store remodel plans let me start with our network optimization program which is designed to not only ensure our stores remain a strategic asset for us but also to ensure that we have them in the right locations to deliver more sustainable sales growth improved margins and greater cash generation as part of this work we are well underway in the process of closing approximately 200 underperforming bed bath and beyond stores by the end of fiscal 2021 initially we identified about 100 stores that were potential candidates for closure in the 3rd quarter we closed four bed bath and beyond stores and in december we closed another 75 and we are currently liquidating an additional 42 stores we are very pleased with our progress to date and completing the store closure program during fiscal 2021 remains a priority turning to our bed bath and beyond store remodel program we have advanced from the initial prototype phase to active iteration within ten stores in our houston markets these proof of concept stores highlight our destination categories bed bath kitchen and storage complete this phase of the remodel program by the end of february 2021 additionally we will take all the visual signage enhancements and immediately apply them to the entire fleet of stores on the same timeline next we will take our learnings from houston and move into our 1st expanded wave of renovations in 2021 which includes approximately 150 stores in total our store remodel plan involves 250 stores in the next three years our investment over the next three years in touches over 450 stores representing roughly sixty of our revenue in addition we will utilize strategic sourcing methods to procure necessary remodeling components at a lower cost and leverage economies of scale with this overall initiative instead of the legacy store by store one off approach of the past we have established a unified planning process identify prioritize and sequence all aspects of the remodeling these store remodeling and our network optimization plans are crucial steps in building an omni channel organization that serves our digital 1st customers with an intuitive and modern shopping experience we look forward to reporting our progress along the way before closing let me provide some perspective on the quarterly performance of buybuybaby it remains a challenging environment for our new or soon to be parents who are particularly vulnerable to the perceived challenges associated with in store shopping due to covid nineteen as a result we saw a disproportionate level of store traffic decline these covid related headwinds have also had a short term impact on the registry component of our business which is highly correlated to in store activity while we have seen overall growth in registry digital registries created online currently tend to carry a lower average value than those created in store enhancements to the digital registry experience are addressing this opportunity to assist our customers in building a more well rounded baby wish list covid headwinds have also constrained inventory levels in certain of our key categories such as furniture and gear as a result of disruptions in the global supply chain we have made key pivots here including sharing improved forecasts with our vendor partners well into 2021 so as consumer behavior shifted we pivoted and leaned into to create an enhanced online experience with a more convenient suite of checkout options including afterpay pay in four and apple pay we also upgraded and relaunched our buy now pay later app in november strengthening the choices we offer our customers who connect with us digitally year to date we have gained nearly 2000000 us online customers an increase of 46 over last year including more than a half a 1000000 new online customers in all nearly two thirds of our baby customers only shopped online this quarter as young parents take safety into consideration this year our new omni capabilities allow us to meet them where they are with bopis curbside and same day delivery services digital orders fulfilled by our baby stores represented a significant portion of total orders in the quarter with bopis orders representing approximately half of all orders while the holiday period is traditionally not a big baby season except for gift giving or needs of families getting ready for or just having had a baby we did see strong digital demand comp growth of 49 year over year during the five day holiday period from thanksgiving to cyber monday this growth was driven by top performing baby categories including toys playroom furniture and apparel these positive results demonstrate the continued strength of e commerce and the importance of digital holiday shopping we believe in this business and we are now ready to double down on and significantly invest in expanding sales and margin and growing our market share we plan to accelerate our growth in baby over the next several years including introducing own brands aging up into toddler and younger children as well as expanding into categories like toys and educational as well as furniture enhancing our our register we will also invest to scale our footprint nationwide with about fifty new stores over the next three years fiscal 2000 and 2021 will mark the true beginning of the transformation of this banner as we execute our three year plan and unlock the value of this brand earlier this week we announced the appointment of patti wu as senior vice president and general manager for buybuybaby exceptional experience will help accelerate our plans and drive meaningful change we look forward to sharing our progress and future conference calls mark i will turn it back over to you now for closing remarks thank you john a strong performance this quarter across several key performance metrics including positive comp sales growth gross margin expansion positive cash flow generation and gross debt reduction is what we are focused on even despite the significant headwinds of a global pandemic yet what i saw beyond the numbers was even more impressive our team was planning modifying and executing in an aligned and disciplined way like never before they were learning and improving in real time as the customer and conditions changed showing true agility in motion these newly acquired muscles extended from product price through messaging and digital expression i am truly grateful to all of our associates that rallied around this call to action to demonstrate our strengths and opportunities as the new bed bath beyond team in what has been an exceptionally difficult year we still continue to make bold pivots to reconstruct renovate and restore our company simply put we are delivering on what we said we would do we said we would put a team in place that would have the right talent thank you execute our new vision inject new ideas and that we would create the right organizational structure to facilitate more streamlined decision making and we have done that we said we would lean into the digital space and make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us and we are doing that we said we would reset our cost structure modernize for growth and refine our organization and we have done that we have continued to focus on growth margin improvement now let me tell you that our authority as the preferred omni

how best to optimize its value for the business on a go forward basis and we have done that and finally we said our mission is to ensure that bed bath beyond is well positioned for long term success

of firm base from which we will continue to drive our bold transformation and seek to deliver on our three year strategic and financial goals shared at our 2020 investor day we have many bowl and exciting plans for fiscal 2021 such as launching your own brands that will help differentiate us in our key destination modifying approximately 1000 stores under our store network optimization program

further strengthen our buybuybaby and harmonbenners and continuing to unlock and deliver shareholder value in a year like no other we are embracing and driving transformative change staying curious and bold and so much more i am proud of the commitment our teams have shown and what we have achieved together with that we will now take your questions thank you you now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press star one on your touchtone phone if you wish to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key there will be a delay in response good morning thanks very much for taking my questions yes so the 1st one is you know understand how very constrained shipping and  freight was an issue for a holiday margins how long do you think this pressure carries into 21 it sounds like at least for the full year you do not think it is an issue since you are still targeting twenty i am sorry 35 gross margins in in 21 and then just have a follow up after that  good morning kurt thanks look  we you know we know that the freight pressure you know across retail is here to stay and we have built that into our future plans so we see that our margin stability and the offsets so we have ok and maybe just  you know again for your mark you know maybe give this  a quick update on some of the big yeah merchandising initiatives you guys have outlined in october analyst day such as you know lower sourcing  inventor costs and then and then i think that is it thank you yeah i mean the good news is that we have already built a firm foundation with these results you know the actions and trends we have here in terms of margin but across the board are really substantial and sustainable and then we are going to add into those the rolling benefits as you outlined to it so the sourcing benefits that we have undertaken throughout 2020 are really going to be evidenced in 1st quarter onwards in 2021 and then we begin in march with the rollout of our own brands and we are going to be sharing more closely in the pagination of that flow throughout the year several brands will be launched but the key news is that in the 1st half of 2021 we will be addressing the majority of our big key categories we are already seeing strength and growth in reembedding those with our own brands and and introduction of opening price point items and arranged there which has been the huge missing part of our equation in terms of being truly competitive in the marketplace to build our authority so the step changes the the consistent management of promotions the mix management now we are going to lay in the incremental benefits of sourcing and own brand so we are excited about that progression in 2021 good morning thanks for taking my question can you talk about where your expectations were a couple months ago for the 4th quarter in sales and now and i know the outlook for next year in embeds is flatterish did that change now that you are going to be lapsing something that may be weaker in this year is 4th quarter yeah i think again we had robust plans for q four of this year we feel good about how we are executing on those but there is no doubt that the covid headwinds and the impact that that has had on foot traffic and overall consumer confidence is something that we had to factor into our plans hence why we talked about the agility of our team through q three and now q four to respond to those challenges and so we think we have met those in in you know what has been a turbulent time and we really look forward to lapping those next year in a very different way ok thanks for that and then my follow up can you talk about q four you mentioned the freight headwinds and but offset by some optimization on i think the gross margin in terms of promotion and pricing can you talk about the promotional environment and then you know thinking about how much margin opportunity there still is i think for next year is that is it looks like it is more of a function of the margin changing as opposed to the top line just to confirm yeah i think that you know we would stress that we did not become more promotional during the quarter in q three or in q four we actually reshaped and reengineered our promotional activity we had opportunity to do so but that is really paying dividends in terms of generating gross margin and helping to create that balance sheet excess so we are less promotional we are more focused on reg price we are winning customers and we see that progressing forward and as gustavo had outlined we are not putting pressure on the working sales plan to generate our evata we believe that we can do that through a number of the different initiatives we have through cost control and definitely margin growth in 2021 as we outlined earlier i am a three u plane sorry and our next question is from bobby griffins from raymond james good morning everybody thanks for taking my questions i guess just some observations mark the 1st thing i wanted to talk about was you know looking at the range for next year it is a fairly tight range of 500 to 525000000 evas and you know it is still a lot of uncertainty out there so can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you see in the business now that really gives you confidence and tightening that range up and as a 2nd part of that what what could be the driver that would cause that range to underperform is it sales is it margin what what gives you the most concern there hi bobby good saba here so definitely there is still a lot of uncertainties as we look forward but we feel very confident in our plans we have clarity on the drivers of gross margin expansion which is why we are reiterating a gross margin of 35 in spite of the recent headwinds that we are seeing in freight costs as mark mentioned we are being more data driven in managing our promotion and our mix and with that we will offset it it is a tighter range than the wide the one we provided at investors day but we said that as we completed the portfolio work the monetization of non core assets we would tighten that and that is what we are coming or to you today on your question of what can throw us off it is not sales we are prudently assuming for financial planning purposes that we would have sales comp sales in line with prior year and in fact with that we will deliver significant ebitda growth we are monitoring things very carefully by week and by quarter we feel that our plan is responsible and achievable and we are looking forward to delivering that all right thank you i guess my 2nd question would be for the december commentary you mentioned that the enterprise did show some growth for comparable sales but then i guess i am a little confused what is a comparable sales so for the entire quarter you are you are kind of calling for flattish versus last year or in line i believe the wording can you maybe just talk a little bit about what is going in there is something popped up in the last couple of weeks that is given you concern or is that just a little bit of you know function of being conservative given the level of uncertainty that is still out there in the world we have two full months to complete this process there is a lot going on in the world and we want to make sure that we are being responsible in our planning and you know we look forward to kind of sharing more in the 4th quarter thank you very much best of luck thanks good morning guys so my 1st question is a follow up you think about you know you talk about you know things evolving and changing as you thought about you know your your 21 plan is it fair to say that covid changed in terms of the recent surge are you assuming that this sort of lasts longer until we actually get to a vaccine so was the change there and also was the other change  the freight costs i mean presumably as the holiday the volume surge yeah i think it is prudent to to think about an environment i mean we saw an acceleration a change of behavior between you know our our q two and september october results and versus our november results based on foot traffic to stores customers being concerned around what the future held and real uncertainty in the market that really began around the election period so we are being prudent in thinking through you know with the vaccine rollout it is still underway still very early we want to be able to monitor that and its impact we have not affected anything in terms of stimulus checks and their impact on the business because again that has been so uncertain so just ensuring that the level of uncertainty and volatility that that has or could bring is built conservatively into our plans and that we can balance out any of those headwinds i you know i think it has been interesting that there has been a lot of discussion around the home category experiencing these great tailwinds from you know the covid moment all of us in retail have been facing the incredible headwinds and confusion and and concern from the customer that we have to face so i could feel really really strongly about this positive compounding profit even in the face of uncertainty and want to ensure that we have got a balance plan going into 2021 got it so understood and then in in terms of the 4th quarter i mean just relative to history for gross margin rate to be you know worse in the 4th quarter than it was in the 3rd quarter just trying to really understand that you mentioned not being is it yeah you know you get about rma about 140 bits from the accounting shift between costs of goods and s g n a so is this shipping surcharge going to be charged going to be much larger than the eighty basis points that you saw on three q u l a p a 180 basis points of markdown pressure and obviously you know it it seems like you have a very clean inventory so just trying to understand the dynamic you know sort of year over year and sequential basis in gross margins such that it would be flat in the 4th quarter year over year sure it is right on what you said about the shipping costs part of the reason in the prepared remarks we talked about eighty basis points impact in q three that was just the latter part of the quarter what we are estimating in q four is over 150 basis points impact and we are committed to offsetting that we are going to be disciplined promotion management and mix and that is what we will do but the incidence on the shipping costs is much larger in q four and that is why we are being prudent on that i just wanted to add that if you are looking at q four versus q four last year the thing you have been sort of recognized in that as the consumer behavior and and the impact of digital purchasing versus store purchasing you know it is not like the like and and it is worth noting definitely accelerated and that is brought with it natural pressures to margin and mix as we have shared but that we are offsetting that and mitigating that to be stable i think is the real achievement so these are you know it is a key four like no other and the consumer behavior that digital drives it and therefore what that is meant for margin inclusive of shipping is part of what we are balancing here and again one month into our our three month quarter but we want to make sure that we are being pre understood thanks so much guys and our next question is from peter benedik from baird hey guys thanks thanks for taking the question 1st i am just curious on on the adoption of bopis and i know it has been around six months and and you know the curbside but i mean how is that trending relative to expectations and and what kind of what are your plans or goals to drive continued adoption of that in the months ahead that is my 1st question yeah peter great question i think what we have seen you know we showed an overall statistic for q three but unpacking that you see an escalation and a movement into the new months so remember we only introduced this in may so what we are seeing now is we have an nps score of eighty you know we are able to provide about a two hour assurance on our order fulfillment at store level and that is actually in real terms around thirty minutes customer is a loving it i think in a total industry level both this is a muscle and and a new methodology is very accepted by the customer and we are benefiting from that as well we saw our rates in the december period escalate week in week out as customers became more concerned around delivery shipping times and really ensuring that they had a joyous holiday period that they could secure the present under the tree and so we really lent into so creating ease and convenience for our customer that they really responded to and we are very grateful for we believe these are constants now and their muscles in the business that we want to maintain and for us we know that a bonus of work fulfilled by store is almost equivalent to a store by sales of profitability so the differential helps us and has helped us through q three and will help us in q four in terms of our shipping and profitability costs so we think it is here to stay it is one of the sticky outcomes ok thanks for that market and then i guess shifting you guys brought up registry a couple of times during your prepared remarks and i am not sure how much you are willing to share quantitatively on on the size of those businesses but maybe just some more qualitative comments baby versus wedding and i mean you talked a little bit about basket size but just curious kind of how you how you see those two topics to be related mark yeah it is a great point i would actually differentiate between the moment in time experience versus the go forward experience and the moment in time experience as john outlined badger registration is very strong for us but it has been more reliant on an in store experience and when we do that we build a bigger basket it is more sticky and higher customer engagement and so we have been pivoting to that strengthen our digital registry and we will invest there further but for us we see complete upside in 2020 with you know the return to a more normalized shopping environment in stores and digital in terms of true omni when we turn to bed bath beyond and beyond the stories even better we are consistently in the top of the ranking and have held market share in most recent data in terms of registries now we have not had the benefit of that in our business i think current numbers because of the covid moment and people are just not having wedding ceremonies in 2020 there is going to be pent up demand and transfer into that year for weddings to occur and because we are number one in those spaces and well placed with held market share and the stats are good we still like that as a runway for growth over the next couple of years is one of our solid strengths that has not existed in our 2020 2021 or current numbers and we are very optimistic about that i wanted to focus on the trends within the categories maybe outside of the top five that you noted in the release so so mark just curious how how these categories are performing can no notes are early but performing in within some of the new concept stores or remodles and or if you could just speak to some of the initiatives right so around addressing the performance here but because although it is the lower percentage of sales it is still 13rd here so i would love to see how you are thinking about improving those specific categories and yeah and the share trajectory within them yeah thanks steven that is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store based traffic than digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again i think that is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store based traffic than digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again i think that is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store based traffic than digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again i think that is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store based traffic than digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again i think that is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store based traffic than digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again i think that is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store based traffic than digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again i think that is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store based traffic than digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again i think that is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store based traffic than digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again i think that is a great question i think that there has been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store based traffic than digital traffic for us and we in our remodeled stores that we have been testing a personal care business is booming and actually showing a huge differential to our control and when we get the traffic we get the trade and i think what we saw in in the end of q three  and and somewhat in q four is this sort of suppression of foot traffic in stores that has a direct correlation and that is the business that either is a great basket build business or is just part of a trip to store that is just not occurring at this moment as frequently as it has in the past think is a couple of key areas too where we have had some some softness i think cleaning is a really good example for us an area that is normally been strong i think getting supply of product has been an issue it is it is constrained across the globe and and we just have not been  firing in that space but at the same time we also cleared out of smaller categories like food to kind of clean up our assignment that we built into that impact so we are really focused on doubling down on our strengths categories you see that coming through and consistent consistent through q three q four and our efforts and strategically in 2021 but we are definitely focusing on a couple of key categories where we can really ramp up our inventory and our focus we are already starting to see positive sides of that in january thanks mark just a quick follow up that you know for you or esteban yeah obviously we know that minimum wage increases that are transpiring are that are transpiring and you know potential some pressure right from other retailers announcing the path to fifteen so curious how you guys think about you know that as a pressure point on the business and in what is incorporated right in the financial guidance as it relates to wage investments for twenty one we are looking at you know change of leadership and how that can impact on that no news on that today other than the fact that we are looking at it very very carefully i want to be competitive in the marketplace and we will be absorbing that into our overall cost and financial plans going forward thank you that is all the luck could you just give us an update on how much of your cost savings did you achieve in the quarter from your overall goal ok so we should count those towards the cost savings program okay that is great and also did you provide overall same store sales at buy buy baby or harman i know you gave some details but i do not think i heard the same store sales number overall no we did not provide that information i mean historically for the 3rd quarter ok great and if you are how much of your if you look at the bed bath beyond business alone how much of that business was done by digital i know you talked about digital growth there but i am wondering you gave it for for the overall company we did share that the digital growth there is 94 for the quarter color so exceptionally strong i guess i was wondering what percentage is the digital sales not the growth it is 31 of the overall company okay so pretty similar you can see that exponential growth through remembering that only includes the november portion of the holiday period so our next question is from mike lasser from ubs good morning thanks a lot for taking my question mark mentioned several times about the importance of driving in store traffic to the bed bath model whether it through the wedding registry or some other personal experience one of the long lasting outcomes of this situation is that they are just going to be a higher penetration of e commerce and retail and some of the initiatives that you are rolling out like curbside pickup and ship to home are going to drive less traffic to to your stores so how are you going to balance that over the long run and generate some of your sales productivity initiatives good morning michael thanks for your question we saw when you know things started normalizing in the middle of the year before the 2nd wave came through we saw really great confidence in stores and that the omnichannel benefit of stores and digital really came together in a positive way you know for us in our forward planning that we provided for the three year plan we have actually shown we have actually factored in a very high digital rate into that so that our financials remain stable but we see that the the driving to store piece really does come from an omnichannel environment i think there is a number of great retailers that are exemplifying this at the moment and a trip to the store whether it be for bopos or for a true trip both generate a sense of the store in your community as part of your network and part of your need lifestyle so we look forward to a more normalized base we think our stores will be ready when that come through with new visual merchandising new assortments new planning and in so we have fifty doors plus a completely new environment and what we have seen in those new environments is that when we provide that the differential to our control is very very strong and that we see sales growth so we are firm believers in stores we are investing in stores and then we think that our assortment our presentation and our remotes will really help us even further there okay my my point my follow up question is in the bridge that you provided for your gross margin for 202019 to 2021 you talk about the the the positive drivers of sourcing own brands better promotions and markdowns and coupons upsell buys and channel shift and freight costs in that there s there s no real discussion around reinvestment in in price or other traffic driving initiatives and this is going to be at a time where arguably and i know this is debatable that some of the tail winds at the home related category are going to feed in a reopening environment yeah i think the reason why that is not in there is that work has been done i mean we are already showing that the indices on the kvi is for our key categories that we are showing great everyday parity to our key comp set with our promotions that we are using now are taking hold and actually we are using them more effectively so we are seeing cost savings and the promotions but getting much more effectiveness we have believed that these muscles which we have displayed in the last two quarters that have really driven great gross margin growth are sustainable inside the mix michael i think that the the promotional expectation of 2021 i feel is overstated i think we see great data that shows that the home trend will be sticky this is part of people is lives now and their expectation of creating joy and comfort at home and and we do not believe that there is going to be an exceptional chase into a promotional activity but our financials and our promotional cadence that we have and the balance we have created this year is ready for that in 2021 and our last question is from seth bassam from whitebridge securities thanks a lot and good morning my 1st question is just on your ebitda guidance for 2021 could you give us some color as to what is driving that so the guidance we are providing in 2021 is already on a core banner basis it is it only includes bad bath baby decoras and harman we showed in the bridge what would be the proforma 2019 ok that is all the information i have is there anything else you would like to know we are being presented with a range being presented based on the true up performer of 2019 again still with that responsible attitude to ebitda for the full year based on some of the early changes in h one that can occur but you know it was a secondary pivot that we could provide to be even more definitive on the way to further growth yeah any comments there that i know you know this but it is a tighter range on revenue now when you compare net sales 2020 21 it is not comparable that is why we want to provide the guidance on a comparable basis and we are going to see some of that dynamic in q four already why we have mentioned that q four net sales are going to be down double digits my reported basis between fifteen up to twenty is simply the impact of the ban on divestitures it is a significant transformation going on it is a totally different shape of the pnl next year on concepts on sales on stores my follow up questions are related to the mix of online versus in store sales that you are expecting in 2021 when you expect that mix of in store sales to increase from 2020 and if so why do you expect so much channel shift headwinds is it just because of freight rate increases yeah i mean we do i mean there is a natural pivot that there just will be you know and again it has been such an exceptional year we think that the digital penetration will continue to be strong and we have got great offsets to that you know including where we were sharing that 36 of all our digital orders were actually fulfilled by stores in the quarter was just incredible agility there so we are going to be offsetting some of the costs we see some freight permeating in 2021 but we are factoring in the higher digital penetration thank you very much and as all time safely we have for questions i will now turn a call back over to janet barth for closing remarks thank you and thank you all for participating in our call today please feel free to contact me or felix with any additional questions have a great day and stay safe and you may now disconnect",

will then be happy to take any questions before i begin my comments on our 3rd quarter results i would like to 1st address our thoughts regarding the coronavirus and any impact to our current supply chain currently culp has not seen significant impacts from the virus in any of our businesses in our upholstery fabrics business our culp china location is operating at normal levels with virtually all employees reporting to work we have also built a stable long term supply base in china and we work with vendors who favor culp due to our strong trusted relationships we have experienced minimal delays as most of our suppliers have backed nearly full output and continue to prioritize our production we have also relocated a considerable amount of our cut and sew production to two facilities we work with in vietnam likewise in both our mattress fabrics and home accessories business we are not currently experiencing any delays in asia and we also have significant alternative locations for production as needed this includes production or sourcing capabilities in the us canada haiti vietnam and turkey while we cannot predict whether the virus will have any negative impact on consumer confidence on us consumer market we believe our solid and stable supply chain and our global platform supports our ability to manage any disruption created by the outbreak now we will turn to the 3rd quarter results as previously announced our results for the quarter reflected unexpected sales particularly in our core business segments while several external factors affected our results for the 3rd quarter we believe culp is well positioned for the medium and long term our global platform is reactive and is a distinct competitive advantage for the company providing the ability to quickly respond to changing market dynamics we also benefit from significant synergies across our business segments that are fostering collaboration and product development and allow us to better serve our customers in all markets above all we remain focused on innovation and creative designs in our all of our businesses and we are confident in our product driven strategy and the ability to meet the changing demands of a diverse customer base throughout fiscal 2020 we have maintained our position as this trusted supplier of fabrics for a global marketplace importantly we have the financial strength to support and execute our strategies and continue returning funds to our shareholders we look forward to the opportunities ahead for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and beyond i will now turn the call over to ken who will review financial results for the quarter thanks iv as mentioned earlier on the call we have posted slide presentations to our investor relations website that cover key performance measures we have also posted our capital allocation strategy here is the financial highlights for the 3rd quarter net sales were 72000000 down sixeight compared with the prior year period on a pre tax gaap basis the company reported a net loss of 5100000 compared with a pre tax income of 4300000 for the 3rd quarter of last year as previously di disclosed a few weeks ago on february 18th the results for the 3rd quarter of the current fiscal year include a reversal of a 6100000 recorded contingent earn out liability as well as non cash impairment charges of 13600000 related to the home accessory division resulting in a non cash net charge of 7600000 excluding this net charge adjusted pretax income non gaap was 2400000 for the 3rd quarter of this fiscal year the financial results for the 3rd quarter of last fiscal year included approximately 769000 in restructuring and related charges and credits and other non recurring items due mostly to the closure of the company is anderson south carolina production facility excluding this net charge pretax income for the 3rd quarter of last year was 5000000 net loss attributed to culp inc shareholders was $58000 or ¢zero per diluted share for the 3rd quarter compared with net income of 3200000 or ¢25 per diluted share for the prior year period the results of the 3rd quarter of both fiscal years include the respective charges and restructuring related credits i just noted the effective income tax rate was nineteen for the 3rd quarter and 142eight for the year to date period for this fiscal year the company is high effective income tax rate for the year to date period reflects the significant decline in the company is projected annual consolidated taxable income particularly in the us which includes the income tax effects of the asset impairment charges as previously discussed as well as the mix of consolidated taxable income that is earned by the company is foreign operations located in china and canada that have higher higher income rates in relation to the us the current mix of taxable income has led to a significant increase in the effective income tax rate that is associated with our global intangible low tax income or gilti tax which represents a us income tax on foreign earnings importantly income taxes incurred in the us on a cash basis for fiscal 2020 are expected to be the minimal due to the projected utilization of the company is us federal net operating loss carry forwards and immediate expensing of us capital expenditures looking ahead to the rest of this fiscal year we estimate that our consolidated effective income tax rate will remain high and be in the 120 130 range based on the facts that we know today and as affected by the factors noted above notably the us treasury department and internal revenue service have issued newly proposed regulations that if and when enacted and if enacted as proposed could provide us with some relief from the gilti tax under the proposed gilti high tax exception election beginning of fiscal 2021 or later subject to the timing of enactment and subject to any determination by the us treasury department and irs that the exception should apply retroactive retroactive the proposed gilti tax high tax exception election is not available until the proposed regulations are finalized and effective if the proposed gilti tax exception election is enacted as proposed and becomes effective for our fiscal 2021 year and assuming we do not have non recurring charges or impairments that would reduce our pre tax income then based on current assumptions we would estimate our tax rate for fiscal 2021 to to be in the range of 35 to fifty however let me stress that there are a lot of moving parts that affect this rate including the many factors i have discussed previously so this estimate could change trailing twelve month adjusted ebitda as of the end of the 3rd quarter of this fiscal year was 19600000 or sixseven of sales consolidate return on capital for the trailing twelve month period with eightseven now let us take a look at our two at our business segments for mattress fabric segment sales with 33100000 down sevenfour compared to last year 3rd quarter operating income for the quarter was 1800000 compared with 3200000 a year ago with an operating income margin of fivefour compared with nine a year ago the operating performance was primarily affected by lower than expected sales return on capital for the trailing twelve month period for mattress fabrics was fourteen one for the upholstery fabric segment sales for the 3rd quarter were 35000000 down fiveseven over the prior year with prior year was a strong a very strong quarter sales performance that was positively effected by advanced customer purchases in anticipation of additional tariffs operating income for the quarter was 3000000 compared with 3800000 a year ago with operating income margin of eightseven compared with tentwo a year ago we are pleased with the eightseven margin this year given that it was achieved during the quarter with the chinese new year shutdown occurred return on capital for the trailing twelve month period for the upholstery fabric segment continues to be impressive coming in at 54 the home accessory segment which includes our e commerce and finished product business offering bedding accessories and home goods reported 3900000 in sales to the 3rd quarter compared with 4400000 a year ago operating loss with the quarter was 181000 which reflects continued sequential improvement from the $350000 loss experienced in the 2nd quarter and the $535000 loss experienced in the 1st quarter we will comment more on operating performance later on here are the balance sheet highlights we reported 34800000 total cash and investment and outstanding barns nine of 925000 for a net cash position of 33900000 for the 1st nine months of this fiscal year we incurred 4100000 capital expenditures we returned 4500000 to shareholders and regular quarter dividends and share repurchases through the 3rd quarter of this fiscal year we had negative cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of 519000 and 4700000 respectively for the 1st month of this fiscal year due primarily to the timing of payments in advance of chinese new year set downs and higher than expected inventories mostly in our mattress fabrics business this compared with positive cash flow from operations and positive pre cash flow of 8100000 5900000 respectively for the prior year period with better working capital performance including better management of inventory we expect cashflow from operations and free cash flow to improve significantly in the 4th quarter of this fiscal year the company repurchased 56000 shares of our common stock during the 3rd for this year and repurchased approximately 86000 additional shares through march 4th leaving 3300000 available under the s previous share repurchase program as reported in our press release our board has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization back to 5000000 shares may be repurchased at the company is discretion from time to time in the open market or in probably negotiated transactions we will continue to consider opportunities to repurchase shares at a price that reflects a discount to our calculated intrinsic value per share however as highlighted in our capital allocation strategy which is posted in the re investor relations section of our website we remain focused on a very disciplined approach to capital allocation including maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid cash position particularly given the current uncertainty in the global business environment with that i will turn the call back over to iv thanks ken let me start with the mattress fabric segment our mattress fabric sales were lower than anticipated for the 3rd quarter of the year as we were pressured by more than expected or we were pressured more than expected from holiday shutdowns and continued industry weakness for our legacy business customers mattress covers have become an increasingly important part of our business and losing multiple productive weeks for our class cover operations in haiti and also in china caused a more significant impact when combined with softness and our legacy business also the anti dumping measures relating to low price mattress imports from china have not yet provided the relief expected for the domestic mattress industry in spite of these challenges we continue to manage our business with a relentless focus on creative designs innovative products and exceptional service our global platform supports these efforts with efficient production and distribution capabilities to provide a full compliment of mattress fabrics and some covers with the flexibility to adapt to evolving customer needs we are strengthened by our existing manufacturing operations in the us canada haiti china and our sourcing platform in turkey we expect to add fabric production capabilities in vietnam this calendar year and we are also expanding our sewn cover production capabilities in haiti with a new building and additional equipment we believe these expansions will enhance our abilities to serve customers further while the domestic disruption from low price mattress imports appears to be continuing as a result of many imports moving from china now to other countries we believe our strong global platform for fabric and covers in asia has us well positioned to capture market share with imported mattresses going forward additionally while the holiday shutdowns disrupted our clients operations in haiti and china during the 3rd quarter we are pleased with the continued growth of our sewn mattress cover business demand trends for mattress covers remains favorable especially for the growing box bedding space and we continue to develop fresh products with both new and existing customers with some cover production capabilities now in the us haiti and asia we have a very strong platform that allows us to maximize our full supply chain potential from fabric to finished covers we continue to invest in design and marketing capabilities with our latest technologies to improve the customer experience and speed to market with new digital tools and project management software we are very pleased with the initial customer response to our new three d mapping and rendering capabilities which is being marketed as re imagine culp home fashions this reflects the spirit of innovation in our mattress fabrics business we are also enhancing our service platform as part of our ongoing efforts to be more responsive to customer demand with shorter lead times and we are implementing a new inventory management process which we believe will drive greater control i am especially pleased with sandy brown our long time cfo in the mattress fabric segment is now president of the division having worked with sandy for over twenty years i am confident she had the experience expertise and the vision to lead this business as we strive to operate our strong platform in the most efficient manner looking ahead there are many opportunities to advance our position as a leading provider of mattress fabrics and sewn covers we believe we will benefit from our recent and ongoing efforts to further out design and service capabilities with advanced technologies that support our sales and marketing efforts with both legacy and new customers now i will turn to the upholstery fabric segment our upholstery fabric business was affected by a slow down in shipments heading into the chinese new year holiday resulting in lower than expected sales for the quarter it is difficult to predict the impact of the holiday shutdown from year to year and this year we experienced a greater than expected decline in january leading up to the holiday period as a result we showed a modest drop in sales compared with a very strong performance in the prior year period in light of the uncertain business environment we faced we are pleased with the overall performance of our upholstery fabric business particularly given the comparison to a very strong quarter last year in fiscal 2019 we have a strong platform in china and stable long term re supplier relationships with vendors that prioritize our production due to those strong relationships this has been an important advantage for culp especially as we res resumed operations at the end of the 3rd quarter following an extended government mandated shutdown in china associated with the coronavirus outbreak we believe this platform supports our ability to manage the current disruptions created by this outbreak and the procedures required by the chinese government also our addition of cut and sew capabilities in vietnam for the end of fiscal 2019 has further augmented our asian platform throughout fiscal 2020 we have continued to execute our strategic focus of introducing new products and diversifying our customer base we are especially pleased with the continued growth in our hospitality business as we have extended our reach in this growing market lead window products our window treatment and installation services business has been a key driver of our growing sales in this business and we are excited about the continued growth opportunities as we expand our product portfolio to the hospitality market product innovation is also a hallmark of our success in the marketplace and provided the state competitive advantage for culp our line of highly durable stain resistant livesmart fabric con continues to be very popular with both existing and new customers we are excited about the demand trends for livesmart evolve our recently introduced line of sustainability fabrics featuring the use of recycled yarns along with the same stain resistant performance looking ahead while the business environment remain remains uncertain with the health issues surrounding the coronavirus in china we believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy with favorable results we have a unique combination of innovative products credit design a growing customer base across both residential and hospitality markets and a global platform to support our business and meet changing customer demands as such we remain confident in our ability to deliver another solid performance in our upholstery fabric in fiscal 2020 lastly i will comment on the results for culp home accessories which includes our e commerce and finished products business offering bedding accessories and home goods we have worked hard to refine our strategy and drive improved results for our home accessory segment while it is taking longer than we expected to reach our initial projection for this business we are encouraged by recent opportunities with new online marketplaces and business to business sales channels we also remain dedicated to improving our performance on amazon which is a principal sales channel for our legacy e commerce business in tandem with these strategies we are continuing to develop new products featuring culp mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics and we were pleased with a very solid showing up as new products at the recent las vegas market we remain optimistic about potential growth opportunities for culp home accessories and the ability to leverage this new important sales channel to reach new customers for culp ken will now review of the outlook for 4th quarter and we will then take some questions importantly our expectations for the 4th quarter assumed the coronavirus outbreak does not have a greater than anticipated impact on the company is operations which may affect each of the company is divisions to varying levels we are monitoring the situation daily and following the processes and procedures provided for in the company is global pandemic disease contingency plan to protect our workforce however the potential impact with the coronavirus is difficult to estimate reasonably at this point given the solidity and circumstances related to the disease and the actions being taken to contain its spread subject to those assumptions and limitations we expect the overall sales to decrease slightly compared with the 4th quarter of last year we expect mattress fabric sales to be slightly down compared with the 4th quarter of last year due to continuing market pressure and stock within our legacy business during the 4th quarter while operating income and margins are expected to increase slightly compared with the prior period in our upholstery fabric segment we expect 4th quarter sales and operating income and margins to be slightly higher than the prior year period in our home accessory segment we expect 4th quarter sales to be comparable to the 4th quarter of last fiscal year we expect an operating loss for the 4th quarter but with significant improvement compared to the prior year period and continued quarter report sequential improvement for this fiscal year considering these factors the company expects report pre tax income for the 4th quarter in the range of 1900000 to 2400000 excluding restructuring and related charges or credits other non recurring charges and impairment charges if any pre tax income for last year is 4th quarter was 1500000 which included a non recurring charge of $500000 excluding this charge pre tax income for the 4th quarter of last year was $2000000 based on our current projection capital expenditures for this fiscal year are now expect to be in the 6000000 to $6500000 range depreciation and amortization expect to be approximately 8600000 additionally free cash flow for this fiscal year is expected to be moderately down as compared to last year is results with that we went out to take your questions thank you if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press star one to ask a question we will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions we will take our 1st question from bobby griffin with raymond james please go ahead good morning everybody thank you for taking my questions good morning bobby so i guess the 1st thing i want to talk about is product maybe adding some fabric production capabilities in vietnam and maybe can we expand on on what those capabilities will give you guys and what is the strategy to participate more and what i i guess we can call the asia import market for mattresses back into the us right thank you bobby this is iv i will take that question yeah you have to go back a little bit as we think about the anti dumping and tariffs you know which it feels like you know now we are not even talking about that anymore but that was a pretty significant disruption over the last year the section 301 tariffs the rules for upholstery and mattress fabrics are are quite different so the reason we are looking primarily to establish m fabric manufacturing in vietnam is because today mattress fabrics have a fairly significant extra 301 tariffs coming from china as do mattress covers unlike furniture or upholstery fabric where we can ship fabric from china to vietnam to avoid a tariff unless you make the full sown cover fabric all the way to cover in vietnam you still you would still pay the extra tariff so for us establishing in vietnam is is a risk management play a cost saving play and certainly gives us the ability to make covers that we can fulfill through vietnam that we can then sell into other countries that are making beds and end up in the us or bring that up in covers of our own back to us in the us what about yeah that is very helpful i am just curious from a competitive standpoint once you get this operation set up would those corresponding covers that you can now make in vietnam be competitively priced to some of the covers that are already going on imports in for the bedroom to the us today yes sir bobby we expect you know we have been we have been very competitive with covers already mattress covers that we are making through our culp china platform have been very competitive and there are opportunities materializing there but to be more advantageous to and to deal with us tariff rules and and costs vietnam could be potentially could potentially more advantageous in certain cases okay and then 2nd for me on the home accessory business you talked about maybe improving some of the performance on the amazon channel so can you can you maybe expand a little bit on those strategies and then secondly is there you know a bigger opportunity to sell some of those finished products in in retail locations yes sir bobby those are really good questions too 1st of all touch on the amazon part when we 1st invested in home accessories amazon was the sole really the primarily primary part of the business up to eighty of the sales and we were really focused on that since the time we have invested it is become more costly to do business and to rank higher to google ad words to just find yourself higher in the rankings so it ended up costing us more money than we might have expected so we have dialed back our offerings on amazon to really what we consider our core most stable most cost effective products and we are trying to do what we consider to be an appropriate level of advertising so what we have placed on amazon today we believe we can serve as well it is a good quality product that should rank well and that we do not have to over advertise it and and spend too much money to make it work so we are anticipating amazon being a significant but more like a fifty share of our business and not not such a heavy piece for certain we have great opportunities in all of our accessory products on the b two b side we have a lot of customers roll path betting customers that are looking for products to take on and have additional sale accessories we also had a chance to sell some of our products into some retail direct distribution and that is working sometimes it is never as fast as we want it to be because it takes time to to get into retail cycle but we are very optimistic about that opportunity also all right i appreciate you taking my questions iv that was very helpful best of luck in the next quarter yes sir thank you once again that is star one to ask a question if you find that your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two and star one to ask a question we will take our next question from paul betz with stifel good morning everyone continuing with amazon you mentioned some new sellers are violating terms can you explain what is going on there and maybe if that gets rectified you know you will lose some or see less competition yes sir well paul thank you for the question it is iv i will i will take that too basically what is what is happened since we 1st started with amazon and there has been a lot of stories in the press about this there have been times where primarily chinese sellers have flooded the marketplace on commodity items mattress protectors and mattress pads and things that we specialized in and amazon has pretty specific terms of service the way you the way you acquire a five star reviews we have a lot of reviews that we have earned through steady normal processes selling items getting reviews it is not really in terms of service to be doing a lot of free giveaways and fabricating reviews and also to be downgrading competitors with fake reviews which we have found instances of all those things and we have reported them to really high levels in amazon and and made some headway so amazon is working really hard to change their method the way they rank suppliers and i think in time that will get better but it is a pretty it is a pretty long fight for someone like us to to make a big impact really quick but that is what we mean by terms of service violation it is really fabricated and falsified reviews primarily okay thanks and the capex was reduced that just to conserve cash or what areas did you might lower that sum yeah well this can yeah we we looked at the year and given our cash position we started prioritizing projects and so you know we have a certain amount of what we call maintenance capex which is in that 6000000 or so range so when you look at where we are ending up projected ended up and then looking forward i mean we are going to in this time of uncertainty we are going to prioritize projects and and as we said keep a very close eye on our cash but we will continue to invest in the business as as we always have and we will just have to you know just m mark the things closely and prioritize projects as they come along okay thanks and lastly the of course margins in the mattress segment will blow our expectations down year over year is that just the disruption from the holiday shutdown or are there anything else going on there no that is that is a good that is a good insight there the obviously the lower sales had an impact but there were a lot of moving parts with the shut downs and all that in the quarter and so that was the the primary reason for the mattresses being down you know the in the lower sales and the other disruption as well okay thank you very much thank you we will take our next question from marco rodriguez of stonegate capital markets please go ahead good morning guys thank you for taking my questions wondering if morning i was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the the expansion activities that you are doing here in vietnam and haiti if you could just maybe place a a timeline as far as when these capabilities will be there and then and then the costs associated with those yes sir thanks for the questions marco the expansions in vietnam and and haiti are are both really targeted for the mattress fabrics business in terms of the expansion standpoint we are already operating pretty significantly in vietnam for our upholstery curtain full kits that is performing well haiti you know we started a a two pronged strategy a really three pronged strategy for mattress covers you know we have our us business that is a prototyping and quick rollout and emergency recovery platform that works well for us haiti is a a very low cost opportunity that we see out on a near sourcing potential so we are able to drive significantly faster lead times in haiti it has been a really resounding success for us so far and we are just expanding the building so it is not a significant expense you know we are just building some extra space and adding some more sewing machines getting into cut and sew so it is not a heavy capex venture so we would anticipate being in that plan and having additional capacity this summer it is a pretty fast pretty fast uprising there and we are excited about haiti the good part about it is we can bring fabrics from anywhere in the world today and co if it is shown in haiti and comes back to us there is no duty on any of the products in or out so very advantageous platform that should provide us with faster lead times if we forecast and store inventory at the right places vietnam is really an important ability for us to dabble with mattress fabrics in a small way we should we will start start small mainly focused on serving asian customers and that is our attempt to get after some of the beds that are being made in asia and we can do that with both fabric or with a sewn mattress cover if we need to we also have the ability to bring some of that back to the us not preferred on lead time basis but it could be good for costs and we will just do that on an as needed basis and we would avoid a section 301 tariff got it understood and then in terms of the the service platform additions or enhancements that you are taking a look at in the in in the new inventory management can you maybe expand a little bit more on what sort of impact if any you might see on the p and l and or the balance sheet with those well what and and now i can not now i can not comment on the impact but i will tell you the way the reason we are thinking about it is the mattress industry always for a long time was a pretty quick speed to market business where we pretty much inventory shipped everything same day and we still do that for a big part of the market but as things have gotten more diverse with imported mattresses and imported components lead times have gotten a little longer so we have tried to then match our platform with all the multi countries that were in us canada china haiti vietnam and then our sourcing business in turkey we want to bring lead times back down even with that global strategy so our anticipation would not be to get out of the longer lead times that we have had recently shorten those lead times down so we are not caught with so much exposure on the water as market conditions change so we are just our intention is to bring a better efficient management of our scheduling faster lead time to customers to make them happy and then reduce our exposure for extra inventory yeah marco this is ken and that is we had you know the extra inventory we we were expecting obviously a better quarter than we had and so we build up inventory that those sales did not material did not materialize but now with this new focus we should be able to get inventory down and and keep it in line work consistently which will obviously help improve the cashflow in the 4th quarter but we are excited about the new process and you know hopefully do not get back in the situation where we build up inventory in expe in in anticipation sales that that do not materialize so this is this is an exciting move and one that is that we are excited anxious to get started got it a and last quick question i know it is it is kind of a difficult one here on guidance you know you you built in some sort of an impact for coronavirus but just kind of curious if maybe you can put a little bit more color around what what does worsening conditions mean for you or look like are are we talking additional shutdowns in china as far as the risk is conce concerned and i know that you also brought the fact that obviously consumer confidence in us is is a big unknown as it stands right now yeah marco i will i will i will answer and then if boyd wants to jump in yeah it is it is forecasting in this environment and is extremely difficult you know w we we put a lot of language around the uncertainty you know as you know everybody reads what happens daily the news comes out and so right now we are things are operating well in china things have re are recovering so we have got that that news there but you know things change daily so given where we are we expect a good quarter the 4th quarter but as as i said things can change quickly and and we will just have to wait and see now we have got processes and systems that we can react to and and make changes and be flexible in our in our flexible platforms but it is just a very very uncertain time right now and so we are just being very cautious in how we forecast boyd i do not know if you want to yeah yeah i will add to that ken thank you and marco just in relation to the current situation for the upholstery side in china we as we have relayed we have really seen a return now to mostly normal situations very quickly getting back to normal situations there we had a one week delay in our china operation a government mandated one week delay before we were able to get back to operating and then we have seen some delays from our supply base but currently nearly all of our suppliers are now back to almost full output again so the current situation is has been very positive we have experienced minimal delays and disruptions to supply to our customer base as a result and so while it may remains a dynamic situation for sure and and uncertainty the current picture is china has recovered quite nicely and our supply base is back to near full output and so at the moment there appears to be minimal disla dis delays coming from it fantastic thanks mark i appreciate your time thank you thank you marco it appears there are no further questions at this time mister iv culp

confidence and the u s consumer market we believe our solid and stable supply chain and our global platform supports our ability to manage any disruption created by the outbreak now we will turn to the 3rd quarter results as previously announced our results for the quarter reflected and unexpected sales particularly in our core business segments while several external factors affected our results for the 3rd quarter we believe kcorp is well positioned for the medium and long term our global platform is reactive and is a distinct competitive advantage for the company providing the ability to quickly respond to changing market dynamics we also benefit from significant synergies across our business segments that are fostering collaboration and product development and allow us to better serve our customers in all markets above all we remain focused on innovation and creative designs in all of our business segments we are confident in our product driven strategy and the ability to meet the changing demands of a diverse customer base throughout fiscal 2020 we have maintained our position as a trusted supplier of fabrics for a global marketplace importantly we have the financial strength to support and execute our strategies and continue returning funds to our shareholders we look forward to the opportunities ahead for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and beyond the call over to ken who will review financial results for the quarter thanks is as mentioned earlier on the call we have posted slide presentations to our investor relations website that cover key performance measures we have also posted our capital allocation strategy here are the financial highlights for the 3rd quarter net sales were $72000000 down sixeight compared with the prior year period on a pretax gap basis the company reported a net loss of 5100000 compared with a pretax income of 4300000 thank you as previously disclosed a few weeks ago on february 18th the results for the 3rd quarter of the current fiscal year include a reversal of a 6100000 recorded contingent earn out liability as well as non cash impairment charges of 13600000 related to the home accessories division resulting in a non cash net charge of 7600000 excluding this net charge adjusted pretax income non gap was 2400000 for the quarter the financial results for the 3rd quarter of last fiscal year included approximately 769000 in restructuring and related charges and credits and other non recurring items due mostly to the closure of the company is anderson south carolina production facility excluding this net charge pre tax income for the 3rd quarter of last year was 5000000 net loss attributed to the coppe inc shareholders was $58000 or ¢zero per diluted share for the 3rd quarter of last year compare with net income of 3200000 or ¢25 per diluted share for the prior year period the results of the 3rd quarter of both fiscal years include the respective charges and restructuring related credits i just noted the effective income tax rate was nineteen for the 3rd quarter and 142eight for the unit date period for this fiscal year the company is high effective income tax rate for the unit date period reflects a significant decline in the company is per share projected annual consolidated taxable income particularly in the u s which includes the income tax effects of the asset impairment charges previously discussed as well as the mix of consolidated taxable income that is earned by the company is foreign operations located in china and canada that have higher higher income rates in relation to the u s the current mix of taxable income has led to a significant increase in the effective income tax rate that is associated with our global operations tangible low tax income or guilty tax which represents a u s income tax on foreign earnings importantly income taxes incurred in the u s on a cash basis for fiscal 2020 are expected to be minimal due to the projected utilization of the company is u s federal net operating loss carryforwards and immediate expensing of u s capital expenditures looking ahead to the rest of this fiscal year we estimate that our consolidated effective income tax rate will be in the range of百分之九到百分之十二 it is expected that the tax rate will remain high and be in the 120 130 range based on the facts we know today and is affected by the factors noted above notably the u s treasury department and internal revenue service have issued newly proposed regulations that if enacted and if enacted as proposed could provide us with some relief from the guilty tax under the proposed guilty high tax exception election beginning in fiscal 2021 or later to the timing of enactment and subject to any determination by the u s treasury department and irs that the exception should apply retroactively the proposed guilty tax high tax exception election is not available into the proposed regulations or finalized and effective if the proposed guilty tax exception election is enacted as proposed and becomes effective for our fiscal year 2021 and assuming we do not have a budget surplus then and assuming we do not have a budget surplus then the budget authority necessary to implement the provisions of this section shall be available from the general fund of the treasury non recurring charges or impairments that would reduce our pretax income then based on current assumptions we would estimate our tax rate for fiscal 2020 to 2021 did it be in the range of 35 to fifty however let me stress that there are a lot of moving parts that affect this rate including the many factors i have discussed previously so this estimate could change twelvemonth adjusted ebitda as of the end of the 3rd quarter of this fiscal year was 19960000 or sixseven of sales consolidated return on capital for the trailing twelve month period was eightseven now let us take a look at our two at our business segments for the mattress fabric segment sales were 33100000 down sevenfour compared to last year 3rd quarter operating income for the quarter was 1800000 compared with 3200000 a year ago with an operating income margin of fivefour compared with nine a year ago the operating performance was primarily affected by lower than expected sales return on capital for the trailing twelve month period for mattress fabrics was fourteen one for the opposable fabric segment sales for the 3rd quarter were $35000000 down fiveseven over the prior year which prior year was a strong very strong quarter sales performance that was positively affected by advanced customer purchases in anticipation of additional tariffs operating income for the year was $11700000 compared to $14900000 in the prior year compared with 3800000 a year ago with operating income margin of eightseven compared with tentwo a year ago we are pleased with the eightseven margin this year given that it was achieved during the quarter in which the chinese new year shutdown occurred return on capital for the twelve and twelve month period for the post three fiscal seven continues to be impressive coming in at 54 the home accessory segment which includes our e commerce and finished products business bedding accessories and home goods reported 3900000 sales for the 3rd quarter compared with 4400000 a year ago operating loss for the quarter was 181000 which reflects continuous sequential improvement from the $350000 loss experienced in the 2nd quarter and the $535000 loss experienced in the 1st quarter we will comment more on operating performance later on here are the balance sheet highlights we reported 34800000 in total cash and cash equivalents in outstanding borrowings not including outstanding borrowings of 925000 for a net cash position of 33900000 for the 1st nine months of this fiscal year we incurred 4100000 in capital expenditures we returned 4500000 to shareholders in regular quarterly dividends and share repurchases through the 3rd quarter of this fiscal year we had negative cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of 519004700000 respectively for the 1st nine months of this fiscal year for the 1st nine months of this fiscal year we had negative cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of 519004700000 respectively for the 1st nine months of this fiscal year this fiscal year due primarily to the timing of payments in advance of chinese new year shutdowns and higher than expected inventories mostly in our mattress fabrics business this compared with positive cash flow from operations and positive pre cash flow of 8100005900000 respectively for the prior year period with better working capital performance including better management of inventory we expect cash flow from operations and pre cash flow to improve significantly in the 4th quarter the company repurchased 56000 shares of our common stock during the 3rd quarter of this year and repurchased approximately 86000 additional shares through march 4th leaving 3300000 available under the previous share repurchase program as reported in our press release our board has approved and increased our share repurchase authorization back to 5000000 shares shares may be repurchased at the company is discretion from time to time in the open market we will continue to consider opportunities to repurchase shares at a price that reflects a discount to our calculated intrinsic value per share however as highlighting in our capital allocation strategy which is posted in the investor relations section of our website we remain focused on a very disciplined approach to capital allocation including maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid cash position particularly given the current uncertainty in the global business environment with that i will turn the call back over to iz thanks again ken let me start with the mattress fabric segment our mattress fabric sales were lower than anticipated for the 3rd quarter of the year as we were pressured by more than expected or we were pressured more than expected from holiday shutdowns and continued industry weakness for our legacy business customers mattress covers have become an increasingly important part of our business and losing multiple productive weeks for our class cover operations in haiti and also in china the softness of our legacy business when combined with the softness of our domestic mattress industry in spite of these challenges we continue to manage our business with a relentless focus on creative designs innovative products and exceptional service our global platform supports these efforts with efficient production and distribution capabilities to provide a comprehensive solution we are pleased to announce the acquisition of mattress fabrics and sun covers with the flexibility to adapt to evolving customer needs we are strengthened by our existing manufacturing operations in the us canada haiti china and our sourcing platform in turkey we expect to add fabric production capabilities in vietnam this calendar year and we are also expanding our sun cover production capabilities in haiti with a new building and additional equipment we believe these expansions will enhance our ability to meet customer needs our ability to serve customers further while the domestic disruption from low price mattress imports appears to be continuing as a result of many imports moving from china now to other countries we believe our strong global platform for fabric and covers in asia has us well positioned to capture market share with imported mattresses going forward additionally while the holiday shutdowns disrupted our class operations in haiti and china during the 3rd quarter we are pleased with the continued growth our sewn mattress cover business demand trends for mattress covers remains favorable especially for the growing box spring bedding space and we continue to develop fresh products with both new and existing customers with sewn cover production capabilities now in the us haiti and asia we have a very strong platform that allows us to maximize our full supply chain potential from fabric to finished covers we continue to invest in design and marketing capabilities with our latest technology we are very pleased with our initial customer response to our new three d mapping and rendering capabilities which is being marketed as red oak imagine called home fashions this reflects the spirit of innovation in our mattress fabrics business we are also enhancing our service platform as part of our ongoing efforts to be more responsive to customer demand with shorter lead times and we are implementing a new inventory management process which we believe will drive greater control i am especially pleased that sandy brown our longtime cfo in the mattress fabric segment is now president of the division having worked with sandy for over twenty years i am confident she has the experience expertise and the vision to lead this business as we strive to operate our strong platform in the most efficient manner looking ahead there are many opportunities to advance our position as the leading provider of mattress fabrics and sound covers we believe we will benefit from our recent and ongoing efforts to further our design and service capabilities with advanced technologies that support our sales and marketing efforts with both legacy and new customers now i will turn to the upholstery fabric segment our upholstery fabric business was affected by a slowdown in shipments heading into the chinese new year holiday resulting in lower than expected sales for the quarter it is difficult to predict the impact of the holiday shutdown from year to year and this year we experienced a greater than expected decline in january leading up to the holiday period as a result we showed a modest drop in sales compared with a very strong performance in the prior year period in light of the uncertain business environment we faced we are pleased with the overall performance of our pulsed fabric business particularly given the comparison to a very strong quarter last year in fiscal 2019 we have a strong platform in china and stable operations we have long term or supplier relationships with vendors that prioritize our production due to their strong relationships this has been an important advantage for our company especially as we resumed operations at the end of the 3rd quarter following an extended government mandated shutdown in china associated with the coronavirus outbreak we believe this platform supports our ability to manage the current disruptions created by the outbreak and the procedures required by the chinese government also our addition of cut to size capabilities in vietnam toward the end of fiscal 2019 has further augmented our asian platform throughout fiscal 2020 we have continued to execute our strategic focus of introducing new products and diversifying our customer base we are especially pleased with the continued growth in our hospitality business as we have extended our reach in this growing market lead window products our window treatment and installation services business has been a key driver of our growing business our sales in this business and we are excited about the continued growth opportunities as we expand our product portfolio to the hospitality market product innovation is also a hallmark of our success in the marketplace and provides a distinct competitive advantage for colt our line of highly durable stain resistant and lifeproof fabric continues to be very popular with both existing and new customers we are excited about the demand trends where lifeproof evolves our recently introduced line of sustainability featuring the use of recycled yarns along with the same stain resistant performance looking ahead while the business environment remains remains uncertain with the health issues surrounding the coronavirus in china and beyond we believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy with favorable results we have a unique combination of innovative products create designs a growing customer base across both residential and hospitality markets and a global platform to support our business and be changing we remain confident in our ability to deliver another solid performance in our upholstery fabrics business in fiscal 2020 lastly i will comment on the results for colt home accessories which includes our e commerce and finished products business offering better than expected accessories and home goods we have worked hard to refine our strategy and drive improved results for our home accessory segment while it has taken longer than we expected to reach our initial projections for this business we encourage by the team is efforts new opportunities with new online marketplaces and business to business sales channels we also remain dedicated to improving our performance on amazon which is a principal sales channel for our legacy e commerce business in tandem with these strategies we are continuing to develop new products featuring cult mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics and we are pleased with the very solid showing of these new products at the recent las vegas market we remain optimistic about potential growth opportunities for cult brands and the ability to leverage this new important sales channel to reach new customers for call ken will now review the outlook for 4th quarter and we will then take some questions importantly our expectations for the 4th quarter assume the coronavirus outbreak does not have a greater than anticipated impact on the company is operations which may affect each of the company is divisions to varying levels we are monitoring the situation daily and following the processes and procedures provided however the potential impact of the coronavirus is difficult to estimate reasonably at this point given the fluidity and circumstances related to the disease and the actions being taken to contain spread subject to those assumptions and limitations we expect overall sales to increase slightly compared with the 4th quarter of last year we expect mattress fabric sales to be slightly down compared with the 4th quarter of last year continuing market pressure and softer than expected legacy business during the 4th quarter will result in operating income margins being expected to increase slightly compared with the prior year period in our upholstery fabric segment we expect 4th quarter sales and operating income margins to be slightly higher than the prior year period in our home accessory segment we expect 4th quarter sales to be comparable to the 4th quarter of last fiscal year we expect an operating loss for the 4th quarter but with significant improvement improvement compared to the prior year period and continued quarter over quarter improvement for this fiscal year considering these factors the company expects to report pre tax income for the 4th quarter in the range of 1900000 to 2400000 excluding restructuring and related charges or credits other non recurring charges and impairment charges if any pre tax income for last year is 4th quarter was 1500000 which included a non recurring charge of 500000 excluding this charge pretax income for the 4th quarter of last year was $2000000 based on our current projection capital expenditures for this fiscal year are now expected to be in the 6000000 to $6500000 range depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately 8600000 additionally pre tax cash flow for this fiscal year is expected to be moderately down as compared to last year is results with that we will now take your questions thank you if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal or reach our equipment again press star one to ask a question we will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions thank you good morning everybody thank you for taking my questions good morning everybody so i guess the 1st thing i want to talk about is product maybe having some fabric production capabilities in vietnam and maybe can we expand on on what those capabilities would give you guys and what is the strategy to participate more in and what i guess we can call the asia import market for mattresses back into the us right thank you bobby this is zea i will take that question yeah you have to go back a little bit as we think about both anti dumping and tariffs you know which feels like you know now we are not even talking about that anymore but that was a pretty significant disruption over the last year of section 301 tariffs the rules for upholstery and mattress fabrics are are quite different so the reason we are looking primarily to establish fabric manufacturing in vietnam is because today mattress fabrics have a fairly significant effect the 301 tariff coming from china as do mattress covers unlike furniture or upholstery fabric where we can ship fabric from china to vietnam to avoid a tariff unless you make the full sole cover fabric all the way to cover in vietnam you still you would still pay the extra tariff so for us establishing in vietnam is a is a risk management play a cost saving play and certainly gives us the ability to make covers that we can fulfill through vietnam that we can then sell into other countries that are making beds that end up in the u s or bring fabric and covers of our own back to us in the u s we will hope that answer yeah that is very helpful i was just curious from a competitive standpoint once you get this operation set up will those corresponding covers that you can now make in vietnam be competitively priced to some of the covers that are already going on the imports imported beds into the u s today yes sir bobbie we expect you we have been we have been very competitive with covers already mattress covers that we are making through our colp china platform has been very competitive and there are already opportunities materializing there but to be more advantageous to and to deal with u s tariff rules and and costs vietnam could be potentially could potentially more advantageous in certain cases okay and then so so for me on the home accessories business we talked about maybe improving some of the performance on the amazon channel so can we can you maybe expand a little bit on those strategies and then secondly is there you know a bigger opportunity to sell some of those finished products in retail locations so really the primary primary part of the business up to eighty of the sales and we were really focused on that since the time we have invested it has become more costly to do business and to rank higher to google adwords to just find yourself higher in the rankings and end up costing us more money than we might have expected so we have dial back our offerings on amazon to really what we consider our core most stable most cost effective products and we are trying to do what we can to so what we have placed on amazon today we believe we can service us well it is a good quality product that should rank well and then we do not have to over advertise it and and spend too much money to make it work so we are anticipating amazon being a significant but more like a fifty share of our business and not not such a heavy piece for certain we have great opportunities in all of our accessory products on the b to b side we have a lot of customers we are roll packed bedding customers that are looking for products to attack on and have additional sales accessories we also have a chance to sell some of our products into some retail direct distribution and that is working sometimes it is never as fast as we want it to be because it takes time to to get in the retail cycle but we are very optimistic about that opportunity also all right i appreciate you taking my questions is that was very helpful best of luck in the next school year yes sir thank you once again that is star one to ask a question if you find that your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two again star one to ask a question we will take our next question from paul betts with steifel zero good morning everyone continuing with the amazon topic you mentioned some new sellers are violating terms can you explain what is going on there maybe if that gets rectified you may  lose some there see less competition yes sir well paul thank you for the question and here i will i will take that too basically what is what is happened since we 1st started with amazon and there has been a lot of stories in the press about this there have been times where primarily chinese sellers have flooded the marketplace on commodity items mattress protectors and mattress pads and things that we specialize in and amazon has pretty specific terms of service the way you the way you acquire five star reviews we have a lot of reviews that are we have earned through steady normal processes selling items getting reviews it is not really in terms of service to be doing a lot of free giveaways and fabricating reviews and also to be downgrading competitors with fake reviews which we have found instances of all those things and we have reported on it s so really high levels in amazon and and made some headway so amazon is working really hard to change their method the way they rank suppliers and i think in time that will get better but it s a pretty it s a pretty long fight for someone like us to to make a big impact really quick but that s what we mean by terms of service violation it s really fabricated and falsified reviews primarily okay thanks and the tapex was reduced that just to conserve cash or what areas did you might lower that sum yeah paul this can yeah yeah we we looked at the year and given our cash position we started prioritizing projects and so you know we have a certain amount of what we call maintenance capex which is in that 6000000 or so range so when you look at where we are ending up projected end up and then looking forward i mean we are going in this time of uncertainty we are going to prioritize projects and as we said keep a very close eye on our cash but we will continue to invest in the business as we always have and we will just have to you know monitor things closely and and prioritize projects as they come along lower expectations down year over year is that just the disruptions from the holiday shutdown or is there anything else going on there now that is that is a good that is a good insight there obviously the lower sales had an impact but there were a lot of moving parts with the shutdowns and all that in the quarter and so that was the the primary reason for the markets being down you know but the yeah the lower sales and the other disruption as well thank you very much thank you we will take our next question from marco rodriguez from stonedge capital markets please go ahead good morning guys thank you for taking my questions i am wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the the expansion activities that you are doing here in in vietnam and haiti if you could just maybe place a timeline as far as when these capabilities will be available yes we will be there and then and then the costs associated with those yes sir thanks for the questions marko and the expansions in vietnam and haiti are are both really targeted for the mattress fabric business in terms of the expansion standpoint we are already operating pretty significantly in vietnam for our full suite cut and sew kits unless performing well haiti you know we sort of have a two pronged strategy a really three pronged strategy for for haiti 遮阳网的覆盖 你知我们有我们的美国企业 是快速的原型 快速的出货 应急的恢复平台 那是有效的 海地是啊 一个非常低成本的机会 那我们看到 经常是近源采购的潜力 所以 我们有能力去驱动显著地更快的出货时间 海地它已经是一个非常成功的案例 所以 我们只是在扩展这个建筑 所以 it s not a significant expense you know we re just building some extra space and that s some more sewing machines getting into cutting so is not a heavy capex venture so we would anticipate being in that plant and having additional capacity this summer it s a pretty fast pretty fast uprising there and we re excited about haiti the good part about it is we can bring fabrics from anywhere in the world today and if it s shown in haiti and comes back to the u s there s no duty on any of the products in so very advantageous platform that should provide us with faster lead times if we forecast and store inventory the right places vietnam is really an important ability for us to dabble with mattress fabrics in a small way we will start start small mainly focused on serving asian customers and that is our attempt to get after some of the beds that are being made in asia and we can do that with both fabric or with the sun if we need to we also have the ability to bring some of that back to the us not preferred on a lead time basis but it could be good for cost and we will just do that on an as needed basis and we would avoid a section 301 tariff and a little bit more on what sort of impact if any you you might see on the p and l and or the balance sheet with those well what and i am not like i like can comment on the impact but i will tell you the way the reason we are thinking about it is the mattress industry always for a long time was a pretty quick speed to market business where we pretty much inventory shipped everything same day and we still do that for a big part of the market but if things have gotten more complex 1st with imported mattresses and imported components lead times have gotten longer so we have tried to then match our platform with all the multi countries that we are in us canada china haiti vietnam and then our sourcing business in turkey we want to bring lead times back down even with that global strategy so our anticipation would not be to get out of the longer lead times that we have had recently shorten those lead times down so we are not caught with so much exposure water as market conditions change so we are just our intention is to bring a better efficient management of our scheduling faster lead time to customers to make them happy and then reduce our exposure for extra inventory yeah marco this can and that is i mean that is you know the extra inventory we we were expecting obviously a better quarter than we had and so we built up inventory that those sales did not materialize did not materialize but now with this new focus we to be able to get inventory down and and and keep it in line more consistently which will obviously help improve the cash flow in the 4th quarter but we are excited about the new process and you know hopefully do not get back in the situation where we build up inventory in exp in anticipation of sales that that do not materialize so this is this is an exciting move and one that that we are excited and anxious to get started and last quick question that is kind of a difficult one here on guidance you know yeah you have built in some sort of an impact for coronavirus but just kind of curious if maybe you can put a little bit more color around what what does worse any conditions mean for you or look like are are we talking additional shutdowns in china as far as the risk is concerned and i know that you also brought up the fact that obviously consumer confidence in us is is a big unknown as it stands right now yeah marco i will i will answer and then if board wants to jump in yeah it is it is forecasting in this environment and is is extremely difficult you know we we put a lot of language around the uncertainty you know as you know everybody reads what happens in daily the the news comes out and so right now we are things are operating well in china things are recovering so we have got that that news there but you know things change daily so given where we are we expect a good quarter in the 4th quarter but as as i said things can change quickly and and we will just have to wait and see now we have got processes and systems that we can react to and and make changes and we are flexible in our and our flexible platforms but it is just a very very uncertain time right now and so we are just being very cautious in how we forecast but i do not know if you want to yeah yeah i will add to that ken thank you and marco just in relation to the current situation for the upholstery side in china we as we have relayed we have really seen a return now to mostly normal situations very quickly so the current situation is is been very positive we have experienced minimal delays and disruptions i think thanks like i appreciate your time thank you operator and again thanks to everyone for your participation and your interest in this call we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter have a great day this concludes today is call thank you for your

humphreys for his com comments sir please proceed thanks operator and thank you all for joining us today in our preliminary results we said we expected to beat the aggressive growth projections we outlined on our 2nd quarter call including eighty growth in rfid for the full year twenty sequential growth in physical security in q two to q three and federal sales up eighty sequentially with our finalized financial results we are confirming that we beat each of those expectations this shows both strong industry trends driving our business and our leadership within the industry overall revenues grew thirty sequentially to 24900000 showing strengths across the business we projected our premises business which is about two thirds federal to grow twenty sequentially we actually grew 26 sequentially in premises our rfid business grew more than fifty sequentially and over 100 year over year as on track for eighty full year growth and our federal revenues grew nearly ninety sequentially so this is lined up for a strong 4th quarter and the 2nd half of the year that will be more than thirty higher than our 1st half we are seeing business momen momentum continuing backlog building and the pipeline for 2021 becoming stronger but before we talk too much about the future let us review the operational and financial results for the 3rd quarter now our key focus areas of our rfid and our federal business were particularly strong within our identity business which is predominantly rfid revenue increased sequentially by 33 to 15400000 and year over year identity and total group 53 from 10100000 in q three 2019 to 15400000 in q three 2020 the growth was mainly driven by rfid of course where we ramped up production volumes for a number of customers in particular a major customer whose production started in q two came through through in q three even stronger than we expected as a result our rfid business more than doubled the volume we produced the year ago even with our ramp up there was nearly $1000000 shipments we did not fulfill we balanced customer requirements and made sure that most critical deliveries were covered as a business implication is that the industry launches we expected are well underway the mass market adoption of rfid integrated products is happening our major customers are incorporated rfid devices and the healthcare products mobility consumer products appliances libraries pharmaceuticals and app enabling the physical world the point is that each of these are a 100000000 or 1000000000 plus unit applications it is a huge market that is just beginning to grow the overall trend clearly shows in our 3rd quarter results as well as in the continuing backlog string we went into the 4th quarter with backlog for 4th quarter shipments of 68 over last year and we will talk about the implications going forward of all these trends later on the call also with an identity in the 3rd quarter our identity readers grew strongly up 38 over last year is 3rd quarter and we all expected the work from home trend to plateau after the initial lockdowns in the spring but this really shows the demand is continuing the 3rd quarter is always strong for smart guard readers because of the federal year end so the growth comes over a normally strong year prior period reason is that the federal government and especially the dod are adopting policy supporting work from home and work mobile for the longterm so we do expect these trends to sustain we will talk more about them as we get as we look at 2021 so turning to our premises business in q three this showed the strength of our full product range as well as of our federal government focus as i mentioned before premises grew 26 sequentially the federal business where our velocity security platform was the strongest vertical from ninety sequentially but we also saw activity in banking retail utilities and others for example in financial services we quoted our 1st large three vr prime managed video services order which is now closed adopting our platform across almost 100 branches the six year is $650000 agreement provides video surveillance analytics and case management on a subscription basis sending 10s of 1000s of dollars in capital expense for our customer and assuring a predictable revenue stream of over $100000 annually for our business that would be clear we have had continuing strong business progress but in our industry some small dealers and small businesses are under pressure as are our competitors who focus there federal state and the local government customers are more than two thirds in the business for our physical access platforms we are seeing strong performance in premises and our quick pivot to recurring revenues with lower cost of entry has put us in a strong position overall these include our velocity cirrus product mobilist id three vr prime our freedom cloud or freedom mobile which we just launched this week all of these are recurring revenue products all launched in the last twelve months now as we talked about in the 2nd quarter the broad adoption of rfid in our major customers core products is what really gives us reason to believe this growth is a long term trend that we are just starting to see takeoff it is building backlog for the 4th quarter and for 2021 so overall the quart the 3rd quarter was highlighted by thirty sequential revenue growth over 100 year over year rfid growth a ninety sequential growth in federal sales 38 year over year identity reader growth and q four backlog of 68 for last year so certainly your challenges in the economic environment we are all in but the strong secular growth we are experiencing rfid are strengthened federal work from home going into a 2nd wave of demand and the products we have launched in the 3rd quarter to take advantage of return to work needs and build the base for a strong 4th quarter in 2021 so let me turn it over to sandra to go through the 3rd quarter financial results afterwards i will go into more metrics and the industry wide trends that are really accelerating our business into the 4th quarter and into 2021 sandra as steve mentioned our results show the continued delivery of what we committed with a solid trajectory for 2021 please note that these results are all within the preliminary results announced october 29th prior to market open the 1st metric is revenue growth even with the continued impact of covid nineteen we closed out the 3rd quarter of 2020 with 24900000 in total revenue up thirty compared to the 2nd quarter of 2020 and that is eight compared to the 3rd quarter of 2019 our recurring revenue accounted for six of our 3rd quarter revenue and eight of our total revenue in the 1st nine months of 2020 this part of our business remained steady at eight of our total trailing twelve month revenue for the 3rd quarter of 2020 our gaap and non gaap adjusted gross profit margins were forty and 41 respectively for the trailing twelve month period our non gaap adjusted gross profit margin was 42 for the 3rd quarter 2020 our non gaap adjusted ebitda margin was positive eleven with a positive four for the trailing twelve month period our gaap net income for the 3rd quarter 2020 was 400000 compared with a loss of 2700000 in q two 2020 and that income of 1100000 in q three 2019 but the dividends on the series to be preferred our gaap net income attributable to stockholders the 100000 or net income of one per share compared with a loss of ¢seventeen per share in q two 2020 and ¢five per share in q three of 2019 we have provided in the appendix a full reconciliation of gaap to non gaap information which is also included in our earnings release on our next slide furth further analyzing trends by segment our premises segment which includes sales of a physical access control and video products video products and services accounted for 9400000 or 38 of our total revenue in q three representing an increase in dollars of 26 from q two 2020 and a decrease of 27 from q three 2019 revenue from our identity products which includes sales of access credentials smart card readers rfid transponders and mobile security products total 15400000 or 62 of our total revenue in q three 2020 an increase the dollars of 33 from q two 2020 and an increase at 53 from q three 2019 our non gaap gross profit was 41 in the 3rd quarter of 2020 this compares with 42 in q two 2020 and 47 in q three 2019 driven by both the mix of product across segments and within segments our premises segment margins were 55 relatively flat compared to q two 2020 and q three 2019 at 55 and 56 respectively our identity segment margins were thirty relatively flat compared to q two 2020 at 31 and lower than q three 2019 at 33 due to a higher proportion of lower margin transponder sales now moving to our operating expense management our gaap operating expenses for the 3rd quarter were 8900000 which was down from 10000000 in q two 2020 and down year over year from 9300000 in q three 2019 the sequential decrease was primarily due to the non recurring 1200000 restructurings in q two 2020 our non gaap operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to thirty in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with forty in the 2nd quarter of 2020 and 34 in the 3rd quarter of 2019 our non gaap operating expenses totaled 7500000 in the 3rd quarter of 2020 this compares to 7600000 in q two 2020 and 7900000 in q three of 2019 bringing all the pieces back together our non gaap adjusted ebitda was 2800000 in the 3rd quarter of 2020 a sequential increase of 2300000 over q two 2020 turning to the balance sheet we will be comparing our position of september 2020 to the position one quarter ago of june 2020 and the prior year quarter ended september 2019 we exited the 3rd quarter with cash at 12300000 and net decrease of 800000 from q two 2020 and a 1200000 increase from q three 2019 net cash activity for the quarter was driven by 2200000 of cash provided by our net income excluding non cash items 3600000 of cash use for working capital and cap ex driven primarily by late q three billings that were not collectible within the quarter and by an increase in working capital to support our singapore growth under financing and foreign currency we had a 600000 net cash provided driven by a 900000 increase in net borrowings under our revolver and a 500000 reduction through scheduled payments on the term loan facility we believe that we have adequate capital available to fund our business growth and returned to positive non gaap free cash flow exiting q four 2020 as well as retiring the term and note that on schedule in q one 2021 in our ten q filings we will be providi providing a full reconciliation of the year to date cash flows for completeness we have included the full balance sheet for the earnings release in the appendix even with the global disruption continuing today we are confirming our guidance for the consolidated results of the company for full year 2020 at revenue between 86 and 88000000 within our original guidance entering this year we achieved gaap eps profitability in q three 2020 ahead of expectations and continues to see the benefits of our actions to optimize costs carry forward in addition we believe we will be non gaap free cash flow positive as committed during q four 2020 and beyond in addition today we are providing guidance for the full year 2021 building on the strong base of growth that we have delivered our full year 2021 guidance is for revenue between 96 and 102000000 which reflects growth year over year from the midpoint of our 2020 guidance exceeding the market growth by a factor of two we expect our normal seasonality to continue with our lowest quarter in q one 2021 and building up quarter over quarter through the end of 2021 we will be issuing a full set of guidance at our q four and full year 2020 earnings release targeted for march 2021 with that i will conclude the financial discussion and pass it back to steve thanks sandra as i said earlier our rfid growth is predictable for two reasons it is heavily backlog driven and it is driven by major companies who have incorporated our rfid devices into their products so any for global products is a year long process so even now we are getting visibility into plans throughout 20211st backlog going into the 4th quarter our total backlogs stood at 10500000 up 68 for last year and our rfid backlog for shipment in the 4th quarter is up 125 over the last year we have now gotten in orders for about many five of our expected shipments for the quarter in our rfid and that means most additional orders either contribute to upside within the quarter or drive more backlog for 2021 this is a key driver of our growth for 2021 and we expect the rfid portion of our business to grow well over fifty in the 1st half of 2021 versus the 1st half of 2020 for the full year growth in the mid twenty range for 2021 and now the core driver of our rfid business is the mass market adoption of rfid integrated products our customers are leaders in their own industries incorporating rfid devices into their products each with volumes of 10s or 100s of 1000000s of units so this is a huge market that is just beginning to grow in the 3rd quarter two strong use cases were launched in the market one by cvs and the other of course by apple now we do not generally disclose customers so these are just industry examples to be clear but both are great examples of the rfid market accelerating they are both basic uses that established platforms to then drive multiple products from already big 1st launches so 1st some of you saw in the demo session we had a couple of weeks back cvs has spoken rx for visually impaired people you tap your phone to the rfid tag on the prescription bottle and it reads up medication with dosage and all the other information for people who can not read the label now that thirteen of prescriptions go to people with some visual impairment and there are about 4500000000 prescriptions annually so in the us alone that is over half a 1000000000 rfid tag every year just for the visually impaired sector now that is the current use case and the 1st use case so so now extrapolate with the platform deployed every cvs pharmacy now is set up to program and put rfid tags on every prescription and that is really where they should be on everyone so when you open your prescription bottle you tap each time you take it you will know if you have taken it morning or evening or whatever the prescription regimen is it will auto refill as you get low there is all kinds of capabilities you can do there you can even opt in and your doctor could get information about how consistently you are taking your meds because anyone who studies this area knows that that the the biggest issue with the prescription pharmaceuticals is people complying with taking their meds so there is a number of things that companies like cvs are thinking about now that they have made that initial investment they can really expand in the into other categories so ultimately we think the opportunity is for all 4500000000 of the prescriptions the in the us annually and the us is about a quarter of the world prescriptions so again you can see to the visually impaired application that is a couple of 1000000000 units worldwide and nearly 20000000000 units for all prescriptions worldwide now of course it is going to take time but you can see the volume of potential and again the investment is really now done and of course the reader in the app technology is already in everybody is pockets in their phones now related to the mobile space and the phones the biggest events of course with apple is launched a full nfc support in ios fourteen and the iphone twelve and especially the new ecosystem of products around so apple is made it very easy and secure to connect to the iphone and then through nfc to connect them into core iphone features so just as a couple of examples the 1st apple branded cases for example you buy an orange case you pop it on your phone the the the screen turns orange it goes through an animation you know you have connected it and you know it is an apple verified phone it it seems pretty trivial but what it is showing is that peripherals are actually communicating securely with the phone launching processes in the phone and all secured and controlled by apple through a secure nfc lane so this enables a whole world of new peripherals to connect to the phone and seamlessly but securely launch apps and experiences so this is really the vision for this type of connected device that that that apple is deploying and with over 200000000 iphones shipped a year connecting multiple magsafe enabled devices each again you can see the market in the 1000000000 units plus range annually and additionally of course where apple and cvs go samsung walgreens amazon pharmacy and others have to match so you can see the scale of the markets we are going after and the volumes that already are happening so rfid is gaining traction right now we have been the trusted co developer and supplier for some of the most advanced applications and the most demanding companies this is where the growth is and it is where our competitive advantage is strongest so how are we going to keep our advantage we are expanding our technical capabilities and for 2021 we are launching services to help companies put rfid into their products now we are unique in our ability to go from concept to optimize design to early productions to scaling production and then to immediately start back into the next generation of devices and this is exactly the cycle these customers need we are also innovating with new products answering needs we know from our own customers an example is a new product we have launched when we think of the industry is lowest carbon footprint rfid tag or eco tag instead of being an antenna on a plastic substrate we have developed a unique laser cutting process and is on recyclable paper substrate we even use recycled aluminum for the antenna so there is no acting chemicals no loss metal no plastic layers no chemical runoff now why do we do all this well the biggest users of high end rfid are consumer facing companies and sustainability matters to them companies like amazon and apple that they public commitment to being carbon neutral and rfid tags are consumer visible devices so our eco tag shows their eco commitment and eliminates what otherwise would be a negative on their carbon footprint now our customers told us this is what they want it is very tricky technology but we developed it and fundamentally this is exactly why we are going to keep our lead in the fast growing rfid market so that is rfid now let us look at premises which has some similarly exciting opportunities and remember the core technology in our rfid tag is shared with our access cards door readers identity readers and other parts of our physical and data security solutions so one growth driver really supports the other so with the premises industry overall growing about six we grew 26 sequentially and we are expecting premises to grow about 25 year over year this quarter for 2021 we expect growth in the mid teens more than double the industry rate now the fundamental drivers are recurring revenue growth the shift to it driven buyers and federal grip so why would we be growing faster than the market with these dynamics just like in our rfid we are both the trusted provider and we have got some of the most advanced technology and broadest product range as customers move to software defined platforms they need to migrate their entire platform across reader is credentials controllers access video and audio and it is all got to be integrated with their active directory or other sensitive data repositories now we are the only company that delivers all of this and we think total solutions and it centric recurring revenue platforms will be the fastest group sector in physical security and the strategic position of combined access video and audio management is the key for anyone trying to win our great example of this is our freedom cloud platform that we just launched this week it is the lightest weight implementation in in the industry totally web and mobile based and especially on the hardware side our freedom bridges are extremely compact and cost effective iot devices a bridge that can contro can control two doors is the size of a pack of playing cards and this is what customers are looking for hardly noticeable really intuitive to deploy and manage and a platform that the it department is totally comfortable owning and managing the software is browser based and the hardware is managed just like a network switch so we have described the growth in each segment so put it together in the 4th quarter we are expecting overall revenues to grow in the 25 to thirty year over year range so looking at the business drivers for next year we have rfid use cases that each can be 100s of 1000000s of units over time and give us clear line of sight into 2021 there is strong federal government demand for our physical security identity readers and mobility apps and our complete range of recurring revenue product is now in place with all these growth drivers we could see faster growth in any given quarter but to keep our predictability we have given a strong base growth outlook and we will update as we get further into the markets take off so 2020 has been a challenging year but we are in markets that are taking off and we have been able to strengthen our leadership even if they are accelerating the result is we are looking forward to a strong finish to the year and an exciting 2021 so with that let me open the discussion to questions operator ladies and thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now take questions if you do have a question please press star one on your telephone keypad at this time if you are using a speaker phone we ask that while posing your question you pick up your handset to provide the best sound quality again ladies and gentlemen if you do have a question or comment please press star one on your telephone keypad at this time we will take our 1st question from jason smith with lake street capital markets please go ahead hey guys thanks for taking my questions steve i appreciate all the color and sort of why you are feeling so confident in 2021 but curious if you could talk about sorry the backlog coverage to 2021 and i i if some of this confidence is really just driven by some sizable orders already in hand or if it is just general confidence especially on the rfid side that you are just seeing going to see this big general adoption yeah thanks for the question jason and yes backlog has been growing nicely i think we earlier indicated that at the time that it was up it was doubled from what it had been just a couple of months earlier and i mentioned that we have already got over 95 of our q four shipment that is already covering backlogs so all the orders coming in are 2021 orders and yet we actually have orders that go throughout all of 2021 so we have got good visibility both front end end and you know as i said we expected the 1st half of the year already to be fifty growth over representative over the year prior and obviously we we would not be saying that clear numbers we did not have fair amount of visibility in it and that is really driven by by our backlog okay that is helpful and in your prepared remarks you noted about $1000000 in business not being able to shift in q three could you just comment on what sort of constraints you are seeing there and if those con constraints have eased now in q four yeah also than thanks for picking up on that one yes as i mentioned in the 2nd quarter call we have been expanding our capacity rapidly but when you you know when you look at doubling your capacity and then we talked about in q four we have got to be a a backlog day you know 125 but the year prior that that is indicating you know more than double where we were years a year ago we are building out space and we are putting in more equipment and the some of the devices that we are producing are particularly complicated and high end which is great for us because it is it is more differentiated but they take more machine capacity because there is multiple processes multiple passes versus some of the more straightforward products and that that of those of course the more complicated products often go to the the more sensitive and the high end customers so we always want to favor those and so we did have some that we could not ship we are catching up in this quarter and it will have the capacity built out by the end of this quarter again when you talk about building capacity you are talking you know 100 150 grand in in facilities you know build out and and few $100000 in equipment it is not a major capital absorption but we have been catching up through the 3rd quarter and we will be all caught up in a good shape going into 2021 okay and then just the last one and i will jump back into queue i mean obviously the school and education market could be a little challenging with budgetary pressures and whatnot but just curious if you could comment on what your expectations in that market are going forward if it is sharpy as you say but it is also you know highly motivated for security we you know we we put out a white paper on remote school in cyber security for example with our fido keys that we just launched you know one of the dirty secrets that a lot of people have not you know focused on is we have taken all the kids in our country and and and put them online to to go to school and if anyone thinks that we have actually properly secured their their data pipes for their learning they are they are they are being a little optimistic and so there is opportunities there for example to cyber secure more of the the distance learning environment and there is also as we go back to school physical security is as important as ever and especially physical security infrastructure is now being integrated well with with the types of safety infrastructure so there is opportunities there we are seeing a lot of you know interest in kids but also you know schools are in financial you know challenges and so some of them are going ahead you know fast and some of them are really frankly hunkered down so i do not know on a month by month basis how it is going to emerge but from a market opportunity you know over the course of the next year i actually think schools and universities are going to be a very good segment for us both on the cybersecurity side and on the health and safety physical security side okay that is really helpful thanks a lot as a reminder ladies and gentlemen if you do have a question or comment please press star one on your telephone keypad at this time we will take our next question from mike with northland capital markets please go ahead great thanks yeah great quarter there steve i could not tell did did you give some guidance on what you thought premises would grow in the 4th quarter i could not tell if you you you said that or not specifically for premises in the 4th quarter i do not know that we we i have got to go back and and look at that okay i know that no we did we did i am sorry i am looking at the my notes here and you said about 25 year over year for for the 4th quarter all right so that that is like up sequentially and is that is that driven by non government or is that government driving that sequential pattern then yeah good question it is it is across the board i and and i yeah you you just push government and non government that is on the growth does think about underneath the numbers it is it is probably more commercial than government in terms of increases sequentially okay okay we have see we have seen a a rebound in activity in on the premises side you know you can only deploy these things so long and and not a lot of the installers and now these are are getting out there getting back in line and also customers you know things like videos systems where microsoft stopped supporting you know windows seven or something they they have to do something so there is that there is a built in you know migration a good pattern that we are starting to see come back yep yep okay got it and then on the identity just it seems like a a a ton of opportunity there i guess ho how diverse is do you see that revenue stream being in terms of you know customer base over the next year is it going to be you know very diverse or is it going to be a couple big customers really driving the growth are you asking primarily about rfid and identity yes yes so actually i think it is going to be quite diverse certainly when some of these global corporations you know launch their numbers are big but there is there is several of them that are you know either are already launching or in pilots and building in the launch for 2021 and you might have noticed we did not have any you know ten presentation customers you know just closed so it certainly some some gorillas but but a range of them and int other interesting thing is a range of applications that are not just in one vertical either there is there is several different use cases that are that are getting momentum yeah okay and then you have a number of cloud offerings now you know i i i am sure you are going to be promoting that even more aggressively next year i mean w what would be and and you know when you when you book a cloud deal it does not always show up within the quarter a year obviously but like what what would be sort of a good amount of cloud booking as for next year if you are successful is it you know $1000000 or is it 5000000 like like wh like what would be a successful cloud booking year well i think we are we are just you know learning what the profile looks like but i think you know that that six years $650000 you know right installation that we did is is on the high end but it is characteristic of how these things work so if you mean how much we recognized within the year you know probably a you know couple of few $1000000 incremental to the to the six to eight we are already at but that would represent the scores five to six times as much in terms of you know book business yeah i guess that that is more what i was referring to okay great yeah okay good excellent excellent at this time this concludes our company is question and answer sessions if your question was not taken you may contact identiv in the relations team at inve gatewayir com i would now like to turn the call back over to mister humphreys for his closing remarks all right and and and operator just want to confirm we do not have any other questions in there that is right no further questions in the queue at this time terrific all right thank you very much well

does conclude today is teleconference we thank you again for your participation you may disconnect your lines at this time have a great day",

i assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements which speak as of today i will now turn the call over to ceo steve humphries for his comments sir please proceed overall revenues grew thirty sequentially to 24900000 showing strength across the business so this has us lined up for a strong 4th quarter and the 2nd half of the year that will be more than thirty higher than our 1st half we are seeing business momentum continue backlog building and the pipeline for 2021 becoming stronger but before we talk too much about the future let us review the operational and financial results from the 3rd quarter now our key focus areas of rfid and our federal business were particularly strong within our identity business which is predominantly rfid revenue increased sequentially by 33 to 15400000 and year over year identity grew by over a 100 53 from 10100000 in 203219 to 15400000 in 2032 there was nearly a $1000000 shipment we did not fulfill we balanced customer requirements to make sure the most critical deliveries were covered now the business implication is that the industry launches we expect it are well underway the mass market adoption of rfid integrated products is happening our major customers are incorporated rfid devices into healthcare products mobility consumer products appliances libraries pharmaceuticals and app enabling the physical world it is that each of these are 100000000 or 1000000000 plus unit applications it is a huge market that is just beginning to grow the overall trend clearly showed in our 3rd quarter results as well as in the continuing backlog strength where we went into the 4th quarter with backlog for 4th quarter shipments up 68 over last year and i will talk about the implications going forward of all these trends later on the call also within identity in the 3rd quarter our identity readers grew strongly now we all expected the work from home trend to plateau after the initial lockdowns in the spring but this really shows that demand is continuing the 3rd quarter is always strong for smart drug readers because of the federal year end so the growth comes over a normally strong year prior period the reason is that the federal government and especially the dod are adopting policies supporting work from home and work mobile for the long term so we do expect these trends to sustain for example in financial services we quoted our 1st large acquisition the acquisition of mbna now i would like to say that we have had continuing strong business growth we have been able to secure a six year $650000 agreement with a leading bank adopting our platform across almost a 100 branches the six year $650000 agreement provides video surveillance analytics and case management on a subscription basis saving 10s of 1000s of dollars in capital expense for our customer and assuring a predictable revenue stream of over $100000 annually for our business now to be clear we have had continuing strong business growth but in our industry some small dealers and small businesses are under pressure as are our competitors who focus there now since federal state and local government customers are more than two thirds of the business for our physical access platforms we are seeing strong performance in premises and our quick pivot to recurring revenues with lower cost of entry has put us in a strong position overall these include our velocity series product mobilize id three vr prime our freedom cloud and freedom mobile which we just launched this week all of these are recurring revenue products all launched in the last twelve months and as we talked about in the 2nd quarter the broad adoption of rfid and our major customer core products is what really gives us reason to believe this growth is a long term trend that we are just starting to see take off it is building backlog for the 4th quarter and for 2021 so overall the 3rd quarter was highlighted by thirty sequential revenue growth over a 100 year over year rfid growth and ninety sequential growth in federal sales 38 year over year identity of revenue growth and q four backlog up 68 from last year so certainly there are challenges in the economic environment we are all in but the strong secular growth we are experiencing in rfsid our strength in federal work from home going to do a 2nd wave of demand and the products we have launched in the 3rd quarter to take advantage of return to work needs and built the base for a strong 4th quarter and 2021 so let me turn it over to standaert to go through the 3rd quarter financial results afterwards i will go into more metrics and the industry wide trends that are really accelerating our business into the 4th quarter and into 2021 standaert as steve mentioned our results show the continued delivery of what we committed with a solid trajectory for 2021 please note that these results are all within the preliminary results announced october 29th prior to market open the 1st metric is revenue growth our revenue grew seventeen year over year the 2nd metric is operating income growth our operating income grew fourteen year over year the 3rd metric is free cash flow growth our free cash flow grew 23 year over year the 4th metric is backlog growth our backlog grew 27 year over year the 5th metric is gross margin expansion our gross margin expanded 200 basis points year over year the 6th metric is operating margin expansion our operating margin expanded 160 basis points year over year the 7th metric is net income growth our net income grew 22 year over year the 8th metric is earnings per share growth our earnings per share grew 24 year over year the ninth metric is return on equity our return on equity was sixteen even with the continued impact of covid nineteen we closed out the 3rd quarter of 2020 with 24900000 in total revenue up thirty compared to the 2nd quarter of 2020 and up eight compared to the 3rd quarter of 2019 our recurring revenue accounted for six of our 3rd quarter revenue and eight of our total revenue in the 1st nine months of 2020 this part of our business remains steady at eight for the trailing twelve month period our non gap adjusted gross profit margins were forty and 41 respectively for the trailing twelve month period our non gap adjusted ev ebitda margin was +eleven with a +four for the trailing twelve month period our gap net income for the 3rd quarter was $22000000 net income was 400000 compared with a loss of 2700000 in q 220 and net income of 1100000 in q 32019 with the dividends on the series b preferred are gap net income attributable to stockholders was 100000 or net income of one per share compared with a loss of ¢seventeen per share in q 220 and ¢five per share on our next slide for further analyzing trends by segment our premises segment which includes sales of physical access control and video products video products and services accounted for 9400000 or 38 of our total revenue in q three an increase in dollars of 26 from q 22020 and a decrease of 27 from q 32019 revenue from our identity products which includes sales of access credentials smart card readers rfid transponders and mobile security products total 15400000 or 62 of our total revenue in q 32020 an increase of dollars of 33 from q two our non gap gross profit was 41 in the 3rd quarter of 2020 this compares with 42 in q 22020 and 47 in q 3202019 driven by both the mix of products across segments and within segments our premises segment margins were 55 relatively flat compared to q two q 220 and q 32019 at 55 and 56 respectively our identity segment margins were thirty relatively flat compared to q 22020 at 31 and lower than q 32019 at 33 due to a higher proportion of lower margin transponder sales now moving to our operating expense management our gap operating expenses for the 3rd quarter or 8900000 which was down from 10000000 in q 220 and down year over year from 9300000 in q 32019 the sequential decrease was primarily due to the non recurring 1200000 restructuring expense in q 220 our non gap operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to thirty in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with forty in the 2nd quarter our non gap operating expenses totalled 7500000 in the 3rd quarter of 2020 this compares to 7600000 in q 22020 and 7900000 in q three of 2019 bringing all the pieces back together our non gap adjusted ebitda was 2800000 in the 3rd quarter of 2020 turning to the balance sheet we will be comparing our position at september 2020 to the position one quarter ago at june 2020 and the prior year quarter ended september 2019 we exited the 3rd quarter with cash at 12300000 a net decrease of 800000 from q 22020 and a 1200000 increase from q three net cash activity for the quarter was driven by 2200000 of cash provided by our net income excluding non cash items 3600000 of cash used for working capital and capex driven primarily by late q three billings that were not collectible within the quarter and by an increase in working capital to support our singapore growth under financing and foreign currency we had a 600000 net cash provided we believe that we have adequate capital available to fund our business growth and return to positive non gap free cash flow exiting q 4220 as well as retiring the term and note debt on schedule in q 1221 in our ten q filings we will be providing providing a full reconciliation of our balance sheet consolidation of the unit date cash flows for completeness we have included the full balance sheet for the earnings release in the appendix even with the global disruption continuing today we are confirming our guidance for the consolidated results of the company for full year 2020 at revenue between 86 and 88000000 within our original guidance entering this year we achieved gap eps profitability in q 32020 ahead of expectations and continues to see the benefits of our actions to optimize costs to carry forward in addition we believe we will be non gap free cash flow positive as committed during q 420 and beyond in addition today we are providing guidance for the full year 2221 building on the strong basis of growth that we have delivered our full year 2221 guidance is for revenue between 96 and 102000000 which reflects growth year over year from the mid teens to the mid 20s we expect our normal seasonality to continue with our lowest quarter in q one 2020 and building up quarter over quarter through the end of 2021 we will be issuing a full set of guidance at our q four 2020 earnings release targeted for march 22nd 2021 with that i will conclude the financial discussion and pass it back to steve as i said earlier our r d growth is predictable for two reasons it is heavily backlog driven and it is driven by major companies who have incorporated our r d devices into their products planning for global products is a year long process so even now we are getting visibility into plans throughout 20211st backlog going into the 4th quarter our total backlog stood at 10500000 up 68 from last year and our r d backlog stood at 1600000 up forty from last year the 4th quarter is up 125 over last year we have now gotten in orders for about 75 of our expected shipments for the quarter in rfid and that means most additional orders either contribute to the upside within the quarter or drive more backlog for 2021 this is the key driver of our growth for 2021 and we expect the rfid portion of our business to grow well over fifty in the 1st half of 2021 versus the 1st half of 2020 we have a full year growth in the mid twenty range for 2021 the core driver of our rfid business is the mass market adoption of rfid integrated products our customers are leaders in their own industries incorporating rfid devices into their products each with volumes of 10s or 100s of 1000000s of units so this is a huge market that is just beginning to grow in the 3rd quarter two strong use cases were launched in the market one by cvbs and the other of course by apple now we do not generally disclose customers so these are just industry examples to be clear but both are great examples of the rfid market accelerating they are both basic uses that establish platforms to then drive multiple products from already big 1st launches so the 1st some of you saw in the demo session we had a couple of weeks back cbs is spoken rfid for visually impaired people you tap your phone to the rfid tag on the prescription bottle and it reads up the medication with dosage and all the other information so that is one example now about thirteen of prescriptions go to people with some visual impairment and there are about 4500000000 prescriptions annually so in the us alone that is over half a 1000000000 rfi details every year just for the visually impaired sector now that is the current use case and the 1st use case so so now extrapolate with the platform deployed every cbs pharmacy now is set up to program and put rfi details on every prescription and that is really where they are everyone so when you open your prescription bottle you tap each time you take it you will know if you have taken it morning or evening or whatever the prescription regimen is it will auto refill as you get low there is all kinds of capability you can do there you can even opt in and your doctor could get information about how consistently you are taking your meds because anyone who studies this area knows that that the biggest issue with the prescription pharmaceuticals is people complying with taking their meds so there is a number of things that companies like cbs are thinking about now that they have made that additional investment they can really expand into into other categories so ultimately we think the opportunity is for all 4500000000 of the prescriptions in the u s annually and the u s is about a quarter of the world prescriptions so again you can see to the visually impaired application it is a couple of 1000000000 units worldwide and nearly 20000000000 units for all prescriptions worldwide now of course it is going to take time but you can see the volume of potential and again the investments really now done and the government is stepping up the reader in the app technology is already in everybody is pockets in their phones now related to the mobile space in the phones the biggest event of course was apple is launch of full nfc support in ios fourteen and the iphone twelve and especially the new ecosystem of products around magsafe so apple made it very easy and secure to connect peripherals to the iphone and then through nfc to connect them into core iphone features so just as a couple of examples the 1st one is the ability to use the iphone as a secure digital wallet apple branded cases for example you buy an orange case you pop it on your phone but the screen turns orange it goes through an animation you know you have connected it and you know it is an apple verified phone it seems pretty trivial but what it is showing is the peripherals are actually communicating securely with the phone launching processes in the phone and all secured and controlled by apple through a secure nfc link and this enables a whole world of new peripherals to connect to the phone and seamlessly securely launch apps and experiences so this is really the vision for this type of connected device that that that apple s deploying and with over 200000000 iphones shipped in a year connecting multiple mag safe enabled devices each again you can see the market in the 1000000000s of units plus range annually and additionally of course where apple and cbs go samsung walgreens amazon pharmacy and others have to match so you can see the scale of the markets we re going after and the volumes that already are happening so rfiid is gaining traction right now we have been the trusted co developer and supplier for some of the most advanced applications and the most demanding companies this is where the growth is and it is where our competitive advantage is strongest so how are we going to keep our advantage we are expanding our technical capabilities and for 2021 we are launching services to help companies put rfiid into their products now we are unique in our ability to go from concept to optimized design to early production so let us continue to innovate and drive growth together we are scaling production and then immediately starting back into the next generation of devices and this is exactly the cycle that the customer needs we are also innovating with new products answering needs we know from our own customers now an example is the new product we have launched what we think is the industry is lowest carbon footprint rfid tag our ecotag instead of being an etched antenna on a plastic substrate we developed a unique laser cutting process and it is on recyclable we even use recycled aluminum for the antenna so there is no etching chemicals no lost metal no plastic layers no chemical runoff now why do we do all this well the biggest users of high end rfid are consumer facing companies and sustainability matters to them companies like amazon and apple have a public commitment to being carbon neutral and rfid tags are consumer visible devices so our eco tag shows their eco commitment our customers told us this is what they want it is very tricky technology but we developed it and fundamentally this is exactly why we are going to keep our lead in the fast growing rfid market so that is rfid now let us look at premises which has some similarly exciting opportunities and remember the core technology in our rfid tag is shared with our access cards door readers identity readers and other parts of our physical and data systems so one growth driver really supports the other so with the premises industry overall going about six we grew 26 sequentially and we are expecting premises to grow about 25 year over year this quarter for 2021 we expect growth in the mid teens more than double the industry rate now the fundamental drivers are recurring revenue growth the shift to it driven buyers and federal growth so why is this important as customers move to software defined platforms they need to migrate their entire platform across readers credentials controllers access video and audio and it is all got to be integrated with their active directory or other sensitive data repositories now we are the only company that delivers all of this and we think total solutions our next speaker is doctor john palfrey co founder and ceo of the cloud security company cloudpassage doctor palfrey thank you for joining us today you are going to talk about the future of revenue platforms in the physical security industry and the strategic position of combined access video and audio management what would you like to say doctor palfrey the growth that can control two doors is the size of a pack of playing cards and this is what customers are looking for hardly noticeable really intuitive to deploy and manage and a platform that the it department is totally comfortable owning and managing the software is browser based and the hardware is managed just like a network switch so we have described the growth in each segment so to put it together in the 4th quarter we are expecting overall revenues to grow in the 25 to thirty year over year range so looking at the business drivers for next year we have rfid use cases that each can be 100s of 1000000s of units over time and give us a clear line of sight into 2021 there is strong federal government demand for our physical security identity readers and mobility apps and our complete range recurring revenue products is now in place now with all these growth drivers we could see faster growth in any given quarter but to keep our predictability we have given a strong federal government demand we have given a strong

further into the markets takeoff the 2020 has been a challenging year but we are in markets that are taking off and we have been able to strengthen our leadership even as they are accelerating the result is we are looking forward to a strong finish to the year and an exciting 2021 so with that let me open the discussion to questions operator ladies and gentlemen we will now take questions if you do have a question please press star one hello everyone please press star one on your telephone keypad at this time if you are using a speakerphone we ask that while posing your question you pick up your handset to provide the best sound quality again ladies and gentlemen if you do have a question or comment please press star one on your telephone keypad at this time we will take our 1st question from jason smith with lake street capital markets please go ahead confident in 2020 but curious if you could talk about sorry the backlog coverage to 2021 and if some of this confidence is really just driven by some sizable orders already in hand or if it is just general confidence especially on the rfid side that you are just seeing going to see this big general adoption and we have already got over 95 of our 24 shipments already covered in backlog so all the orders coming in are 2021 orders and we actually have orders that go throughout all of 2021 so we have got good visibility both front ended and as they said we expected the 1st half of the year already the the fifty growth ok that is helpful and in your prepared remarks you noted about a $1000000 in business not being able to shift into q four could you just comment on what sort of constraints you are seeing there and if those constraints have been eased now in q four yeah also thanks thanks for picking up on that one yeah as as i mentioned in the 2nd quarter call we have been expanding our capacity rapidly but when you yeah when you look at doubling your capacity and then we talked about in q four we have got to get backlogged yeah 125 of that the year prior that that is indicating you know more than double where we were years ago we are building out space and we are putting in more equipment and some of the devices that we are producing are particularly complicated and high end which is great for us because it is  it is more differentiated but they take more machine capacity because there is multiple processes and multiple passes versus some of the more straightforward products and that  those of course the more complicated products often go to the the more sensitive and high end customers so we always want to favor those and so we did we have been catching up through the 3rd quarter and we will be all caught up in a good shape going into the 4th quarter okay and then just the last one and i will jump back into queue i mean obviously the school and education market could be a little challenging with budgetary pressures and whatnot but just curious if you could comment on what your expectations in that market are going forward remote school in cybersecurity for example with our fido keys that we just launched you know one of the dirty secrets that a lot of people have not you know focused on is we have taken all the kids in our country and and and put them online to to go to school and if anyone thinks that we have actually properly secured their their data types for their learning there they are they are being a little optimistic and so there is opportunities there for example to cyber secure more of the the and this learning environment and there is also as we go back to school physical security is as important as ever and especially physical security infrastructure is now being integrated with with health and safety infrastructure so there is opportunities there we are seeing a lot of you know interest and bids but also you know schools are in financial yeah challenges and so some of them are going ahead yeah fast and some of them are really frankly hunted down so i do not know on a i think we will do a monthly by month basis how it is going to emerge but from a market opportunity you know over the course of the next year i actually think schools and universities are going to be a very good segment for us both on the cybersecurity side and on the health and safety physical security side hi this is mike lattamore with northern capital markets please go ahead thanks a lot yeah great quarter there steve i could not tell if you gave some guidance on what you thought premises would grow in the 4th quarter i could not tell if you said that or not i specifically for premises in the 4th quarter i do not know that we have got to go back in there and look at that zero you know give it a look yeah we will get to it sorry i am looking at my notes here what we said about 25 year over year for for the port board so that is that is like up sequentially and is that is that driven by non government or is that government driving that sequential pattern yeah good question it is it is across the board and and yeah you just separate governments and non government that is on the growth as they think about underneath the numbers it is  it is probably more we have seen  a  rebound in activity on the the premises side you know you can only defer these things so long and and now a lot of the installers and others are are getting out there getting back in line also customers you know things like videos systems where microsoft stops supporting you know windows seven so they have to do something so there is a built in you know migration and growth pattern that we are starting to see come back yeah yeah i got it and then on the identity just it seems like a ton of opportunity there i guess how diverse do you see that revenue stream being in terms of you know customer base over the next year is it going to be you know very diverse or is it going to be a couple big customers really big customers driving the growth are you asking primarily about rfid and identity yes yes but so actually i think it is going to be quite diverse certainly when some of these yeah global corporations you know launch their numbers are big but there is there is several of them that are you know either already launching or in pilot and building in the launch for 2021 and you might have noticed we did not have any you know ten concentration we have certainly disclosed to customers that you know this is going to close so but certainly some  some guerrillas but but a range of them and the other interesting thing is a range of applications that are not just in one vertical either there is  there is several different use cases that are  that are getting momentum what would be sort of a good amount of cloud bookings for next year if you are successful is it you know a $1000000 is it 5000000 like like what like what would be successful cloud bookings for next year bank is installation that we did is is on the high end but it is characteristics of how those things work so if you mean how much we recognize within the year you know probably a couple of a few $1000000 incremental to the to the 68 we are already at but that would represent of course five to six times that much in terms of you know book business make fun at this time this concludes our company is question and answer session if your question was not taken you may contact identiv in detvecher relations team at i n v e at gatewayi r dot com i would now like to turn the call back over to mister humphries for his closing remarks thank you very much well thank you all for joining us very much appreciate it also please join us at some of the virtual investor events coming up this quarter we have got imperial capital the 1st week in december and northland the week after that so look forward to continuing to update you on the business and until then best wishes be well and be safe and have a good evening thank you ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today is teleconference we thank you again for your participation disconnect your lines at this time have a great day",

reminder today is conference is being recorded and now i would like to introduce you to your host for today is conference alexander he is head of relations at the firm so please go ahead thank you charlotte i would like to welcome and thank you all for joining us today for affimed 2nd quarter 2020 financial results and operation progress conference call before we begin i would like to encourage everyone to go to the investor relation section of affimed is website to find the earnings and related financial tables we also posted slides on our website that follow our discussion today on the call today we are joined by doctors adi hoess our chief executive officer andreas harstrick chief medical officer arndt schottelius chief scientific officer and angus smith our new chief financial

that i will turn the call over to adi adi thank you alex good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our 2nd quarter business update call today we have some updates to share with you on our operational progress as well as on our financial results while we are still in the middle of a serious global health pandemic and a chal challenging economic downturn at affimed we are quite confident that the steps we are taking in advancing our science and moving our pipeline forward that are beginning to yield data that demonstrate the longterm potentially of our innovative approaches and products covid nineteen quarantine used to affect societies around the world and we hope that your and your families are well and safe we are observing some impact by covid nineteen on the progress of our clinical studies however time we are taking great efforts to minimize them as a result we have been able to continue our progress on the clinical studies of afm thirteen in peripheral t cell lymphoma and of afm 24 in egfr positive tumors and which is very exciting for us genentech roche the 1st patent with ro 729708 which is if you remember is the bcma engager we are also making good progress in our pre clinical pipeline for our lead candidate afm thirteen our studying patients who have relapsed or refractory peripheral t cell lymphoma and exhausted available standard of care treatments are now being treated with afm thirteen as a singular agent we are executing according to our development timelines and as previously stated expect to complete the predetermined interim analysis in mid 2021 we are also looking at options to enhance afm thirteen is efficacy beyond monotherapy the 1st of these options is the combination with with our genetic nk cells in a study and is conducted at the md anderson cancer institute and on ist and the anderson website now shows that the study is enrolling but initiation is impacted by the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic in texas our 1st patient in the study is expected as soon as this situation improves for afm 24 we disclosed that we have completed the 1st cohort of our dose escalation study without any dose limiting toxicity and we are currently recruiting into a 2nd dose cohort we have also planned for its active recruiting following the completion of the does escalation phase of the study we have the option to enroll patients into tumor specific expansion cohorts where we will look for single agent activity in a number of well defined tumor types in addition we are planning to initiate combination studies with checkpoint inhibitors and we will be providing updates as the program continues to make progress we are very pleased with the continued progress in our collaboration with genentech importantly the phase one clinical study with the bcma cd sixteen a as an engager is now enrolling patients this achievement represents the 3rd innate cell engager to enter the clinic and a milestone payment to us during the 3rd quarter in an amount that we are not able to disclose last month angus smith joined us as chief financial officer angus will introduce himself later and discuss our financial position and the flexibility to provide us to continue to execute on our strategy and drive future growth of our company during the annual january meeting of shareholders which was held on august 4th we are happy to report that all proposed agenda items were approved this includes the addition of doctor annalisa jenkins and harry welten to the supervisory board as new members annalisa is a visionary leader who knows how to translate science from bench to bedside and harry is an accomplished financial executive who will help drive value creating strategies for the company these additions to the supervisory board further strengthen the company is industry knowhow experience and diversity as it is as it has only been a month and a half since we last spoke to you we thought we would focus today is discussion on company achievements thus far and with business confidence in our science update you on our programs and then have plenty of time for q and a to get started i will now hand over the call to andreas harstrick our chief medical officer to give you a brief update on our clinical stage programs andreas yeah thank you adi for the introduction and thank you all for joining us today and i am happy to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs that we made over the over the last three months as you are all aware covid nineteen pandemic is still present globally and it continues to pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment of patients the two guiding principles we are employing at affimed is to ensure patient safety on the studies and to ensure trial data integrity and this is in line i think with guidance given from all competent authorities within this framework however the affimed team is very proactively working with all of our participating sites to make sure that our innovative treatment is still available for patients in need of new therapeutics and that we minimize the impact of covid nineteen to a minimum possible one important achievement in this regard is that we were able to secure drug supply for all of our ongoing studies and can ensure uninterrupted treatment of all patients to go into more detail lets start with afm thirteen our most advanced program 1st as you know afm thirteen is in registration directed phase two study afm thirteen 202 treating patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral t cell lymphomas who have exhausted all available standard of care options the enrollment into the study is at a steady state we were able to activate 54 sites now contributing patients in ten countries around the globe as you know this is the study has two stage design with a pre planned interim analysis after forty patients in the ptcl cohorts and as adi said we are confident that we will have the data from this interim analysis available by the mid of next year there was also a 3rd cohort or there is a 3rd cohort in this study for patients with transformed mycosis fungoides so a cutaneous form of t cell lymphoma this 3rd cohort with mycosis fungoides was never part never intended to be part of the registration program it was a proof of concept cohort only and for covid nineteen related restrictions the enrollment into this cohort is currently on hold as adi also mentioned we are continuing to make progress in our collaboration with md anderson cancer center we we have an active ind for our 1st phase one study of amf thirteen in combination with allogeneic natural killer cells as adi said the current status at the md anderson website is recruiting and we know that patients are currently screened and considered and we are expecting to the enrollment of the 1st patient as soon as covid nineteen related restrictions at md anderson are lift up now lets move to our 2nd program afm 24 as you know by bispecific tetravalent molecule targeting both cd sixteen a to activate natural killer cells and macrophages and the egf receptor on solid tumors this compound is in a phase one a dose escalation part of of the 101 study and we are happy to report that we were able to activate all four pre planned sites and all four pre planned sites are contributing patients as we disclosed earlier we have completed our cohort one without observing dose limiting toxicities and actively recruiting into those cohorts too with this i close the overview of the clinical progress and i am happy to hand over to my colleague arndt schottelius chief scientific officer who will review with you some of our pre clinical data that make us so excited about the opportunities that we can create for patients with ices and activating the innate immune system arndt please thank you andreas and thank you all for joining in the next few minutes i would like to summarize as andreas mentioned the pre clinical and clinical data observed so far with our innate cell engagers providing evidence that these molecules are potent and safe for our our candidates i will start by summarizing the data showing that our ices are potent molecules as you see on slide five if we take afm thirteen as an example afm thirteen has been showing strong single agent anti tumor responses and t cell lymphoma with an overall response rate of fifty the molecule has also shown promising signs of raw clinical development potential in augmenting other io therapies such as pb one inhibitors for example in the hodgkin lymphoma phase one b study we have seen an impressive overall response rate of 88 with a complete response rate of 42 and 46 in the local and the central read respectively the lower part of the slide we have also highlighted for you presentations of the studies past and in the future additionally our own experience and the work with md anderson we have seen promising pre clinical data showing that the combination with the adoptive transfer of nk cells enhanced the immune response of afm thirteen leading to prolonged survival in the respective mouse model and as we mentioned the phase one b study at md anderson is now in the last stages of preparation if we go to slide six you see that in our pre clinical studies with afm 24 we saw potent killing of egfr positive tumor cell lines mediated by two distinctive of action potent adcc or antibody dependent cellular cyto toxicity is seen irrespective of the mutational status of the tumor cells and we see potent killing mediated of by adcp or antibody dependence cellular phagocytosis in tumor cells with high and low egfr expression importantly in cells baring the k ras g thirteen d mutation afm 24 shows preserved killing potent killing or adcp or phagocytosis whereas this ability is lost for established treatments for the anti bcma cd sixteen or ro 729 formerly known as afm 26 molecule we also saw very good potency in where there is a dose dependent killing of this innate positive plasma cells was observed we believe that we observed improved potency mediated by the dual mode of action of our approach innate cell engagers are employing nk cells and macrophages to kill tumor cells and thus acquire a two pronged mode of action of antibody dependent cellular cyto toxicity and antibody dependent phagocytosis to fight cancer indeed this dual mode of action is differentiated from other rna cell targeted approaches as these specifically activate nk cells only rna cell engagers work at low expression levels the potency is thus independent of the surface target expression and you see this we continue in slide six with afm thirteen we learned that there is a broad range of cell lines that express different levels of tumor antigen and we have not observed any dependency of target expression to the potency of the molecule the same holds true for afm 24 and the anti bmca engagers pre clinically both molecules have shown high potency across a wide range of egfr and bcma surface expression including at low target expression levels this implies that more patients could respond to treatment with an innate cell engager versus and antibody drug conjugate or adc if the mecha mechanism of adcs have been shown only to rely on certain levels of target antigen thereby missing those tumor cells with expression levels below the ability of the adc to bind to target cells as we move on to slide seven and report on the safety front pre clinically our innate cell engagers demonstrate low cytokine release some examples of this are the ind enabling toxicology study in cyno monkeys which consistently showed no meaningful increases in ser serum cytokines for example at the june virtual ascr conference a pre clinical poster presentation on the ro 729 molecule with genentech showed potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing nk cells that are tetra cells with minimal increase in cytokines also a four week safety study in cyno monkeys showed a favorable safety profile with no cytokine release or adverse finding at the fifteen one five and fifty so five zero mixed tested dose levels and in the case of a afm 24 only a transient increase in all six was observed but was fully reversible within 24 hours but no signs of cytokine release was observed that would lead one to believe that there was a risk of a cytokine storm in patients important to note here is that none of the clinical studies of afm thirteen have revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines these data indicated that our ices have a tolerable and good safety profile taken all together these data suggest that our innate cell engagers are potent able to engage at low levels of antigen expression and have thus far demonstrated a good and tolerable safety profile now in order to maximize the opportunity for molecules in addition to clinical development as monotherapies we are also pursuing combinations with natural killer cells and other treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors such as pd one and pdl one we go to slide eight and 1st let me comment on our combination approach with nk cells as you see on the slide there is evidence showing that high nk cell numbers are associated with better outcomes for example patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma have improved survival rates if their tumors show evidence of nk cell infiltration we also know that patients with diffused large b cell and follicular lymphomas treated with anti cd twenty antibodies that have low peripheral nk counts tend to have poor survival we are seeing that one of the limitations in treating patients is that they do not have the appropriate amount of nk cells so we are working on supplementing nk cells through adoptive transfer and are currently assessing different approaches as you can see on slide nine as we go to slide ten and as discussed earlier the improved tumor kill cell killing by loading nk cells with our ices as you see on the graph for in vitro data on the right hand side of slide ten it will be investigated in the md anderson phase one study in cd thirty positive recurrent or refractory hodgkin and non hodgkin lymphoma patients the pre clinical data that we shared here or that we shared before leads us to believe that they can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy of in innate cell engager afm thirteen through the addition of nk cells and encouraged by the synergistic potential of combining our ices with nk cells and checkpoint inhibitors we are currently evaluating the opportunity on our developing clinical plans for these combinations with afm 24 finally let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at ascr as a reminder our afrm 24 poster demonstrated its distinct mechanism of action different from other egfr signaling inhibition approaches potentially a able to provide benefits for a broad range of cancer patients and in the case of the joint poster with genentech the pre clinical pharmacology and safety of the bcma cd sixteen a innate cell engager shows potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing nk cells as effector cells minimal increase in cytokines suggesting a low risk of cytokine release syndrome we hope this background was helpful for you and i will now turn the call over to angus to introduce himself and provide an update on the financials angus thank you arndt before our financial highlights let me just say that i am thrilled to have joined affimed and i look forward to working with our team to deliver some promise of our exciting turning to the results for the quarter affimed is consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ifrs as issued by the international accounting standard board for iasb the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros which is the company is functional and presentation currency therefore all financial numbers that i will present in this call unless otherwise noted will be in euros we ended the 2nd quarter with cash cash equivalents and current financial assets of €92600000 compared to €104100000 on december 31st 2019 during the quarter we received net proceeds of approximately €20800000 under our at the market or atm program based on our current operating plan and assumptions we anticipate that our cash cash equivalents and current financial assets will support operations into the 1st half of 2022 net cash use and operating activities for the quarter ended june 30th 2020 was €15000000 compared to €5600000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 the 2nd quarter 2019 net cash use and operating activities included a milestone payment to the company from the genentech collaboration total revenue for the 2nd quarter of 2020 was €2900000 compared with €4000000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 revenue in 2020 and 2019 predominantly relates to genentech collaboration revenue from the genentech collaboration in the 2nd quarter of 2020 was comprised of revenue recognized for collaborative research services performed performed during the quarter rnd expenses for the 2nd quarter of 2020 were €11700000 compared to €11500000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 expenses in 2020 relate predominantly to our afm thirteen and amf 24 clinical programs as well as to our early stage development and discovery activities tna expenses for the 2nd quarter 2020 for €2600000 compared to €2300000 in the 2nd quarter to 2019 the increase is primarily related to higher stock compliance costs legal consulting and audit costs net loss for the 2nd quarter of 2020 was €12200000 or ¢sixteen per common share compared to a net loss of €10300000 or ¢seventeen per common share during the 2nd quarter of 2019 the weighted number of common shares outstanding for quarter ended june 20th 2020 were $79200000 i will now turn the call back to adi adi thank you angus as you can see from our presentation today we are taking advantage of the knowledge that we have gained in the field of innate immunity and are applying it to our programs going forward this experience in working with innate immune system is something that if you need to establish that affimed and is helping us in guiding the design of unique therapies which now have the potential to address very different kind of cancers i just want to point out here that the egfr is expressed in more than ten tumors and that gives us a lot of optionality how to take this molecule forward we are please with how things are moving forward for both our clinical and pre clinical programs especially in the current environment our pre clinical programs are on track afm thirteen and 24 are moving forward according to plan and genentech is moving things forward with the anti bcma cd sixteen a innate cell engager what are our inflection points for the next one and half years for afm thirteen we have mentioned that we want to present the interim data in peripheral t cell lymphoma around middle of next year we have been successful in our collaboration with md anderson moving forward the combination of amf thirteen and natural killer cells as we said we are ready to start or md anderson is ready to start and we hope to report 1st patient in and we will provide updates as we move forward for afm 24 we are in the midst of those escalations in order to generate safety and activity data this is quite exciting for us because it is a drug with a very differentiated profile as profile as compared to the lmoats currently used in targeting efg receptors now with the dose escalation and establishing the safety we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the dose cohort expansions but as we have mentioned earlier as well as the planning early on to move forward into combinations we are very happy with the progress in the genentech collaboration we have just provided the next update for the bcma cd sixteen a engager we have multiple other programs ongoing and if things go well pending on program progression progression we can bring in additional milestones and for our newest additions to the pipeline with afm 28 and afm 32 we are sorting enabling studies so that we can have an an id filing 1st for afm 28 finally before we open the session for q and a i would like to thank all our employees for their contribution and express our gratitude my gratitude in particular for our investigators and the clinical sites the patients and and all their families and our investors who are supporting us in our efforts to develop these innovative treatments for cancer patients it is through the combined effort of all of you that keeps us on the path of discovery and innovation i am now happy to close the presentation and we are open now for questions thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session as a reminder should you wish to ask a question you need to press star and one on the telephone and wait for your name to be announced if you wish to cancel you can just press the pound or hash key once again it is star and one for questions 1st question comes from the line of murray from go ahead your line is now open hi good morning everyone congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my questions to start off just wondering for afm 24 i am not sure how much you can say on this but just wondering if both patients in cohort two have been dosed and if you can talk more about the the timing of dosing between patients with the four sites activated can you provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward andreas can you take the question please yeah so there there will there were multiple parts of the questions i hope i got them all so we face one study afm 24 as we said we are recruiting in the 2nd cohort we have not yet disclosed how many patients but you know it is a standard three by three design with with a dose modification but what that is basically what it is in terms of timing between the patients there is a mandatory eight day waiting period between patients so they cannot be treated all at the same time but will be staggered with eight day intervals and there was another part of the question around the four participating sites sorry yeah just wondering if you can provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward yeah currently the enrollment pace is as pre specified by the protocol so all sites are very active in screening patients and as we said all patients all sites have already contributed patients got it okay great and then also for afm 24 just checking if you can say more about the tumor types that they are screening for the study and if you can also provide more perspective into the the checkpoint inhibitor and and combo plans at this point so for the tumor types in the does escalation part we are accepting all patients with all all histologies that are egfr expressing and where the patient has exhausted the respected standard of care treatments as adi mentioned this is a wide variety of potential tumors probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal cancer and non small cell lung cancer and these are the two hist ologies where we would expect probably the majority of patients in the phase one having said that the dose escalation part would also be open for other egfr expressing tumors like for example head and neck cancer gastric cancer or or other solid tumors now once we have defined our dose limiting toxicities or if there are no does limiting toxicities we have defined recommend phase two dose we will enroll into tumor specific expansion cohorts and these expansion cohorts are currently in the process of being defined now for our pd one combination plans based on the interesting data we have seen with pd one in combination with afm thirteen which are not referred to with the very encouraging complete response rate in excess of forty we plan to have a combination with the pd one or a pdl one inhibitor open rather soon probably in parallel to the last cohort of the dose escalation of the single agent studies so it would be more or less a parallel development that we are anticipating right now great okay thanks for the additional perspective any follow up questions murray we will now proceed to our next question next question comes from the line of jim from los please go ahead jim yeah hi guys and congrats on all the progress maybe just a 1st quick question for angus to start him off collaborative research revenues is that expected to be a stable number between you know a three to $4000000 level or is there any reason that might go up as as programs progress and as we think about the milestone that got paid in the 3rd quarter is it a simple matter to back out the assumptions around collaborative research revenues and that will give us some sense of the milestone given that you can not say it explicitly yeah yeah thanks jim for the question and so you know our our our revenue numbers fluctuate from quarter to quarter you know based primarily on the number of hours that we are that we are working on the the various genentech programs that are in progress i mean you can see just looking back at the last several quarters we have been you know fairly fairly range range bound and costs us $2000000 to $5000000 zone you know when see increases specifically as a result of time milestone payments that we received so you know this this milestone payment that we discussed today that will that we will get in the 3rd quarter will will likely increase our revenue in a in the 3rd quarter and that will be sort of an add on to the to the range we have seen over the last several quarters and back again kind of to the to the $5000000 two two or to the €5000000 rather got it okay okay that is helpful and then maybe just on cohort one for afm 24 and what we might learn from that cohort can you remind us if you are doing pre and post biopsies and what kind of translational work you might be doing and how that might inform you know the ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we do a pre treatment biopsy post or on treatment biopsies are optional we do have significant correlative science program looking at peripheral activation markers of nk cells as well as a cytokine profiles once we are in the expansion of phase so we are recruiting into tumor specific cohorts i think this is the part where we will get most of the correlative science as we have more homogenous patient population we maintain our requirement for a pre treatment biopsy and will have post or on treatment biopsies in selected cohorts and then just you know given the comments on the variability in peripheral nk cell populations is there any sense in screening patients for their nk cell levels given that you know patients who screen low may not have adequate nk cells or macrophages to recruit or do you feel like within the variability of innate cell in the blood that that you will be able to have an effective treatment and it is not worth screening for that variable i think currently it would be premature it depends on what you mean with with screening so we are definitely determining the levels of circulating nk cells and also looking at some of the their i think we currently do not have enough data to define a cutoff or a threshold and this may very well vary between tumor hist ologies and also be dependent on the of nk cells in the tumor microenvironment the variable which we have seen in our afm thirteen columbia study to have some impact on on the likelihood to response of of patients so i think in the beginning of the program we will be open for all comers we will assess all of these important biomarkers and then based on the activity data and the readout we are seeing we may modify the program defining certain thresholds but currently i think it would be premature to do that and maybe just a final question just the md anderson collaboration is focused on core blood derived nk cells is there any thought to other nk cell sources including potentially ipfc nk cells adi you want to take this question or should i take it no well i andreas why do not you go ahead okay yeah you are right core blood derived nk cells is one source of nk cells and if you watch the field of nk cell based approached especially the the the field around companies and institutes providing different sources of nk cells there is definitely speed picking up and there is a variety of of options to to look at and this is what we do not only from our site but we have also received proactive inquiries of potential working models to gather so we are looking at the entire nk cell field and then evaluating various options there great thanks for taking the questions guys may maybe as a brief comment we see this core blood derived nk cells already quite advanced and chemically relevant so they have already been many patients well with ipsc currently there is still a the to be determined and obviously in combination with learning more on the functionalities so this is somewhat in to us on how functional an ipsc derived versus a peripheral nk cell and it is good to see the 1st clinical data so we are quite not only happy but we have we have checked so many different options at the moment for nk cells and we are indeed very convinced about the activity of the core blood derived cells from md anderson great thanks adi thank you our next question comes from the line of ike from bmo capital the line is now open please go ahead hey good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my questions this is e k allen for just a couple regarding the bcma engager i understand that you probably linked to this ability on the entirety of the clinical developed pathway but if you could provide any type of insight in terms of what genentech kind of has planned maybe in terms of could they potentially pursue an accelerated pathway for the assets and secondly again you are you do not provide complete details on the exact milestone payments but if you could provide us some additional perspective on what the future milestones for the asset might hold in terms of you know phase two phase three things of that sort should we expect increasing size of value for each milestone payment that would be helpful for us thanks adi maybe i take the question for the pathway and then hand over to you for the milestones yes please go ahead arndt so yeah thanks for the question i mean as you already correctly say we cannot really speak in detail for genentech but we can share with you i think you are aware of course licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal with ge genentech they are obviously excited about the strong differentiation potential of the molecule also demonstrated at ascr at the at the poster just to review again the very strong pre clinical cell killing selective no cytokine release very good safety profile and good pharmacodynamic marker specific bcma specific plasma cell killing in the cyno monkey so you know despite the also recent approvals of the you know the inco the 1st incomers in the space i would think say that genentech shares our excitement with the differentiation potential and wait for a potentially best in class molecule maybe i i will leave it there i think it is it is a it is a clearly strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule will enable genentech and we as we are partnered to you know have a strong position in the space yeah regarding the financials so i just want to recall the deal when it was signed so we received $96000000 in upfront cash and a and can get the total of more than $5000000000 in milestones that are d different categories so there are preclin there is a pre clinical milestones payments there are indeed multiple clinical milestone payments regulatory and sales milestones and on top we can receive royalties which as we described are on the higher end of what you would expect for the early nature of the license agreement beyond that we are not able to disclose any further details unless genentech would allow us or roche would allow us to do so usually that is just a general statement that is that the payments will increase the further the program progresses okay thank you for that and just one more quick questions i think i might have misheard it this is in regards to afm 24 i believe you mentioned that there was a patient that had increased il six cytokine levels that would resolve over 24 hours just curious was that self resolving or was that did that patient receive and il six inhibitor yeah i can thanks for bringing that up for verification so the transient il six increase was reported in the enabling cyno tox study what you you referred to the ascr poster indeed we saw that with the dosing a kind of moderate peak that quickly went down was completely resolved without any any treatment obviously you know one does not do that in the because this is cyno tox study and again when we see this in the context because it was transient and fully reversed leads us to the conclusions which of course will be looked at carefully in patients that we should not expect any kind of cytokine release syndrome all right thank you for that clarification sure and the next question comes from the line of yu jen from please go ahead the line now open hello yes hi can you hear hi yes sorry my headset fall out thanks for taking the questions my 1st question is that for the afm thirteen in the for the registration study that it is assignment to setup so what might be the threshold of in the forty patients so the interim readout before you can move forward so just curious to what and review on that front i am afraid we cannot give a concrete response rate it is based also on the patient design so there is some interdependence of response rates but we usually do not disclose thresholds but it is a classical assignment two stage design okay no problem and and also just curious in terms of afm 24 that you are dose escalating at least based on interim data is there any thought where when you might start to see the potential effective dose to start i think currently it is not possible to predict when we will have the optimal biologically active dose as there are a number of of co variants like binding sites for cd sixteen binding sites for egfr and then distribution and as you know the the animal models especially in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are very difficult to translate the relevant tox species and you have to that there is only a tox species of the cynomolgus monkey however we do not have any cynomolgus monkey tumor models available so we cannot really bridge between what we see in the toxicology studies and then what we would see in terms of efficacy for for tumors so it will be something that i will have to define in our in our clinical program okay great maybe what thinking of one last one last question here is that in terms of adaptive nk cell from core blood derived nk cells is 1st of all could that be potentially used in solid tumor and any comments comments in terms of regarding that possibility this is as adi said something that we are actively looking into we will starting out with lymphomas obviously with afm thirteen targeting cd thirty but our vision is that also for amf 24 we will develop certain development options in combination with nk cells could be core blood derived nk cells could be nk cells from another source that is something that we will define but the intention is also to to have a have a program where afm 24 would be part that was exogenous nk cells okay great thanks i appreciate it and congrats for all the progress this far there are no further questions at this time for closing remarks we go to our speakers yes thank you again for listening in and following our our updates the the the progress is coming smoothly along despite that we are affected by by covid we have strengthened the team significantly in order to address any issues that may relate to the conductance of these clinical trials or to the interactions with the with the specific sites so we are very happy to be able to that i have been able to address any of the issue that have been arising and i did want to thank again the entire team here at affimed for managing all this through these difficult times we are quite excited that we can move forward these programs either as mono therapies and now looking at different options of of combination if you have heard we focus on natural killer cells and checkpoint inhibitors in particular so pd ones or pdl ones so we feel that we have with the multiple programs addressing different targets we can provide a cadence of data over the next quarter and and years and very happy to report any additional updates as we move along thanks a lot again for listening in and all the best goodbye thank you this has been conference the conference today thank you all for participating and stay safe everyone thank you everyone",

i will turn the call over to aarti aarti thank you alex good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our 2nd quarter business update call today we have some updates to share with you on our operational progress as well as on our financial results while we are still in the middle of a serious global health pandemic and a challenging economic downturn we are quite confident that the steps were taken to address these issues thank you we are beginning to yield data that demonstrate the long term potential of our innovative approaches and products covid nineteen continues to affect societies around the world and we hope that you and your families are well and safe we are observing some impact by covid nineteen on the progress of our clinical studies however it is lastly we are taking great efforts as a result we have been able to continue our progress on the chemical studies of avm thirteen in peripheral t cell lymphoma and of avm 24 in each of our positive tumors and which is very exciting for us those the 1st patient was the ro 7297729708 which is the bcma cd 68 in that case as you remember is the bcma cd 68 in that case we are also making good progress on our preclinical pipeline for our lead candidate apm thirteen i was studying patients who have relapsed or refractory peripheral t cell lymphoma in exhausted available standard of care treatments and are now being treated with apm thirteen as a single agent we are executing according to our development timelines and as previously stated expect to complete the predetermined interim analysis in mid 2020 we are also looking at options to enhance the efficacy of evf beyond monotherapy the 1st of these options is the combination with allogenic keratinocytes in a study that is conducted at the md anderson cancer institute under on ist md anderson is website now shows that the study is enrolling but the initiation is impacted by the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic in texas as soon as the situation improves for efm 24 we disclosed that we have completed the 1st cohort of our dose escalation study without any dose limiting toxicities we are currently recruiting into the 2nd dose cohort we have all four plant sites active and recruiting following completion of the dose escalation study we will continue to monitor the patient is progress we have the option to enroll patients into tumor specific expansion cords where we will look for single agent activity in a number of well defined tumor types in addition we are planning to initiate combination studies with checkpoint inhibitors and we will be providing updates as the program continues to make progress we are very pleased with the continued progress in our collaboration with genentech importantly phase one clinical trials are ongoing this is a message from the bcma cd sixty a inpatient enrollment system this system is now enrolling patients this achievement represents the 3rd enrollment system to enter the clinic and triggers a milestone payment to us during the 3rd quarter in an amount that we were not able to disclose last month angies smith joined us as our chief financial officer angies will introduce himself later and discuss our financial position during the annual shareholders meeting which was held on august 4th we are happy to report that all proposed agenda items were approved this includes the addition of doctor annalisa jenkins and harry weldon to the supervisor is new members harry is an accomplished financial executive who will help drive value creating strategies for the company these additions to the supervisory board further strengthen the company is industry know how experience and diversity as it is as it has only been a month and a half since we last spoke to you we thought we would focus today is discussion on company achievements thus far and what gives us confidence in our plans thank you on our programs and allow plenty of time for q a to get started i will now hand over the call to doctor andras harsanyi our chief medical officer to give you a brief update on our clinical stage programs doctor harsanyi yeah thank you addie for the introduction and thank you all for joining us today and i am happy to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs that we made over the last year good afternoon everyone as you all are aware the covid nineteen pandemic is still present globally and it continues to pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment of patients the two guiding principles we are employing at afimeat is to ensure patient safety on the studies and to ensure trial data integrity and this is in line i think with the guidance within this framework however the afiamet team is very proactively working with all of our participating sites to make sure that our innovative treatment is still available for patients in need of new therapeutics and that we minimize the impact of covid nineteen to a minimum possible to go into more detail let us start with afm thirteen our most advanced program 1st as you know afm thirteen is in a registration directed phase two study afm thirteen 200 treating patients with relapsed and refractory t cell lymphoma the enrollment into the study is at a steady state we were able to activate 54 sites now contributing patients in ten countries around the globe as you know the study has a simon two stage design with a pre planned interim analysis and as adi said we are confident that we will have the data from this interim analysis available by the mid next year there was also a 3rd cohort or there is a 3rd cohort in this study for patients with transformed mucositis so a cutaneous form of t cell lymphoma this 3rd cohort was mucositis was never part of the study it was intended to be part of the registration program it was a proof of concept cohort only and for covid nineteen related restrictions the enrollment into this cohort is currently on hold as adi also mentioned we are continuing to make progress in our collaboration with md anderson cancer center where we have an active i and n for our 1st phase one study of avm thirteen in combination as i already said the current status at the md anderson webpage is recruiting and we know that patients are currently screened and considered and we are expecting the enrollment of the 1st patient as soon as covid nineteen related restrictions at md anderson are lifted up now let us move to our 2nd program afm twenty as you know a bispecific tetravalent molecule targeting both cd sixteen a to activate natural killer cells and macrophages and the egf receptor on solid tumors this compound is in a phase one escalation part of the eleven study and we are happy to report that we were able to activate all four pre planned sites and all four pre planned sites are active as we disclosed earlier we have completed our cohort one without observing those limiting toxicities and are actively recruiting into cohort two thank you and thank you all for joining in the next few minutes i would like to summarize as andreeas mentioned the preclinical and clinical data observed so far with our innate cell engagers providing unprecedented opportunities for patients with icds and activating the innate immune system i will start by summarizing the data showing that our ics are potent molecules as you see on slide five if we take fm thirteen as an example fm thirteen has been shown to have strong single agent anti tumor responses and t cell immunomodulation with an overall response rate of fifty the molecule has also shown promising signs of broad clinical development potential in augmenting other i zero therapies such as pd one inhibitors for example in the hodgkin lymphoma phase one b study we have seen an impressive overall response rate of 88 with a complete response rate of 42 and 46 in the local and central read respectively in the lower part of the slide we have also highlighted for you presentations of the studies past and in the future additionally our own experiences and the work with andy anderson we have seen promising preclinical data showing that the combination with the adaptive transfer of and k cells enhanced the immune response of avian thirteen leading to prolonged survival in the now as we mentioned the phase one b studied and the anderson is now in the last stages of preparation if we go to slide six you see that in our preclinical studies with afl cellular toxicity is seen irrespective of the mutational status of the tumor cells and we see potent killing mediated by adenosine deaminase cytidine deaminase or anybody dependent cellular fagocytosis in tumor cells with high and low egrf expression importantly in cells bearing the kras g thirteen d mutation afroman 24 shows preserved we also saw very good potency in cynomolgus monkeys whereas a dose dependent killing of bcma positive plasma cells it was observed we believe that the observed improved potency is mediated by the dual mode of action of our approach the innate cell engagers are employing nk cells and macrophages to kill tumor cells and thus act via a two pronged mode of action of antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity and antibody dependent tumor cell phagocytosis to fight cancer dual motivation is differentiated from other t cell targeted approaches as these specifically activate t cells only our t cell engaging agents work at low expression levels the potency is thus independent of the surface target expression and you see this we continue in slide six with aven thirteen we learned that there is a the same holds true for e two f 24 and the anti bcl two agents pre clinically both molecules have shown high potency across a wide range of  and bcl two surface expression including a low target expression this implies that more patients could respond to treatment with an innate cell engager versus an antibody drug conjugate or adc as the mechanism of adcs have been shown only to rely on certain levels of target antigen thereby missing those tumor cells with expression levels below the ability of the adc to bind to target cells as we move on to slide seven and report on the safety front preclinically our innate selling agents demonstrate low cytokine release some examples of this are the i n d enabling toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys which consistently showed no meaningful increases in serum cytokines for example at the june virtual acr conference a preclinical poster presentation on the ro 729 molecule with genetic showed potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing nk cells as effector cells with minimal increase in cytokines also a four week safety study in cynomolgus monkeys showed a favorable safety profile with no cytokine release or adverse findings at the fifteen 150 and fifty so fifty mix per kick tested dose levels and case of afm 24 only a transient increase in r six was observed that was fully reversible within 24 hours but no signs of cytokine release was observed that would lead one to believe that there is a risk of a cytokine storm in patients important to note here is that none of the clinical studies of afm thirteen have revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines these data indicate that our rnai constructs have a tolerable and good safety profile taken altogether these data suggest that our innate immune system engages are potent able to engage at low levels of antigen expression and have thus far demonstrated a good and tolerable safety profile now in order to maximize the opportunity for molecules in addition to clinical development is more we are also pursuing combinations with natural killer cells and other treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors such as pd one and pd l one we go to slide eight and 1st let me comment on our combination approach with n k cells as you see on the slide there is evidence showing that high n k cell numbers are associated with better outcomes for example patients with metastatic cancer have better outcomes when treated with n k cells we have improved survival rates if their tumors show evidence of n k cell infiltration we also know that patients with diffused large b cell and follicular lymphomas treated with n dc d twenty antibodies that have low peripheral n k counts tend to have poor survival so we do not have the appropriate amount of nk cells so we are working on supplementing nk cells through adaptive transfer and are currently assessing different approaches as you can see on slide nine as we go to slide ten and as discussed earlier the improved tumor cell killing by loading nk cells with our ices as you see on the slide the preclinical data that we share here and have shared before leads us to believe that we can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy of innate immune cell engagement f thirteen through the addition we are encouraged by the synergistic potential of combining our ris with and nk cells and checkpoint inhibitors we are currently evaluating the opportunity and are developing clinical plans for these combinations with aml 24 finally let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at aacr as a reminder or aml 24 poster demonstrated its distinct mechanism of action different from other edfr signaling inhibition approaches potentially able to provide benefit to a broad range of cancer patients and in the case of the joint poster with genetic the preclinical pharmacology and safety of the bcam eight cdc 660 a innate cell engager shows potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing we hope this background was helpful for you and i will now turn the call over to angus to introduce himself and provide an update on the financials angus thank you angus before i discuss our financial highlights let me just say that i am thrilled to i joined this board and and and i look forward to working with our audit committee to deliver from the problems of our exciting fight against cyber attacks turning to the results for the quarter apertio is consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros which is the company is functional and presentation currency therefore all financial information presented in this release is presented in euros during the quarter we received net proceeds of approximately €20800000 under our at the market for atm program we anticipate that our cash cash equivalents and current financial assets will support operations into the 1st half of 2022 net cash used in operating activities for the quarter ended june thirty 2022 was approximately €15000000 compared to €5600000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 the 2nd quarter of 2019 net cash used in operating activities included a milestone payment to the company from a partner total revenue for the 2nd quarter of €2022900000 compared with €4000000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 revenue in 2020 and 2019 predominantly relate to the genentech collaboration revenue from the genentech collaboration in the 2nd quarter of 2020 was comprised of revenue recognized for collaborative research services performed during the quarter expenses for the 2nd quarter of 2020 were €11700000 compared to €11500000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 expenses in 2020 relate predominantly to our afm thirteen and afm 24 clinical programs as well as to our early stage development and discovery activities gdna expenses for the 2nd quarter of 2020 were €2600000 compared to €2300000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 the increase is primarily related to higher staff costs legal consulting and audit costs net loss for the 2nd quarter of 2020 was €12200000 or ¢sixteen per common share of €10300000 or ¢seventeen per common share during the 2nd quarter of 2019 the weighted number of common shares outstanding for the quarter ended june 30th 2020 was 79200000 thank you angus as you can see from our presentation today we are taking advantage of the knowledge that we have gained in the field of innate immunity and are applying it to our programs going forward this experience in working with the innate immune system is something that we have uniquely established at afimet and is helping us in guiding the design of unique programs we are pleased with how things are moving forward for both our clinical and preclinical programs especially in the current environment our preclinical programs are on track afa thirteen and 24 are moving forward according to plan and genentech is moving things forward with the antibcma adc 6018 in cell engagement what are our inflection points for the next onefive years for afa thirteen we have mentioned that we want to present the interim data in peripheral t cell lymphoma around the middle of next year we have been successful in our collaboration with emd anderson moving forward the combination of afm and thirteen and copblud derived natural killer cells as we have said we are ready to start or emd anderson is ready to start and we hope to report for this patient in and we will provide updates as we move forward for afm 24 we are in the midst of we are going to talk about the use of escalation in order to generate safety and activity data this is quite exciting for us because it is a drug with a very differentiated profile as compared to the other omotilates that are currently used in targeting the egf receptor now with the dose escalation and establishing the safety we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then then thank you for your questions as we have mentioned earlier we are also planning early on to move forward into combinations we are very happy with the progress in the genetic collaboration we have just provided the next update for the bcma cd sixteen a in data we have multiple other programs ongoing and if things go well pending on program progression we can bring in additional milestones good afternoon everyone i am jim i am here to talk about our newest additions to the pipeline with aem 22 and aem 32 we are starting the i and d enabling studies so that we can have an i and d filing 1st for aem 22 finally before we open the session for q and a i would like to thank all of our employees for their contribution and express our gratitude my gratitude in particular for our investigators and the clinical sites and the patients and all their families and our investors who are supporting us in our efforts to develop these innovative treatments for cancer patients it is through the combined efforts of all of you that keeps us on the path of discovery and innovation i am now happy to close the presentation and we are open now for questions thank you the session will now begin the question and answer session as a reminder please do refer to the slides as we go through the presentation hello you will need to press star one in the telephone directory for your information press the pound or hash key once again for assistance once again it is star one for questions 1st question comes from the line of maui raykoff from jeffrey is please go ahead your line is now open just wondering if both patients in core two have been dosed and if you can talk more about the the timing of dosing between patients and with the for sites activated can you provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward as we said we are recruiting in the 2nd cohort we have not yet disclosed how many patients as you know it is a standard three by three design with washout modification but but that is basically what it is in terms of timing between the patients there is a mandatory eight day waiting period between patients so they can not be seen back to back i was wondering if you could provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward yeah currently the enrollment pace is as prescribed by the protocol so all sites are very active in screening patients and as we said all patients all sites have already contributed patients got it okay great and then also for ens 24 just checking if you can say more about the the tumor types that you are screening for the study and if you can also provide more perspective into the checkpoint inhibitor and and combo plans at this point so for the tumor types as we are accepting all patients with all histologies that are egf are expressing and where the patient has exhausted the respective standard of care treatments as adi mentioned this is a wide variety of potential tumors are probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal cancers and non small cell lung cancers these are the two histologies where we would expect probably the majority of patients in the phase one having said that the dose escalation part would but also be open for other ejf expressing tumors like for example head and neck cancer gastric cancer or other solid tumors now once we have defined our dose limiting toxicities or if there are no dose limiting toxicities we have defined we recommend we will enroll into two more specific expansion cohorts and these expansion cohorts are currently in the process of being defined now for our pd one combination plans based on the interesting data we have seen with pd one in combination with avm thirteen which is not referred to as a very encouraging complete our bond rates are in excess of forty we plan to have a combination with a pd one or pdl one inhibitor open rather soon probably in parallel to the last cohort of the chronic dosing escalation of the single agent studies so it will be more or less a parallel development that we are anticipating right now great thanks for the additional perspective hi guys i just wanted to congratulate all of you on all the progress maybe just a quick question for angus to start him off collaborative research revenues is that expected to be a stable number between a you know three to $4000000 level or is there any reason that might go up as as programs progress and as we think about the milestone that got paid in the 3rd quarter is it a simple matter to back out the assumptions around collaborative research revenues and that will give us some sense of the milestone i will give and that you can not say it explicitly yeah yeah thanks jim for the question so you know our our revenue numbers fluctuate from quarter to quarter you know based primarily on the number of hours that we were that we were working on the various genentec programs that are in progress i mean you can see just looking back at the last several quarters we have been you know fairly fairly range bound range bound and call up the the 2000000 to to 5000000 zone you know when you see increases it is typically a result of point in time milestone payments that we received so you know this this milestone payment that we discuss today that will so will hit in the 3rd quarter will will likely increase our revenues in in the 3rd quarter and that would be sort of an an add on to the to the range you have seen over the last several quarters of that again kind of to the two to the $5000000 or two to €5000000 rather but okay that is that is helpful and then maybe just on cohort one for a fm 24 and what we might learn from that cohort can you remind us if you are so in the dose escalation part we do a pre treatment biopsy  post or on treatment biopsies are optional we do have a significant science program looking at these things so we are in the expansion phase so we are recruiting into tumor specific cohorts i think this is the part where we will get most of the correlative science as we have a more homogeneous patient population we maintain our requirement for a pre treatment biopsy and will have post or pre treatment biopsies and then just you know given the comments on the variability and perfolate n k cell populations is there any sense in screening patients for their n k cell levels given that you know patients who screen low may not have adequate n k cells or macrophages to recruit or you feel like within the variability i think we currently do not have enough data to make a definitive statement about what the appropriate screening test would be but i think currently it would be premature to say that we should be screening for that variable yeah depends on what you mean by screening so we are definitely determining the levels of circulating nk cells and also looking at some of their characteristics i think we currently do not have enough data to make a definitive statement about what the appropriate screening test would be but i think currently it would be premature to say that we should be screening for that variable yeah depends on what you mean by screening so we are definitely determining the levels of circulating nk cells and also looking at some of their characteristics to define a cutoff or a threshold and this may very well vary between tumor histologies and also be dependent on the infiltration of nk cells in the tumor microenvironment a variable which we have seen in our afm study to have some impact on on the likelihood to respond to patients so i think in the beginning of the program we will be able to see some impact on the patient response we will assess all of these important biomarkers and then based on the activity data and the readouts that we are seeing we may modify as a program defining certain thresholds but currently i think it would be premature to do that including potentially ips derived nk cells based approaches especially in the field around companies and institutes providing different sources of n k cells there is definitely speed picking up and there is a variety of options to look at and this is what we do not only from our side but  we have also received proactive inquiries of potential working together we are looking at the entire endoskeleton cell field and then evaluate various options there great thanks for taking the question guys maybe as a quick comment so we see this co blood derived in case that was already quite advanced in clinical development so there have already been many patients treated while with the ipsecs currently there is still a yeah the safety to be determined obviously in combination we learn more on their functionalities so this is somewhat yet to us on how functional and ites derived versus a peripheral in kasl is and it is good to see the 1st clinical data so we are quite not only happy but we have checked so many different options at the moment for in kasl and we are indeed very convinced about the activity of the kober derived cells from md anderson great thanks audi our next question comes from the line of ick og from bmo capital the line is now open please go ahead thirdly again you do not provide complete details on direct milestone payments but if you can provide that a perspective on what the future milestones for the footprint might hold in terms of you know phase two phase three things of that sort should we expect increasing size of value for each milestone payment that would be helpful for us thanks so yeah thanks for the question i mean as you already correctly say we cannot really speak in detail for genentech but we can share with you i think you are aware that of course licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal we did with genentech they are obviously excited about the strong differentiation potential of the molecule also demonstrated at acr at the at the poster just to review again a very strong  preclinical selective no silicon release very good safety profile and good pharmacodynamic marker specific bcma plasma cell killing in the cynomolgus monkey so you know despite the also recent approvals of the you know income 1st incomers in the space i would say a that genetic shares our excitement with the differentiation potential and a way for maybe i i leave it there i think it is it is a it is a clearly a strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule will enable geron and we as their partner to you know have a strong position in this space and in upfront cash and and can get a total of more than 5000000000 in milestones that are in different categories so there are  preclinical mile they are preclinical milestone payments there are indeed multiple clinical milestone payments regulatory and sales milestones and on top we can receive royalties which as we described are on the higher end we would expect the early nature of the license agreement beyond that we are not able to disclose any further details unless genentic would allow us or rosh would allow us to do so usually and that is just a general statement is that the payments will increase the further the program progresses okay thank you for that and again that is the general statement a quick question i think i might have missed it this is in regards to afm 24 i believe you mentioned that there was a patient that had increased in il six cytokine levels that was resolved over 24 hours i was just curious was that self resolving or did that patient receive an il six inhibitor  six increase was reported in the iron and enabling syno tax study what you you are referring to the acr poster indeed we saw that with the dosing a kind of moderate peak that quickly went down was completely resolved without any any treatment obviously you know one does not do that in the because this is syno tax study and again when we see this in the context because it was transient and fully reversed leads us to the and of course we will be looked at carefully in patients that we should not expect any kind of cytokine release syndrome hi can you hear me hi sorry that is my headset fell out thanks for taking the questions my 1st question is that for the afm thirteen in the for the registration study that it is assignment two set up so what might be the threshold of or in the forty patients and sort of inter rater reliability readout before you can move forward so just just the general idea any information you can reveal on that front i am afraid we cannot give a concrete response rate it is based also on the bayesian design so there are some interdependence of response rates but we usually do not disclose thresholds but it is a classical simon two stage design so i think that you are having a rising dose but at least based on the animal data is there any thoughts where when you might start to see the potential effective dose to start animal models especially in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are very difficult to translate the relevant taxon species and after all that is only your taxon species is the cynomolgus monkey however we do not have any cynomolgus monkey tumor models available we cannot really bridge between what we see in the toxicology studies and then what we would see in terms of efficacy for for tumors so it will be something that we will have to define in our in our clinical program 1st of all could that be potentially used in solid tumors and any comments in terms of regarding that but of possibility we will develop certain development options in combination with and with nk cells could be cord blood derived in nk cells could be from another source that is something that we will define but the intention is also to have a program where afn 24 would be partnered with exogenous nk cells i just wanted to call and congratulate you on all the progress that this bar has made despite the fact that we are affected by by the by the situation that is going on the progress is coming smoothly along despite that we are affected by the situation that is going on thank you for your question at this time for any closing remarks please go ahead on speakers yeah thank you again for listening in and following our updates the progress is coming smoothly along despite the situation that is going on we have strengthened the team significantly in order to address any issues that may relate to the conduct of this clinical trials or to the interactions with the specific sites so we are very happy to be able to have been able to address any of the issues that have been arising and i indeed want to thank again the entire team here at daffy for managing all that through and difficult times we are quite excited that we can move forward these programs either as monotherapies and now looking at the different options of of combination if you have heard we focus on natural killer cells and checkpoint inhibitors in particular pd one so pdl one so we feel that we have with the multiple programs addressing different targets we can provide a collection of data over the next and in quarters and in years and very happy to report any additional updates as we move along thanks a lot again for listening in and all the best goodbye thank you everyone for participating you may now disconnect stay safe everyone",

            "reference": "token welcome to the rwe conference call markus krebber cfo of rwehg will inform you about the developments in the 1st half of fiscal 2020 i will now hand over to thomas danny thank you anika good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us today to discuss rwe is results for the 1st six months of the year i am joined by our cfo markus krebber who will run through the presentation before we move on to q as later in the call as in q one this year in order to compare like for like our presentation focuses on the proforma figures in comparison to 2019 meaning that assets taken over from e on in the 3rd quarter last year are included for adjusted ebitda and ebit for the full year 2019 and with this let me hand over to markus for the update on h one 2020 yeah thank you thomas and a warm welcome to everyone on the phone it is good to speak to you and i really hope you are safe and sound wherever you are dialing in from today the operational and financial performance in the 1st half of 2020 has been good overall and so far we have only seen a small impact on the business from the covid nineteen pandemic on a proforma basis year on year adjusted ebitda of our core business increased nine to €1500000000 the rwe group is adjusted ebitda stands at €1800000000 we confirm our full year guidance and now expect adjusted ebitda to be at the upper end of the guidance we also confirm our target to increase the dividend payment to ¢85 per share for this year our net debt now stands at €7800000000 this is a decrease by roughly €900000000 compared to q one our clear target is to meet a leverage factor of around three times adjusted core ebitda to net debt at year end and we are delighted that the asset swap with e on is finally fully closed the legal integration and the hr integration have already been completed the teams are now operating in the target management structure across the entire business let me remind you that the energy activities which we transferred back to rwe have been recorded in our group figures already as they were commercially assigned to us we do not see any relevant effect from the final closing in our financials what else we are excited about our latest announcement on the deal to acquire nordex twoseven gigawatt development pipeline in onshore wind and solar this gives us great option for future growth and a broad entry into the french market i will come to back at we will come back to that in a minute regarding our coal and nuclear business we are pleased at the coal phase out act which found broad consensus was brought into german law phase out is supplemented by a public law contract drawn up by the federal government and the operators which will pass the german parliament after the summer break the law and contract are subject to approval under eu state aid law we expect this process to happen in autumn this year this is we now have a clear path on how to exit from our remaining coal operations ladies and gentlemen let me briefly come back to the transaction with nordex on page four this transaction is a strategic pipeline enhancement in our in and our broad market entry into france strengthens our existing pipeline of 22 gigawatt and the projects to be built will come on top of the targets announced at the capital market date we expect cuds these as early as next year and additional capacity of approximately 500 megawatts in operations by 2025 we are also pleased that this creates a great opportunity to enter the french market onenine gigawatts of the development projects are in france of which roughly 300 megawatt are close to fid or in late development stage france is a very attractive functional market was used to build our targets and the solid remuneration framework france was the only large market in europe where we where we were missing a pipeline and a strong development team together with the pipeline and experienced team of seventy professional mostly based in france will join us to drive our growth ambitions in france further in markets where we already operate assets the pipeline gives additional options spain approximately 400 megawatt sweden approximately 400 megawatt and poland small position of more than ten megawatt what are the next steps we have agreed in exclusive put option with nordex on a purchase price of €402500000 nordex kicks off the consultation process with the french works council which needs to be finalized before the put option can be exercised the completion of the transaction is also subject to foreign investment theorems in france and the completion of common processes it is assumed that the transaction could be completed in the 4th quarter of this year now back to the financials for h one 2020 on page five in our core business adjusted ebitda increased by nine to €1500000000 as a result of a good performance in all segments broadly speaking the good h one result for offshore wind and onshore wind solar was due to the very good weather conditions in the 1st quarter and onshore capacity additions the hydro biomass gas division mainly benefits from the resumption of gb capacity market and the supply and trading division outperformed after a successful start into the year was continued which continued in the 2nd quarter ladies and gentlemen our wind and solar business is progressing well and stock capacity remains unchanged at eightnine gigawatt but there is more to come in the 2nd half of the year and we made good progress towards our growth targets for 2022 amongst others we have taken the fid for the hickory park solar farm in the us has a capacity of 196 megawatt and the coal located forty megawatt battery which is due to be commissioned in 21 the project is under the investment tax credit itc regime and has secured a thirty year ppa with georgia power regarding the period after 2022 the offshore wind farm has secured an agreement for lease with the crown estate the project is an extension of our operating twenty more wind farm the additional pro rata capacity is 300 megawatt what are the next steps the development of the project will continue with a view to participating in cfd auction rounds in three to five years time furthermore we welcome the announcement from the irish government that the dublin array offshore project has been designated as one of seven relevant projects meaning it will be fast tracked to the new marine planning regime the project will add 300 megawatt pro rata capacity and is currently in the development phase subject to an updated content application and investments decision construction could begin in 24 with ud in 26 and lastly we are now participating in the 3rd floating demonstration project together with the university of maine as well as mitsubishi corporation we will develop a demonstration project off the coast of maine we continue to drive floating offshore wind because we see great potential for floating wind farms worldwide in particular in countries like the us with deeper coastal waters let us move onto an update of our construction program it is progressing well apart from some covid nineteen related delays mainly at us construction sites so that we had to shift ud of approximately 500 megawatt from twenty to 21 due to the adjusted commissioning plan we expect the overall financial impact for this year to be a small to medium double digit €1000000 amount please note that the ptc income level of the us project is secured in any cases at all sites now we will take a look at the status of the individual projects we presented to you at q one starting with the offshore division our not a project offshore construction work started earlier this year and everything is progressing as planned at the cascadia project contract was made suppliers assigned so preparatory preparation work is continuing and going according to plan the construction work will start in q three 2021 the club and the forest onshore wind farm is already generating and receiving revenues from the contract for difference as soon as wind farm testing is completed and cud is reached reported as can start capacity good availability at the cornell onshore site has been achieved and the commissioning of the individual wind turbines is ramping up the extra commissioning date is scheduled for this month we have updated our milestones at our big raymond onshore wind project one part of the project namely raymond west with twenty 240 megawatt will slip into q one 21 whereas the commissioning of raymond east was 200 megawatt is expected in the 2nd half of q four 2020 cud has moved within the 4th quarter to the end of december this year on the basis of the adjusted timeline construction work is on track commissioning ramp up will start soon and at the lyman their solar farm the good registration process took more time than expected due to the current circumstances cud has therefore slipped into q one 21 in total we will bring onethree gigawatt online in the 2nd half of the year mainly backend loaded with that we can move to the details of the individual segments the offshore wind division realized an adjusted ebitda of €585000000 year on year this is an increase of nineteen thanks to higher wind speeds in the 1st quarter ross cash investments in h one amount to €316000000 mainly driven by triton or construction work the sale of the sea breeze installation is the main driver for ross cash divestments we confirmed the outlook for the offshore division our onshore wind solar division increased twelve year on year and adjusted ebitda amounted to €273000000 at h one whether you drive us an increase in capacity of approximately 380 megawatts year on year as well as higher earnings in europe from above average weather conditions in the 1st quarter of this year most of the gross cash investments are for the us onshore projects big raymond scotia rich and cassadaga as well as boiling springs despite the small to medium double digit €1000000 negative impact from tighter commissioning phases and the delay at big raymond and we confirm the outlook for the full year the hydro biomass gas division delivered a good performance over the 1st six months higher earning results mainly from the british capacity markets in contrast to the strong 1st water at h one earnings from the commercial optimization of co op power plant dispatch have normalized in june we signed a contract to sell our georgia bio mass business to nvivo partners for a purchase price of 175000000 us dollars the transaction was closed at the end of july after successful merger clearance the disposal is already reflected in the guidance we gave you in march the ebitda contribution for proforma 2019 was a good €30000000 in 2020 it is approximately half this amount as we have already reported to the market the fire at the power plant has caused an interruption to the biomass co firing which we expect to last until november 2020 this will impact the outlook by a small to medium double digit €1000000 amount despite this we also confirm the guidance for this division moving on to another quarter of favorable earnings development from the supply and trading division at h one adjusted ebitda amount to €322000000 on the back of a strong trading performance and good results from the gas and energy business we did not expect the division to replicate the exceptional performance of the 1st six months of last year the division is outlook is 150 to €350000000 given the strong h one we expect to end the upper end or even above ladies and gentlemen having now report on the core business let us move to the coal and nuclear division adjusted ebitda has doubled year on year and amount to €310000000 as we already mentioned at q one earnings improved due to higher realized wholesale prices and an updated production plant in the system nevertheless we need to consider implications from the implementation of accelerated exit plan for the full year we confirmed the divisions outlook moving onto the earnings drivers down to adjusted net income adjusted net income amounted to €795000000 due to the high adjusted ebitda of rwe group the negative effect on the financial result of €150000000 from q one were partly compensated by the e on dividends of €182000000 we received in the 2nd quarter adjustment in tax applied with a general tax rate of fifteen in line with expected midterm tax level for the group the tax rate of fifteen has been derived from all income streams it is based on blended local tax rates the use of loss carried forward and the low taxation of dividends including the e on and dividends and now onto the adjusted operating cashflow the adjusted operating cashflow shows the impact on that debt from operating activities it is adjusted for special items and timing effects that balance out over time the utilization of nuclear provisions is not included as you will remember we consider this as a financial cashflow as when the nuclear provisions are utilized they can be refinanced via financial debt in h one the adjusted operating cashflow top €2000000000 and is build up on the high adjusted ebitda as well as a positive effect in working capital change in operating working capital of €437000000 is mainly driven by the payment from the british capacity market from 2018 and nineteen which we received in q one as well as the reduction of gas inventories for the full year 2020 we expect this line item to remain positive for the same reasons turning to the details on the development of net debt at the end of june net debt increased to roughly €7800000000 1st and foremost this was due to timing effects from hatching activities of roughly €1000000000 mainly related to co two another driver of net debt is the company is net cash investments clearly linked to our strategy to expand in renewable energy the dividend payment for fiscal year 2019 is already reflected in the net debt figure at h one we see a leverage factor of around three times net debt to core adjusted ebitda at year end which considers investment of approximately €400000000 for the acquisition of the two part seven nordex development pipeline volatility in commodity prices and interest rates could temporarily drive it slightly above three times but if this is the case we are confident that we would return to our target level in the medium term without an impact on our plan capex program finally moving on to the outlook for fiscal 2020 as i already said we confirmed our outlook for this year adjusted ebitda of the core business will come out between twofifteen and €2450000000 adjusted ebitda for the group we raised between twoseven to €3000000000 and adjusted ebit between onetwo to onefive for both adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebit we expect to see results at the upper end of the guides our guidance for adjusted net income is 850000000 to €1150000000 and we expect it to be in the middle of the range due to the one off in the financial results which we experienced in q one dividend target is unchanged €85 cents per share for fiscal year 2020 and with this i conclude my remarks and i am now happy to take all your questions thank you marcus and as always if you have time you know please stick to two questions only operator please start the q a session ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask a question please press one on your telephone keypad if you change your mind and wish to withdraw your question please press two you will be advised when to ask your question our 1st question is coming from the line of avanda savinasca from credit suisse please go ahead good afternoon i am avanda savinasca credit suisse two questions from me the 1st one is on the negative power price in the uk there is a clause in the most of the cfds to say that if the power price goes negative for more than six hours then basically cfd is to apply for zero for that that time does it does the rule applies for all your assets in the uk and it is and that is the same or similar rule exist in other markets that rwe operates in and the 2nd question is on the renewables target growth when can we expect rwe to rise the annual renewables target growth i mean we have seen recently ng including the annual targets from three to four gigawatt per annum thank you very much yeah thanks for your question i mean yes the negative price rule applies to the uk and we have a similar one but the technical details are slightly different also in germany i mean i have to admit i do not know the exact details and so far i think i mean you can you can usually plan it because you know your power price forecast on a on a quarterly hour basis for the full year and i mean it has not had a a significant negative effect which was not planned for us even this year so for us it is it is a minor techna technicality on and if you want the details i think please call the team also to understand where the drum measured from the uk one on the targets i mean we already g gave you an indication with the nordex pipeline that comes on top of our targets but i mean our targets have been communicated in a couple of months ago so do not expect that we give you new targets every month so when we deem it appropriate that we need to update the the market about new plans or revise plans we will do it but we will do not do it on a quarterly basis thanks i mean i would appreciate if you could get back to me on the on the details on the technical details on the negative power price i know that it is not the issue for this year or next year but we see more and more often negative power price on the market yes we will come back thank you very much but i mean i i i just to remark i mean the moment it becomes viable you usually i mean but as the team comes back but i think i mean for us i think it is an overrated issue also going forward because what we see is we get more and more flexibility in the system in many markets so the periods of very negative power prices should naturally come to an end i mean not for the specific plan you cannot do anything for a cfd plan but the market overall because incentivizes investments in flexibilities like batteries and that these if you will get more of that it will definitely take at 1st the negative power prices away so we do not see it as a big issue going forward but the team will come back on the technicalities thanks a lot thank you avanda next question please the next question is coming from the line of vincent from jp morgan please go ahead yes good morning good afternoon quick one could you provide us a bit more color on the nordex pipeline but at an asset level so we understand we see the geographies so mainly it seems to be a footprint in in the french onshore market so we understand the strategy behind it it would be great if we could get a bit more color on the on the project level while the big projects which are in there and basically what is the expected time for contribution there so that would be the question one and bouncing back on this what is your view regarding acquisition of renewable assets given current prices buying a pipeline is one thing buying existing operating assets is another one do you see that like value accretive and would you in such a situation consider potentially even sounding large acquisitions by reconsidering your thank you very much yeah thanks for your question let me start with the latter one i think for us i mean having a a a deep pipeline where we can invest our money it would not be let us let us put it value optimal to actually acquire existing assets because we want to we want to build them we want to operate them and us becoming a financial investor i mean i see it difficult that that is really very accretive it is a different thing if if you can maybe swap assets here and there to to to change the portfolio mix and get some synergies here and there but i i do not see it as very relevant for the near future so i mean we are interested in strengthening our pipeline especially as we have done with nordex i will come to that in a minute but acquiring existing assets asset by asset is not part of our investment investment plan i mean on the nordex pipeline i mean let me let me start 1st with why this was strategically important as i said in my speech because france is a very attractive onshore market with i mean the double sided cfd for twenty years in inflation link we have seen prices in the last options between 62 and €67 so you can see that that is very attractive and it was on the european landscape the one target market where we really missed the presence so it was really good opportunity for us we looked into the pipeline in in detail as you can imagine in the due diligence and i mean we have very good locations good wind conditions clusters in in geographic proximity that that they provide efficiencies and i mean i can i will not talk about specific locations now because the transaction is not closed and we are bound to confidentiality so i can give you a view of how the portfolio will look like i will give you more color in a minute but i cannot talk about specific sites i mean we can we can give you more color after the closing of the transaction what we have already said is fifteen of the pipeline is is close to fid or very late development stage and we expect the 1st cuds at 21 on average we would at least expect 100 megawatts from the pipeline per annum so that we have by 25 another 500 megawatts under operations including the the purchase price of 400 2500000 we expect that the irs of the projects with us in our given range the capital market day we set for mature onshore pv markets we expect five fourfive to eight but please i mean this is a very mature market and we had to buy it so do not expect it at the upper end of the fourfive to eight but clearly in the in the range we saw the price as attractive i mean it is always very difficult to judge or assess the price from the outside in but we have also seen other pipelines we have participated in many due diligence in france so we know also our other pipelines look like and just looking at it from the outside in we have seen acquisitions in that market which were priced at 150 to €250 per megawatt and we are at the lower end of that but i mean that is very difficult comparing prices on that level pipeline by pipeline the split of the of the maturity of the pipeline is more or less in line with the maturity of our overall of our overall pipeline i mean around as i said fifteen is close to fid and late stage we have around thirty mid stage and the remaining part is an early stage development thank you very much thank you next question please the next question is coming from the line of peter bisztyga from bofa securities please go ahead hi yeah thanks for taking my question so just a another one on the nordex portfolio could you sort of tell us how the 400000000 acquisition price and the i guess additional capex that you are going to be spending over the next couple of years fits into your existing 5000000000 capex budget does it display something else out of that budget or is it an addition and i guess if it is an addition then where have you found the extra balance sheet capacity please and then my 2nd question as she was just on carbon which has obviously been very volatile over the last couple of quarters i guess your supply and trading division might have profited from that but i was just wondering could you could you give us your views as to what is actually been driving the carbon price particularly you know as it reached the sort of mid to high high 20s thank you yeah peter thanks for the question on the nordex pipeline yes it will come on top of the 5000000000 as we have said with the announcement of the transaction and now question regarding funding i mean as i have said in the speech we expect to be within the leverage target of the three times net debt to ebitda including the 400000000 and i mean we have a lot of moving parts i mean if we assume and i also hinted to that that commodity prices especially gas and co two and interest rates stay where they were at end of june then we have a good view what are the moving cash items operating cashflow investments we know our divestment i hinted to georgia biomed you are going to pay back the hybrids i mean that is all very stable and we can foresee that we end the year at around three but of course we cannot control commodity prices and we cannot control interest rates but these are only i mean timing effects i mean this will normalize over time that is why are confident if we move up then it is really come down without impacting the capex then later the project investments after the i mean when we when we do cuds that will be part of the of the capital allocation approach but of course as i hinted to it will come on top of our existing targets but i mean 100 megawatts here and there that will not move the needle on the company of our size and carbon sorry carbon sorry exactly carbon yeah i mean even even within the team here we have two different views and i think that is a good reflection of how i see the market short term is more bearish because i mean with the covid situation with very low gas prices significant fuel switching muted industrial demand i mean the demand for comm certificates is definitely much lower than it has been it has been expected on the other hand it is also clear that the more politic the mid to long term view is more bullish because i mean somehow the european commission needs to implement the more aggressive co two reduction target and it does not matter whether they go to i do not know fifty 55 or even sixty reduction by 2030 a significant part of that maybe even more than half needs to come from the euets and that will definitely mean that prices will go up and maybe what is different this time than in the last financial crisis in the last financial crisis we have seen that a lot of industrials who were sitting on excess certificates were in financial trouble and they needed to sell just to to get to get liquidity this is with a huge program of the central banks and the physical support now different maybe some industrials to take more the political long term view and use the liquidity they still have to buy cheaper than they expect the prices to be i think these are the two camps short term long term and since this market is nothing you can fundamentally analyze that it is always a sentiment question and i think the more dominant factor is definitely the mid term to long term political view i can simply not imagine that if prices go down to €fifteen again that the politicians will sit there and do nothing okay interesting thanks very much for that thank you next question please the next question is coming from the line of alberto kendalvile from goldman sachs please go ahead thank you and good afternoon the 1st one is to go back to the e on stake we heard in the past that maybe badly counted about half of that could be used leaked net liabilities and the rest could be used for growth could you please confirm that and when it comes to growth can you help us understand the logic would it be contingent to maybe big offshore the wind or perhaps to identifying something external like you just did with with nordex and become even bigger and secondly it is just thinking about them in a from a different perspective like rwe as a potential target so we are seeing all companies very quickly moving into the space you know vp with a fifty gigawatts next target by by 2030 company like yourself would be like a plug and play you know developing with existing capacity so do you think there is a race to scale here and what would be the best way for you to fend off a fact like this one yeah alberto thanks for the thanks for the question i mean on the e on stage i can just reconfirm that everything is to valid which we have set in the past i mean the e on state is not tied to the leaked net provisions we just said we currently use it we could also back the leak net provisions by other financial portfolios and i mean when you look at the the the potential sourcing of of financing yes i mean we potentially need half of it to back the leaked net provision and the other half would be available to capital rotation but i mean that has not changed it is exactly what we said before usually we have two questions so you have three which one do you want me to answer now the the oil question or the other one i start with the oil question and then let us see whether we still have time perfect thank you because i think that is the more interesting one i i do agree that it could that we could not and the situation that it is the race for scarcity because i mean it might be difficult to if you put together all the all the capital investment plans of everybody around in this in this field it is almost impossible to employ that amount of money until let us say 2030 because they are simply not enough project as you have more lead times to do it so existing pipelines become much more valuable i think the investors of big oil and others needs to ask themselves the question whether it is really green a green investment if you buy existing stuff from others because that is not a positive contribution it is just i mean over bidding in prices so i mean on the question whether we could become a target or not i think your company is well positioned to help the oil companies figuring that out and we sit and wait what happened got it well i mean that is speculation i mean that is not in our control what so what can we do i mean i am i am actually happy that also others see the field of renewables and the overall power sector is attractive because that is our that is the core of our strategy and i think we have all the ingredients to be successful we have a very experienced team we have a deep pipeline which actually needed to be developed over a decade and of course we have have investment discipline and we will ensure that we put the money where we get a decent return and we will continue doing that i mean developing our pipeline investing in good projects and also being on the technological forefront be it battery speed h two or be it floating off shore where i actually do not see limiting factors if the the long term market grows because the long term market grows over renewables and also power overall is i mean tremendous globally the trend to electrification and to green is very supporting and there also do not see a limiting factor of funds because if you have good projects i think investors are actually looking for investment opportunities and now you need to ask yourself who actually brings what to the table i mean the market closes there itself funds is not the problem so what you need is experience in the pipeline thank you that is great thank you alberto next question please the next question is coming from the line of rob pauline from morgan stanley please go ahead hi yes good afternoon everyone so 1st question markus is please talk about the eu recovery fund and how do you think internally that rwe will benefit from this and a a 2nd part to that not a 2nd question can you help us understand practically how the money flows from a number on a presentation slide into actual projects cause that is still seems very unclear and the 2nd question and hopefully a lot simpler is you have security to make your agent in uk could you provide an update on the process you have for leases for some of the other extensions you would liked that the cmd namely greater gabbard galloper and rampion has that been successful is that underway or is that not this year is business thank you let me start with the easier one rob i mean we are working on the lease extensions and we it will be around 800 to onetwo 800 megawatts to onetwo gigawatts and we are optimistic that we can finalize it and by then book it as as at least secured by the end of the year but it is going it is going well and on the european recovery fund let me start with the 2nd part of the question yeah i mean i think we will we will we will learn about it over the next let us say two quarters until the end of the year how the flow of the money will really go because usually the european union works in a way that it is just they do not have they have only little funds like the just transition fund and stuff like that where it is double digit 1000000 where they put money directly into specific projects usually the european union is budget is a huge kind of i mean shifting mechanisms so people are paying net in and getting money in that out so what now as a next step needs to happen is that the individual countries needs to come up with programs and plans where to invest the money and if that ticks all boxes they will get their proportional share of the money so we need to wait for national actions where they kind of put and where they want to invest and how they support certain things is also unclear i mean you can do it with direct subsidy you can do it with the remuneration framework is simpler simpler financing i mean it is it is still totally unclear and the only thing what we can do and that is the 1st part of your question i mean we are we are also now actively looking especially in in the in the evolving h two sector and of course what is obvious is if more renewable power is needed and you get indirect remuneration from and for renewable power via the support of demand for green hydrogen we are definitely ready to build more renewables but we are also willing to invest into the production of hydrogen that depends on what agreement we find with the partners is it better of our money or there and how do you structure the contract the question is who puts money into transportation maybe maybe more others it remains to be seen whether that needs to be unbundled i many open questions so i think the important step now is to get the right partners together and thinking through what is feasible and you should usually start with the demand i mean who actually needs the hydrogen and then you you do you backward yet and i mean i think these are the big fears our account business already saw especially renewables and storage technology and the new one which will come in additional is hydrogen but also i want to kind of not spoil the party but i mean if you talk about profits from especially hydrogen probably we need to wait a couple of years before it is relevant in terms of investments but also in terms of profitability and maybe the kickstart of the of the solar and wind business is a good proxy it could easily take at least half a decade maybe a decade before it becomes a relevant profit figure that is super interesting thank you very much and good luck with the with the lease function thank you we will update you whenever we have good news thanks rob next question please the next question is coming from the line of sam harry from ubs please go ahead hi good afternoon everybody thanks for the presentation and great results today i just wanted to ask two questions one on returns and one on farm down so one on returns i think you had spoken at the cmd about 100 to 300 bits spread above watts as being typical in the renewable business these days a 100 to 300 bits does not actually sound that crazy as an estimate of the watts actually as well and i do not know the lower the watts the lower the spread that you need to make the same kind of value creation ratio so it just seems to me that a year or two ago it was coming to talk about high single digit returns in renewables or mid to high single digit returns i am talking about un levered project returns but are we now more likely to be going into the low single digit returns territory and is that you know is that possibly a fair outlook for offshore wind as well wherever returns if they have been a bit higher just loves to love to know what what your thoughts are about that that the kind of industry level and then my farm down question is just look i feel like we are going to see over time and more and more pressure from auctions and tenders and developers may be eventually forced to bring the farm down partner with them to the tender so if you like the competitive pressure of auctions will mean that this kind of extra value of the charge that you currently get in a farm down might eventually get captured by the consumer or you know the public policy during the tender so i am just wondering do you think that is a reasonable expectation a few thoughts about whether in the future you will sort of as standard go to auctions or tenders with a with a finance partner alongside and have you talked to any specific funds or partners about that kind of long term approach returns and farm down thank you sam thanks thanks for the discussion i mean on returns i agree that we definitely see that the vex are coming coming down i mean i also carefully read your your report and you also put now very low numbers to vex which i think is is the right thing and but i am not there that i would say we see now low single digit returns for for for offshore that is not where we are i mean definitely if we have promised you the average higher out of an un levered project of 650 basis points for the for the investment program we have outlined until 2022 potentially the absolute returns not the value creation but the absolute returns of the next capex program will be lower but also because the vex is significantly lower but when you talk about the absolute level i am not at low medium i mean low for me is three and three something it will come down but i mean what we see is not for the for the projects which we which we have after the 22 horizon already visibility of the profitability i would not call that low it is more medium sam now i am not sure whether i got your question i do not see i clearly do not see that you have tenders where you need to bring your financing or where you have an advantage if you do not go into the auction alone and getting an advantage when you already bring the financing partner i have not seen things like that what is more and more obvious is that also now the new tender decide to give you one example for taiwan that local i mean local production becomes a dominant theme that if you want to put money in some place you need to prove that it is actually good for the regions where you get the lease it is good for the people you create jobs you use local suppliers and it is becoming more and more support very important but what i do not see is that it is advantage that you already with the auction say that you are going to find out of bring a financing partner interesting want to have clarification no no no that is fine i do not want to take up too much time but i am sure we will talk about this again and thank you thank you for to them we will thank you thank you sam next question the next question is coming from the line of john musk from rbc please go ahead yes morning good afternoon everyone firstly on the hedging of the outright book it looks as if you have accelerated the fully hedged portion particularly in 2022 obviously it is a quite a small chart but from maybe roughly thirty to fifty which is probably more than you would normally do in a quarter so just wanted to understand some thinking behind that is there a particular view on on power prices or spreads that these levels and then secondly on the the three times leverage factor just to confirm that is not including any potential asset rotation at the moment because there are some some headlines in in recent days around some of your your offshore assets that you might be looking to sell down john thanks for the question i mean on hedging you are right we increased the outright hedge so but we actually closed by that was the spread position is there i mean what you could read into it is if you think spreads are fair is part of of de risking now to close it and i think if you look at current market prices and spreads i think everybody expects a 100 recovery by 22 and if you want to lock that in you better close that position now and that is what we have done that does not tell you what we i mean we do not know how the global economy will look like but it is better to lock it in now than to keep it open on the leverage side the three times a net debt to ebitda includes our plans on capital rotation so it is it is it is our net investment target i mean we have outlined a net investment of around onefive to 2000000000 per annum so if we are going to invest gross more given the the the profile and it also includes divestment i have already said that we divested which is not yet in the financials georgia biomass for close to $200000000 175 and some adjustments and i mean on the other things we are considering our options so we will bring it to the net figure but i now do not want to speculate on gross and net because we always said that the leading metrics is thirteen gigawatt net so whatever we do on disposals we will reach the thirteen gigawatt net and also the ebitda guide is for 2022 it is a net guidance yeah so and how are we going to achieve is this how much costs and how much disposals that we need to give them the current uncertainties in some markets we need to have some flexibility and i mean if you now want to get a comment on the on the on the rumors on this providence i mean the comment is no comment because sir i mean we will update you when we have taken a decision not we will not update you whether we have on a certain assets a market chest or not okay thank you thank you john next question please the next question is coming from the line of deepa venkateswaran from bernstein please go ahead thank you so my two questions for in the us so if we do have a possibility for joe biden and they bring in the 2000000000000 plan i was just wondering how does that change would you accelerate your growth your de conversion of your pipeline in the us or practically how might it change anything for you and my 2nd question is is on the is on germany itself so obviously germany has pretty lofty targets for 2030 but we are seeing the auctions are continuing to go under subscribe on onshore wind do you see this situation changing with any kind of reforms and would you be taking the lead as i do not know germany is national champion on this too to also grab maybe more more of the shares and the german renewable markets thank you yeah deepa thanks for the question the 1st one is easy we actually do not expect a significant impact from a potential federal election outcome in the us on our business i mean i mean even today i mean many things depend on non state level of course the tech support is a federal thing but also the current administration extended the ptcs given the covid situation so i mean as it is pure speculation i would say it will not make a huge difference and on germany of course we would like to do more in onshore and in onshore in germany and we see under subscribed options the problem is that the projects are not ready to be bid into the options we have permitting issues we have pending law cases and so on but there is some interesting development because the minister of economic affairs he tabled a law a draft law yesterday or two days ago where they really want to accelerate the permitting process and the court proceedings and they also introduced something which is now heavily discussed also with the ngos that even if you if you dispute a permission in court that should still until the decision is there allow the construction to go on and that would be both very helpful so speedier processes and you can go straight to the final court level to get a decision and you do not need to go to the hierarchy and also that nobody can by pure tactics in the court delay projects but let us see how the draft will go through parliament but the draft version at least looks very favorable for the industry perfect thank you thank you deepa next question please the next question is coming from the line of petro solowski from ct please go ahead hi good afternoon this is petro solowski from ct i have two questions the 1st one would be a small on nordex can you say what is the kind of a current cost structure of it how is it significant number small number in annual euro figure as a cost as you take over the whole company and secondly i wanted to ask you on this year to go back to this discussion because before the covid nineteen i thought that is an equilibrium which is determined by the switching between coal and gas as power plants now if we take coal assets out what will be according to you your expectation the next equilibrium kind of threshold how we will the market will restore longer term equity of demand the co two project we should be looking at elimination of co two what is the next thing to look for petro thanks for the question i mean on nordex it is easy i mean we take over the company yes but it is a developing company so what you actually have is the salaries and opex for the seventy people and of course the development expenditures for the to develop projects but i mean part of that is also capitalized so it is a very i mean in terms of addition to the cost base it is almost not relevant i mean the most relevant one will be the webex for the project and then the capex on co two equilibrium i mean yeah actually the interesting thing is that the current co two price is already above the fuel switching price from hardcore to gas the gas taking most of the times looks gas 1st then liquid and then hard coal so if you take out hard coal now that should not change the equilibrium between for the co two relevant shoot switching price there should not be a change the interesting elements as i said it is already trading abo above the current level that can only be explained that actually the industry expects a shortage and this is always difficult to judge because this market is not in any of the market it is also since you can easily keep your certificates for longer you can also say it is partly a view on what to come in future years so i would not overrate the annual price which causes fuel switching that was in the old days of oversupply a good indicator but now the significant more time is to come maybe that is not the relevant indicator anymore okay thank you thank you petro next question please the next question is coming from the line of elsien mamadov from bloomberg intelligence please go ahead hi there two questions from me please the 1st one is on negative prices and i am sorry if you covered it before i missed the very beginning basically reported yesterday it was a small issue for them because of you know if the price has been negative for the subsequent few hours your cfd and whatnot you know you can not recoup it yourself with it so is that have you seen it being an issue with you for the for the 2nd quarter and do you think the negative prices will become more or less prevalent going forward the 2nd question is on hydrogen it can w where do you think the value will lie is it in the production of hydrogen transportation of hydrogen converting it to other fuels like kerosene et cetera where do you think the money will be and will you be a big player there thank you if i could answer the last question life would be easier if i think it is too early to tell it also depends on how will the how will the incentivization framework look like and how big will the market become and of course it has has the two angles you can incentivize green production and you can incentivize demand for green hydrogen and in the end it will be then kind of demand supply on on on on the different angles where i actually do not see scarcity in the production of green hydrogen in terms of electrolyzers i mean that is a proven technology where we definitely have scarcity already today is renewable projects because i mean if you believe on the demand for our gas and i have no doubts that there is a good assessment we need so much green energy that every project which is actually in the pipeline of somebody needs to be built one day it is just a question of time so this is really a scarcity on the demand side i think that will be a competition by the off takers who is who can who can who can do it cheaper it is nothing for us i mean if you if you ask me where i see our role it is definitely on the production side green power potentially depending on how the consortia will will look like also the production of green hydrogen and then the structuring of the off take i mean as we are currently also a very relevant player in gas trading and providing solutions to customers and that will also our role be in h two and you can do that without producing as we currently do with lng and natural gas the 1st question on negative prices i mean for us i mean we have seen it in the uk and germany but it is not it was not a relevant issue i mean it was not a big number okay thanks a lot appreciate it thank you next question please the next question is coming from the line of from please go ahead yes hi thank you two questions from my side as well i was just wondering if if we could get a little bit more color from you around the sort of how do you see this as the value creation opportunity relating to the nordex pipeline especially the sort of the near term assets because you you mentioned it is a it is a mature market some of the near term projects are fairly well developed close to scale sort of market where we had scale in the past i was interested in understanding a little bit more how you see the sort of the value proposition from commodity and i guess the 2nd question is relating to that i think you mentioned earlier right this was one of the markets you did not have presence and and therefore you were you were sort of looking for opportunities looking at your existing portfolio either from a pipeline perspective or a skill perspective are there any sort of specific gaps that you see that you think sort of this sort of scaling up put sort of benefit benefi you quite beneficial thank you yeah perfect thanks for the question i mean on i would not say that we failed on france because where we we were simply not present it was always a strategic target to get a foot in the door and now we have not only a foot in the door but a a significant pipeline and the nordex team was actually very successful in the french market i think they are ranked number two in terms of success rates in two auctions in the last years and they have not only built this pipeline their business model was to build and then when they were close to fid and they got them to the auction they sold the projects to their potential customers and i mean what what is the value creation potential for us i mean it is we continue what they have done in the past and we close our strategic gap and the team is not there just to deliver the pipelines which we have acquired they will continuously develop projects and the french market overall is very attractive it is it is not not so densely populated like germany so you have more space they have huge build outs target and even better remuneration framework with a double sided twenty year inflation linked cfd so if you believe that onshore wind in france is good it will definitely create value and i mean we are a firm believer that also the political environment in france and their targets was to go straight from nuclear to renewables will not be will not be questioned by some of the next government so it is it is a very intact cross platform the gaps in our pipeline i mean i think it is always good to be honest i mean if you look into that we are very wind heavy so doing more on the solar side would definitely be good let us see how we can achieve it i mean we have definitely ramped up our our development activities and you will see more to come especially in the attractive solar market like in the us but still it is compared to the wind side underrepresented and the other one which is definitely significantly tougher maybe impossible to close if you look into our offshore pipeline there is in terms of cod dates and that is historically explainable because e on stopped and energy had also funding issues but we have a gap between 22 where we will commission trytanol and then maybe the next project will be commissioned according to the pipeline at around 25 maybe 26 and that is i mean this is a profile how will how it looks like and if you ask me you have two wishes i would like to fill that time gap and i would like to have more on the solar side thank you very clear thank you thank you ahmad next question please the next question is coming from the line of firmino mocado from man glg please go ahead thanks for allowing me hello just i mean two quick questions one you have seen deep offshore winds floating i mean what is your view in terms of the the technologies that are around and you know what you envision that will be the the role of rwe okay and thanks for the question because i mean i can use it as an opportunity to clarify what our interest is i mean we are not turbine manufacturers so we are not betting on a certain technology and i have no view and also the team has no view what is the potential best floating technology for which market and which sea sea conditions so what we said is let us participate in different technologies be it the be it concrete or be it steel i mean you have also different i mean i am not an expert on that but you probably you are you have totally different approaches to that and what we said is we want to be part of consortium of several technologies to be an early learner we want to learn how this stuff works because it is a bit different than a fixed bottom it is in terms of wind field in terms of maintenance costs and so on and we want to learn that with different technologies that does not mean that we will in future if we go into offshore only use the technologies where we have been a partner earlier on we can also use others so and you you asked for our role our role is we want to be we want to construct and we want to operate also offshore wind farms but we do not want to build the turbines or the or the the foundation very clear and and just perhaps to tie up with alberta is question and the role of oil companies i mean you actually that depo fall you know it would be that to do you know in in in in joint venture or in conception with oil companies that they have experienced from offshore i mean that is that is speculation i mean but if you look at our partnership landscape i mean we are operating one offshore wind farm together with equinor i mean they are partners of one of our farms one of the floating technologies we are in via together with shell in but i think i mean that can go the one way or the other i mean it is too early i mean we are open to discussions but we could also do it ourselves i mean and and and related question w when i compare rwe and your strategy and you know what you want it to be with the with the leaders in the in renewables so you know in europe the settling one of the components missing on the investment piece is is is the full commitment to a growing dividend i mean w when do you think that you can have that full commitment and you know what kind of growth do you envision that you know you you you you can sustain i would not compare to i mean enol is a fully integrated utilities with i mean most of the value sitting in the networks and they do not operate offshore i mean our business model is i mean is d is different we have actually given a clear commitment to a growing dividend we said we want to continuously grow with the grow the dividend broadly in why line with the development of of of the earnings of our operating core business and since the core business given our investment plans will definitely grow also the dividend should grow and we discussed it before so i said i mean a good proxy is maybe the ¢five on top every year which we have now delivered for the last years i mean that can be maybe even more because of course the percentage goes to on if you stick to a to an absolute cent number but i that is a commitment we have given we want to grow the dividend in line with earnings development in core bu in the core business but if the core business for whatever reason cannot sustain i mean cannot grow i mean what is your commitment and you will cut the dividend in line with the with the decline of earnings on the core business you should know i mean we should stick to the two questions rule so i will still answer that one but then we should give the next one the opportunity to ask questions otherwise we need to do it in a in a in a one on one session obviously i mean if you do not have enough growth opportunities i mean the 1st thing which is questionable then is why do you only pay out fifty of your practice as dividends because you cannot employ it somewhere so that would totally change the dividend policy but it is not a question of a cap then thank you next question please as a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press one on your telephone keypad the next question is coming from the line of rob pauli rob pauline from morgan stanley please go ahead yeah hi rob pauline i rejoined to ask another question if that is okay but given you have answered or not answered the question on the humber can i ask about us deferred tax liabilities a wonderful subject a us expose utility reported yesterday a large tax charge as projects reached cod and they entered into a tax equity partnership so will we see a similar tax impact at rwe as it reaches cod on your us projects thank you the tax answer the question to the text the answer to the text question is easy no we do not expect any huge number but maybe the situation is different because you said a us utility because we do not have tax capacity ourselves so since we do not have tax capacity our taxes in the us are are are zero and we need to actually bring in financing partners to reap the tax benefits so the tax effect on our business is more or less zero for a long time no sorry markus i said a us exposed company it is actually a european no we do not see anything like that and you you you blame me on not answering a humber question what was the humber question no humber humber offshore humber i know we want to say humber but probably you do not get a lot of money falling from from some trees no i did not answer the humber question because i said i mean this is a rumor and we do not comment on rumors what i just can reiterate is of course exit portfolio management is part of the strategy but we will give you an update when we have taken a decision and as long as we have not taken a decision to do something we do not talk about it fair enough thank you thank you are there further questions we have no further questions in the queue so i will hand you back to your host for any concluding remarks perfect thank you all for dialing in stay safe and healthy and speak to you again latest at our q three have a good day bye bye thank you for joining today is call you may now disconnect",
            "prediction": "welcome to the rwe conference call markos keber cfo of rwe ag will inform you about the developments in the 1st half of fiscal 2020 i will now hand over to thomas dannenmayer thank you anika good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us today to discuss rwe is results for the 1st six months of the year i am joined by our cfo marcus kreber who will run through the presentation before we move on to q a later in the call as in q one this year in order to compare like for like our presentation focuses on the pro forma figures in comparison to 2019 meaning that assets taken over from eon in the 3rd quarter last year are included for adjusted ebitda and ebit for the full year 2019 and with this let me hand over to markus for the update on h 1202 markus over to you we confirm our full year guidance and now expect adjusted ebitda to be at the upper end of the guidance we also confirm our target to increase the dividend payment to ¢85 per share for this year our clear target is to meet a leverage factor of around three times adjusted core ebitda to net debt at year end and we are delighted that the asset swap with eon is finally fully closed the legal integration and hr integration have already been completed the teams are now operating in the target management structure let me remind you that the energy activities which we transferred back to rwe have been recorded in our group figures already as they were commercially assigned to us we do not see any relevant effect from the final closing in our financials what else we are excited about our latest announcement on the deal to acquire nordex twoseven gw development pipeline this gives us great option for future growth and a broad entry into the french market i will come back to that in a minute speaking of coal and nuclear business we are pleased that the coal phaseout act which found broad consensus was brought into german law the lignite phaseout is supplemented by a public law contract drawn up by the federal government and the operators which will pass the german parliament after the summer break the law and contract are subject to approval under eu state aid law we expect this process to happen in autumn this year with this we now have a clear path on how to exit from our remaining coal operations gentlemen let me briefly come back to the transaction with nordex on page four this transaction is a strategic pipeline enhancement and our broad market entry into france we are pleased to announce that our existing pipeline of 22 gigawatts will be replaced by new projects to be built on top of the targets announced at the capital market day we expect tus as early as next year and additional capacity of approximately 500 megawatts in operations by 2025 we are also pleased that this creates a great opportunity to enter the french market with onenine gigawatts of development projects in france of which roughly 300 megawatts are in operation together with the pipeline and an experienced team of seventy professional mostly based in france will join us to drive our growth ambitions in france further we have already operated assets the pipeline gives additional options spain approximately 400 megawatt sweden approximately 400 megawatt and poland small position of more than ten megawatt what are the next steps we have agreed an exclusive put option with nordex on a purchase price of €400000000 nordex kicks off the consultation process with the french works council which needs to be finalized before the put option can be exercised it is also assumed that the transaction could be completed in the 4th quarter of this year now back to the financials for h 12020 on page five in our core business adjusted ebitda increased by nine to €1500000000 as a result of a good performance in all segments generally speaking broadly speaking the wind and solar business is progressing very well the hydro biomass gas division mainly benefited from the resumption of the gb capacity market and the supply and trading division outperformed after a successful start into the year which continued in the 2nd quarter our installed capacity remains unchanged at eightnine gigawatts but there is more to come in the 2nd half of the year amongst other things we have taken the fid for the hikari park solar farm in the us with a capacity of 196 megawatts and the co located forty megawatt battery which is due to be commissioned in 21 the project is under the investment tax credit itc regime regarding the period after 2022 the ablemarle more offshore wind farm has secured an agreement for lease with the crown estate the project is an extension of our operating gwynt y mor wind farm the additional capacity is 300 mw what are the next steps the development of the project will continue with a view to participating in cfp auction rounds in three to five furthermore we welcome the announcement from the irish government that the dublin array offshore project has been designated as one of seven relevant projects meaning it will be fast tracked to the new marine planning regime the project will add 300 mw of capacity and is currently in the development phase subject to an updated consent application and investment decision construction could begin in 2024 with cud in 26 and lastly we are now participating in the 3rd floating demonstration project together with the university of maine as well as mitsubishi corporation we will develop a demonstration project of the coast of maine we continue to drive floating offshore wind because we see great potential for floating wind farms worldwide in particular in countries like the us with deeper coastal waters let us move on to an update of our construction program so far we are progressing well apart from some covid nineteen related delays mainly at us construction sites so that we had to ship cvd of approximately 500 megawatt from twenty to 21 due to the adjusted commissioning plan we expect the overall financial impact for this year to be a small to medium double digit €1000000 amount please note that the ptc income level of the us project is secured in any cases now we will take a look at the status of the individual projects we presented to you at q one starting with the offshore division our trieste offshore construction work started earlier this year and everything is progressing as planned at the caspian sea project contacts with main suppliers are signed so preparation work is continuing and going according to plan construction work will start in q two the clockerock forest onshore wind farm is already generating and receiving revenues from the contract for difference as soon as wind farm testing is completed and cod is reached we will report it as installed capacity good availability at the cronell onshore site has been achieved and the commissioning of the individual wind turbines is ramping up the actual commissioning date is scheduled for this month one part of the project namely raymond west with 200 megawatt will slip into q 121 whereas the commissioning of raymond east with 200 megawatt is expected in the 2nd half of q 420 at the lyman dale solar farm the registration process took more time than expected due to the current circumstances co two has therefore slipped into q 121 in total we will bring onethree gigawatts online in the 2nd half of the year mainly back loaded with that we can move on to the details of the individual segments the optronix wind division realized the outlook for the offshore division is positive with a revenue increase of nineteen thanks to higher wind speeds in the 1st quarter gross cash investments in h one amount to €316000000 mainly driven by the construction of new vessels the sale of the seabreeze installation vessel is the main driver for gross cash divestments we confirm the outlook for the offshore division solar division increased twelve year on year and adjusted ebitda amounted to €273000000 at h one weather conditions in the 1st quarter of this year were above average most of the gross cash investments are for us onshore projects big raimond scoop rich and casadauga despite the small to medium double digit €1000000 negative impact from tatar commissioning faces and the delay at big rameau and lymondale we confirm the outlook for the full year the hydro biomass gas division delivered a good performance over the 1st six months higher earnings results mainly from the british capacity market in contrast to the strong 1st water at h one our power plant dispatch has been normalized in june we signed a contract to sell our georgia biomass business to nbeva partners for a purchase price of 175000000 us dollars the transaction was closed at the end of july after successful merger clearance the disposal is already reflected in the guidance we gave you in march the ebitda contribution for performer 22 is zero as we have already reported to the market the fire at the emsland power plant has caused an interruption to the biomass co firing which we expect to last until november 22nd this will impact the output by a small to medium double digit 1000000 amount despite this we also confirm the guidance for this division moving on to another quarter of favorable earnings development from the supply and trading division at h one adjusted ebita amounts to €322000000 on the back of a strong trading performance and good results from the gas and energy business we did not expect the division to replicate the exceptional performance of the 1st six months of last year the division is outlook is 150 to €350000000 given a strong performance we expect to end at the upper end or even above for the full year we confirm the division outlook moving on to earnings drivers down to adjusted net income adjusted net income amounts to €795000000 due to the high adjusted ebitda of rwe group the negative effect in the financial result of €150000000 from q one adjustments in tax are applied with a general tax rate of fifteen in line with the expected mid term tax level for the group the tax rate of fifteen has been derived from all income streams it is based on blended local tax rates the use of loss carried forward and the low taxation of dividends including the eon and enel dividends and now on to the adjusted operating cash flow the adjusted operating cash flow shows the impact on their debt from operating activities it is adjusted for special items and timing effects a balance out over time the utilization of nuclear provisions is not included as you will remember we consider this as a financial cash flow as when the nuclear provisions are utilized they can be refinanced via in h one the adjusted operating cash flow is €2000000000 and is build up on the high adjusted ebitda as well as a positive effect in working capital the change in working capital of €437000000 is mainly driven by the payment from the british capacity market from 2018 and nineteen which we received in q one as well as a reduction of gas inventories for the full year 2020 we expect this line item to remain positive for the same reasons turning to the details on the development of net debt at the end of june net debt increased to roughly €7800000000 1st and foremost this was due to timing effects from hedging activities of roughly €1000000000 mainly related to co two another driver of net debt is the company we see a leverage factor of around three times net debt to core ebitda at year end which considers the investment of approximately €400000000 for the acquisition of the 2700000000 cubic meters development pipeline finally moving on to the outlook for fiscal 2020 as i already said we confirm our outlook for this year adjusted ebitda of the core business will come out between twofifteen and €2450000000 for adjusted ebita for the group we range between twoseven to €3000000000 and adjusted ebita for both we expect to see results at the upper end of the guidance our guidance for adjusted net income is 850000000 to €1150000000 and we expect it to be in the middle of the range due to the one of the financial results good morning ladies and gentlemen this is marko speaking the dividend target is unchanged at €85 cents per share for fiscal year 2020 and with this i conclude my remarks and i am now happy to take all your questions thank you marko and as always in view of time please stick to two questions only operator please start the q a session hello if you change your mind and wish to withdraw your question please press start two you will be advised when to ask your question our 1st question is coming from the line of evanda serenovska from credit swiss please go ahead evanda so then basically cfdd is to apply for for that time that is the rule that is the rule that applies for all your assets in the uk and is and that is the same or similar to what exists in other markets then adobe operates in and the 2nd question is but on the renewables target growth when can we expect adobe to rise the annual renewables target growth i mean we have seen recently engie including the annual target from three to four yes  thank you very much yeah thanks for your question i mean yes the negative price rule applies to the uk and we have a similar one but the technical details are slightly different also in germany i mean i have to admit i do not know the exact details and so far  i think i mean you can you can usually plan it because you know your power price forecast on a on a quarterly basis for the full year i mean it has not had a significant negative effect which was not planned for us even this year so for us it is  it is a minor technicality on and if you want the details i think please call the team also to understand where the germs measure deviate from the uk one on the targets i mean we already gave you an indication with the nordex pipeline that comes on top of our targets but i mean our targets have been communicated so do not expect us that we give you new targets every month so when we deem it appropriate that we need to update the the market about new plans or revised plans we will do it but we will not do it on a quarterly basis yes we will come back thank you very much but i mean just a remark i mean the the moment it becomes viable you usually i mean but the team comes back but i think i mean for us i think it is an overrated issue also going forward because what we see is we get more and more flexibility in the system in many markets so the period of very negative power prices should naturally naturally come to an end i mean not for the specific plan you cannot do anything for the cfd plan but the market overall because incentivizes investments in flexibility like batteries and if you get more of that it will definitely take at 1st the negative power prices away so we do not see it as a big issue going forward but the team will come back on the technicalities thanks alag next question please the next question is coming from line two please go ahead yes good morning good afternoon a quick one could you provide us a bit more color on the nordics pipeline but at an asset level so we understand we see the geography so mainly it tends to be  for print in the french onshore market so we understand the strategy behind it it would be great if we could get a bit more color on the project level and what is your view regarding acquisition of renewable assets given current prices buying a pipeline is one thing but existing operating assets is another one do you see that like value accretive and would you in such a situation consider potentially even buying existing operating assets i think for us i mean having a deep pipeline where we can invest our money it would not be let us let us put it value optimal to actually acquire existing assets because we want to build and we want to operate them and us becoming a financial institution i mean i see it difficult that that is really where you are going with this it is a different thing if if you can maybe swap assets here and there to to change the portfolio mix and get some synergies here and there but i i do not see it as very relevant for the near future so i mean we are interested in strengthening our pipeline especially as we have done with the nordex i come to that in a minute but acquiring existing assets asset by asset is not i mean on the nordex pipeline i mean let me let me start 1st with why this was strategically important as i said in my speech because france is a very attractive onshore market with i mean the double sided cfd for twenty years inflation link we have seen prices in the last options between 62 and €67 so you can see that that is very attractive and it was on the european landscape so the one target market where we really missed a presence so it was really a good opportunity for us we looked into the pipeline in in detail as you can imagine in the jordan valley and i mean we have very good locations good wind conditions  clusters in in geographic proximity that will provide efficiencies and i mean i can i will not talk about specific locations now because the transaction is not closed and we are bound to confidentiality i will give you more color in a minute but i cannot talk about specific sites i mean we can we can give you more color after the closing of the transaction what we have already said is fifteen of the pipeline is is close to fid or very late in development stage and we expect the 1st co two by 201 on average we would at least expect 100 megawatts but from the pipeline per annum so that we have by 25 another including the purchase price of 402500000 we expect that the irr of the project will be within our given range at the capital market day we set for mature onshore pv markets we expect fivefour to eight but please i mean this is a very mature market and we had to buy it so do not expect at the upper end of the fourfive to eight we saw the price as attractive i mean it is always very difficult to judge or assess a price from the outside in but we have also seen other pipelines we participated in many new developments in france so we know also our other pipelines look like and just looking at it from the outside in you have seen acquisitions in that market which were priced at 150 to €250 per megawatt and we are at the lower end of that on that level pipeline by pipeline the split of the maturity of the pipeline is more or less in line with the maturity of our overall of our overall pipeline i mean around as i said fifteen is close to fid and late stage we have around thirty mid stage and the remaining part is then early stage development thank you next question please the next question is coming from the line of peter beshtege from bofa securities please go ahead hi yeah thanks for taking my question so just  another one on the nordex portfolio could you sort of tell us how the 400000000 acquisition price and the i guess additional kmw that you are going to be spending over the next couple of years fits into your existing 5000000000 kmw budget display something else out about budget or is it in addition and i guess if it is in addition then wherever you found that extra balancing sheet capacity please and then my 2nd question as she was just on carbon which has obviously been very volatile over the last couple of quarters i guess your supply trading division might have profited from that but i was just wondering could you give us your views as to what is actually been driving the carbon price particularly you know was it reached for sort of mid to high 20s yeah peter thanks for the question on the nordic pipeline yes it will come on top of the 5000000000 as we have said with the announcement of the transaction and now the question regarding funding i mean as i said in the speech we expect to be within the leverage target of the three times in that debt to ebta including the 400000000 i mean we have a lot of moving parts i mean if we assume and i also hint to that that commodity prices especially gas and co two and interest rates stay where they were at the end of june then we have a good view of what are the moving cash items operating cash flow investments we know our divestments i hinted to georgia biomass we are going to pay back the hybrids i mean that is all very stable and we can see that we end up at the end of the year with a very positive cash flow i mean around threezero but of course we cannot control commodity prices and we cannot control interest rates but these are only timing effects i mean it will normalize over time that is why we are confident if we move up then it will come down without impacting the capex then later the project investments after the i mean when we do cods that will be part of the of the capital allocation approach but of course as i hinted to i mean a 100 megawatts here and there that will not move the needle on the company of our size i mean with the covid situation with very low gas prices significant fuel switching muted industrial demand i mean the demand for carbon certificates is definitely much lower than it has been expected on the other hand it is also clear that the more political mid term view is more bullish because i mean somehow the european commission needs to implement the more aggressive co two reduction it does not matter whether they go to 55 or sixty reduction by 2030 a significant part of that maybe even more than half needs to come from the eu ets and that will definitely mean that prices will go up and maybe what is different this time than in the last financial crisis in the last financial crisis we have seen that a lot of industries who were sitting on excess capacity have had to close down they were in financial trouble and they needed to sell just to get liquidity this is with the huge program of the central bank and the fiscal support now different maybe some industrialists take more the political long term view and use the liquidity they still have to buy cheaper than they expect the prices to be i think these are the two camps short term long term and since this market is nothing you can fundamentally you know you can fundamentally change the market i think the more dominant factor is definitely the mid term to long term political view i can not imagine that if prices go down to €fifteen again that the politicians will sit there and do nothing okay interesting thanks very much for that and the 1st one is to go back to the eon stake we heard in the past that maybe badly counted about half of that could be used against liget liabilities and the rest could be used for growth could you please confirm that and when it comes to growth can you help us understand the logic with the decrementant to maybe a big offshore win or perhaps to identify something external like you just did with with nok that can be even bigger and secondly it is just thinking about the mne so we are seeing all companies very quickly moving into the space  you know vps with a fifty gigabit at net target by 2030 company like yourself would be like a plug and play you know developing with existing capacity so do you think there is a race to scale here and what would be the best way for you to fend off a threat like this one roberto thanks for the thanks for the question i mean on the eon stake i can just reconfirm that everything is too valid which we have said in the past i mean the eon stake is not tied to the lig净规定 we just said we currently use it we could also back the lig净规定 by other financial portfolios and i mean when you look at the the potential sourcing of of financing yes i mean we potentially need half of it to back the lig净规定 i mean that has not changed it is exactly what we said before usually we have two questions so you had three which one do you want me to answer now the oil question or the other one i start with the oil question and then let us see whether we still have time because i think that is the more interesting one i do agree that it could that we could that we could get more value out of the other half if we had more capital rotation it might be difficult to if you put together all the or the capital investment plans of everybody around in this in this field it is almost impossible to employ that amount of money until let us say 2030  because they are simply not enough projects as you have more lead times to do it so existing pipelines become much more i think the investors of big oil and others need to ask themselves the question whether it is really green a green investment if you buy existing stuff from others because that is not a positive contribution it is just i mean overbidding in prices so i mean on the question whether we could become a target or not i think your company is well positioned to help the oil companies figure that out and we should sit and wait and see what happens no no no i got it well i mean i think that is a good idea i mean that is not in our control so what can we do i mean i am i am actually happy that also other see the field of renewables than the overall power sector as attractive because that is the core of our strategy and i think we have all the ingredients to be successful we have a very experienced team we have a deep pipeline which actually needed to be developed over a decade and of course we have investment discipline and will ensure that we put the money where we get a decent return i mean developing our pipeline investing in good projects and also being on the technological forefront be it batteries be it h two or floating offshore where i actually do not see limiting factors is the long term market growth because the long term market growth of renewables and also power overall is tremendous globally the trend to electrification and to green is very supporting also do not see a limiting factor as funds because if you have good projects i think investors are actually looking for investment opportunities and now you need to ask yourself who actually brings what to the table i mean the market growth itself funds is not the problem so what you need is experience in the pipeline thank you that is great next question please the next question is coming from the line of rob puline from morgan stanley hi yes good afternoon everyone so 1st question marcus is can we talk about the eu recovery fund and how do you think internally that rwe will benefit from this and there is a  2nd part to that not a 2nd question can you help us understand practically how the money flows from a number on a presentation slide into actual projects because that still seems very unclear and hopefully a lot simpler is you have secured the maker edge in the uk could you provide an update on the process you have for leases for some of the other extensions you flagged at the cdm namely greater gabbard galapagos and rampion has that been successful is that underway or is that not this year is business thank you let me start with the easier one rob i mean we are working on the lease extensions and it will be around and we are optimistic that we can finalize it and by then book it as least as lisa secured by the end of the year but it is going well and on the european recovery fund let me start with the 2nd part of the question yeah i mean i think we will we will learn about it over time let us say two quarters until the end of the year how the flow of the money will really go because usually the european union works in a way that it is just they do not have they have only little funds like the just transition fund and stuff like that where they put money directly into specific projects usually the european union is budget is a huge kind of i mean shifting mechanism so people are paying net in and getting money net out so what now as the next step needs to happen is that the individual countries needs to come up with programs and plans where to invest the money and if that takes all boxes they will get their proportional share of the money so we need to wait for national actions where they are going to put and where they want to invest and how they support certain things is also unclear i mean you can do it with direct subsidy you can do it with a reimbursement framework is easy i mean it is it is still totally unclear and the only thing what we can do and that is the 1st part of your question i mean we are we are also now actively looking especially in the in the evolving h two sector and of course what is obvious is if more renewable power is needed and you get an indirect renewable energy permit for renewable power via the support of demand for green hydrogen i am definitely ready to build more renewables but we are also willing to invest into the production of hydrogen that depends on what agreement we find with our partners is it better our money or theirs and how do you structure the contract the question is who puts money into transportation maybe more others we need to see whether that needs to be unbundled a many open questions so i think the important step now is to get the right partners together and think it through what is feasible and you know you are on the right track i am happy to be here i mean who actually needs the hydrogen and then you you do you you do backwards and renounced it and i mean i think these are the big fears our current business already so especially renewables and storage technology and the new one which will come in addition is hydrogen but also i want to a kind of not spoil the party but i mean if you talk about profits from especially hydrogen probably we need to wait couple of years that is super interesting thank you very much and good luck with the lease with the lease franchise thanks so much next question please the next question is coming from the line of sam arie from ubs please go ahead hi good afternoon everybody thanks for the presentation and great results today i just wanted to ask two questions one on returns and one on farmdowns so on returns i think you had spoken at the cmds about 100 to 300 is that correct i think it is typical in the renewable business to talk about high single digit returns in renewables or mid to high single digit returns i am talking about high single digit returns i do not think it is that crazy as an estimate of the whac actually as well and i do not know the lower the whac the lower the spread that you need to make the same kind of value creation ratio so it just seems to me that a year or two ago it was common to talk about high single digit returns in renewables or mid to high single digit returns i am talking about high single digit returns i do not think it is that crazy as an estimate of the whac actually as well and i do not know the lower the whac the lower the spread that you need to make the same kind of value creation ratio so it just seems to me that a year or two ago it was common to talk about high single digit returns in renewables or mid to high single digit returns are we now more likely to be going into the low single digit returns territory and is that you know is that possibly a fair outlook for offshore wind as well where returns historically have been a bit higher i just love to love to know what what your thoughts are about that at the kind of industry level and then my farm down question is just look i feel like we are going to see over time more and more pressure from auctions and tenders and developers may be eventually forced to bring the farm down partner with them to the tender so if you like the competitive pressure of auctions will mean that this kind of extra value arbitration that you currently get in a farm down might might eventually get captured by the consumer or you know the public body that is doing the tender so i am just wondering do you think that is a reasonable expectation and if you thought about whether in the future you will sort of as standard go to auctions or tenders with  with a finance partner alongside and have you talked to any specific funds or partners about that kind of long term approach so returns and farm downs thank you thanks for the discussion i mean on returns i agree that we definitely see that the vaxes are coming down i mean i also carefully read your report and you also put now very low numbers to vaxes which i think is is the right thing to do and and but i am not there that i would say we see now low single digit returns for for offshore that is not where we are i mean definitely if we have promised you the average irr of an unlevered project of 650 basis points for the for the investment program we have outlined until 2022 potentially the absolute returns not the value creation but the absolute returns of the next capex program i think it will be lower but also because the wec is significantly lower but when you talk about the absolute level i am not at low medium i mean low for me is three and and three something it will come down but i mean what we see is not for the projects which we have after the 22 horizon already visibility of the profitability i would not call that low it is more medium a farm now i am not sure whether i got it i do not see i currently do not see that you have tenders where you need to bring your financing or where you have an advantage if you do not go into the auction alone and and getting an advantage when you already bring the financing partner i have not seen things like that what is more and more obvious is that also now the new tender design to give you one example for taiwan that  local production becomes a dominant theme if you want to put money in some place you need to prove that it is actually good for the regions where you get the lease it is good for the people you create jobs you use local suppliers that is becoming more and more important but what i do not see is that it is an advantage that you already with the auction say that you are going to farm that or bring a financing partner yeah whatever clarification no no no that is fine i have gone to take up too much time but i am sure we will talk about this again and thank you thank you for two polite answers to send we will thank you thank you sam next question please the next question is coming from the line of john musk from rbc please go ahead accelerated the fully hedged portion particularly in 2022 obviously it is a quite small chart but from maybe roughly thirty to fifty which is probably more than you would normally do in a quarter so just wanted to understand some of the thinking behind that is there a particular view on on power prices or spreads at these levels and then secondly on the the three times leverage factor just confirm that is not including what is the potential asset rotation at the moment because there are some headlines in in recent days around some of your your offshore assets that you might be looking to to sell down john thanks for the question i mean on hedging you are right we increased the outright hedge so what we actually closed by that was the spread position is there i mean what you could read into it is if you think spreads are fair it is part of of derisking now to close it  i think if you look at current market prices and spread i think everybody expects a 100 recovery by 22 and if you want to lock that in you better close the position now and that is what we have done that does not tell you what we i mean we do not know how the global economy will look like but it is better to lock it in now than to keep it open on the leverage side the three times net debt to ebitda includes our plans on capital expenditures so it is it is our net investment target i mean we have outlined a net investment of around onefive to 2000000000 per year so if we are going to invest more given the the profile and it also includes divestment i have already said that we divested which is not yet in the financials georgia biomass for close to $200000000 175 and some change and  i mean on the other things we are considering our options so we will bring it to the net figure but i now do not want to speculate on gross on net because we always said that the leading metric is thirteen gigawatts what net so whatever we do on dispositions we will reach the thirteen gigawatts what net and also the ebitda guidance for 2022 is a net guidance so and how we going to achieve this with how much gross on how many dispositions that we need to do that  the current uncertainties in some markets we need to have some flexibility and i mean if you now want to get a comment on the on the rumors on disposals i mean the comment is no comment because sir i mean we will update you when we have taken a decision we will not update you whether we have on a certain asset the market chest or not hi this is deepa venkataraman from bernstein please go ahead thank you for my two questions but 1st in the us so if you do have a possible victory for joe biden and they bring in the 2000000000000 plan i was just wondering how does that change would you accelerate your growth the conversion of your pipeline in the us or practically how might it change anything for you and my 2nd question is is on germany the auction is continuing to go under subscribe on offshore wind do you see this situation changing with any kind of reforms and would you be taking the lead as i do not know germany is the national champion on this to also grab maybe more of the share in the german renewables market thank you your deepa thanks for the question the 1st one is easy we actually do not expect any i mean the potential federal election outcome in the us on on our business i mean many things depend on state level of course tax support is a federal thing but also the current administration extended the ptcs given the covid situation so i mean that is pure speculation i would say it will not make a huge difference of course we would like to do more in onshore and in onshore in germany and we see undersubscribed auctions the problem is that the projects are not ready to be to be bid into the auctions we have permitting issues we have pending law cases and so on but there is some interesting development because the minister of economic affairs he tabled a draft law yesterday they really want to accelerate the permit process and the court proceedings and they also introduced something which is now heavily discussed with the ngos that even if you dispute a permission in court that should still allow the construction to go on and that would be very helpful so speedier processes and you can go straight to the court the next question is coming from the line of piotr zelaski xelloski xelloski zelaski thank you piotr the next question is coming from the line of piotr zelaski xelloski xelloski zelaski thank you piotr please go ahead hi good afternoon it is piotr jenczowski from city i have two questions the 1st one would be a small on nordex can you say what is the kind of a current cost structure of it how is the significant number small number in annual eurofigura as a whole company and secondly i wanted to ask you on the co two go back to the discussion because before covid nineteen i thought that there was a trend towards lower emissions is that still the case now if we take coal assets out what will be according to you your expectations the next equity recovery kind of threshold how will the market will restore longer than equity on the co two prices which we should be looking at then the elimination of co two what is the next net thing to look for  peter thanks for the question i mean on nordic it is easy i mean we take over the company yes but it is a development company so what you actually have is the salaries and opex for the seventy people and of course the development expenditures for the two week developed projects but i mean part of that is also capitalized so it is a very i mean in terms of addition to the cost base it is almost not relevant i mean the most relevant one will be the devex for the project on c zero two equilibrium i mean yeah actually the interesting thing is that the current c zero two price is already above the fuel switching price from from hard coal to gas the current stack in most of the times looks gas 1st then licnate and then hard coal so if you take out hard coal now that should not change it is for the for the c 02 relevant fuel switching price there should not be a change the interesting element is as i said it is already trading above the current fuel switching level that can only be explained that actually the industry expects a shortage and but this is always difficult to judge because this market is not  and an annual market it is also since you can easily keep your certificates for longer you can also say it is partly a view on what to come in future years so i would not overrate the annual price which causes fuel switching that was in the old days of oversupply a good indicator but now the significant more tightness is to come maybe that is not the relevant indicator anymore okay thank you thank you truter next question please the next question is coming from the line please go ahead hi there two questions for me please the 1st one is on negative prices and i am sorry if you covered it before i missed the very beginning basically oystar reported yesterday it was a small issue for them because of you know if the prices are negative for the subsequent few hours your cfd and whatnot you know you can not retrieve your stop loss so is that have you seen it been an issue with you for the for the 2nd quarter and do you think the negative prices will become more or less prevalent going forward the 2nd question is on hydrogen again where do you think the value will lie it is in the production of hydrogen transportation of hydrogen converting it to other fuels like decarburization etc where do you think the money will be and will you be a big player there thank you if i could answer the last question the last question is will the us be a major player in hydrogen production i think life would be easier i think it is too early to tell it also depends on how will the incentivization framework look like and how big will the market become and of course it has two angles you can incentivize green production and you can incentivize demand for green hydrogen and in the end it will be then kind of demand supply on on on i actually do not see scarcity as the production of green hydrogen in terms of electrolyzers i mean that is a proven technology where we definitely have scarcity already today is renewable projects because i mean yeah if you believe or the demand forecast and i have no doubt that that is a good assessment we need so much green energy that every project which is actually in the pipeline of somebody is going to be profitable so it is just a question of time so that is really a scarcity on the demand side i think that will be a competition by the off takers who can do it cheaper that is nothing for us i mean if you ask me where i see our role it is definitely on the production side green power potentially depending on how the consortium will look like and then the structuring of the off take i mean as we are currently also a very relevant player in gas trading and providing solutions to customers and that will also our role be in h two and you can do that without producing it as we currently do with lng and natural gas the 1st question on negative prices i mean for us it i mean we have seen it in the uk and germany but it is not it was not a relevant issue i mean it was not a big number ok thanks a lot appreciate it next question please the next question is coming from the line of ahmed farman from jeffries please go ahead yes hi thank you two questions from my side as well i am just wondering if we could get a little bit more color from you around the sort of how do you see this as the value creation opportunity relating to the nordex pipeline especially the sort of the near term medium term aspects thank you because you you mentioned it is  it is a mature market some of the near term projects are fairly well developed close to fed sort of market where audioboom had scale in the past i was interested in understanding a little bit more how you see the sort of the value proposition from from audioboom and i guess the 2nd question is relating to that i think you mentioned earlier that this was one of the markets you did not have presence and and therefore you were sort of looking for opportunities looking at your existing i would not say that we failed on france because we were simply not present it was always a strategic target to get a foot in the door and now we have not only a foot in the door but and the nordex team was actually very successful in the french market i think they ranked number two in terms of success rates into auctions in the last year and they have not only built this pipeline their business model was to build and then when they were close to fid and they got them to the auction they sold the projects to their potential customers and i mean what is the value creation potential for us i mean if we continue what they have done in the past so if you believe that onshore wind in france is good then the strategic gap between what we have acquired and what we need to deliver the pipeline which we have acquired will continue to develop projects and the french market overall is very attractive it is not so densely populated like germany so you have more space they have huge build out targets and even better renomination framework with a double digit twenty year inflation link cfd so if you believe that onshore wind in france is good then the strategic gap between what we have acquired and what we need to deliver the pipeline which we have acquired will continue to develop projects and the french market overall is very attractive it is not so densely populated like germany so you have more space they have huge build out targets and even better renomination framework with a double digit twenty year

wind in france is good then the strategic gap between what we have acquired and what we need to deliver the pipeline which we have acquired will continue to i mean we are firm believers that also the political environment in france and their targets to go straight from nuclear to renewables will not be questioned by some of the next governments so it is a very intact  growth platform the gaps in our pipeline i mean i think it is always good to be honest i mean if you look into that we are very wind heavy so doing more solar side let us see how we can achieve it i mean we have definitely ramped up our development activities and you will see more to come especially in the attractive solar market like in the us but still it is compared to the wind side underrepresented and the other one which is definitely significantly tougher maybe impossible to close if you look into our offshore pipeline i am sorry in terms of co dates and that is historically explainable because eon stopped and energy had also funding issues but we have a gap between 22 where we will commission triolith and noll and then maybe the next project will be commissioned according to the current pipeline around 25 maybe 26 and that is i mean this is a profile how it looks like and if you ask me you have two wishes i would like to fill that time gap and i would like to have more the solar thank you very much thank you next question please the next question is coming from the line of fermin morgado from man glg please go ahead thanks all along hello just a couple of quick questions one you have seen a deep offshore wind floating what is your view with regards to the technology that are around there is a tie i envision that will be the role of our vessels so what we said is let us participate in different technologies be it concrete or steel i mean you have also different i mean i am not an expert on that but probably you are you have totally different approaches to that and what we said is we want to be part of consortium of several technologies to be an early learner we want to learn how this stuff works because it is a bit different than a fixed bottom it is in terms of wind shield in terms of maintenance costs and so on and we want to learn that with different technologies that does not mean that we will in future if we go into offshore only use the technologies where we have been a partner early on we can also use others so and yeah you asked for our role our role is we want to be we want to construct and we want to operate also offshore windfarms but we do not want to build the turbines or the or the very clear and just perhaps to tie up with alberto is question and the role of oil companies i mean do you believe that deep offshore you know to do you know in joint ventures or in conjunction with oil companies that have experience from offshore that that is speculation i mean but if you look at our partnership landscape it is a very different landscape we are operating one offshore wind farm together with equinor they are our partner in one of our farms one of the floating technologies we are in we are together with shell but i think i mean i think that can go either way i mean it is too early i mean we are open to discussions but we could also do it ourselves one of the components missing on the investment thesis is the full commitment to a growing dividend i mean when do you think that you can have that full commitment and you know what kind of growth do you envision that you can sustain i mean i would not compare us to enel i mean enel is a fully integrated utilities with i mean most of the value sitting in the networks and they do not operate offshore i mean our business model is i mean is different we have actually given a clear commitment to a growing dividend we said we want to continuously grow the dividend broadly in line with the development of of the earnings of our operating core business and since the core business given our investment plans will definitely grow also the dividend should grow and we discussed it before so i said i mean a good proxy is maybe the ¢five on top every year which we have now delivered for for the last years i mean it can be maybe even more because of course the percentage goes down if you stick to  to an absolute trend number but that is the commitment we have given we want to grow the dividend inline with earnings development in core business in the core business but if the core business i mean for whatever reason cannot sustain i mean cannot grow i mean what is your commitment you know you will cut the dividend in line with the decline of earnings on the core business i mean we should now i mean we should stick to the two questions rule so i will answer that one but then we should give the next one the opportunity to ask questions otherwise we need to do it in a one on one session obviously i art team please i mean if we do not have enough growth as a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad next question is coming from the line of rob puline rob puline from morgan stanley please go ahead will we see a similar tax impact at rdi as it reaches cod on your us projects thank you the text answer to the question to the text the answer to the text question is easy no we do not expect any huge number but maybe the situation is different because you set a us utility because we do not have tax capacity ourselves so since we do not have tax capacity our taxes in the us are  zero and you need to actually bring in financing partners to reap the tax benefits so the tax effect on our business is more or less zero for a long time no sorry i said us exposed company is actually a european name no we do not see anything like that you are blaming me for not answering a humbert question what was the humbert question no we want to sell humbert yes then no then yes then no then no then yes then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then no then

no then no then no then no then no then no then no i did not answer the humbug question because i said i mean this is a rumor and we do not comment on rumors what i just can reiterate is of course active portfolio management is part of the strategy but we will give you an update when we have taken a decision and as long as we have not taken a decision to do something we do not talk about it fair enough thank you thank you another further question we have no further questions in the queue so i will hand you back to your host for any concluding remarks perfect thank you all for dialing in stay safe and healthy and speak to you again later at our q three results have a good day goodbye",

            "reference": "token please stand by good morning and welcome everyone to femsa is 2nd quarter 2020 financial results conference call please note today is call is being recorded all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise after the presentation there will be a question and answer session during this conference call management may discuss certain forward looking statements concerning femsa is future performance and should be considered as good safe estimates made by the company these forward looking statements reflect management is expectations that are based upon currently available data actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties which can materially impact the company is actual performance at this time i would now like to turn the conference over to eduardo padilla femsa is chief executive officer please go ahead sir good morning everyone and welcome to femsa is 2nd quarter 2020 results conference call as is customary juan fonseca and jorge collazo are also on the line and today we are als we are also joined by eugenio garza we hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe the 2nd quarter was the most challenging period we have faced operationally in many decades although there were differences in performance amo among our business units but also we saw a severe impact from comi continuing lack of consumer mobility in the geographies we serve that translated into soft performance for most of our categories and consumer occasions and the challenge was compounded by the lack of beer supply that only began to recover in the month of june our health division fared better as demand for its production products remained high but sales were constrained by strict restrictions imposed on consumers and their ability to move around particularly in our key south american market the fuel division was impacted most as vehicle utilization fell quickly and drastically however from a deeper value and in relative terms it is the retail operation that seems to be rebounding faster for its part coca cola femsa was quite resilient leveraging execution capabilities to once again adapt to consumer needs and minimize the negative impact of the downturn having said all that our team continues to execute at a high level in very complex environment and we continue to focus on the safety and health of our people and our customers above all else moving on to discuss femsa is consolidated quarterly numbers total revenue during the 2nd quarter decreased tenseven while income from operations decreased 37five on an organic basis total revenues decreased fourteenthirty and income from operations decreased by fortyfour for this quarter the difference between reported and organic figures reflects two months of our drugstores in ecuador a full quarter of the agv operation in brazil and 45 days of the waxie and north american jan san distribution platforms acquired in the united states net income decreased significantly driven by number one lower income from operations as i just described number two higher other non operating expenses including ancillary charges related to the extraordinary payments of almost mxn eight 800000000 agreed with the mexican tax authority as well as impairments including for certain assets at coca cola femsa and the closure of our specialties operations and number three in terms of participation in heineken results which were lower relative to the comparable figure we reported last year in terms of our consolidated net debt position during the 1st quarter it increased by approximately mxn 10000000000 compared to the previous quarter to reach a level of mxn 72000000000 at the end of june this reflects our investment of approximately $900000000 in the waxie north american platforms as well as the majority of the large tax payments mentioned before while we are on the doc in the target of debt we should mention that during the quarter we placed $700000000 in the 2nd reopening of our thirty year dollar denominated bond issuance bringing the total amount to $2500000000 which was our original target the weighted average yield for a total issuance was threefive which was also our target back in september when we started the with this project and i highlight this because it took us nine months and we went to the market on three separate occasions in order to get the amount we wanted at the cost we wanted we were very patient and it paid off and this is the approach and the and this is the approach and the discipline and what we try to bring to our financial decisions moving on to discuss our operations and beginning with femsa is comercio proximity division we should start with our comments about store openings while we managed to open a number of new stores during the quarter we also have to close a small percentage of our store base due to covid nineteen restrictions and effects some of the closures will be temporary but some will be permanent as we take this opportunity to remove certain marginal stores from our base the numbers for the quarter went like this 159 new openings 85 reopening after remodeling and maintenance 24 definitive closures and 260 temporary closures as a result we recorded a net reduction of forty stores for the 2nd quarter to reach 950 net store openings for the last twelve months in addition to the store closures we reduced the number of operating shifts from three to two in a large percentage of our stores as 247 operations is not viable or necessary given the current consumer dynamics also same store sales were down twelveforty for the 2nd quarter reflecting a 24 point 24ten decline in store traffic and an increase of fifteenforty in average consu customer ticket here it is also useful to pause and discuss a little bit what happened in the entire quarter because we did see meaningful differences as the quarter went by during april as you may recall we still had relative availability of beer through most of the month as well as some panic buying for certain categories on the part of consumers and this mitigated the blow in late april the least the last month of the quarter for oxxo during may however we basically depleted our beer inventories and we saw the steepest contractions in traffic making the worst month of the quarter finally in june we began to recover beer availability and we also began to observe a gradual shift in consumer dynamics during the 1st part of the quarter most of the consumer demand weakness came from mobility restrictions and lock downs with the thirst and craving occasions suffering from the absence of customers going about on the street and the gathering occasion reeling from social distancing however late in the quarter the weakness in demand in demand seems to be driven increasingly by economic hardship as so many consumers have lost their income making the crisis today a bit more similar to prior downturns but also more pronounced adding to the headwinds as much as half of our stores in mexico were under some type of operating restriction from local authorities during the quarter also related to the sale of alcohol in certain time windows we expect most of the restrictions to be temporary moving down the income statement for the 2nd quarter gross margin contracted by ten basis points reflecting a negative sales mix effect caused by the beer shortage in may and improved performance of our daily and replenishment categories partially offset by a high single digit increase of our services category income from operations decreased almost 66 and operating margin contracting 620 basis points reflecting significant operating dev deleverage moving on to femsa is comercio health division we reduced our store count by seven drugstores as amount of temporary closures was enough to offset this the number of stores we opened during the quarter having said that we have a total of 300 3189 open units across our territories at the end of june and 128 total net new stores for the last twelve months revenues increased twofour while on an organic basis they decreased nine one same store sales decreased an average of nineeighty in mexican pesos reflecting the negative impact of the strict mobility restrictions implemented in our south american markets including curfews partially offset by a solid performance in operations in mexico gross margin expanded by eighty basis points in the quarter reflecting number one a positive sales mix effect driven by consumer behavior shifts in connection to the pandemic number two more effective collaboration with key supplier partners in our operations in south america and number three better margin performance in our business in ecuador where applying socofar is operational best practices is very very improved operating margin contracted 120 basis points reflecting lower operating leverage in south america as we anticipated last quarter femsa comercio is fuel division was the most exposed to the current environment of lock downs and reduced mobility and the impact is visible in our quarterly results while we were able to add one new net one new station to our network same station sales decreased an average of almost fifty in the 2nd quarter gross margin reached thirteenthree the operating margin was one zeroeighty of total revenues reflecting considerable operating deleverage operating expenses decreased fifteen as a result of tight expense control and increased efficiencies as a silver lining in relative terms it seems this business is the one that is recovering more quickly re in relative terms showing the sequential improvement in certain weeks but rising from a very from a deeper contraction finally moving on briefly to coca cola femsa as john highlighted yesterday the results show a resilient volume performance in mexico improvements improvements in brazil and colombia and continued strength in guatemala they made further progress in development of digital and omnichannel initiatives in key markets and managed to deliver solid profitability in mexico and central america even in the context of the current pandemic for more detail you can listen to the webcast of the quarterly conference call looking ahead uncertainty remains high and it is hard to make predictions however as i mentioned before it seems the crisis is steadily evolving in the beginning its main drivers were severe health concern and the lack of consumer mobility and this remain a problem however we are increasingly seeing the signs of another set of more traditional economic headwinds come into play this is not possible but at least we have more experience with economic downturns as you might imagine we continue to look for at our entire business in an effort to optimize it to the changes taking place today and for those that seem to be on the way and and and for those that seem to be under way and we will continue to work hard to evolve our company to meet the moment and to come out in better shape on the other side and with that we can open the call for questions operator thank you the question and answer session will begin at this time if you would like to ask a question during this time simply press the star then number one on your telephone keypad if you would like to withdraw your question press the pound star two you will your question will be taken in the order that is received in the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question at a time to allow the maximum number of callers to ask their questions again that is star one to ask a question and we will go 1st to ben theurer of barclays hey good morning thank you very much for taking me 1st i hope you are you are all safe and sound eduardo juan and and well eugenio welcome welcome on board so my my one question would be on the more recent performance in oxxo and you have elaborated how it went through the quarter but if you could shed a little light on the current performance over the most recent weeks into july where we have seen more states going into the the orange phase some of the reopenings and if you could also share with us on the the the temporary store closures how many you you currently still have closed and how do you think the reopening is going to evolve considering some of the tourist restrictions as well as office restrictions that are still in place that would be my question thank you thank you ben let me tell you we we are making progress as i said in the quarter fifty had had restrictions now i would say 35 have restrictions the same store sales have improved a little bit mobility is is is coming still but but there is still if we you know if we we just pay attention let let us say to this global mobility index and and the global mobility index in mexico is down around forty and and that really i mean me oxxo really lives by the people who are on the go and moving and and and this is really being the major cause we think that people are beginning to understand and adapt to this new environment mobility is coming up little by little and and and not only car mobility but production mobility too and i think it all depends that how what is going to happen with school systems in the next quarter what is going to happen with with offices opening or or keeping it closed so i think we are optimistic in the way that we are understanding the pandemic better you know i could tell that the lack of contagious of of this pandemic in the stores is very low very very low basically the the program that we have had with the the the the our personnel is more because the the lock downs they leave their house and the lack of of of of of care they have with with connection with some family members and and and most of the people that have had the the pandemic goes to the house not ne not really from from from the traffic to the to the work or the store so we are optimistic but the thing is that you know we are feeling now the pain that the economic downturn is becoming is is is is staying here and and and and we will we we we are adapting the the the offering too but we are cautiously optimistic yeah that is what we have to be well thank you very much thanks our next question will come from bob ford of bank of america hey thank you good morning everybody and and thank you for for taking my question eduardo on your opening comments you mentioned the 24 closures that are announced i was curious is it really for a wider assessment of the store base and and and how do you think about the footprint right now in terms of maybe reallocating those resources to other locations or or maybe just trimming it in anticipation of you know more traditional headwinds in terms of the the slowdown in the economy well as i said the a lot of the lock downs that we had ha had the restrictions of alcoholic curfews or or lock downs or the possibility of open stores in certain commercial areas and and that was the number that we had around fifty have these kind of restrictions as i said now out of the 19000 stores there are around 7000 that might that have had some kind of restrictions for instance in the state of tamaulipas the previous weekend we were not allowed to to to sell we ha we have to we have to clo close not only not sell alcohol but to close the the completely the store and again i think the local authorities are trying to best their best to adapt and and and and and have countermeasures against this pandemic some are effective and some are not i would say and and and but the thing is we try to to lobby and and understand what the authorities is planning to do and help them to accomplish the the objectives not necessarily by by by unstabilizing the the the way we we we work with the stores i think another problem is really through the lockdown the the lack of social mobility and the social distancing night shifts are very very weak and and we have had some besides the the lockdown restrictions that we have with some authorities or selling of alcohol in some some stores also we are really closing some of the night shifts because again there is no no no consumers around so but again we think that it will be temporary and and we are adapting the best we can thank you very much thank you bob and again as a remind that is star one to ask a question and if you find that your question has been answered you can remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two we will now go to miguel tortolero of gbm hi good morning everyone thanks for the thanks for the questions considering the timing of this crisis that that came right after you bought or invested in a couple of companies which of them would you say that have had the most challenging start now in the in the sense of direction you know we we are very happy with the with our partners and with the companies we acquired they are in the jan san business and as as you imagine jan has had a a great demand for for the products out of the two waxie is more focused to jan san and north american had a more diverse platform and in fact north american had had to sell to some hospitality customers and i think probably that is the one that has suffered the the most but i think both companies have adapted tremendously to in this environment they have been able to to protect their their their employees and prot and and and and but the at the very same time trying to serve their customers so we are extraordinarily happy with them we have great partners and i think that we are going to build an extraordinary platform with the help of them and and we look forward with a very optimistic future yeah i i think i would add miguel this is juan even on the on the jetro restaurant depot which is also one of the recent investments which being as exposed as they are to the restaurant sector one would think or at least one would have thought a few months ago that this would be a complicated period for them and i am not saying it it has not been complicated but certainly they have been adjusting and navigating the situation quite frankly exceeding exceeding at least my personal expectations which kind of confirms our view that this is a very well positioned and very well run company so they have been doing as i said better than better than expected adjusting and i think their customers as well the little restaurants adapting to you know curbside delivery and things begin to open up in many of the markets that they serve so overall i would say on the restaurant depot front you know a positive surprise great thank you both and now we will take a question from marcella recchia of credit suisse and marcella if you could check your mute function we are unable to hear you hi are you listening me now yes please go ahead with your question yes okay hi juan hi eduardo i hope you are well just two quick que que questions here from my side the 1st one is about g a i saw that basically your g a increased across the business divisions so just to understand what is driving such increase and secondly very briefly if you can give views your impressions about the mexican pension reform in terms of potential impacts for for femsa thank you very much well i i will go to to the 2nd one and i think i will let juan answer the 1st one the the pension reform i think it is this hole led there and i think it is a good thing that we altogether tried to solve it because it will be very difficult for the current environment to to to solve and and what we would not like to have to solve it in a desperate way and and that that could disrupt the economic environment in mexico i think what we have in for the future is is is kind of painful but i think it is what the right thing to do and i think between the the private companies and the government i think it is it is it is a good trend that we are together here to to fix the hole for the long run and the other one juan why do not you go and try to answer the the very 1st question please yes hi marcella so we we are having some amortization of it investments i think on the oxxo front they have continued to to invest in their new versions of some of the software as well as developing the digital platforms across the board we have had some closures of stores and we have had some asset write downs both at coke femsa and and at femsa so i think that would be playing a part on that obviously we can we can also follow up offline in terms of you know making the numbers match but i think off the top of our heads that those are concepts that come to mind okay thank you thank you very much guys thank you and next we will go to gustavo oliveira of ubs hi good morning everyone thank you thank you for taking my question it is on oxxo gross margin you mentioned that you your your numbers are actually very good there was a very little contraction there you mentioned that the beer shortage obviously affects your profitability but that was offset by by the service category on the recovery do you think that you could actually see an expansion in your gross margin as the i do not know if the service category really remains strong and the beer clearly could recover could you please elaborate a bit on on the trend for for the gross gross margin for for oxxo well let let me give you a summa our business our suppliers and us are concerned with the lack the lack of consumer economic strength but what we are trying to do is is to come up with with different offerings to to really estimate dema the demand and here we are we have our our our our our suppliers and our partners and and trying to do something great for them for the consumer in in in in in in covid times but i do not know juan why do you go and and go for the details of the numbers please sure i i think on the gross margin i mean historically or at least for for a a long time now the two main drivers of gross margin expansion have been the financial services category and you know the commercial income that we that we receive from our from our supplier partners right now as eduardo ha has said you know i am i think a positive surprise has been the resilience and even the you know faster growth of financial services during the downturn as consumers have kind of made sure that they are keeping current with their with their memberships and their utilities and and you know realizing or or taking advantage of the fact that it is it is a lot easier to go to oxxo than than to go to the bank and it is less time consuming and so even though financial services had been contracting or at least it has been growing less in recent quarters in the last 23 quarters this quarter it actually the growth came came in the in the high single digits which was a a positive surprise and i think contributes to the to a high gross margin the other question on commercial income is a little bit trickier because you know so some of those agreements as eduardo also referred to are are tied to to volume and so it is hard to predict i mean we we do need volumes to come up transactions to go up for commercial income to go up you know in consequence so i would say visibility for gross margin is is is not as clear as as we would like i would not necessarily predict at this point that we will continue to to expand it you know more than more than trend but at least during the during the 2nd quarter it did kind of hold its own thank you i think it is very clear thank you thank you i would also add that probably the there there were a small increase also in in in in the lack of beer also shift demand to to some other alcoholic beverages and that those have that compensated the margin a little bit too and that it actually brings up an interesting point eduardo because you know obviously you are you are you are right consumers did shift to higher consumption of spirits during the quarter and interestingly i think what what the oxxo our oxxo colleagues were observing in recent weeks was that even as the beer came back that the volume for spirits was still holding up strong so maybe you know if in the in the effort to look for the for the silver lining or the glass half full you know as consumers realize what the assortment and the the pricing is for for spirits at the oxxo stores that this becomes a category that that is you know that is stronger than that historically because historically we have not sold as much spirits as as we are selling right now so hopefully this remains after the after the pandemic is is gone and we will move on to our next question and that will be from alan alanis of santander thank you so much good morning everyone eduardo hello alan hello did did we lose alan it looks like we may have lost alan we will go next to ulises argote hi everyone thanks for the for the space for questions so here i wanted to to get your thoughts a little bit on on any potential product portfolio rationalization there there in oxxo and maybe if you can share any any color on what you are seeing in terms of of the shift in in mix more recently now in july maybe going back a little bit more to the to the more profitable categories that you guys have there thank you you know unless we think that this lack of mobility will stay for a very long period of time which we not which we we do not think it is the case i think we we be we have to adapt better and we have to adapt more to the to the lack of of of consumer economic power and and by by probably with a different assortment probably the the the looking for for cheaper or or less expensive products our returnable cun soft drinks is is not as strong as we we should have it now and and and those kind of shift we can we can foresee it for the future but not necessarily in in the types of of of of of consumer demand of of of of thirst or or or breakfast or or people gathering depending on we think that eventually those those type of of consumer demand will stay it is more the lack of economic power the consumer that we are more concerned than than the real shift of of our consumer occasions that that is perfect and and a bit more on the on the short term kind of thinking now on on june july after the the beer category is backend etc do you have any any color that you can share with us kind of there on on the shift back let us say in in mix yeah juan yeah i i i think you know eleven thing to kind of highlight and i think eduardo touched on it in his opening remarks was that the quarter itself was a little bit of a i do not know if a v shape is a little bit of a strong descriptor but certainly the the the trough of the of the of the trend was was the month of may and we believe that we hope and believe that will mark the the lowest point of this downturn should be the month of may and then as as beer comes back it it it helps everything right it it helps operating leverage and it helps margins and generally begins to to turn this into a a more traditional downturn so so to speak and so you know the as eduardo said in the beginning we we are seeing improving improving metrics and improving traffic and and really the the one concern i have is not to convey the the view that you know once the the mobility restrictions are are gone that we go back to normal immediately right because we are seeing these symptoms and and signs of a of a more traditional economic driven downturn but again you know you when you go when you go dry and this has never happened before on the beer side obviously you have both of our suppliers on the beer front working hard to restock the the shelves consumers themselves are are probably buying a little bit more beer than they normally do to make sure they do not go dry again and so you know you you are seeing positive trends on on on some of these important categories especially beer so i would expect that to to continue and you know we we will obviously make the adjustments eduardo referenced some in terms of of packaging and and and mix for some important categories i think we need to to be careful and work hard at at understanding how you know how quickly and and what the new normal eventually ends up looking like in the sense that we will i am sure adapt our value proposition to that whether it means you know some incremental skus or a shift in the mix and that sort of thing so so we are we are still not at the end of this but we know more about how the consumer is adjusting habits than we did a couple months ago and we are acting in in consequence yeah and we will now go back to alan alanis of santander let us see if this time works thank you so much thanks for taking my question and again good morning hope you guys are and your families are safe eduardo or juan i guess i mean we on the sell side most of us have a buy rating on the stock i mean because of the of of the luxury valuation of oxxo implied here now the the the result of this quarter i guess the question is is is this result putting to question the business model of oxxo in the long run this is the 1st quarter ever that you closed stores so i guess the specific question is and and sorry if i missed it what what is the expectation regarding store openings going forward and the 2nd thing and this is a question we get a lot and i am i am sure juan also gets it a lot and eduardo it is why the reluctance to stay away from e commerce and invest here in job you have been saying every time you guys mentioned the copilot with amazon or so forth the stock reacts positively why not invest in a in a basement or in a 2nd floor in as in as many offices as possible to use them as distribution for e commerce and and leverage that especially given the the changes of the pandemic will cost and the 3rd and last question has to do with with capital deployment i mean i think that the pushback has been visibility in terms of capital deployment eduardo you mentioned about patience and discipline i think that it is very clear for investors that your you you guys are very patient but what can you expand on in terms of of giving comfort to investors that you will remain disciplined in terms of that capital deployment given the the the very strong balance sheet and cash flow generation that you that you generate those will be my questions thank you so much well let me tell you we we are very optimistic of oxxo in in in the medium and long run i think we have a extraordinary platform and and and it is it is just that we have the right consumer the adjustments and and and the lack of mobility that that that will help us to be on track again in terms of of your question about the e commerce we are we are very much we are doing things that we are not prepared yet to disclose but i think we are in in the financial in the financial sector we see the evolution there and we have to be prepared and also the loyalty program is related and connected with the international platform we we the current the current the if if you want to see those are the the ones the linkages that we are making with the current platforms like amazon and everything we are very optimistic with those two what we do not know yet is the the home delivery home delivery still we do not see how the im impact the ones that are doing home delivery in small purchases not groceries but small purchases are the ones we deliver no nobody makes money nobody makes money and and and they are still trying to to catch up and find a a better way so if we were in the grocery business without doubt that we will be delivering a lot of things for the for the for homes because ec economically those make sense and the other the other ones we have not seen yet although we have some test to deliver in a very efficient way with some back stores and everything but i think there are still some learnings and and efficiencies to come to come in into place to to perform better i do not know if you want to add to the question juan thank you yeah thank you eduardo yes i do i think alan is 1st attempt at the question did not work but the 2nd attempt he made sure that he covered a fair amount of big topics so i will i will try to to to add to to some of these so on the store front alan you know i think what what we are seeing is you know we we have for a number of years we have been opening more stores every year than the previous you know we got as high as 1350 i think at the at the top and i think what we are doing right now is we are taking this opportunity to look at the you know the you know that there is a layer of stores that are probably marginal in terms of of what they are contributing to the numbers and we are we are fi you know figuring out which of those stores actually should not be open kind of pruning the the base of a small number of stores that that should not be open and just generally i think you know the the budget for stores this year before pandemic you know kind of reared its its ugly head we were thinking about 1200 stores for mexico so that you know that is a level that is a little bit lower than the top that we reached a couple years ago but you know we we were already kind of moving into a phase where you are you are becoming more demanding about what you expect of your new stores in order to ensure profitability and productivity of the new stores and at the same time the budget for this year had us with about 150 stores outside of mexico so i think we are in the early stages of that process where international will begin to add you know more meaningful numbers to the number of stores and obviously once we get some scale in colombia chile eventually hopefully brazil that this becomes not just a mexico story but more of a of a of a continental story so we are at that stage and i think this year with the pandemic with the dynamics we decided to to to start closing a few of those kind of marginal stores i am also optimistic on the storefront that for central and western mexico now that we have the you know both portfolios of beers that there will be a large number of locations in places like guadalajara leon queretaro even the the valley of mexico where the fact that you now have the abi portfolio kind of takes a lot of those locations that were just short of being viable makes them viable and again kind of you know ensures that we can contin continue to open large numbers of stores in that part of the country i think on the e commerce front i mean eduardo touched on it in terms of also obviously realizing the the potential and the power of of the oxxo platform to bankarize people or to get people to adopt new technologies or new products i mean i think we we we certainly have the saldazo experience that gives us a lot of comfort in terms of our ability to get people to sign up and and adopt new new means of payment or new means of of of of saving but one thing we do not want to do is to overpromise and and underdeliver so we are working hard at the three legged stool of our digital platform at at oxxo which involves last mile delivery and i think more importantly the loyalty program and the e wallet and hopefully we will have something to show the market you know towards the end of the year and then finally on capital deployment i mean you know you have seen us for over the years femsa basically has a couple of ways that that we grow we either take what we do well to a new geography or we take what we do well and we expand it by a couple of degrees and examples of of this abound whether you are talking about jugos del valle or santa clara or or the drugstore business where you took kind of oxxo and and expanded what it does by a few degrees and and you you know decide to go into into drugstores so i think what we are doing right now and i think the market to your point in in terms of how you frame the question it is still kind of getting its hands around you know why it is that we made a couple of investments in the us or how does the the jan san business fit into the overall strategy i think you are seeing us do kind of what we usually do which is figuring out what you know what we do well and then taking it to another another country obviously with the benefit of very strong partners as we have in in in the us so we understand that we you know we we are adding a little bit of complexity to the to the org chart we will try to address that to the extent that we can by increasing the disclosure and where we have spoken about how we are going to start opening up the numbers for s the logistics business as well as for the jan san business 1st quarter of next year so you know capital deployment these investments and and and addressing the complexity that it brings to the equation are very much top of mind for for the team and and hopefully we are in the process of addressing it got it got it no thank you so much i mean you you guys are extremely good if not the best in in the region in terms of large scale logistics of moving things it is just like it is impossible for a lot of investors and analysts to buy i mean that logistics expertise has not been moved to like all the way to small delivery like eduardo said it is your largest point i mean i know i am going to say something very humbly and things that you already know but amazon tesla facebook all of these companies started without making money initially and they just and you gained the scale and these colombian guys rappi it is a question mark if they are going to be able to then to control the small the small drop size delivery and i just think that and i think a lot of investor thinks that you have you have a great opportunity you have the balance sheet you have the expertise and i think that yeah initially well nobody will make money and probably you get in you probably will not make money either but once you get the scale eventually i think consumers will pay a premium for using uber for pay using paygroup or using amazon and so forth and with a long term vision that femsa has i think that a lot of investors are asking why why are not you getting into that with more strength in using your your muscle and your expertise but anyways thank you so much for taking my questions thanks stay safe and have a great day thank you thank you alan thank you alan i mean i will just wrap that question you know the the the concept or the notion of the super apps and how in in other in other geographies obviously things have evolved very quickly but we do have the aspiration with the you know with the right platform and the right partnership to hopefully become become one of those or part of part of one of those ecosystems down the road and leverage quite frankly the the 20000 bricks and mortar stores that we have which are a differentiating factor vis a vis other folks good thank you so much juan thank you eduardo thanks alan thank you alan and now we will go to rodrigo echagaray of scotiabank thank you guys thanks for taking my question just wanted to hear your thoughts on the state of the mom and pop stores in mexico i mean on the one hand it is hard to imagine many will will not go on their course and on the other hand higher unemployment may push many sort of shop in the informal economy so any any thoughts on what you are seeing on the ground would be appreciated well i i i think the mom and pops were hardly hit unfortunately because of the lack of beer and that was and and and and also the lack of cigarettes because it was not only beer in cigarettes i think we were able to to to prepare ourselves with good inventories and but again the so those two were major they have major effects on that in the other hand i think the the traditional mom and pops are closed where people live so i think i would say there are different mom and pops to where where where the the where mobility was a major role yes they have been hard hardly hit but these are and i think the ones that are in the neighborhoods i think they are they are coming up with a with a good performance i would say also that that we are better prepared in the returnable bottles that the ones the returnable soft drinks compared with with oxxo so that was a small advantage but yes ag again i i think they will recuperate because i think the the coca cola system bimbo and and alike are very much wi willing to support and and and help and and help them to to compete and and and so i i do see that the pandemic in those levels i think is is helping them to to to to sustain but yes but the they were very hardly hit the ones that have lack of beer in in in during this initial period of the downturn great thank you and and just related to the last question i guess you you have taken some stakes in in certain startups and i have seen that one of those justo have been growing quite quite a bit any insights or things that you have learned on on the delivery in in in these stakes that that you can share yes you know we we we have been trying to support the ven with some pension money to support those suppliers that are very much in line with us so we will help those to enhance our our value proposition and and i i do not know specifically the one you are talking about juan well might have a better idea of of but yes we are working not only with technological suppliers but also with with normal suppliers where we could help them to become larger and in fact we did that with a a great supplier that we have with this caffenio which is the one that supported all the coffee operations and i think with that knowledge we could be of of great support to them so this pandemic we also we we all the small vendors we are helping them to pay them very quickly so they do not have this cash currency problem that this pandemic will cost to them and and so that that that those are the the yes but our our small scale suppliers are very important and the strategic ones we want to invest with them so they can grow better and faster to become a major competitive advantage to us yeah i think on the on the justo or justo investment i mean certainly we are we are trying to to help these these new ventures through through our femsa ventures arm but also learn about you know things that that would help us in our own value proposition or or the way that we operate and certainly distribution the use of you know dark dark warehouses or dark kitchens dark stores the handling of perishables these are all things that that we would love to to be better at and to know more about and this this investment in particular obviously has has tur it turned out to be an interesting one i mean the the the the the amounts involved are are not huge and relative to the size of femsa but certainly it is a startup that is doing very well and of course i know that you stay close to to to these companies and and and their you know the different rounds of financing and and how quickly they are growing and and this is so far a very nice success story well thanks eduardo and juan and we will go to alvaro garcia of p btg pactual good morning eduardo juan eugenio my questions i have two questions sorry i have two questions one on heineken i was wondering if you could comment on whether or not your position on the stake on owning you know this this fifteen has changed or not given the new tax agreement with the mexican government and two on m a is it fair to say you are in integration mode it would seem to be a nice time to sort of take a breather and and and integrate a lot of the different assets you you bought over the last couple of years those are my two questions thank you well the heineken the heineken shares yes it is a temporary investment we just have to try to a way to deploy that capital in a better way and and and it it is it it is as as not as optimal as as it was in the past as you are referring but it is we just have to find the the the right time and and the right path to to deploy that capital and and and have that use of those proceeds the the 2nd question i forgot juan would i i i forgot the 2nd the the 2nd point are we ready to take a breather after a lot of activity on the m a front and i think i mean i i think that the answer to that is is yes for the most part that is good you should expect us to to start integrating capturing synergies and kind of delivering on the promise of of all of these investments i would i would say there there is probably eleven exception and you know the the jan san platform you know a big part of the of the attractiveness of that business involves a growth through acquisitions and eventual integration and you know it is hard to tell at this point whether there will be transactions kind of coming along in the coming months and quarters but if they were i think we would be interested in taking looks but other than that for the most part and understanding that m a is hard to predict generally speaking the the our stance is is one of as you say kind of sitting a little bit more on our hands and digesting the the the number of bites that we took over the last eighteen months yes and alvaro eh thinking about the 4th platform that we are looking i think we already have it so we we the the we do not think to open a new vector a different vector for growth we the ones we have is is already well well established the proximity health and and and now this jan san platform i think we are already very much foc we will be very much focused in into the platform that we already have great that is very clear thank you very much and now we will take our next question from sergio matsumoto of citi yes hi good morning thank you for taking my questions i i have two questions one is i wanted to go back on the again portfolio and the the assortment question at oxxo you spoke about how you can you know change some of the assortments given the the the economic slowdown but could you explain more on the assortment changes you can make in the face of the the the reduced mobility and and especially over the long term if this changes the the consumer habits like if if the mobility stays low for a long time that is the 1st question and the 2nd question is in brazil logistics which are the biggest industries that that those businesses serve sergio i i think in in we have better abilities and and competencies to suit the assortment for an economic downturn lack of mobility is it will be different because really they are also designed to serve people that are on on the go and are on the street we have had in the past the daily and replenishment category and and that is the groceries we could not really bind the groceries and also it is really the one that the the the one that you are left out in your pantry and and really that is really the occasion that we have have been sharing i think in this pandemic we have been able to to compel and the consumer that we have a a good assortment of of of for for that pantry well to find the product you are that that you are left out in in your in in your pantry and and i think by testing more and finding more they are finding that we have be good prices but i think that category it will if lack of mobility will be in place we will have to expand that category compared with the quench or or or some other categories that are more designed to serve people that are on the go but i think that would take more the more time and and effort than product to the economic downturn juan yes no i i think i mean on on that front it it it will be interesting for all of us to to see whether you know the consumer begins to privilege proximity even more right in terms of these traditionally kind of supermarket type categories and whether our assortment and our pricing is is compelling enough which probably we will we will expect that it will be for some of these cust consumers to decide to not just buy the you know the cooking oil or the rice that they forgot or that they run out of during you know between trips to the supermarket but that they will use oxxo as a more frequent source of this type of products and then we will make the necessary adjustments as as we go along i think on and i mentioned earlier the you know the the comment about spirits as another potential category where we hopefully will become more kind of top of mind for the consumer in terms of how how good an assortment and and how good our pricing is for for that category i think you also touched on on the 2nd part of your question on the categories for brazil logistics i think generally as we have been moving towards the ltl the less than truckload business and the specialized warehousing certainly pharma is an industry that is very well suited for the for the type of logistics that that that we do not just in the distribution part but also on the on the warehousing side in fact if you look at agv the the company that we acquired a few months ago the you know their biggest their biggest category actually has to do with with health certainly a big component of of animal or veterinary health but also human health i think when you think about the the the equation or the relationship between the size of the products the weight and the and kind of the volume and the cost and and the type of conditions that they require for the transportation and their storage it is an attractive industry it is a profitable industry and it is a very good fit with with what we do so i would say you should expect us to continue to try to grow in in that front obviously there are others there are cpg products and categories and companies electronics companies but certainly the health you know for both human and and veterinary stand stand out as as as probably one of the biggest if not the biggest thank you and next question will come from carlos laboy of hsbc good morning everyone john and constant hi carlos hi eduardo john and constantino spoke of a concentrate price readjustment yesterday as the controlling shareholder and with really important rights in your equity agreement with coke what role is femsa playing in this negotiation and what can you tell us about the long term clarity of profit split with the brand owner well are they are they adequate for you at this point carlos this agreement was signed like four years ago and yes we want to have we would love to have a more stable and certain long term relationship model and that that is something that is important for us and and and and important not only for the femsa is controlling shareholder it is very important for management because the way we we compensate the management they have to have some certainty because that is very important for the long run and also for the minority shareholders the only the coca cola company is is understand this and and i think it it really is is we just have to be very creative and and and and and and and empathetic from both sides in the stand but we are at the same ship that is very important because probably in the in the past we were not as empathetic of to understand the income statement of the coca cola company and probably they were not as empathetic to understand our income statement and i think with through these conversations that we have had with them we are very much aligned and then they have a total understanding that we are exactly in the same boat and the current economic circumstances and the current consumer behavior we have to be very much aligned so we are trying to build as much aligned as possible alignment as possible and certainty so we can invest and and develop and tackle the consumer the best we can and as i said we love and and i think the main two objections have to be fully aligned fully aligned and the build certainty and trust in the relationship for the long run so the tenure of the last agreement was a ten year agreement this one you just got a negotiation four years ago that just just you just finished making your last payments on it do you know what the tenure of this agreement is going forward or are we just really negotiating a long term agreement now no we we we have this established and and and but it is it is something that they they have the time and and and and we we cannot disclose this to you to you without them being fully aware but do not worry we are very happy with it and and and and in fact we love to have this kind of agreement everywhere else we have given the certainty for the long run and alignment alignment certainty and trust that is helpful thank you yeah i think car carlos if i if if i could you know a few weeks ago in in in one of the group calls that that you you you have helped us set up with with investors you you asked me the question of you know is it possible to have a a long term relationship with with coke where where both partners realize a reasonable spread of roic versus wacc and and my answer was was yes yes yes we can right i mean yes it is possible and i think the point i would make right now is that this is definitely not at odds with what you know what john and constantino said yesterday i mean the alignment that eduardo is talking about the expectation that there is a formula where both partners can make the the right level of returns is what we are looking at thank you and now we will take a question from ricardo alves of morgan stanley good morning gentlemen thanks for the call most of my questions have been answered but if i may just insist a little bit more on the jan san asset appreciate your comments earlier now perhaps a bit more of a strategic question i mean how how do you you know how are you going to be unlocking value on this acquisition in the long run i mean juan just mentioned the the m a potential but you know as you merge the two companies you come up with the venture synergies and so forth what is the plan here in terms of how it fits to the overall femsa platform or perhaps it is just that the growth profile of these assets just improved a lot with the dynamic and then you know m a would really be the key driver for for future cash generation so just a few thoughts there would be helpful and and then just a quick update on the jv in brazil as well yeah i i think we have a very good platforms for the medium and long run i think this pandemic has caused some some some damages but i think in the medium and long term we are very optimistic we have the health division where and we have opportunities there for growth we have the proximity division and then we have we are very optimistic of of the of the performance we are making in in south america and the jv we made in in in in brazil and also with our partnerships that we have here in in in in in in in the united states we are very pi optimistic we have two great platforms we have the the jetro restaurant depot without doubt jetro has been eating share part of the competitors and at least a major competitive strength that they have and we are very happy with that and on the other hand in in in in in the ja ja jan san business we are i think we made the right decision with the companies we are with it with the partners that we have and the platforms that have been established and the opportunities too for integration and and going forward for a na more national footprint as as i said we do not plan to open up a new vector for growth i think the ones are there and we just have to be very keen and and probably those ne short term pandemic disturbance cope with it align better make efficiencies and and probably make some decisions to adjust ourselves to this new environment but we have great platforms for growth in in the future juan yeah no i i think i would just following up on what you just said a while ago you know on the whole jan san platform there is certainly you know this is an industry that is very highly fragmented where you do not really have a huge incumbent as a platform that we are forming by combining waxie in north american already becomes one of the larger players with you know the the the waxie since it has kind of a bias to the west coast of the us north american out of chicago has more of a midwest all the way down to florida coverage but you really do not have players with anything resembling a big national presence and so the synergy component the the aspiration to integrate more of these assets at the right time and in the right way it is a big part of i think the the aspiration that that we have for that business scale is a beautiful thing we we we have been the beneficiaries of of of scale in in many of our businesses and this is another one where we think that could work its its magic if done at in the right way i think you also mentioned at the end of your question something about an update on the on the jv in brazil you know obviously the the pandemic throws a little bit of sand into the gears in terms of the the the pace of openings down there but quite frankly we are almost on track in terms of openings for both the 1st new stores on the select side on the on the gas stations of raizen but also on the on the standalone oxxo side so we we do aspire to start opening stores oxxo stores towards the end of the year in in brazil we are already making progress in terms of setting up our 1st distribution center down there as well so things are going very much according to plan and like i said i think the pandemic has not forced the team down in in in brazil to depart very much from the original plan obviously this is we have said before this is not going to be a piece of cake you know figuring out the right val value proposition for for the brazilian oxxo is is going to take a little bit of time but the the size of the opportunity and and certainly the the partnership that we have make us very very optimistic that this will eventually be an important part of the portfolio and i think the the partnership that we have with with cosan and and and i think if if we found that the proximity division really entire commercial found the right way to go into brazil they are very happy they are learning a lot in fact they are learning through and and they are going to do adopt some of the select operations to this new scheme and i think there is a a lot of we see a lot of growth and and potential to adjust the value proposition of the select stores and the oxxo stores in the field and i think that will be very but it will take time it will take time but i think we are very optimistic got it thank you so much now we go back to a follow up from gustavo oliveira of ubs thank you for taking my followup question you know if i may yesterday at walmex conference call they may show some risks with respect to the introduction of the new labeling regulation rules that will start already in october could you please help us to understand what could be the impact of those new labeling rules in your in your oxxo business perhaps during the transition time now as as as it is implemented in october and perhaps in in your ability of of or on your suppliers ability to push for for sales growth we we think that the sometimes too much information for the consumer and and and and and it seems like what i have been learning i think it is very important to inform the consumer so the consumer can do the better decision for the their their i do not know for their health and and and then nutrition and everything sometimes if the if the if the labeling goes a bit too far the consumer might be blocking some of some of so so much information that he does not want to he he is just overloaded by this labeling we do not know really where we would stand and and i think but but but currently we have been working very closely with with the with the our suppliers and i think we will be very in in a very good position to adapt to this new environment we do not see major derails ha happening i do not know you want to add to to this one i mean just just the point that i think on on on beverages certainly on the coke femsa side generally the consumer has been well informed for many years now about you know calorie count and that sort of thing and then the the industry has been evolving for a while increasing the percentage of the of the portfolio that has reduced or no calories at all and so i think the you know the challenges from the from the relabeling involve more you know the costs and the kind of the the operating conundrums of you know changing labels or adjusting your packaging that sort of thing but not so much in terms of the incremental information that the consumer will receive there are there are other categories where maybe the the consumer has not been as as as exposed to nutritional information and i think for those there there there will be a period of adaptation but to eduardo is point you know i think also is is is it is very well positioned and the the the flexibility and the the the level of dialog and cooperation with suppliers leads i think to to what should be a relatively smooth transition when this eventually becomes a a fact during this transition juan and eduardo do you foresee the risk of a a more aggressive markdown just to get rid of the inventory that is with the old labeling and befo or or suppliers are going to assume the cost you know of of that operation i think that could impact your your four q results or perhaps part of your three q results no but i i i think if we we i ne but i never the turnover of inventory in in in in oxxo goes very fast and if there will be some opportunities there we will then we will continue to make some more money yes i i i think it will be yeah probably an alternative i do not know if juan no i i agree with you that our inventory levels and you know tend to be small and and there the turnover is just as fast and i am sure we will work with suppliers and come up come up with promotional activity as required and i do not think it is something that is that is causing us to lose a lot of sleep at this point thank you very much for the clarification thank you thanks gustavo thank you and ladies and gentlemen that is all the time we have for questions today i will now turn the conference back to mister padilla for closing additional remarks well thank you everyone

is investor relations website this concludes our conference for today thank you for your participation and have a nice day all parties may now disconnect",
            "prediction": "please stand by good morning and welcome everyone to zions 2nd quarter 2020 financial results conference call please note today is call is being recorded all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise after the presentation there will be a question and answer session during this conference call management may discuss certain forward looking statements concerning zions future performance and should be considered as good faith estimates made by the company these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to economic conditions changes in laws and regulations and the actions of competitors and other 3rd parties good morning everyone i welcome to pensa is 2nd quarter 2020 results conference call i think it is customary one from each guest the 1st quarter was also on the line and today we were also joined by uchenna garza we hope that you and your loved ones are in healthy and safe the 2nd quarter was the most challenging period we have faced operationally in many days although there were differences in performance among our business units but also we saw severe impacts from continuing lack of consumer mobility in the geography we serve that translated into soft performance for most of the quarter but as the challenges were compounded by the lack of beer supply but only began to recover in the month of june our health division fared better as demand for its production products remained high but sales were constrained by strict restrictions imposed on consumers and their ability to move around particularly in our key south american market the field division was impacted the most as beer sales were down by the most utilization fell quickly and drastically however from a deeper value and a relative terms it is the return operation that seems to be rebounding faster for its part where aqualenshin was quite resilient nurturing its execution capabilities to once again adapt to consumer needs and minimize the negative impact on the long term having said all that our team continues to execute at a higher level in very complex environments and we continue to focus on the safety and health of our people and our customers above all else moving on to the sic consolidated financial statements total revenue during the 2nd quarter decreased tenseven while income from operations decreased 37five on an organic basis total revenues decreased fourteenthree and income from operations decreased by fortyfour for this quarter the difference between reported and organic figures reflects the impact of acquisitions number one lower income from operations as i described number two higher other non operating expenses including affiliate charges related to the extraordinary payment of $2300000000 the 1st item is an 8800000000 pesos agreement with the mexican tax authority as well as some permits including for certain assets of coca cola femsa and the closure of our specialty operations and number three participation in hanover results which were lower relative to the comparable figure we reported last year in terms of our consolidated net debt position during the 1st quarter it increased by approximately 10000000000 pesos compared to the prior year during the 2nd quarter we expect to reach a level of 72000000000 pesos at the end of june this reflects our investment of approximately $900000000 in the wax and north american platforms as well as the majority of the large tax payments mentioned before while we are on the debt and the charges of the debt we should mention that during the 2nd quarter we will place $700000000 in the 2nd reopening or over thirty year dollar denominated bond issues bringing the total amount to $2500000000 which was our original target the weighted average yield for a public insurance was threefive which was also our target back in september when we started with this project and i highlight this because it took us nine months and we went to the market on three separate locations in order to get the amount we wanted at the cost we wanted we were very patient and it paid off and this is the approach and this is the approach under this framework what we try to bring for financial decisions moving on to discuss our operations and beginning with penseco commercial proximity division we should start with a comment about store openings while we managed to open a number of new stores in the quarter we also have to close a small percentage of our store base due to covid nineteen restrictions and effects some of the closures will be temporary but some will be permanent as we take this opportunity to remove certain marginal stores from our base the numbers for the quarter went like this 159 new openings 85 re openings after remodeling and maintenance 24 definite closures and 260 temporary closures as a result we recorded a net reduction of forty stores for the 2nd quarter to reach 150 net store openings for the last two months in addition to the store closures reviewed the number of operating shifts from three to two in a large percentage of our stores as 247 operations are not viable or necessary given the current consumer dynamics also since the stores were down twelvefour for the 2nd quarter reflecting a 2424 one decline in store traffic and an increase of fifteenfour in average consumer customer traffic here it is also useful to pause and discuss a little bit what happened in inter quarter because we did see meaningful differences as the quarter went by during april as you may recall we had relative availability of beer for most of the month as well as some planning buying for certain categories on the part of consumers and this mitigated the blow and made april the least but month of the quarter for us during may however we basically depleted our beer inventories and we saw the steepest contractions in traffic making the worst month of the quarter finally in june we began to recover beer availability and we also began to observe a gradual shift in consumer dynamics during the 1st part of the quarter most of the consumer demand weakness came from mobility restrictions and lockdowns with the thirst and craving occasions suffering from the absence of customers going about on the street and the gathering occasion really from social distancing however later in the quarter the weakness in the man in the man seems to be driven increasingly by economic hardship  so many consumers have lost their income making the crisis today a bit more similar to prior downturns but also more pronounced adding to the headwinds as much as half of our stores in mexico were under some type of operating restriction from local authorities moving down the income statement for the 2nd quarter gross margin contracted by ten basis points reflecting a negative sales mix caused by the beer shortages in may and improved performance over daily and replenishment categories partially offset by a high single basis point increase services category income for operations decreased almost 66 and operating margin contracting 220 basis points to affect significant operating debt leverage moving on to the commercial health division we reduced our store count by seven drug stores as a result of temporary closures was enough to set the small number of stores we opened during the quarter having said that we have a total of 355 stores 189 open units across our territories at the end of june and 128 total net new stores for the last two months revenues increased twofour while on an organic basis they decreased nine one same store sales decreased an average of nineeight in mexican pesos reflecting the negative impact of the street mobility restrictions implemented in our south american markets including mexico i partially offset by a service performance in operations in mexico gross margin expanded by eighty basis points in the quarter reflecting number one a positive sales mix effect driven by consumer behavior shifts in connection to the pandemic number two more effective collaboration with key supplier partners in operations in south america and number three better margin performance and our business in ecuador where applying sico for our operation operating margin contracted 120 basis points reflecting lower operating leverage in south america as we anticipated last quarter our finance and commercial field division was the smoothest exposed to the current environment of lockdowns and reviews mobility and the impact is visible in our quarterly results while we were able to add one new net one new net station total revenue same station sales decreased an average of almost fifty in the 2nd quarter gross margin reached thirteenthree while operating margin was oneeight of total revenues reflecting considerable operating leverage operating expenses decreased fifteen as a result of tighter expense control and increased efficiency as a fiscal yearling in terms it seems this business is the one we are recovering more quickly in terms showing the sequential improvement in the past weeks but rising from a very deeper contraction finally moving on briefly to coca cola femsa as john highlighted yesterday the results show a significant improvement in mexico improvement in brazil and colombia and continued strength in guatemala they made further progress in the past week good morning this is the opening of the 1st digital and omnichannel initiative in team markets and manage to deliver solace for stability in mexico and central america even in the context of the current pandemic for more detail you can listen to the webcast of the acquirement conference call the initial main goals were severe health concerns and the lack of concern and mobility and these remain a problem however we are increasingly seeing the signs of another set of more traditional economic hard times coming into place this is not positive but at least we have more experience with economic downturns as you might imagine we continue to look for at our entire business in an effort to optimize it for the changes taking place today for those that seem to be on the way and and for those that seem to be on the way and we will continue to work hard to achieve our goal as a company to meet the moment and to come out in better shape on the other side and with that we can obtain the call for questions operator thank you the question and answer session will begin at this time if you would like to ask a question during this time please press the star the number one on your telephone keypad if you would like to withdraw your question press the pound star two your question will be taken in the order that it is received in the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question at a time to allow the maximum number of callers to ask their questions again that is star one to ask a question and we will go 1st to ben thurer of barclays good morning thank you very much for taking the question hope you are all safe and sound at the white house and and well osborne you are welcome welcome aboard so but my one question would be on the more recent performance in oxon and you have elaborated how it went through the quarter but if you could shed a little light on the current performance over the most recent weeks into july where we have seen more states going into the orange face some of the reopenings and if you could also share with us on the but the temporary store closures how many you you currently still have closed and how do you think the reopening is going to evolve considering some of the tourist restrictions as well as office restrictions that are still in place that would be my 1st question thank you ben let me tell you we we are making progress  the quarter fifty have restrictions now i will say 35 have restrictions the same so ourselves have improved a little bit mobility is is is coming still but but there s still if we you know if we we just pay attention to the google mobility index and and the google mobility index in mexico is down around forty and and that really i mean met also really lives by but the people are undergoing and moving and and this is really being the major cost we think that people are beginning to understand and adapt to these new environments mobility is coming up little by little and and not only car mobility but pedestrian mobility too and i think all depends that how why is it going to happen with schools the next quarter was going to happen with with offices opening or keeping it closed so i think was optimistic in that way that we are understanding the pandemic better you know i could sense that the lack of contagiousness of of these  pandemic in the stores is very low very very low basically the the problem that we have had with the the the the the personnel is more because the the lockdowns they leave their house and the lack of of of of care they have with with connection with some family members and  most of the people that have had the the pandemic goes through the house not really from from from the traffic to the to the work or the store so we are optimistic but the thing is that you know we are feeling now the pain that the economic downturn is becoming we are staying here and and and we are adapting the the the offerings too but we are cautiously optimistic well as i said a lot of the lock downs that we have we have been able to get some additional resources to those locations or maybe just in anticipation of of the more traditional headwinds in terms of the slowdown in the economy have restrictions of alcoholic curfews or or lockdowns or the possibility of open stores in certain commercial areas and and that was the number that we had around fifty had these kind of restrictions i said now out of the 19000 stores there are around 7000 that might that have had some kind of restrictions for instance in the state of kentucky the people we can we were not allowed to to sell we have to we have to close not only not so so alchohol but to close the the completely the store and again i think the local authorities are trying to the best to adapt and and and and have countermeasures against this pandemic some are effective and some are not i would say and and but the thing is we try to to lobby and understand what the authority is trying to do and help them to accomplish the the objectives not necessarily by by by obstructing the the way we we work with the stores i think another problem is really but through a low bound but the lack of social mobility and the social distancing night shifts are very very weak and we have had some besides the the locked down restrictions that we have from authorities or selling of alcohol and some  some stores also we are really closing some denunciations because again there is no no consumers around so but again we think that will be temporary and and we are adapting the best we can and again as a reminder that is star one to ask a question and if you find that your question has been answered you can remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two we will now go to miguel torres of gpm hi good morning everyone thanks for the chance to speak the question i have is considering the timing of this crisis that came right after you bought or invested in a couple of companies which of them would you say has had the most significant impact we start now on the defensive direction you know we were very happy with the yeah with our partners and when with the companies we acquired they are under janssen business and as you imagine janssen has had a great demand for for the products out of the two  waxes is more focused to janssen and north america and had a more diverse platform and in fact north america had added so so to some  hospitality  customers and i think probably that is the one that has suffered the most but i think both companies have adapted tremendously to this environment they have been able to to protect their their employees and and and but but at the very same time try to serve the customers so we are extraordinary happy with them we have great partners and i think that we are going to build my story platform with the help of them and and we look forward with their very optimistic future i think i would add that and also just juan even on the on the jetway restaurant depot which is also one of the recent investments which being as exposed as they are to the restaurant sector one would think or at least one would have thought a few months ago that this would be a complicated period for them and i am not saying it has not been but i think they have done a great job certainly they have been adjusting and navigating the situation quite frankly exceeding exceeding at least my personal expectations which kind of confirms our view that this is a very well positioned and very well run company and things begin to open up in many of the markets that they serve so overall i would say on the restaurant depot front you know a positive surprise great thank you bart and now we will take a question from marcelo roschke of credit suisse hi let us check your mute function we are unable to hear you hi are you listening to me now yes please go ahead with your yeah okay hi howa hi eduardo i hope you are well just two quick co questions here from my side the 1st one is about dna i saw that basically your dna increases it across the business division so just to understand what is driving such increase and secondly very briefly if you can give you so your impressions about the mexican pension reform in terms of potential impacts for for fensam thank you very much well i will go to the 2nd one and i think let one answer the 1st one the pension reform i think is is this whole web there and i think it is a good thing that we all together try to solve it because it will be very difficult for the current government to to to solve it and and what we would like to have to solve it in a desperate way and and that that could be absorbed the economic environment in mexico i think what we have for the future is it is it is kind of painful but i think it is what the right thing to do and i think between the yeah the private companies and the government i think it is it is a good sign that we are together here to to fix the hole for the long run and the other one when what did you go and yes hi marcella so we we are having some amortization of it investments i think on the oxy front and they have continued to to invest in their new versions of some of the software as well as developing the digital platforms across the board we have had some closures of stores and we have had some asset write downs both at cocp and also at oxy so i think that would be playing a part on that obviously we can we can also follow up offline in terms of you know making the numbers match but i think off the top of our heads that those are concepts that come to mind okay thank you thank you very much guys thank you it is on oxo gross margin you mentioned that your numbers are actually very good there was a very little contraction there you mentioned that the beer shortage obviously affected your profitability but that was offset by by the service category on the recovery do you think that you could actually see an expansion in your gross margin as the i do not know if the service category we remain strong and the beer clearly could recover could you please elaborate a bit on on the trend for for the gross gross margin for for oxo well let let me give you some our our suppliers and us are concerned with the like the yeah lack of consumer economic trend but but what we are trying to do is is to come up with with different offerings to to really to stimulate the demand and here we are we have we have our our  suppliers and our partners and trying to do something great for them for the consumer in in current times but i do not know when where do you go and and go for the  the details of the numbers please supplier partners right now as we all know has said you know and i think a positive surprise has been the resilience and even the you know faster growth of financial services during the downturn as consumers have kind of made sure that they are keeping current with their with their memberships and their utilities and and you know realizing or or taking advantage of the fact that it is it is a lot easier to go to oaxaca than than to go to the bank and it is and so even though financial services had been contracting or at least it had been growing less in recent quarters in the last two or three quarters this quarter it actually the growth came came in in the and the high single digits which was  a positive surprise and i think contributes to the to the high growth margin the other question  on commercial income is a little bit trickier because you know so some of those agreements as i have also referred to are are tied to to volume and so it is hard to predict i mean we we do need volumes to come up transactions to go up for commercial income to go up you know in consequence so i would say visibility for growth margin is is is not as clear as as we would like i would not necessarily predict at this point that we will continue to to expand it you know more than more than trend but at least during the during the 2nd quarter it did kind of hold its own thank you i think it is very clear thank you i will also add that probably the there were a small increase also in in and and the lack of beer also shifted demand to to some of the alcoholic beverages and that those have that probably the margin a little bit too there was an interesting point that elio had because yeah obviously you are you are right and consumers did shift to higher consumption of spirits during the quarter and interestingly i think what what the oxo or oxo colleagues were observing in recent weeks was that even as the beer came back that the volume for spirits was still holding up strong so maybe you know in in the effort to look for the for the silver lining in the quarter there was a shift to spirits you know at consumers realize what the assortment and the pricing is for for spirits at the oxo stores that this becomes a category that is you know that is stronger than than historically because historically we have not sold as much spirits as we are selling right now so hopefully this remains after the after the pandemic is is gone we will move on to our next question and that will be from allen olanes of santicender thank you so much good morning everyone i was wondering if i could have a follow up on the recent incident at the santicender and thanks for the for the space for questions so here  wanted to to get your thoughts a little bit on on any potential  product portfolio rationalization there there in october and maybe if you can share any any caller on what you are seeing in terms of of the shift in in mix more recently now in july maybe going back a little bit more to the to the more profitable categories that you guys have there thank you you know unless we think that these lack of homogeneity will stay for a very long period of time which we not which we we do not think it is the case i think we we bet we have to adapt better and we have to adapt more to the to the lack of of consumer economic power and and by by probably with a different sortment probably the looking for for cheaper or or less expensive products i were returnable of cookware the soft drinks is is not as as strong as we should have it now and and and those kind of sheets we can we can foresee it for the future but necessarily in in the types of of of consumer demand of of of 1st or or breakfast or or people gathering depending on we think that eventually i think that those type of of consumer demand will stay it is more the lack of economic power the consumer that we are more concerned about than than the real shift of of all consumer locations that is perfect and a bit more on the short term kind of thinking now on on june 20th after the beer categories back and et cetera do you have any any caller that you can share with us kind of there on on the shift back let us say in july thank you yeah i think eleven thing to kind of highlight and i think alon touched on it in his opening remarks was that the quarter itself was a little bit of a i do not know if a v shape it is a little bit of a strong descriptor but certainly the the trough of the of the trend was was the month of may and we believe that we hope and believe that that will mark the the lowest point of this downturn should be and then as a beer comes back it it helps everything right it it helps operating leverage and it helps margins and generally begins to to turn this into a more traditional downturn so so to speak and so you know the as i said in the beginning we we are seeing improving improving metrics and improving traffic and and really the the one concern i have is not to convey the the view that you know once the the mobility restrictions are are gone that we go back to normal immediately right because we are seeing this symptoms and and signs of  of our more traditional economic driven downturn but again you know yeah when you when you go dry and this had never happened before on the beer side  really you have both of our suppliers on the beer front working hard to restock the the shelves consumers themselves are probably buying a little bit more beer than they normally do to make sure they do not go dry again and so you know you are seeing positive trends on on some of these important categories especially beer so i would expect that to to continue and you know we we will obviously make the adjustments a lot of the reference some in terms of of packaging and and and mix for some important categories i think we need to to be careful and work hard at understanding how you know how quickly and and what the new normal eventually ends up looking like in the sense that we will i am sure adapt our value proposition to that whether it means you know some incremental esca use or a shift in the mix and that sort of thing so so we are we are still not at the end of this but we know more about how the consumer i am adjusting habits that we did a couple of months ago and we are acting in consequence we on the sell side most of us have a buy rating on the stock i mean because of the of the lowly priced evaluation of wockhardt implied here now the the result of this quarter i guess the question is is these results putting to question the business model of wockhardt in the long run this is the 1st quarter ever that you closed to us so i guess the specific question is what in sorry if i mentioned what what the expectations regarding store openings going forward and 2nd thing and is the question we get a lot and i am sure one also gets a lot of is why they are reluctant to stay away from ecommerce an investor even joked with me saying every time you guys mention the competitors with amazon or so forth the stock reacts positively or why not invest in  in a basement or in a 2nd floor in in as many offices as possible to use them as distribution for ecommerce and leverage that especially given the two changes of the pandemic will cost and the 3rd and last question has to do with with capital deployment i mean i think that the pushback has been the visibility in terms of capital deployment and the lack of discipline that you mentioned about patience and discipline i think that it is very clear for investors that you are the you are the designated winner in terms of patience but what can you expand on in terms of of giving comfort to investors that you will remain disciplined in terms of that capital deployment given the the very strong global growth those will be my questions thank you so much well let me say we are very optimistic about this opportunity in the individual long term i think we have a very strong platform and it is just that we have the right consumer adjustments in the lack of mobility that that will help us to be on track again in terms of of your question about the e commerce we are we are very much but we are doing things that we are not prepared yet to disclose but i think we are in the financial and the relational sector we see the evolution there and we have to be prepared and also the loyalty programs related and connected with the financial platform we we the current the current if you want to see those are the the ones as the what we do not know yet is the e the home delivery home delivery still we do not see how the impact the ones that are doing home delivery in small purchases not groceries but small purchases like the ones we deliver nobody makes money nobody makes money and and they are still trying to to catch up and find a better way so if we were in the grocery business without doubt that would be delivering a lot of things for the for the  for homes because economically it makes sense and the other the other ones we have not seen yet although we have some tests to deliver in a very efficient way with some back stock and everything but i think with there are still some learnings and and and efficiency and come and into place to to perform better i do not know we want to add  to the question one thank you robert yes i do i think island is 1st attempt at the question did not work but the 2nd attempt he made sure that he covered for a full amount of big topics so i will i will try to to add to to some of these so on the storefront island you know i think what what we are seeing is you know we we had for a number of years with opening more stores every year than the previous you know we got as high as 1350 i think at the at the top and i think what we are doing right now is we are taking this opportunity to look at the you know the you know that there is a layer of stores that are probably marginal in terms of of what they are contributing to the numbers and we are we are you know figuring out which of those stores actually should not be opened kind of pruning the the base of a small and just generally i think you know the budget for stores this year before you know the pandemic kind of reared its its ugly head we were thinking about 1200 stores for mexico so that you know that is a level that is a little bit lower than the top that we reached a couple of years ago but you know we were already kind of moving into a phase where you are you are becoming more demanding about what you expect of your new stores in order to ensure and obviously once you get some scale in colombia chile eventually hopefully brazil that this becomes not just a mexico story but more of  of a continental story so we are in the early stages of that process where internationally we will begin to add you know more meaningful numbers to the number of stores and obviously once you get some scale in colombia chile eventually hopefully brazil that this becomes not just a mexico story but more of  of a continental story so we are in the early stages of that process where internationally we will begin to add you know more meaningful numbers to the number of stores and obviously once you get some scale in colombia chile eventually hopefully brazil that this becomes not just a mexico story but more of  of a continental story at that stage and i think this year with the pandemic with the dynamics we decided to to start closing a few of those kind of marginal stores i am also optimistic on the storefront that for central and western mexico now that we have you know both portfolios of beers that there will be a large number of locations in places like guadalajara leon even the the valley of mexico where the fact that you now have the adi portfolio kind of takes a lot of those locations that were just short of being viable makes them viable and again kind of you know ensures that we can continue to continue to open large numbers of stores in that part of the country i think on the ecommerce front i mean as a lot of the touches on it in terms of also obviously realizing the the potential and the power of of the oxal platform to bankerize people or to get people to adopt new technologies or new products and i think we we certainly have the salbaso experience that gives us a lot of comfort in terms of our ability to get people to sign up and and adopt  new new means of payment or new means of of of saving but one thing we do not want to do is to over promise and and under deliver so we are working hard at the three legged stool of our digital platform at at oaxaca which involves last mile delivery and i think more importantly the loyalty program and the u wallet and hopefully we will have something to show the market you know toward the end of the year and then finally on capital deployment i mean you know you have seen us for over the years femsa basically has a couple of ways that that we grow we either take what we do well to a new geography or we take what we do well and we expand it by a couple of degrees and examples of of this abound whether you are talking about hugo is el bajio or santa clara or the dry stone business where you took a kind of oxide and expanded what it does by a few degrees and and and you know decided you go into dry stone we usually do which is figuring out what you know what we do well and then taking it to another another country obviously with the benefit of very strong partners as we have in in the u s so we understand that we you know we we are adding a little bit of complexity to the to the org chart we will try to address that to the extent that we can by increasing the disclosure and where we have spoken about how we are going to start opening up the numbers for so the logistics business as well as for the jncs business 1st quarter of next year so you know capital deployment these investments and and addressing the complexity that it brings to the equation are very much top of mind for for the team and and hopefully we are in the process of addressing it got it got it no thank you so much i mean you guys are extremely good not the best in the region in terms of large scale logistics of moving things you just get the package for a lot of investors and analysts why i mean that logistical expertise has can be moved to like all the way to small delivery like as far as this head to a war room this point i mean i know i am going to say something very humbly and think that you already know but amazon tesla and facebook all of these companies started without making money initially and they just gained the scale and this columbia guys wrapping it is a question mark they are going to be able to do to control small small dropside delivery and they just think that and i think a lot of investors think that you have  you have a great opportunity you have the balance sheet you have the expertise and i think that yeah initially will nobody will make money and probably you get in you probably will not make money either but they want to get the scale eventually i think consumers will pay a premium for using google for taking using pay group for using amazon and so forth and with a long term vision the term to has i think that a lot of investors are thinking like or you getting into that with more strength and using your your muscle and your expertise but anyway thank you so much for taking my questions stay stay safe and have a great day thank you thank you all that i mean i just run that that question where you know the the concept or the notion of the super apps and how in in other in other geographies obviously things have evolved very quickly but but we do have the aspiration with the  you know with the right platform and the right partnerships to hopefully become become one of those or part of one of those systems down the road and leverage quite frankly the the 20000 bricks and mortar stores that we have which are a differentiating factor vis a vis the other folks so thank you so much one thank you roger thanks all of you right on alan i think the mom and pop stores were hardly hit unfortunately because of the lack of beer and that was a the lack of cigarettes because it was not on the bear in cigarettes i think we were able to to  to prepare ourselves with good inventories and but again the so those two were and major they had major effects on it in the other hand i think the the traditional mountainous parts are closed where people leave so i think i would say there are different mountainous parts to work where where the where mobility is where a major role yes they did not have hardly hit but these other areas i think the ones are in the small neighborhoods i think they are they are coming up with  with a good performance i would say also that they were better prepared in the returnable bottles that the ones the returnable soups compared with with also so that was a small advantage but yes again i think they will recuperate because i think the yeah the co coa assistants these are transcriptions of spoken words they are not necessarily word for word accurate but they are close and can be used to identify themes topics and speakers being black and i like i am very much willing to support them and and help and help them to compete and and so i i do see that the pandemic those laborers i think is is helping them to to sustain but yes but they were very hard hit the ones that have a lack of beer in during this initial period of the pandemic and to the last question i guess you you have taken some stakes in in certain startups and i have seen that one of those hostels has been growing quite quite a bit any insights or things that you have learned on on the delivery in in these stakes that that you can share to support those suppliers that are very much aligned with us that will help us  to enhance our our value proposition and i do not know specifically the one you are talking about when one might have a better idea of of but yes was working not only with technological suppliers but also with with normal suppliers where we could help them to become larger and in fact we need that with  we have a great supplier that we have with uscafe which is the one that supported all the coffee operations and i think with that knowledge we could be of of great support to them so this pandemic we also we we all the small vendors we are helping them to pay them very quickly so they do not have this cash flow problem that this pandemic will cost to them and and so that that those are the the yes but our small we want to help scale suppliers are very important and the strategic ones we want to invest with them so they can grow better and faster to become a major competitive advantage to us yeah i think on the on the houston or j c penney investment i mean certainly we are we are trying to to help these these new ventures through our femsa ventures arm but also learn about you know things that that would help us in our own value proposition or or the way that we operate certainly the distribution the use of you know dark dark warehouses or dark kitchens dark stores the handling of perishables these are all things that that we would love to to be better at and to know more about and this this investment in particular all the lead has has  turned out to be an an interesting one i mean the the the amounts involved are are not huge and and relative to the size of femsa but certainly it is a start up that is doing very well and of course i know that you take close to hello to these companies and and they are you know the different rounds of financing and and how quickly they are growing and and this is so far a very nice success story my question has two questions sorry but i have two questions one on heineken i was wondering if you could comment on whether or not your position on the stake on owning you know this fifteen has changed or you are not getting the new tax agreement with the mexican government and two on mna fair to say or an integration move it seemed to be a nice time to sort of take a breather and and integrate a lot of the different the assets you have bought over the last couple of years that is my two questions thank you the right time and the right path to deploy that capital and and have that use of those proceeds the the 2nd question i forgot the one we were talking about zero i forgot the 2nd one i mean are we ready to take a breather after a lot of activity of the m and a front i think i mean i think that the answer to that is is yes for the most part you should expect us to to start integrating capturing synergies and kind of delivering on the promise of all of all of these investments i would i would say there is there is probably eleven exception and you know the the jpmc platform  you know a big part of the of the attractiveness of that business involves growth through acquisitions and eventual integration and you know it is hard to tell at this point whether there will be transactions kind of coming along in the coming months and quarters but if they were i think we would be interested in taking looks but other than that for the most part and understanding that mna is hard to predict generally speaking the our stance is is one of as you say kind of sitting a little bit more on our hands and digesting the the number of bites that we took over the last eighteen months yes and  but thinking about the 4th platform that we are looking at i think we already have it so we we the and we do not think to open a new vector a different vector for growth with the one we have already was established the proximity health and and yeah and now these young platform i think we already very much focus we will be very much focus and into the platform that we already have hi good morning yes hi good morning thank you for taking my question i have two questions one is i want to go back on the portfolio and the yes sort of event question at oxol you spoke about how you can change some of the assortments given the the economic slowdown and but could you explain more on the assortments changes you can make in the face of the the reduced mobility and especially over the long term if this changes the the consumer habits like if if the mobility stays low for a long time and that is the 1st question and the 2nd question is in brazil logistics which are the biggest industries that those businesses serve i think in in we have better abilities and competencies to suit the assessor for an economic downturn lack of mobility is it will be different because really and also designed to serve people around on the goal around on the street we have had in the past the daily and replenishment of materials we have been able to to compel and the consumer that we have  the  good array of of  for for that  pantry well to find the part of you that they are left out in your but in your country and and i think by testing for and finding more they are finding that we have very good prices but i think that category it will you know lack of mobility will be in place will help to expand that category compared with the yeah quench or or some other categories are and more designed to serve people that are on the go but i think that will take more and more time and an effort than to adapt to the economy downturn one traditional supermarket type categories and whether our assortment and our pricing is is compelling enough which obviously we will we will expect that it will be for some of these consumers to decide to not just buy the you know the cooking oil or the rice so that they forgot or that they run out of during you know between trips to the supermarket but that they will use also as a more frequent source of this type of products and then we will make the ness i think on and i mentioned earlier the you know the the comment about spirits as another potential category where we hopefully will become more kind of top of mind for the consumer in terms of how how good an assortment and and how good our pricing is for for that category i think you also touched on on the 2nd part of your question on the categories for brazil logistics i think generally as we have been moving we have been focusing on making sure that we have the right categories and that we are serving the consumer in the best way possible certainly towards the ltl the less than truckload business and specialized warehousing certainly pharma is an industry that is very well suited for the for the type of logistics that that we do not just in the distribution part but also on the warehousing side in fact if you look at agv the the company that we acquired a few months ago you know their biggest their biggest category  actually has to do with with health certainly a big component of of animal or veterinary health but also human health i think when you think about the the the equation or the relationship between the size of the products the weight and the kind of the volume and the cost and and the type of conditions that they require for their transportation and their storage it s an attractive industry it s a profitable industry and it s a very good fit so i would say you should expect us to continue to try to grow in in that front obviously there are others there are cpg products and categories and companies electronics companies but certainly the health you know for both human and veterinary stand stand out as probably one of the biggest if not the biggest good morning everyone john and constantino hi but john and constantino spoke of a concentrate price readjustment yesterday as the controlling shareholder with really important rights in your equity agreement with coke what role is semsa playing in this negotiation and what can you tell us about the long term clarity profit splits with the brand owner are they adequate for you at this point this agreement was signed  like four years ago and yes we want to have we would love to have a more stable and certain long term relationship model and that that is something that is important for us and and and important not only for the pepsico controlling shareholder it is very important for managers the way we we compensate management they have to have some certainty because that is very important for the long run and also for the minority shareholders the and the co co co cooca company is is understands this and and i think it really is is we just have to be very creative and and and and and and empathetic from both sides understand that we are the same ship that is very important because probably in the in the past we were not as empathetic of to understand the income statement of a coca cola company and probably we were not as empathetic to understand our income statement and i think through these conversations that we have had with them we are very much aligned and and they have a common understanding that we were not exactly in the same boat under the current economic circumstances and the current consumer behavior we have to be very much aligned so we are trying to build watch a line as possible alignment as possible uncertainty so we can invest and and develop and tackle the consumer the best we can and as i said we love and i think the main two objectives have to be fully aligned fully aligned and the build certainty and trust in the relationship for the long run it was four years ago that just just you just finished making your last payments on it do you know what the tenure of this agreement is going forward or are we just really negotiating a long term agreement now than being fully aware but do not worry we are very happy with it and and and and in fact we would love to have this kind of agreement everywhere else we have had very high certainty for the long run and alignment alignment certainty and trust that is helpful thank you i think that is part of the if i if i could you know a few weeks ago in in one of the group calls that that you have helped us set up with with investors you you ask me the question of you know is it possible to have a long term relationship with with coke where where both partners realize a reasonable spread of royce versus wack and and my answer was was yes yes yes we can right i mean yes it is possible and i think the point i would make right now is that this is definitely not at odds with what you know what john and constantino said yesterday i mean  the alignment that i was talking about the expectation that there is a formula where both partners can make the the right level of returns is what we are looking for thank you a little bit more on the genesco asset appreciate your comments earlier now perhaps a bit more of a strategic question i mean how how do you you know how are you going to be unlocking value on this acquisition in the long run one just mentioned the the medifast pay show but you know as you merge the two companies you come up with the venture synergies and so forth what is the plan here in terms of how it fits to the overall sense of a platform or perhaps it is just that the group has grown i think we have a very good platform for the medium and long run i think this pandemic has caused some some of damages but i think when the medium long term is considered the damages are minimal we are very optimistic we have the health edition where we have opportunities for growth we have the proximity edition and then we have the revenue statistics of the of the performance of all making in south america and the jbd we made in brazil and also with our partnerships that we have here in the united states we are very optimistic we have two great platforms we have the  the jetblue regional depots without south jet so we have been eating share of the market and this is a major competitive strength that they have and we are very happy with that and and the other hand in in the jiangshen business we are i think we made the right decision with the companies in west with the partners that we have and the platforms that we have and the opportunities too for integration i am going forward for a more national footprint as i said we do not plan to open up a new vector for growth i think the ones are there and we just have to be very keen and and probably very neat short term  pandemic disturbance like cope with it align better make efficiencies and probably make some decisions to adjust ourselves to this new environment but yeah no i think i would just following up on what you just said at a level you know on the whole janssen platform there certainly you know this is an industry that is very highly fragmented where you do not really have a huge incumbent as the platform that we are forming by combining waxes in north america already becomes one of the larger ones players with you know the waxes it has a kind of a bias to the west coast of the us north america out of chicago has more of a midwest all the way down to florida coverage but you really do not have  players with anything resembling a big national presence and so the synergy component the the aspiration to integrate more of these assets at the right time and in the right way is a big part of i think the aspiration that that we have for that business scale is a beautiful thing we we have  been the beneficiaries of of of scale in in many of our businesses and this is another one where we think that could work it is it is magic if done up in the right way i think you also mentioned at the end of your question something about an update on the the jv in brazil you know obviously the the pandemic throws a little bit of sand into the gears in terms of the space of openings down there but quite frankly we are almost on track in terms of openings for both the 1st  new stores on the select side on the yeah on the gas stations of reasen but also on the on the stand alone oxo side so we we do aspire to start opening stores oxo stores towards the end of the year in brazil we are already making progress setting up our 1st distribution center down there as well so things are going very much according to plan and like i said i think the pandemic has not forced the team down in in brazil to depart very much from the original plan obviously this is as we have said before this is not going to be a piece of cake and you know figuring out the right and a valuable position for for the brazilian oxo is is going to take a little bit of time but the the sites of the opportunity and and certainly the the partnership that we have makes us very very optimistic that this will eventually be an important part of the portfolio and i think the partnership that we have with cosan and and and i think we found that the proximity division and the commercial division found the right way to go into brazil they are very happy they are learning a lot in fact they are learning us through and and and i want to adapt some of the select operations to this new screen and i think there is a lot of we see a lot of growth and and potential to adjust the balance of the position of the select stores and the option stores in the field and i think that will be very but it will take time it will take time but i think we are very optimistic now we will back to a follow up from gustavo oliva of ubs thank you for taking my follow up question yesterday at walmac is conference called dementia some risks with respect to the introduction of the new labeling and regulation rules that will start already in october we are looking to understand what could be the impact of those new labeling rules in your in your rok business perhaps during the transition time now as it is implemented in october and perhaps in your ability of or on your suppliers ability to push for sales growth consumer and and and and and it seems like what i have been learning i think it is very important to inform the consumer so the consumer can do the better decision for their their i do not know for their health and and and nutrition and everything sometimes if the if the labeling goes a bit too far the consumer might be blocking some of some of the benefits so so much information that he does not want to have he just overloaded by this labeling we do not know really where we will stand and and i think but but but currently we are working very closely with with our suppliers and i think we will be very in in a very good position to adapt to this new environment we do not see major deriders happening that you want to add to to this one i mean i just just the point that i think on on beverages certainly on the coke franchise side generally the consumer has been  well informed for many years now about the you know calorie count and that sort of thing and and the industry has been evolving for a while increasing the percentage of the of the portfolio that has reduced or no calories at all and so i think the you know the challenge is from the from the from the relabeling involve more you know the costs and the kind of the the operating conundrums of you know changing labels or adjusting your packaging that sort of thing but not so much in terms of the incremental information that the consumer will receive there there are other categories where maybe the the consumer has not been as as and as exposed to nutritional information and i think for those there will be a period of adaptation but to all those points you know i think also is is it very well positioned and the the flexibility and the level of dialog and cooperation with suppliers leads i think to to what should be a relatively smooth transition when this eventually becomes a fact i think that could impact your your four key results or perhaps part of your three key results no but i think if we we i know where i know i know the turnover of inventory in in in office goes very fast and there will be some opportunities there very well but we will probably make some money yes i think we will be probably i do not know one no i agree with you that our inventory levels and you know tend to be small and and the turnover is just fast and i am sure we will work with suppliers and come up with promotional activity as required and i do not think it is something that is that is causing us to lose a lot of sleep at this point thank you very much for the clarification thank you i could stop now thank you and ladies and gentlemen that is all the time we have for questions today i will now turn the conference back to mister padilla for proposing additional remarks thank you everyone thank you very much for your participation today stay safe and we will so relations website this concludes our conference for today thank you for your participation and have a nice day all

the 2nd quarter please refer to slides 45 and six in our presentation our organization and operations performed well during the 2nd quarter in the face of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage costs deliver on margin expansion and positive operating cash flow despite the drop in global construction i want to thank our employees across the globe for their dedication during these ever changing times due to the coronavirus we implemented changes in our operating environment to ensure our employees remain safe and healthy our multifaceted response to the government imposed and voluntary factor shutdowns resulted in minimal disruptions to our business i could not be more proud of our employees as they came together to support one another our customers and our vendors it goes without saying that ensuring the health and safety of our employees will always be our number one priority as discussed during our 1st quarter earnings call we were seeing significantly lower volumes in april and may impeded by lockdowns across the globe due to the coronavirus in june as the regions began to reopen revenue started to trend up for the 1st time since march in many of our markets our experience is in line with industry trends and our customers continue to depend on us during the quarters to support their needs july revenues have continued in line with june and our position in our markets is strong let us begin by talking about our fcc business fcc revenues which rebounded in june were about flat with june 2019 after experiencing the thirty decline in the 1st two months of the quarter in north america or largest region fcc had six growth in the month of june versus prior year june several large north american projects started during the quarter which will continue into 202 european volumes rebounded in june exceeding june 2019 volumes by two as the region reopened after being locked down in april and may fcc in latin america was impacted by a reduction in demand due to lockdowns in most of the countries which continued through to june in the asia region china began to recover during the quarter although southeast asia and australia remained in lockdown during june our verified business continues to grow although at a slower pace versus pre covid nineteen due to the downturn in the global construction industry now turning to sbm we saw a slow down in project activity and distributor demand during april and may with volumes down 37 during this two month period particularly when markets experienced construction restrictions place orders sales volumes improved in june with north america which is our largest region ending the month onefifty behind june of 201 we continue to win and progress on large project activity including airports bridges and office building projects we secured a number of infrastructure projects in north america which will support us in the 2nd half additionally some projects that began pre pandemic continued to progress during the 2nd quarter gcp is products applied in other outdoor applications such as our fireproofing product line experienced less of a negative impact the possible momentum during the month of june continued through july we see a stronger 3rd quarter compared with the 2nd quarter while we are mindful of local hotspots that may impact our customers due to the covid nineteen virus our strategic goal for sbm is for sustainable organic growth particularly in our north american building envelope and residential product lines and by increasing our presence in underserved segments and market geographies that are profitable and growing in the long term our plan also includes expanding our product portfolio awareness to adjacent market segments and accelerating the launch of new and accessory products for the premium and mid tier segments this program is starting to gain traction and is evident in our year over year june revenues in north america i am also pleased to report the launch of two new products for weather barriers and surface coatings that we believe will gain traction in the coming quarters there were several other accomplishments from the 2nd quarter that i would like to highlight gcp is gross margin improved 130 basis points in the 2nd quarter to 39 one fcc is gross margin improved for the 6th consecutive quarter this is a result of our continued focus on our manufacturing and freight productivity initiatives that we started in 201 we also saw the benefit of raw material deflation throughout the quarter 2nd quarter selling general administrative costs decreased by approximately eight mainly due to lower employee and related costs during the quarter as a result of our restructuring programs and lower discretionary spending cost containment actions including reduced travel were put in place during the quarter in response to the crisis gcp is cash position remains very strong with $318200000 of cash on the balance sheet at the end of june net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended june twenty june of 2020 totaled $17600000 as we continue to execute our working capital improvement projects i am happy to report that we completed the sale of gcp is cambridge headquarters on july 31st 202 planning is underway to locate a fitting location for our headquarters the $125000000 transaction unlocks value for gcp shareholders and is consistent with the company is commitment to invigorating its focus on profitable growth value creation and appropriate capital allocation strategies in addition today we announced the approval by gcp gcp is board of directors of the $100000000 stock buyback program with the authorization in place management will work with the board to determine the best way to execute on this program i would now like to turn the call over to craig who will review the company is financial performance in more detail along with segment results and or comments on the 3rd quarter craig thank you randy and good morning everybody just a reminder all revenue and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis before we summarize our 2nd quarter let me 1st just say that we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and year to date considering the challenging operating environment during the 2nd quarter our teams remain focused on their objectives and continue to provide a high level of service and commitment to our customers albeit more challenging with the current environment 1st i will focus on the revenues for the quarter gcp sales of 200000000 were 23seventy lower than prior year due to the impact of government imposed restrictions on construction activities and manufacturing as a result of covid nineteen impacts due to covid nineteen varied by product line and geography during the quarter but generally remained within the 25 to 35 on favorable impact expected as we entered the 2nd quarter although the demand in april and may was down significantly our june revenues did rebound for gcp overall and specifically in north america as the economy opened up although north america revenues finished two up for june versus prior year and we see continued strength in north america in july europe asia and latin america also finished june much stronger than the 1st two months of the quarter however the rebound was not as generous and it was in north america due to a slower overall return to normal construction activities uk volume has been steadily improving but at a little slower rate than continental europe china volumes have come back since the country reopened and the rest of asia including australia continue to improve but are still impacted by covid nineteen government restrictions latin america volume steadily improved during the quarter however some countries remain under lockdown where lockdowns are not present we are seeing good construction activity and volumes globally with respect to price gcp was close to flat year over year at a zeroten price decline fcc captured price most notably in latin america where in country inflation due to currency devaluations occurred and we increased price appropriately sbms north america and asia regions experienced some price pressure and which was expected in the current deflationary period when oil prices are at historical low the teams acted quickly though to con continue to secure appropriate volumes and margins during the quarter on current and future project bids gcp is gross margin increased 130 basis points to 39 one primarily due to lower raw material labor and freight costs driven by operational productivity which were par partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reduced operating leverage during the period to lower sales and production volumes selling general and administration costs of 65700000 improved by 5700000 or approximately eight during the quarter benefiting from lower employee and related costs due to restructuring management of other discretionary costs including advertising and favorable impact of the covid nineteen restrictions on travel entertainment and other operational activities some 2nd quarter restructuring activities did move to the 2nd half of the year due to the limited access to offices and travel restrictions which made it difficult to execute in some countries due to covid nineteen we will continue to execute on our restructuring plans and are currently assessing our sgna position relative to overall sales volumes in the environment managing these costs is a high priority as we monitor our performance metrics and expected volumes over the next three to six months gcps lost from continuing operations attributed to gcp shareholders was 1300000 compared to income from the operations attributed to gcp shareholders of 3100000 per 2nd quarter 201 the change was primarily due to lower gross profit due to lower sales volumes partially offset by reduced restructuring and repositioning costs lower selling and general administration costs and slightly lower tax expense gcps adjusted ebit margin ended the quarter at sixeighty versus ninesixty in the prior year quarter primarily due to lower gross profit as a result of volume declines partially offset by lower selling general and administration costs adjusted ebitda margin was twelveeighty for the 2nd quarter or a 100 basis points lower than the same period 201 looking at the specific performance of our two segments you can refer to pages ten and one fcc sales were down twentyfifty to 119500000 north america is revenues declined tenseventy in the quarter as construction in most states was deemed essential and our customer network in north america continued to service their customers although at a slower pace versus prior year during the quarter however reorder rates in june were well ahead of prior year other regional sales declined in other regions 27 to thirty versus prior year during the quarter with the sales declines all mostly attributable to covid nineteen impacts in asia europe and latin america due to covid nineteen have been slightly more prolonged and deeper versus north america revenue in june versus the same period for 2019 in north america and europe both increased fiveseventy and onesixty respectively compared with june 201 price gains also occurred in latin america and in europe on a nominal basis with slightly offset volume declines during the quarter fcc is gross margin improved by 350 basis points during the 2nd quarter six consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement as randy mentioned raw material deflation operation and logistics productivity and favorable regional mix all contributed to margin expansion fcc segment income was 9900000 with an operating margin of eightfive which decreased ninety basis points compared with the prior year quarter primarily due to lower sales volume unfavorably impacted by operating leverage partially offset by higher gross margin sbm sales totaled 80500000 during the 2nd quarter a 28 decline versus the 2nd quarter of 2019 due to challenging construction markets as a result of covid nineteen sales volumes in april and may were below 2019 volumes due to reduced construction and manufacturing distributors in april and may did not restock at a normal pace due to the uncertainty of the impacts of covid nineteen on future product demand north america volumes did however rebound in june as reconstruction resumed in many north america locations with distributors reordering and larger projects restarting once customer covid nineteen safety procedures were instituted in line with government and state recommendations in june north america sbm sales were down onefifty versus prior year june however positive year over year reorder patterns were evident in july business in france germany italy and the uk for sbm also improved during june once overall restrictions were lifted sbm is gross margin declined 140 basis points to 39seventy compared to the 2nd quarter of 2019 due to the unfavorable impact of lower sales resulting in reduced operating leverage and increased inventory year over year partially offset by raw material deflation and productivity sbm segment operating income was 11000000 with operating margins at thirteeneight a 610 basis point decline versus prior year this was due mainly to lower sales volume unfavorably impacting operating leverage and lower gross profit partially offset by the benefits of reduced discretionary costs and employee related costs during the quarter now turning back specifically to gcp gcp is effective tax rate was 136forty for the quarter that included the reversal of the 1st quarter cares act tax benefit resulting from changes in our forecasted income for the year the company no longer expects to have a net operating loss carryback for 2020 of which it did expect in q one forecast gcp is net cash provided by operating activities was 17600000 for the six months ended june 30th 2020 versus a usage of cash of 13100000 for the six months ended june 31st 201 adjusted free cash flow totaled 18000000 for the 1st six months compared with a usage in total of 12300000 during the same period in 201 accounts receivable management improved 20800000 vendor payables delivered a $4100000 improvement and inventories generated a $1700000 improvement compared to the prior six months we continue to improve the transparency of our working capital initiatives throughout the regions and within our respective country operations and we are seeing the results of these efforts which will continue please refer to slides twelve and thirteen for our discussion on gcp is 1st half performance gcp is net sales for the 1st six months totaled 419400000 decreasing fourteen compared with the prior year mainly due to the 2nd quarter impact of covid nineteen on volumes gross margin for the six months increased 130 basis points to 38four the net loss attributable to gcp shareholders in the 1st six months totaled 200000 compared with net income attributable shareholders of 24000000 for the 1st half of june 201 the change resulted mainly from the reduced sales volume to covid nineteen in the 2nd quarter partially offset by reduced operating expenses adjusted ebit was 27800000 for the 1st six months for 25ten unfavorable for the same period in 2019 again mainly due to the impact of covid nineteen turning to our outlook for 2020 although it continues to be difficult to predict the duration and extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business over the next six months and beyond as events unfold the near term view is as follows as discussed june is positive volume trends have continued into july and we expect the 3rd quarter to be a significant improvement over the 2nd quarter planned and funded construction projects have resumed or are coming online with construction sites having implemented additional health and safety protocols along with social distancing these efforts are important for construction to remain active while hotspots may arise while we expect the demand to improve and slowly return to close to normal levels as the year progresses some projects have moved into 2021 which may dampen some demand in the latter half of the year and we are monitoring this closely as for the 3rd quarter of which we have the best view we expect the impact of covid nineteen pandemic to reduce overall demand for our products by approximately five versus prior year in constant currency we also expect raw material deflation to provide a modest offset to the forecasted volume declines however we will continue to deliver productivity to support our margins we remain focused on our operating expenses which we have continued to improve sequentially during the year and in addition to our restructuring programs which will continue we have identified additional cost savings opportunities and have learned a lot during the covid nineteen period on how to perform at a lower cost base while we service our customers very well we are implementing these learnings as we move through the year we remain on track to the planned capital expenditure reduction of 25000000 in 2020 or a reduction of 35 to 45 from our original planned capital spending and we expect our cash position will grow throughout the year based on the working capital programs we have initiated that reduce capex target versus original plan and of course the sale of our cambridge site the share repurchase program announced will be funded with our existing cash balance looking beyond the pandemic we are confident in long term fundamentals of gcp and the construction industry we are confident that our current plans will allow us to navigate the pandemic and we will be well positioned as the overall construction demand stabilizes somewhat during the 2nd half of the year while we focus on our overall cost position as a company i will turn it now back over to randy thank you thanks craig just a few closing remarks let me just say again that we have welcomed our new board members and their enthusiasm and interest in working with the gcp leadership team has been constructive the working relationships have been very engaging and we look forward to jointly continuing to create value for our gcp shareholders despite the challenges the covid nineteen virus presented in the 2nd quarter our teams around the globe continued to focus on our customers and we are happy to see june rebound as it did we will continue this focus going forward and our strong balance sheet which features significant liquidity and no near term debt maturities is competitive differentiator that provides substantial financial flexibility and positions as well to successfully manage through the ongoing economic challenges and uncertainty caused by the covid nineteen pandemic with the sale of the cambridge facility and the stock buyback program we are committed to maintaining a flexible liquidity base and along with the board we will continue to evaluate all alternatives for the effective and efficient use of cash i would like to wrap up my comments by thanking our employees personally and on behalf of my leadership team for all the hard work and efforts they continue to devote to gcp under extremely challenging conditions i really appreciate that thank you today for joining our call and we now look forward to taking your questions you will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star then one on your touch tone phone if you are using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw from the question queue please press star then two the 1st question is from mike harrison of seaport global security please go ahead all right good morning morning mike morning mike and congratulations to craig on the the permanent role as cfo thank you mike i wanted to ask if you can talk a it sounds like you are pretty confident in the direction of things and the trends that you are seeing in north america i was wondering if you can maybe give a little bit more color on what you are seeing in other regions you know maybe in specific areas where you feel like they are you feel like they are making better progress toward normal construction activity for some areas where you you have more concern or or more uncertainty on on the pace of that progress toward normal no it is a good question mike and you know just like we see here in north america and we hear about every day on the news you know some states are reopening faster than others and are getting back to some some type of normalcy well the same can be said of around certain countries in europe as well as certain countries in the asia pacific region some have just been much slower due to restrictions and and also due to some hotspots that have resurfaced and getting back to to normal activity so we are going to follow that through the next quarter to see what happens we do believe that the construction activity in that those two regions europe and and the apac region will indeed start coming back in the 3rd quarter we just do not know the pace by which that is going to happen again due mostly to these restrictions all right and then in in terms of the restructuring you mentioned some additional cost areas that that you have have learned to operate on a lower cost space i guess i am just trying to apply your your guidance of a a five impact of covid on the top line trying to think about how that looks on the bottom line as you maybe hang on to some of these additional cost actions that you have delivered and continue to see improvement in in in the raw material environment no it is another good question mike we have obviously gone through an experiment here over the past you know four months or so on a global basis to see how can we run our company differently given the fact that we have to work differently in this pandemic and there is a lot of lessons that that have come out of that in terms of you know working at home strategies how we service our customers differently how we do virtual go lives and virtual test trials you know with our customers so a lot of those learnings we are going to take going forward as most companies are and we do believe that is going to lead to lower cost of how we run our operations we have also learned a lot in our plants in terms of inventory management again driven by this crisis in terms of different techniques and different processes that we have built in to be able to to better manage our inventory and better manage how we service the customers globally so a lot of lessons that we have learned and and the goal would be going forward that these lessons are going to find their way to the bottom line anything you want to add craig yeah mike it is a good question we have done a lot of just priority is our our employee safety of course during this whole process and you know we are we are doing a lot of virtual training with our customers we are doing mixed design training with our customers virtually we are starting to learn that sometimes and our customer is behavior is starting to come around a little bit that that is acceptable we also implemented a gc plus program of ordering online that randy and and the customer service group and the it group implemented about six months ago we are seeing traction on that now just orders coming through online versus a sales representative or someone having to take these orders which obviously is costly when it has to be handed off to eight different people to take orders you know more back in the 1960s industrial kind of process so we are seeing a lot of progress on kind of the new way of of how you do business and we are we are getting advantage of that in the in the cost base and we are not going to go back and invest the money back in there now that we see the advantage so we expect savings to continue in q three and four relative to those and we are having good discussions with the whole team about how we continue that into 2021 even if things come back to normal and and covid nineteen kind of relaxes a little bit so that that is that is really quite a bit of money there if if we can keep the momentum going i can not say exactly how much it will be in 2021 but we will probably have a better idea as we go through q three and and an additional point to make mike that you know i would like to add we are in the enviable position that we are going to be looking for new headquarters going forward as we have mentioned and having this learning of this new environment that we have been working in should play into our decision so it is it is definitely you know the world has changed and we need to take that into consideration looking forward all right and then in in terms of you mentioned some larger projects that looked like they were getting pushed into 202 are you pretty confident at this point that these are delays and not cancellations maybe just talk about kind of what you are seeing in terms of the backlog on on some of those larger projects yeah so another good question i i mean i wish i could answer you you know 100 that they are delays not cancellations but for right now they are delayed there is certainly some projects that would have got started already in q two they are not started there is some probably concern on funding and social distancing as you know these big projects when they start them the timeline is very important to them so i i just think for now as long as the economy stays about where it is at and there is not incremental hotspots that people need to be concerned about i think they are pushed out i do not think they are canceled there is funding for the projects there is still a lot of money around that is not the issue people just are a little bit more apprehensive to to start a project especially a big one right now with the social distancing you know specific hotspots even on the supply chain side we have actually given our customers a little more confidence in our supply chain our inventory is slightly higher than when they want to be we want them to be but we have actually had some backup inventory just in case one of our plants goes down and i think once other companies start to do this folks will have more comfort to spend the money on these big projects so they can get full supply chain support from their customers all right and then last question for me is is this maybe on the decision to authorize the $100000000 of share repurchase can can you talk about your capital allocation priorities going forward and maybe any guidance on on the timing of this repurchase activity thanks yeah no mike we obviously have always had a pretty comprehensive view of capital allocation and returning our monies to shareholders now with the new board in place and we are excited again to have their input and their guidance into specifically the strategy operating at risk committee we will be working with management and going through the the various options we have what makes the best sense for the shareholders and it is going to create the most value for shareholders obviously this was the 1st decision that was made regarding capital allocation the $100000000 authorization for the buyback but the overall board once in the strategy operating committee once they get up and and and functioning fully this will be a discussion point going forward mike yeah thanks very much yeah yeah i will just add mike maybe out to one of your other questions i mean these big projects are in the infrastructure category they are not in commercial or retail projects that that type of thing so you know we are we are more confident they are pushed out than than canceled just just the category they are in is is more comforting for us the next question is from rosemary research please go ahead thank you good morning everyone good morning rosemary good morning rosemary you talked about the board the board is input on your strategy going forward so between the new board and what you have learned during the covid well we are still in it but during covid could you touch on what changes you are thinking about in you know for your strategy going forward is there anything very different from what you were planning doing ahead of those two events no what i would say rosemary we have been working very closely with the new board we have had several meetings over the last couple of months and we are still in the phase of of sharing our current strategies and and getting their input on areas that we could focus on differently and areas that ideas that they have that we can investigate so it is still in that phase of getting to know each other and putting forth the best strategy for gcp going forward i am really excited with what i have heard again mentioning this the strategy operating risk committee a lot of experience a lot of ideas and we are going to continue to work with them closely in the coming months and we are to come on that but but we are excited to have this different perspective on on how the company could be doing things differently and in terms of what you learned during covid so you have learned that you can operate at a lower cost a certain amount of discretionary costs can you quantify how much of those you think you will generate in 2020 and while you may not have a hard number for 2021 how much is coming back with volume yeah so rosemary in in q two maybe this will give you some guidance and i know some others might want it in q two of about the six or i guess about $6000000 of operating savings we had you know mostly sgna it is about a 3rd a 3rd a 3rd it is about 3rd restructuring about 3rd actual implemented cost savings and about a 3rd due to kind of lower activity due to covid nineteen so our our challenge to ourselves is you know can we keep that 3rd you know savings due to the covid nineteen lower activity so that is a couple $1000000 a quarter so we are challenging ourselves to determine how we continue to get our volumes our prior year volumes and still still execute on that so that that will get that is about all the guidance i can give right now but we are still working through that and and to determine whether we can keep that through the year or not and in terms of restructuring rosemary we we are focused on continuing the initiatives that we set forth you know supply chain initiatives and obviously looking at asset management better but with the input with the new board we are excited that there will be some new ideas to come into that so restructuring is not going to stop restructuring will continue and that will be be an input into our savings going forward all right thanks and i was wondering if you could give us a feel as to how verifi during the this downturn i assume that if a cement truck does not go out then there is no use of verifi but you are also doing some virtual trials can you give us a feel for the momentum in that particular area yeah we we were actually pleasantly surprised on the revenues with verifi during the quarter they were up fifty year over year in q two that is mainly due to the fact that we had more more equipment out there in q two this year than we did last year because of the installs in the latter half of 201 the interesting part about that business is that they they tend to use the trucks on any job that have verifi so our our trucks go out 1st with the verifi units on them because they need to keep their operations kind of solidified because that is the new operating model they are on so we did not really see a lot of decline of usage of the verifi units during the quarter and certainly not as much as maybe we saw the market and in north america the market was pretty strong and that is where we have got most of our units so that is why we had the fifty pop in revenue we have seen slightly slow down on installs of new customers only because it is difficult for them with social distancing and you know managing the behavior of their their organization you know at this time during covid nineteen they do have to change the behavior of the organization to get the value so we have seen a little bit of slow down but we did see you know in australia new zealand and asia some new contracts signed during q two and even into q three here so we are pretty pleased at the progress but certainly it will be slightly slower on the installs in the 2nd half here but ra randy do have any other comments no i just wanted to say that as well i mean it is unfortunate with our customers that we had hoped to have installs that they are just distracted with the virus and it is difficult to install units when you need their help then you have the social distancing restriction so that is kind of slowed down to craig is point sure that makes sense i was wondering lastly if you could give us the level of importance for your business between residential construction commercial construction and infrastructure spending so we can and if you can talk of the about the trends in each of those categories what are you seeing yeah so north america is where we got the best visibility on the market data but obviously globally there is ihs and others that come up with the data were tend to be if you want to think about it about a 3rd a 3rd a 3rd i mean about a 3rd of our revenues tied to infrastructure a 3rd to commercial and about a 3rd to residential and people could be sur surprised on the residential piece but the north america concrete and cement you know basically goes into residential also and that is a big part of our business we are pretty confident that infrastructure governments you know you know may up the spend on infrastructure going forward just to to pump the economy so we are pretty pretty confident that that is going to happen globally and they are going to there might be some delays here just on getting things going but we think we are we are good at good there on the residential the market seems strong i i think you have seen the statistics too both in north america and around the world china asia residential still keeps going strong so i think we are in good shape there commercial could be slightly slower just you know you have seen the retail news you know there is obviously some reconsideration on office space on what you really need for office space moving forward so i would say commercial is probably the place where we might see a little bit more slower uptake but i think the infrastructure and the residential will offset that and in fact we get very good margin on the infrastructure so we will probably get a margin mix that will offset any decline on the commercial side if there is one moving forward all right thank you very much again if you have a question please press star then one there are no additional questions at this time this concludes our question and answer session i will turn it back to back to betsy cowell for closing remarks thank you kay we appreciate your help today and

for the 1st time since march in many of our markets our experiences in line with industry trends and our customers continued to depend on us during the quarter to support their needs july revenues have continued in line with june and our position in our markets is strong let us begin by talking about our sfc business sfc revenues which rebounded in june were about flat with june 2019 after experiencing a decline in the previous quarter thank you in north america our largest region fsc had six growth in the month of june versus prior year june several large north american projects started during the quarter which will continue into 2021 european volumes rebounded in june exceeding june 2019 volumes by two as the region reopened after being locked down in april and may fsc in

was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was as a result of reduction in demand due to lockdowns in most of the countries which continued through to june in the asia region china began to recover during the quarter although southeast asia and australia remained in lockdown during june our verified business continues to grow although at a slower pace versus pre covid nineteen due to the downturn in the global construction industry now turning to smb we saw a slowdown in project activity and distributor demand during april and may with volume during this two month period particularly in markets experienced construction restrictions or shelter in place orders sales volume improved in june with north america which is our largest region ending the month onefive behind june of 2019 we continue to win and progress on large project activity including airports bridges and office building projects and we secured a number of infrastructure projects in north america which will support us in the 2nd quarter additionally some projects that began pre pandemic continue to progress during the 2nd quarter gcc is products applied in other outdoor applications such as our fireproofing product line experienced less of a negative impact the positive momentum during the month of june continued through july and we see a stronger 3rd quarter compared with the 2nd quarter while we are mindful of local hotspots that may impact our customers due to the covid nineteen virus our strategic plan remains focused on maintaining our financial strength while continuing to invest in our growth initiatives our primary mission is for sustainable organic growth particularly in our north american building envelope and residential product lines and by increasing our presence in underserved segments and market geographies that are profitable and growing in the long term our plan also includes expanding our product portfolio awareness to adjacent market segments in accelerating the launch of new and accessory products for the premium and mid tier segments this program is starting to yield results i am also pleased to report the launch of two new products for weather barriers and surface coatings that we believe will gain traction in the coming quarters there were several other accomplishments from the 2nd quarter that i would like to highlight gcc is gross margin improved 130 basis points in the 2nd quarter to 39 one scc is gross margin improved for the 6th consecutive quarter this is the result of our continued focus on our manufacturing and freight productivity initiatives that we started in 2019 we also saw the benefit of raw material deflation throughout the quarter 2nd quarter selling general and administrative costs decreased by approximately eight mainly due to lower employee and related costs during the quarter as a result of our restructuring programs and lower discretionary spending cost containment actions including the closure of certain facilities also contributed to the decrease in costs reduced travel were put in place during the quarter in response to the crisis gcc is cash cash position remains very strong with $318200000 of cash on the balance sheet at the end of june net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended june twenty june 2020 totalled $17600000 as we continue to execute on our working capital improvement projects i am happy to report that we completed these projects on july 31 2020 gccp is cambridge headquarters on july 31 2020 planning is underway to locate a fitting location for our headquarters the $125000000 transaction unlocks value for gccp shareholders and is consistent with the company is commitment to invigorating and its focus on profitable growth value creation and appropriate capital allocation strategies in addition today we announce the approval by gccp is board of directors with the authorization in place management will work with the board to determine the best way to execute on this program i would now like to turn the call over to craig who will review the company is financial performance in more detail along with segment results and our comments on the 3rd quarter craig thank you randy and good morning everybody just a reminder all revenue and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis before we summarize we will take a moment to review the key takeaways from our discussion let me 1st just say that we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and year to date considering the challenging operating environment during the 2nd quarter our teams remain focused on their objectives and continue to provide a high level of service and commitment to our customers albeit more challenging with the current environment 1st i will focus on the revenues for the quarter gccp sales of 200000000 were 23seven lower than prior year due to the impact of the pandemic construction activities and manufacturing as a result of covid nineteen had impacts due to covid nineteen varied by product line and geography during the quarter but generally remained within the 25 to 35 unfavorable impact expected as we entered the 2nd quarter although the demand in april and may was down significantly our june revenues did rebound for gccp overall and specifically in north america as the economy opened up although and north america revenues finished two up for june versus prior year and we see continued strength in north america in july europe asia and latin america also finished june much stronger than the 1st two months of the quarter however the rebound was not as generous and it was in north america due to a slower overall return to normal construction activities uk volume has been china volumes have come back since the country reopened and the rest of asia including australia continue to improve but are still impacted by covid nineteen government restrictions latin america volumes steadily improved during the quarter however some countries remain under lockdown where lockdowns are not present we are seeing good construction activity and volumes globally with respect to price it remains relatively stable gcp was close to flat year over year at a zero one price decline scc captured price most notably in latin america where in country inflation due to currency devaluations occurred and we increased price appropriately sbms north america and asia regions experienced some price pressure and which was expected in the current deflationary period when oil prices are at historical lows teams acted quickly though to continue to secure appropriate volumes and margins during the quarter on current and future project bids gcp s gross margin increased 130 basis points to 39 one primarily due to lower raw material labor and freight costs driven by operational productivity which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reduced but operating leverage during the period to lower sales and production volumes selling general and administration costs of 65700000 improved by 5700000 or approximately eight during the quarter benefiting from lower employee and related costs due to restructuring management of other discretionary costs including advertising and favorable impact of the covid nineteen restrictions on travel entertainment and other operational activities some 2nd quarter restructuring activities did due to limited access to offices and travel restrictions which made it difficult to execute in some countries due to covid nineteen we will continue to execute on our restructuring plans and are currently assessing our sgna position relative to overall sales volumes in the environment managing these costs is a high priority as we monitor our performance metrics and expected volumes over the next three to six months gccp is loss from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2020 was $11800000 the change was primarily due to lower gross profit due to lower sales volumes partially offset by reduced restructuring and repositioning costs lower selling and general administration costs and slightly lower tax expense gccp is adjusted net income for the 2nd quarter of 2019 was 1300000 compared to income from continuing operations of 3000000 for the same period in 2018 the change was primarily due to lower gross profit due to lower sales volumes partially offset by reduced restructuring and repositioning costs lower selling and general administration costs and slightly lower tax expense gccp is adjusted net income for the 2nd quarter of 2019 was 1300000 compared to income from continuing operations of 3000000 for the same period in 2018 ended the quarter at sixeight versus ninesix in the prior year quarter primarily due to lower gross profit as a result of volume declines partially offset by lower selling general and administration costs adjusted ebitda margin was twelveeight for the 2nd quarter or a 100 basis points lower than the same period 2019 looking at the specific performance of our two segments you can refer to pages ten and eleven gcc sales were down twentyfive to 119500000 north america s revenues declined tenseven in the quarter as construction in most states was deemed essential and our customer network in north america continued to service their customers although at a slower pace versus prior year during the quarter however reorder rates in june were well ahead of prior year other regional sales declined in other regions 27 to thirty versus prior year during the quarter with the sales declines mostly attributed to covid nineteen impacts in asia europe and latin america due to covid nineteen have been slightly more prolonged and deeper versus north america revenue in june versus the same period for 2019 in north america and europe both increased fiveseven and onesix respectively compared with june 2000 and 1999 price gains also occurred in latin america and europe on a nominal basis with slightly offset volume declines during the quarter fcc is gross margin improved by 350 basis points during the 2nd quarter six consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement as randy mentioned raw material deflation operation and logistics productivity and favorable regional mix all contributed to margin improvement scc segment income was 9900000 with an operating margin of eightfive which decreased ninety basis points compared with the prior year quarter primarily due to lower sales volume unfavorably impacted by operating leverage partially offset by higher growth margin sbm sales totaled 80500000 during the 2nd quarter a 28 decline versus the 2nd quarter 2019 due to challenging construction markets as a result of covid nineteen sales volumes in april and may were below 2019 volumes due to reduced construction and manufacturing distributors in april and may did not restock at a normal pace due to the uncertainty of the impacts of covid nineteen on future product demand north america volumes did however rebound in june as construction resumed in many north america locations with this this is the distributor is reordering and larger projects restarting once customer covid nineteen safety procedures were instituted in line with government and state recommendations in june north america sbfm sales were down onefive versus prior year june however positive year over year reorder patterns were evident in july business in france germany italy and the uk for sbfm also improved during june overall restrictions were lifted sbfm is gross margin declined to 140 basis points to 39seven compared to the 2nd quarter of 2019 due to the unfavorable impact of lower sales resulting in reduced operating leverage and increased inventory write off year over year partially offset by raw material deflation and productivity sbfm is segment operating income was 11000000 with operating margins at thirteeneight a 610 basis point improvement from the 2nd quarter of 2019 this was due mainly to lower sales volume unfavorably impacting operating leverage and lower gross profit partially offset by the benefits of reduced discretionary costs and employee related costs during the quarter now turning back specifically to gccp gccp is effective tax rate was 136four for the quarter that included the reversal of the 1st quarter cares act tax benefit resulting from changes in our forecasted income the company no longer expects to have a net operating loss carryback for 2020 of which it did expect in q one forecast gccp is net cash provided by operating activities was 17600000 for the six months ended june 32020 versus a usage of cash of 13100000 for the six months ended june 31st 2019 adjusted free cash flow totalled 380000000 during the 1st six months compared with a usage in total of 12300000 during the same period in 2019 accounts receivable management improved 20800000 vendor payables delivered a $4100000 improvement and inventories generated a $1700000 improvement compared to the prior six months we continue to improve the transparency of our working capital initiatives throughout the regions and within our respective markets we are seeing the results of these efforts which will continue please refer to slides twelve and thirteen for our discussion on gccp is 1st half performance gccp is net sales for the 1st six months totalled 419400000 decreasing fourteen compared with the prior year mainly due to the 2nd quarter impact of covid nineteen on volumes gccp is gross margin for the six months increased 130 basis points to 38four the net loss attributed to gccp shareholders in the 1st six months totalled 200000 compared with net income attributed to gccp shareholders of 24000000 for the 1st half of june 2019 the change resulted mainly from the reduced sales volume to covid nineteen in the 2nd quarter partially offset by reduced operating expenses adjusted ebit was 27800000 for the 1st six months or 25000000 as favorable as one for the same period in 2019 again mainly due to the impact of covid nineteen turning to our outlook for 2020 although it continues to be difficult to predict the duration and extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business over the next six months and beyond as events unfold the near term view is as follows as discussed june is positive volume trends have continued into july we expect the 3rd quarter to be a significant improvement over the 2nd quarter planned and funded construction projects have resumed or are coming online with construction sites having implemented additional health and safety protocols along with social distancing these efforts are important for construction to remain active while hotspots may arise while we expect to demand to improve and slowly return to close to normal levels as the year progresses some projects have moved into 2021 which may dampen some demand in the latter half of the year and we are monitoring this closely as for the 3rd quarter of which we have the best view we expect the impact of covid nineteen pandemic to reduce overall demand for our products by approximately five versus prior year in constant currency we also expect raw material deflation to provide a modest offset to the forecasted volume declines however we will continue to deliver productivity to support our margins we remain focused on our operating expenses which we have continued to improve sequentially during the year and in addition to our restructuring programs which will continue we have identified additional cost savings opportunities and have learned a lot during the covid nineteen period on how to perform at a lower cost base while we service our customers very well we are implementing these learnings as we move through the year we remain on track to the planned capital expenditure reduction our original planned capital spending in 2020 was $25000000 and we expect our cash position will grow throughout the year based on the working capital programs we have initiated the reduced capex target versus original plan and of course the sale of our cambridge site the share repurchase program announced will be funded with our existing cash balance looking beyond the pandemic we are confident in long term fundamentals of gccp and the construction of our new plant we are confident that our current plans will allow us to navigate the pandemic and will be well positioned as the overall construction demand stabilizes somewhat during the 2nd half of the year while we focus on our overall cost position as a company i will turn it now back over to randy thanks thanks craig just a few closing remarks let me just say again that we have welcomed our new board members and their enthusiasm and interest in working with the gccp leadership team has been constructive our business relationships have been very engaging and we look forward to jointly continuing to create value for our gcc shareholders despite the challenges the covid nineteen virus presented in the 2nd quarter our teams around the globe continued to focus on our customers and we are happy to see june rebound as it did we will continue this focus going forward and our strong balance sheet which features significant liquidity and no near term debt maturities is a competitive differentiator that provides substantial financial flexibility and position thank you for the opportunity to speak today as we continue to navigate the ongoing economic challenges and uncertainty caused by the covid nineteen pandemic with the sale of the cambridge facility and the stock buyback program we are committed to maintaining a flexible liquidity base and along with the board we will continue to evaluate all alternatives for the effective and efficient use of cash i would like to wrap up my comments by thanking our employees personally and on behalf of my leadership team for all the hard work and efforts they continue to devote to gccp under these challenging circumstances thank you so much for joining our call and we now look forward to taking your questions you will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star one on your touch tone phone if you are using a speaker phone please pick up your handheld set before pressing the key to withdraw from the question queue please press star two the 1st question is from mike harrison of seaport global securities good morning hi good morning mike and congratulations to craig on the the permanent goal at cco wanted to ask if you can talk about it it sounds like you are pretty confident in the direction of things and the trend that you are seeing in north america i was wondering if you can maybe give a little bit more color on what you are seeing in other regions you know you know you know specific areas where you feel like they are you feel like they are making better progress toward normal construction activity or some areas where you you have more concern or or more uncertainty on on the pace of that progress toward normal so we are going to follow that through the next quarter to see what happens we do believe that the construction activity in those two regions europe and in the apca region will indeed start coming back in the 3rd quarter we just do not know the pace by which that is going to happen again due mostly to these restrictions and then in in terms of the restructuring you mentioned some additional cost areas that that you have have learned to operate on a lower cost base i guess i am just trying to apply your your guidance of  a five impact of covid on the top line trying to think about how that looks on the bottom line as you maybe hang on to some of these additional cost actions that you have delivered and continue to see improvement in in the raw material environment no it is another good question mike we have obviously gone through an experiment here over the past you know four months or so on a global basis to see how can we run our company differently given the fact that we have to work differently in this pandemic and there is a lot of lessons that have come out of that in terms of you know working from home strategies how we service our customers differently how we do virtual go lives and virtual test trials you know you know our customers so a lot of those learnings we are going to take going forward as most companies are and we do believe that is going to lead to lower cost of how we run our operations we have also learned a lot at our plants in terms of inventory management again driven by this crisis in terms of different techniques and different processes that we have built in to be able to to better manage our inventory and better manage how we service the customers globally so a lot of lessons that we have learned and and the goal would be going forward that these lessons are going to find their way to the bottom line anything want to add yeah  mike it is a good question we have done a lot of just priority is our our employee safety of course during this whole process and yeah we are doing a lot of virtual training with our customers we are doing mixed design training with our customers virtually we are starting to learn that sometimes and our customer is behavior is starting to come around a little bit that that is acceptable we also implemented a gc plus program ordering online that randy and and the customer service group and the it group implemented about six months ago we are seeing traction on that now just orders coming through online versus a sales representative or someone having to take these orders which obviously is costly when it has to be handed off to eight different people to take orders you know more back in the 1960 s industrial kind of process so we are seeing a lot of progress on kind of the new wave of how you do business and we are taking we are getting advantage of that in the in the cost base and we are not going to go back and invest the money back in there now that we see the advantage so we expect savings to continue in q three and four relative to those and we are having good discussions with the whole team about how we continue that into 2021 even if things come back to normal and and covid nineteen kind of relaxes a little bit so that is that is really  quite a bit of money there if we can keep the momentum going i can not say exactly how much it will be in 2021 but we will probably have a better idea as we go through q three and an additional point to make mike that i you know would like to add we are in the enviable position that we are going to be looking for new headquarters going forward as we have mentioned and having this learning of this new environment that we have been working in should play into our decision so it is definitely you know the world has changed and we need to take that into consideration looking forward all right and then in terms of you mentioned some larger projects that looked like they were getting pushed into 2021 are you pretty confident at this point that these are delays and not cancellations maybe just talk about kind of what you are seeing in terms of the backlog on some of those larger projects yeah so another good question i mean i wish i could answer you you know a 100 that their delays are not canceled but for right now there are delays there is certainly some projects that would have gotten started already in q two they are not started there is some probably concern on funding and social distancing as you know these big projects when they start them the timeline is very important to them so i just think for now as long as the economy stays about where it is at and there is not incremental hotspots that people need to be concerned about i think they are pushed out they are canceled there is funding for the project there is still a lot of money around that is not the issue people just are a little bit more apprehensive to to start a project especially a big one right now with the social distancing you know specific hotspots even on the supply chain side we have actually given our customers a little more confidence in our supply chain our inventories are slightly higher than when they want to be we want them to be but we have actually had some backup inventory just in case one of our plants goes down and i think once other companies start to do this folks will have more comfort to spend the money on these big projects so they can get full supply chain support from their customers all right and then the last question for me is is this maybe on the decision to authorize the $100000000 of share repurchase can can you talk about your capital allocation priorities going forward and maybe any guidance on on the timing of this repurchase activity thanks yeah no like we obviously have always had a pretty comprehensive view of capital allocation and returning our monies to shareholders now with the new board in place and we are excited again to have their input and their guidance and specifically the strategy operating at risk committee will be working with management and going through the the various options we have we have what makes the best sense for the shareholders and it is going to create the most value for shareholders obviously this was the 1st decision that was made regarding capital allocation the $100000000 authorization for the buyback but okay the overall board once in the strategy and operating committee once they get up and in functioning fully this will be a discussion point going forward mike yes i will just add mike maybe up to one of your other questions i mean these big projects are in the infrastructure category they are not in commercial or retail so you know we are more confident that they are pushed out than than canceled just just the category they are in is is more comfortable for us so between the new board and what you have learned during the covid well we are still in it but during covid could you touch on what changes you are thinking about you know for your strategy going forward is there anything very different from what you were planning on doing ahead of those two events no what i would say rosemary we have been working very closely with the new board we have had several meetings over the last several months so it is still in that phase of getting to know each other and putting forth the best strategy for going forward i am really excited with what i have heard again mentioning this strategy operating in a risk committee lot of experience and lot of ideas and we are going to continue to work with them closely in the coming months and we are to come on that but but we are i am excited to have this different perspective on on how the company could be doing things differently and in terms of what you learn during covid so you have learned that you can operate at a lower cost but there is a certain amount of discretionary costs can you quantify how much of those you think you will generate in 2020 and while you may not have a hard number for 2021 how much is it back yeah with volume yeah so rosemary in in q two maybe this will give you some guidance and i know some others might want it in q two of about the six or i guess about $6000000 of operating savings we had you know mostly sgna it is about a 3rd a 3rd a 3rd it is about 3rd restructuring about 3rd actual implemented cost savings and about a 3rd due to kind of so our challenge to ourselves is you know can we keep that 3rd you know savings due to the covid nineteen lower activity so that is a couple $1000000 a quarter so we are challenging ourselves to determine how we continue to get our volumes at prior year volumes and still  still execute on that so that will get that is about all the guidance i can give right now but we are still working through that and and to determine whether we can keep that 3rd you know savings due to the covid nineteen lower activity we are focused on continuing the initiatives that we set forth you know supply chain initiatives and obviously looking at asset management better but with the input with the new board we are excited that there will be some new ideas to come into that so restructuring is not going to stop restructuring will continue and that will be an input into our savings going forward  verify operated during the this downturn i assume that if a cement truck does not go out then there is no use of verify but you are also doing some virtual trials can you give us a feel for the momentum in that particular area q two that is mainly due to the fact we had more more equipment out there in q two this year than we did last year cause they installed in the latter half of 2019 the interesting part about that business is that they they tend to use the trucks on any job that has verify so our our trucks go out 1st with the verify units on them because they need to keep their operations kind of solidified cause that is the new operating model they are on so we we did not we have seen a lot of decline of usage of the verify units during the quarter and certainly not as much as maybe we saw the market and in north america the market was pretty strong and that is where we have got most of our units so that is why we had the fifty pop in revenue we have seen slightly slowed down on installs of new customers only because it is difficult for them in social distancing and you know managing the behavior of their organization you know at this time during covid nineteen they do have to change the behavior of their organization to get the value so we have seen a little bit of slowdown but we did see you know in australia new zealand and asia some new contracts signed during q two and even into q three here so we are pretty pleased at the progress but certainly it will be slightly slower on the installs in the 2nd half here but brandy randy do you have any other comments no i just wanted to say that as well i mean it is and with our customers that we had hoped to have installs that they re just distracted with the virus and it s difficult to install units when you need their help and you have the social distancing restrictions so that s kind of slowed down to craig s point sure and that makes sense i was wondering lastly if you could give us   the level of importance for your business between residential construction commercial construction and infrastructure spending so we can and if you can talk of the about the twins in each of those categories what are you seeing yeah so north america is where we get the best visibility on market data but obviously globally there is is is and others that come out with the data tend to be if you want to think about it about a 3rd a 3rd a 3rd i mean about a 3rd of our revenue is tied to infrastructure a 3rd to commercial and about a 3rd to residential and people could be sort of surprised on the residential but the north america concrete and cement you know basically goes into residential also and that is a big part of our business we are pretty confident that infrastructure governments you know you know may up the spend on infrastructure going forward just to to pump the economy so we are pretty pretty confident that that is going to happen globally and there is going to there might be some delays here just on getting things going but we think we are we are good at good there on the residential the market seems strong i think you ve seen the statistics too both in north america and around the world  china asia residential still keeps going strong so i think we re in good shape there commercial could be slightly slower just you know you ve seen the retail news you know there s obviously some reconsideration on office space on what you really need for office space moving forward so i would say commercial is probably the place where we might see a little bit more slower uptake but i think the infrastructure and the residential will offset that and in fact we get very good margin on the infrastructure so we will probably get a margin mix that will offset any decline on the commercial side if there is one moving forward additional questions at this time this concludes our question and answer session thank you katy we appreciate your help today and thank you all for attending the conference has now concluded thank you for attending today is presentation you may now disconnect",

turn the call over the robert well thank you scott and good morning everyone and appreciate everyone is attendance for your call today thanks for making time to join us for our 2nd quarter conference call in the midst of the current pandemic we continue to take appropriate caution and maintain focus on keeping our personnel safe while continuing to efficiently manage our operations achieving our strong 2nd quarter results in the face of this unprecedented oil price collapse and difficult operating environment is evidence of the resiliency of our business plan and the solid commitment of our people throughout these trying times we have worked to quickly adjust to the rapidly changing conditions and align our costs with our business activity as well as preserve our strengths as we have discussed last quarter and in updates along the way stating we would be free cashflow positive from the 2nd quarter on for 2020 we had significant free cashflow of $35000000 in this quarter this was driven by several factors including limited capital expenditures in the quarter as we completed our drilling and completion program for the year strong hedge positions that delivered over $29000000 of realization and significantly lower operating costs partially as a result of our may shut in and curtailment program but also sustainable reductions including the impact of our shut in program our average daily sales volume in the 2nd quarter was 13555 barrels of oil equivalent or boe per day even with reduced volumes and a 44 drop in average realized price per boe in the 2nd quarter our cost management efforts combined with the strong hedge position allowed us to generate higher quarter over quarter adjusted net income and adjusted ebitax i suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that we expect to generate substantial free cashflow throughout the balance of the year which should result in a decreasing debt balance and help us achieve our target of being below one times debt to ebitax for the year as we previously discussed in response to the sharp decline in oil prices in april and very low forecasted may oil prices we made the decision in late april to shut in a large majority of our operated production for the month of may which resulted in approximately sixty of our total net production being shut in during may with a forecast of significantly improved june oil prices which ultimately were more than double our april and may oil price realizations we returned to full production in june we had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions which saw us reduce total leas operating expense or loe in the 2nd quarter by forty from the prior quarter despite reduced production volumes due to our shut in program in may our team is continued focus on cost reduction resulted in a thirty decrease in loe per boe in the 2nd quarter to $four53 versus $six51 in the 1st quarter this was the major driver of the overall 33 reduction in all in cash cost during the quarter on a per unit basis our all in cash cost went from near $thirteen per boe in the 1st quarter to near $ten per boe in the 2nd quarter for a total of 22 22 reduction this is all in cash cost folks which includes operating costs corporate g a costs and all of our interest costs on our debt to dive a little deeper into how we achieved the forty decrease in loe let met outline some of the key factors 1st as much of our peers have done we were successful in negotiating price reductions with vendors across the broad range of our lease operating expenses from chemicals to maintenance rigs saltwater disposal contracts and compression costs 2nd we are benefiting from our longterm practice of spending a little more money as we go repairing wells facilities and associated equipment to reduce frequency of maintenance which is resulting in a continued decrease in non routine loe repair needs 3rd workover repairs have trended down resulting from our optimization of lift methods chemical program improvements and general approach of fixing things right the 1st time the limited offset frack activity also reduced frack hit related workover expenses 4th we have been successful in getting the utility companies to perform electrical upgrades sooner than scheduled which has allowed us to eliminate gener generator usage on some of our newer locations lastly with limited drilling and completion activity we have also been able to refocus our field employees towards lease maintenance which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor all of these items and many other subtleties of operating were in progress as our team has a history of continually driving down costs we will remain focused on continuing to reduce costs across the board as we expect the oil price environment that we have observed since late 2014 including increased volatility to persist which only stresses the need to structure our business to be profitable across a much lower oil price range i would really like to commend our operations team which did a fantastic job of both shutting in production in may and bringing production back fully online in june while also achieving these cost reductions for the 1st time in my career and our team is history we had to tell our guys to produce as little as possible every single day we executed this shut in operation and our field personnel did a great job of efficiently returning wells to production with little to no incremental expense and no adverse effects on our producers our wells have returned to their previous volumes with some wells producing at increased rates for a period of time plus the three wells in southeast reagan county that were brought online in april prior to the curtailment and were shut in during may are now back online and have fully cleaned up and are perferm performing well versus the tide curve i mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in late may and released our contracted rig operating in the mid midland basin so our planned capital expenditures are minimal for the balance of the year given that our program ended with eleven wells drilled but not completed and with our ample liquidity we have optionality on completion timing depending on market conditions with production returned to full capacity we have entered the 2nd half of this year with expectations for no further drilling or completion activities this year we can maintain approximately flat year over year production in 2020 compared to 2019 as a reminder we recently updated our 2020 full year production guidance ranging from 13000 to 14000 boe per day which compares to 2019 is full year average of 13429 boe per day further with our eleven drilled but uncompleted wells in upton county we intend to carefully monitor commodity pricing appropriate service availability and service cost conditions to determine if it makes sense to bring in a completion crew later this year or wait until early next year depending on the timing we anticipate the completion of those eleven wells would enable us to maintain similar year over year production for 2021 with only a modest capital program for the completion which we currently estimate at around $30000000 with that overview i will now turn the call over to mark to review the financials have at it mark thank you robert as we have in the past two consecutive quarters i would like to 1st discuss our cash position and our balance sheet as robert mentioned we are pleased to have achieved our goal of generating substantial free cashflow in the quarter with a total of 35100000 of free cashflow as we referenced in our 1st quarter call our plan was 1st to reduce our working capital deficit which we calculate excluding derivatives and we are able to do this by well over $50000000 during the 2nd quarter and then to begin to pay down our revolver debt the under our senior secure revolving facility which was set in late march remains unchanged at $275000000 and should remain there until our regularly scheduled fall redetermination process our outstanding borrowings on the credit facility at quarter end totals 168600000 and we had 1800000 in cash with 106400000 of unused borrowing capacity that gave us approximately 108000000 of liquidity at quarter end i would note that as of july 31st we have paid down our revolver by $14300000 compared to quarter end reducing our debt balance now to about 153 154300000 and we do expect to apply free cashflow the remainder of the year primarily to pay down the revolver during the 2nd quarter our capital expenditures totaled $3200000 and year to date we have spent $45000000 of our annual 2020 capital budget of fifty to $60000000 as robert mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in may so we anticipate minimal expenditures during the remainder of the year and will likely end up towards the low end of our guidance range now looking at our 2nd quarter income statement starting with the top line revenues for the 2nd quarter of 2020 were $21700000 compared to $45100000 the 1st quarter the decline was driven by a 54 decrease in oil revenues to $18900000 which made up about 87 of total revenues and revenues fell by 44 while natural gas revenues rose slightly our average price in the 2nd quarter for all three commodities was $seventeen56 per barrel of oil equivalent which was down by nearly half of our average price during the 1st quarter by commodity our average realized price for crude oil in the 2nd quarter was $2356 per barrel natural gas a averaged ¢83 per mcf and ngls averaged $eightten ber barrel of oil equivalent from a production standpoint our 2nd quarter sales volumes averaged 13555 barrels of oil equivalent per day which was comprised of 65 oil eighteen natural gas and seventeen natural gas liquids as highlighted this does include having curtailed about sixty of total production in may on the expense side as robert also highlighted we did drive down our all in ca costs from twelve92 per boe in the 1st quarter to $teneleven per boe in the 2nd quarter we achieved this through nearly $two per boe reduction in our lease operating expense to $four52 per boe for the quarter on the general administrative side we reduced our absolute cash g a g a expense by about seven versus the 1st quarter which resulted in per unit cash g a expense of $three34 per boe as you know we reduced our cash g a guidance in may to fifteenfive to $16500000 for the full year and expect to be somewhere in that range which at the bottom end is a 25 reduction versus our initial full year plan in addition to some of the savings we articulated last quarter we continue to focus on and have had success in reducing expenses really any and everywhere including reduced usage of 3rd par 3rd party consultants reducing vendor rates and managing our costs tightly from an income standpoint we recor we reported gaap net loss in the 2nd quarter of $35900000 or ¢55 per share which included a pre tax unrealized loss of $50000000 on our derivative contracts our adjusted net income was $4800000 or ¢twenty per diluted share adjustable diluted share for the 2nd quarter we reported adjusted ebitax of 39800000 the 2nd quarter which as robert mentioned is actually an increase quarter over quarter now i would like to take a minute take a minute to update you on our commodity hedge results in the 2nd quarter as highlighted we realized $29400000 gain on our commodity hedges for the quarter this was largely reflective of our hedge position entering the quarter and our locking in some really nice gains on hedges when we made the decision to curtail production and did that when 2nd quarter nimax prices were about at their lowest point the hedge realizations also include a gain of about $5700000 from an unwind of 1000 barrels of oil a day for the 2nd half of 2020 we remain really well hedged for the balance to the year with an average of 6500 barrels per day of oil swapped at a nimex price of $5835 stepping down to 4000 barrels a day for full year 2021 at a nimex price of $55sixteen per barrel with basic hedges in place on similar volumes on the natural gas side we have 7000 nmbtu per day swapped at a henry hub price of $two85 for the 2nd half of this year stepping up to 8000 nmbtus per day at a price of $two71 for full year 2021 with basic hedges in place on the same volumes hedging remains a critical component of our financial strategy and we expect to continue layering on hedges as we get more visibility around the azump a resumption of our drilling and completion activity going forward stepping back and looking at our expectations for full year 2020 we reinstated our production guidance in july and we have reinstated loe in production and lower impact guidance with our earnings released yesterday our reinstated production lower impact guidance of six r of six25 to seven25 is identical to what it was at the onset of our 2020 guidance provided in january as is the case for our reinstated loe guidance of fivefifteen to $six per boe although we have had recent sustainable loe reductions and came in well below this range in the 2nd quarter without the advantage of bringing on new wells we have kept our guidance range where it was at the beginning of the year when we anticipated bringing sixteen new wells online with that i will turn back over the robert thank you mark we are really pleased with the results and confident in a bright future for earthstone while we are sorry to see our industry in such distress it is creating more m a opportunities than we have seen in quite some time we are actively evaluating a number of situations and expect to have more to consider throughout the rest of the year as prices remain low and stress situations continue to increase we believe that our strong balance sheet and track record as a successful consolidator positions us well to increase the scale of our company and add value to our shareholders with that operator we will now open the floor for questions thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key our 1st question comes from the line of brad heffern with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question hi morning everyone hope you are doing well i guess on the the 2021 color that you gave about being able to keep production flat with the eleven ducts is that more just meant to be instructive or is that actually how you are thinking about the 2021 plan as we said here today yes a little bit of both brad you know it does depend on where commodity prices head towards the end of the year whether we want to pick up a rig or not i think we have been pretty vocal or consistent about our message that you know we need we meed mid 45 to $fifty oil to want to go back to spending large capital dollars but outside of that at some point end of this year early next year completing those wells will allow us to main production flat year over year okay got it and then obviously you made the comment on m a can you go into a little more detail about sort of what opportunities you are seeing and a also any thoughts you have about an ability to fund them the opportunities are increasing and size is variable from small to quite large as you have seen you know distressed and bankrupt companies i think all of this will result in further opportunities in terms of larger companies selling assets it it is difficult with no public equity and for that matter debt markets open or open only to a very few maybe we are one of those few but we have had discussions with financial parties who are interested in participating with us on acquisitions and much like we have done in our fr history you know we will bring in parties at the right time to look at buying assets and we are going to maintain a very healthy leverage amount and keep ourselves from getting into distress no matter where we are in the cycle so i think we are just going to see more and more opportunities and and we will figure out how we can finance those and make sure we keep our balance sheet clean okay thanks for the comments thank you our next question comes from the line of neal dingmann with truist securities please proceed with your question morning all robert 1st question on the also on that same line on 21 expectations and i am just wondering you know while i realize this plan really i think you know at least the ones you have just initial laid out assumes no new wells really what is what i am just wondering what is driving this low cost or another way maybe to ask is how you think about maintenance capex you know given just so low because you know if i recall i thought frank already had you all cancel all those country club and other memberships i just know what else is there yes there is no country club memberships up here you know e e the the the eleven wells we have are in really good areas and they they will help us keep production relatively flat at $30000000 now is that sustainable absolutely not you know we still have a relatively high decline rate and it does depend on when we brought those wells online if we waited till the very end of 21 we are going to have a hard time keeping production relatively flat i if we brought them on today you know we might have the same problem because we would get all this flush production from these new wells so you know maintenance eh to maintain you know 13000 boe a day kinda level longer term we are going to have to have a rig running and a one rig program i do not know what it would exactly cost us today but generally speaking is 120000000 to maybe 140000000 depending on lateral length and working interest and things like that so you know this is just a very preliminary if the world stays the same and we are at forty ish low $forty environment and we are not spending any drilling capital these eleven ducts will help us keep production flat okay and then you kinda hit on my last one just on how do you think about sort of pdp decline you know on a on on on a now that you have been slowing a bit is that that too you know going to going to go down or in i guess to look at it another way is it you know are you able to give us kinda how many how many wells would offset that i mean any any any way you can kind of give us a collar on how you know kind of your thinking about that in 21 on broader terms yeah i think we have been consistent in telling everyone that our sort of base decline starting today we will call it you know is about thirty in the 1st year and then gets into the mid maybe 26 or 27 the next year and then low 20s or high teens after that and so you know i do not think that is changed any and if we did not spend any capital then you can kind of forecast what our blowdown production would look like even if we did not do those eleven wells but again with those eleven wells it will help keep 21 flat and then going forward in 22 and beyond it is all going to depend on price very good thanks guys thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff grampp with northland capital markets please proceed with your question hi guys i was wondering robert or or maybe mark how important to you guys are you staying free cashflow positive in the context of evaluating you know whether to go after the the ducts and and potentially drilling rig at some point in time would you view that as as kind of a you know a a must if you will or would you guys have any level of comfort with any you know near medium term outspend if it helps you know if the returns are good and if it helps kinda you know jumpstart a return to growth sure m maybe i will i will try to answer that one then robert can add on if he wants to y you know we keep things pretty simple at the end the day we feel like our responsibility is to make good individual decisions at the well head a and that is why we were quick to to put the rig down and stop completing in march and april is because the economics did not make a whole lot of sense then do the ducts make sense right now i mean economically you definitely could go complete the ducts right now and have pretty nice rrs for the incremental cost to complete them i i in terms of are we so focused on quarter to quarter year to year free ca free cashflow that we will not outspend no we are not and and from a practical matter and we are just going to be free cashflow positive this year and next year kind of irrespective of anything else that happens with the prices if all we are doing is completing the ducts a at some point you know we we do anticipate picking the rig back up and you know there is a bit of a a obviously a lag there between the cost you expend to drilling the complete wells versus the cashflow you know does that mean over the course of the year we are not free cashflow positive no not necessarily but we are not so fixated on checking that box every quarter we want to make smart economic decisions at the well head that will flow into the bigger picture and having some outspend for some period of time yeah we still think is supported by the economics at the same time y y you know we are not ones just to go keep drilling and completing because we have hedges in place or for other reasons we are just trying to to be as good a stewards as we can of of the individual decisions we are making at the well heads yeah the only i will add jeff is i think we can run a one rig program with the level of production and cashflow we have today and be cashflow neutral on an annualized basis obviously there is a jump starting the program we are going to be cashflow negative for a a period of time but i think longer term over a year timeframe a again depending on what the price is sure understood appreciate those comments my follow up i think i still have you know a a decent amount of of non op exposure in the permian are you guys seeing any activity levels there and more on the land side is there any traction or conversations on swapping any of that out to increase the operation exposure there still working on the trades but people have been hunkered down in the bunker i i you know for quite some time now since you know at least march and so nothing is moving very quickly there we have no we have not heard anything different from our partners in terms of activity in the near term being kind of the remainder of this year so we will have to see as we get closer to year end what their view might be for activity in 2021 all right thanks guys thank you our next question comes from the line of duncan mcintosh with johnson rice please proceed with your question morning robert zero morning i had a quick question on the balance sheet now you all doing a great job and the free cash outlook looks great paying it down wondering you know do you get in conversations with the bank as we head into the fall redetermination you know back in march you all were early in in getting it done in the spring but you know back in back then it looked like things would be pretty dire again in the fall and it is not as bad here and particularly with the line of sight they will have on the free cash kind of how any conversations with them to give you an any indication as to what the fall redetermination could could look like sh sure probably too early to you know anything around numbers but we do pretty rarely talk to banks and we we do that normal course irrespective of the environment y you know the the one thing i would say for us we are expecting to decrease in the barnett basin you know obviously we are not drilling and completing new wells roll off you know fortunately you know we we feel like we have got enough ability to pay down debt to outpace that decrease and and really you know we do not see any scenarios that we think are realistic that would be concerning in that regard now i will say like does the environment feel better now than it did three months ago a absolutely and and maybe some of that is the shock of seeing $37 on oil and you know seeing realizations for for the month of of april and may a at the end of the day it is still not a very good price environment for for for companies in general and the banks maybe they feel a little better because we are at $45 or $42 versus somewhere in the teens but they still have a lot of issues to deal through to to deal with a and obviously there there has been a a lot of e p companies that have gone bankrupt and there is certainly more that will so the banks still have their hands full and they are still working through all these situations yeah i i think there is a lot of trepidation on the bank is part in general and yeah i do not frankly see them letting up a whole bunch in the fall now now that being said that is a general statement you know we have got one time leverage and liquidity and generally are viewed as having done the right thing from a financial standpoint a and and our assets are are better than than than many we probably feel like we have got a pretty supportive bank group that is going to be reasonable and fair and and historically that has been the case but too early to to to circle a number thanks mark and then i guess just from a follow up you know robert you gave some some really good and you all did some pretty creative things to get loe down in the 2nd quarter i know you you talked about how it is going to come back up a little bit here in the back half of the year towards y you know a more historical range but you know any of those initiatives that you took that you think that you could can carry forward to kinda help mitigate that loe curve definitely dun there there is you know it is just a constant progression of a well is lifecycle to adjust artificial lift a lot of our wells are on gas lift so relatively expensive compressors over time that gets changed out to other lift methods in some cases rod pump in other cases plunger lift what have you so we are continuing to work through that and that will definitely help reduce loe and then some of the things that you know we we were fortunate in getting done in the quarter working with the utility company to get meters set and get ahead of the schedule there or got moved up in the schedule from some good relationships we we ended up getting generators off of our payroll and those are very very expensive so we did not have a whole lot but they still show up as a big expense so some of these things we did in the 2nd quarter are sustainable and we will continue doing the right things in the way we you know operate our business and continue to watch costs like a hawk all right thank you all very much and congrats on a strong quarter and a strong outlook thank you thanks dun thank you ladies and gentlemen as a reminder if you would like to join the question queue please press star one on your telephone keypad our next question comes from the line of noel parks with coker palmer please proceed with your question hey good morning hi noel i y you know i was thinking about having the the back inventory that you know where it works out that just completing those next year can can help you keep production flat that is you know that is not a really great flexibility you have there and and i mean was that just sort of a a result of the the timing of everything you know kind of falling off the rails with covid and opec russia or or was w was that sort of part of the plan as you were just trying to you know continue to pivot to to emphasis on free cashflow heading into next year i would love to tell you noel that we had this great plan that no matter happened in the world oil going to twenty or sub twenty that we could keep production flat for three years running with various amounts of capital if you go back and think about the beginning of the year and the call we had you know related to the 4th quarter earnings and full year we had a one rig program we were going to average for the entire year a tiny bit of free cashflow and those eleven wells would have been completed i do not know by know i can not remember but pretty darn close so i would say it is a fallout of what is happened here and just being very conservative with our capital expenditures an and cash and making sure that you know we come out of this down this near term down cycle we have been in a down cycle since 2014 but at least this recent piece of it that we you know we survive nicely through it and come out the other side and can continue to find ways to consolidate and grow great thanks and y you know just a a housekeeping question sorry if you touched on this earlier and i i missed it for the free cashflow calculation if i looked at the number right it looked this was one of those periods where there was a pretty big delta between i guess i would say cash capex and you know sort of capex incurred in the quarter and i was just wondering for the the free cashflow calculation going forward just kind of which which which one of those is is more important then for us to use as we you know just just try to model that we always use the crude cash from a calculation standpoint cause not all the bills necessarily have hit but we know what generally they are zero okay it is in the presentation on the last page or something like that okay so so real zero and one other thing i and i i just do not have the release in front of me and as far as change in working capital you th that is something all of you re routinely include well include the im impact of in the free cash calculation or or would you exclude that y yes s so we do not include that a and i recognize there is you know multiple different ways to to to look at that i i mean the way we have been approaching it is okay adjusted ebitax is the the best proxy for your really sort of cashflow for the period we back out interest expense and then we back out capital expenditures for activity during that period now when you are stopping or starting there is going to be a bigger delta between right calculating free cashflow the way we do versus if you are using a cash capex number you know the the 2nd quarter was very atypical from the standpoint of h here we are reporting 35000000 of of free cashflow yeah our debt balance went up and the the reason for that is because and of course this is tied to the cash capex it is just the time of the payments you know we reduced the the negative working ca the working capital deficit by about 50000000 during the quarter now we are to a point where that working deficit working capital deficit is pretty low and probably will not fluctuate a whole bunch one way or the other until we pick activity back up at which point you would expect you know if you start completions and drilling again you start getting billed but there is some lag between the activity and when you get the bills and when you pay them so very atypical quarter yeah a as we mentioned in the press release you know we had about 169000000 in debt at quarter end and the month of july we we paid down a little more than fourteen that is not the the run right by the way it is not fourteen quarter that was high because of timing but we do expect i mean really every month this year that we are paying down some debt without any big changes in the working capital status great thanks a lot for the details that is all for me thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i will turn the floor back to mister anderson for any final comments well we appreciate everybody joining us and you know we will continue to update as as we need to and we will see you next quarter thanks thank you this concludes today is conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation",

financial matters in performance and then some closing comments from robert i will now turn the call over to robert thank you scott and good morning everyone good morning everyone for our call today thanks for making time to join us for our 2nd quarter conference call in the midst of the current pandemic we continue to take appropriate caution and maintain focus on keeping our personnel safe while continuing to efficiently manage our operations achieving our strong 2nd quarter results in the face of this unprecedented oil price collapse and difficult operating environment is evidence of the resiliency of our business plan throughout these trying times we have worked to quickly adjust to the rapidly changing conditions and align our costs with our business activity as well as preserve our strengths as we have discussed last quarter and in updates along the way stating we would be free cash flow positive from the 2nd quarter on for 2020 we had significant free cash flow of $35000000 in this quarter this was driven by several factors limited capital expenditures in the quarter as we completed our drilling and completion program for the year strong hedge position that delivered over $29000000 of realizations and significantly lower operating costs partially as a result of our may shut in and containment program but also sustainable reductions including the impact of our shut in program our average daily sales volume in the 2nd quarter was 13555 barrels of oil equivalent even with reduced volumes and a 44 drop in average realized price per boe in the 2nd quarter our cost management efforts combined with the strong hedge position allowed us to generate higher quarter over quarter adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda i suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that we expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the balance of the year which should result in a decreasing debt balance and help us achieve our target of being below one time debt to equity for the year as we previously discussed in response to the sharp decline in oil prices in april and very low forecasted may oil prices we made the decision in late april to shut in the large majority of our operated production for the month of may which resulted in approximately sixty of our total net production being shut in during may we had a significantly improved june oil prices which ultimately were more than double our april and may oil price realizations we returned to full production in june we had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions which saw us reduce total lease operating expense or loe in the 2nd quarter by forty from the prior quarter despite reduced production volumes due to our shut in program in may our teams continued to focus on cost reductions this was the major driver of the overall 33 reduction in all in cash costs during the quarter on a per unit basis our all in cash costs went from near $thirteen per boe in the 1st quarter to near $ten per boe in the 2nd quarter this is all in cash costs folks which includes operating costs corporate g a costs and all of our interest costs on our debt to dive a little deeper into how we achieved the forty decrease in loe let me outline some of the key factors 1st as much of our peers have done we were successful in negotiating price reductions with vendors across the broad range of our lease operating expenses from chemicals to drilling services we were able to achieve significant cost savings to maintenance rig salt water disposal contracts and compression costs 2nd we are benefiting from our long term practice of spending a little more money as we go repairing wells facilities and associated equipment to reduce frequency of maintenance which is resulting in a continued decrease in non routine lube repair needs 3rd workover repairs have trended down resulting from our optimization of lift method 4th we have been successful in getting the utility companies to perform electrical upgrades sooner than scheduled which has allowed us to eliminate generator usage on some of our newer locations lastly with limited drilling and completion activity we have also been able to refocus we have made a significant change in our field employees towards lease maintenance which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor all of these items and many other subtleties of operating were in progress as our team has a history of continually driving down costs we will remain focused on continuing to reduce costs across the board as we expect the oil price environment that we have observed since late 2014 including increased volatility to persist which only stresses the need to structure our business to be able to be profitable in the face of these challenges i would like to commend our operations team which did a fantastic job of both shutting in production in may and bringing production back fully online in june while also achieving these cost reductions for the 1st time in my career and our team is history we had to tell our guys to produce as little as possible every single day we executed this shut in operations and our field personnel did a great job of efficiently returning well our wells have returned to their previous volumes with some wells producing at increased rates for a period of time plus the three wells in southeast reagan county that were brought online in april prior to the curtailments and were shut in during may are now back online and have fully cleaned up and are performing well versus the tight curve i mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program good morning i am john may the president of may drilling company we have released our contracted rig operating in the midland basin so our planned capital expenditures are minimal for the balance of the year given that our program ended with eleven wells drilled but not completed and with our ample liquidity we have optionality on completion timing depending on market conditions with production returning to full capacity we have entered the 2nd half of this year with expectations for no further drilling we can maintain approximately flat year over year production in 2020 compared to 2019 as a reminder we recently updated our 2020 full year production guidance ranging from 13000 to 14000 boe per day which compares to 2019 full year average of 13400 boe per day further with our eleven drilled but uncompleted wells in upton county we intend carefully monitor our commodity the appropriate service availability and service cost conditions to determine if it makes sense to bring in a completion crew later this year or wait until early next year depending on the timing we anticipate the completion of those eleven wells would enable us to maintain similar year over year production for 2021 with only a modest capital program for the completions which we currently estimate at around $30000000 with that overview i will now turn the call over to the operator as we have in the past two consecutive quarters i would like to 1st discuss our cash position and our balance sheet as robert mentioned we are pleased to have achieved our goal of generating substantial free cash flow in the quarter with a total of 35100000 of free cash flow as we referenced in our 1st quarter call our plan was 1st to reduce our working capital deficit which we calculate excluding derivatives and we are able to do this by a little over $50000000 during the 2nd quarter we are currently in the process of paying down our revolver debt the barn based under our senior secured revolving facility which was set in late march remains unchanged at $275000000 and should remain there and so our regularly scheduled fall redetermination process our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at quarter end hold 168600000 and we had 1800000 in cash with 106400000 of unused barn capacity that gave us approximately 108000000 i would note that as of july 31st we had paid down our revolver by $14300000 compared to quarter end reducing our debt balance now to about $153000000 and we do expect to apply free cash flow the remainder of the year primarily to pay down the revolver during the 2nd quarter our capital expenditures sank $3200000 and year to date we have spent $45000000 of our annual 22000000 capital budget as robert mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in may so we anticipate minimal expenditures during the remainder of the year and we will likely end up toward the low end of our guidance range now looking at our 2nd quarter income statement starting with the top line revenues for the 2nd quarter of 2020 were $28000000 compared to $46000000 in the 1st quarter the decline was driven by a 54 decrease in oil revenues to $27000000 which made up about 87 of our total revenues and ngl revenues fell by 44 while natural gas revenues rose slightly our average price in the 2nd quarter for all three commodities was $seventeen56 per barrel of oil equivalent which was down by nearly half of our average price during the 1st quarter by commodity our average realized price for crude oil in the 2nd quarter was $2356 per barrel natural gas at average ¢83 per mcf and ngl at average $eightten per barrel from a production standpoint our 2nd quarter sales volumes averaged 13555 barrels of oil equivalent per day which was comprised of 65 oil eighteen natural gas and seventeen natural gas liquids as highlighted this does include having curtailed about sixty of total production in may on the expense side as robert also highlighted we did drive down our all impact costs from 1292 per barrel in the 1st quarter we achieved this through nearly $two per boe reduction in our lease operating expense to $fourfifty per boe for the quarter on the general administrative side we reduced our absolute cash g a expense by about seven versus the 1st quarter which resulted in per unit cash g a expense of $three34 per boe as you know we reduced our cash g a guidance in may to fifteen55 we expect to receive somewhere in that range which at the bottom of the end is a 25 reduction versus our initial full year plan in addition to some of the savings we have articulated last quarter we continue to focus on and have had success in reducing expenses really anywhere including reduced usage of 3rd party consultants reducing vendor rates and managing our costs tightly from an income standpoint we reported a net loss of $35900000 in the 2nd quarter our adjusted net income was $12800000 or ¢twenty per diluted share adjusted diluted share for the 2nd quarter we reported adjusted ebitda of 39800000 in the 2nd quarter which as robert mentioned is actually an increase of a quarter of a quarter now let us take a minute to update you on our commodity hedging results in the 2nd quarter as highlighted we realized $29400000 gain on our commodity hedging activities in the 2nd quarter this is largely reflective of our hedge position entering the quarter and our locking in some really nice gains on hedges when we made the decision to curtail production and did that when 2nd quarter nx prices were about at the lowest point the hedge realizations also include a gain of about $5000000 from an unwind of 1000 barrels of oil a day for the 2nd half of 2020 on the henry hub side we have 7000 mmbtu per day of swaps at a henry hub price of $two85 for the 2nd half of this year stepping up to 8000 mmbtu per day at a price of $two71 for full year 2020 2021 we reinstated our production guides in july and we have reinstated loe and production and aslor tax guides with our earnings released yesterday our reinstated production aslor tax guides with our earnings released yesterday the six25 to seven25 is identical to what it was at the onset of our 22 guides provided in january as is the case for our reinstated l zero e guidance of 550 to $600 per b zero e although we have had recent sustainable l zero e reductions and came in well below this range in the 2nd quarter without the advantage of bringing on new wells we have kept our guidance range where it was at the gandhi year when we anticipated bringing sixteen new wells online what that means mark is so thank you mark we are really pleased with the results and confident in a bright future for auerstone while we are sorry to see our industry in such distress it is creating more m and a opportunities than we have seen in quite some time we are actively evaluating a number of situations and expect to have more to consider throughout the rest of the year as prices remain low and distressed situations continue to increase we believe that our strong balance sheet and track record as a successful consolidator positions us well increase the scale of our company and add value to our shareholders with that operator we will now open the floor for questions thank you at this time i will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the queue you may press start two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your headset before pressing the star keys our 1st question comes from the line of brad heffern with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question hi morning everyone hope you are doing well i guess from the 2021 color that you gave about being able to keep production flat with the eleven ducks is that more just meant to be instructive or is that actually how you are thinking about the 2021 plan as we sit here today zero yes a little bit of both brad you know it does depend on where commodity prices head towards the end of the year whether we want to pick up a rig or not i think we have been pretty vocal or consistent about our message that you know we need we need mid 45 to $fifty oil to want to go back to spending large capital dollars but outside of that at some point into this year early next year completing those wells will allow us to go back to spending large capital dollars the opportunities are increasing and sizes variable from small to quite large as you go along i think all of this will result in further opportunities in terms of larger companies selling assets it is difficult with no public equity and for that matter debt markets are open or open only to a very few maybe we are one of those few but we have had discussions with financial parties who are interested in acquiring us we are going to participate with us on acquisitions and much like we have done in our history you know we will bring in parties at the right time to look at buying assets and we are going to maintain a very healthy leverage amount and keep ourselves from getting into a distress no matter where we are in the cycle so i think we are just going to see more and more opportunities and we will figure out how to handle them good morning everyone i have a question from neil dignam with truest security please proceed with your question robert  1st question on that also met same line on 21 expectations and i am just wondering you know why i realized this plan really i think you know at least the one you just initially laid out assumes no new wells really one just wonders what is driving i thought frank already had you all cancel all those country club memberships and other memberships i just know what else is there yes there is no country club memberships up here you know the eleven wells we have are in really good areas and they will they will continue to produce at a very low cost so is that sustainable absolutely not you know we still have a relatively high decline rate and it does depend on when we brought those wells online if we waited until the very end of 21 we are going to have a hard time keeping production relatively flat if we brought them on today you know we might have the same problem because we get all this flushed production from these new wells so you know we are going to have a hard time keeping production relatively flat to maintain you know 13000 b zero e a day kind of level longer term we are going to have to have a rig running and  one rig program i do not know what it would exactly cost us today but generally speaking is a 120000000 to maybe a 140000000 depending on lateral length and working interests and things like that so you know this is just a very preliminary if the world stays the same and we are at fortyish low $forty environment environment i do not think any drilling capital these eleven ducks will help us keep production flat okay and then you kind of hit on my last one just on how do you think about the sort of pdp decline you know on a go forward it is now that you have been slowing a bit is that that too you know going to go down or i guess we will look at another way is it you know you are able to give us kind of how many how many wells would offset that anyway you can kind of give us a call on how you know kind of you are thinking about that in 21 on broader terms you know i do not think that is changed any and if we did not spend any capital then you can kind of forecast what our blowdown production would look like even if we did not do those eleven wells but again with those eleven wells it will help keep 21 flat and then going forward being 22 and beyond it is all going to depend on price hello this is jeff grant with northland capital markets please proceed with your question i guess i was wondering robert or maybe mark how important do you guys think pre cash flow positive in the context of evaluating whether to go after this project and potentially drilling or at some point in time would you view that as a kind of you know a must if you will or would you guys have a level of comfort with any you know near medium term maybe i will try to answer that one and robert can add on if he wants to you know we keep things pretty simple at the end of the day we feel like our responsibility is to make good individual decisions at the wellhead and that is why we were quick to put the rig down and stop completing in march and april is because the economics did not make sense so do the ducks make sense right now i mean economically you definitely could go out and complete the ducks right now and have pretty nice irrs for the incremental costs to complete them in terms of are we so focused on quarter to quarter year to year free cash flow that we will not outspend no we are not and from a practical matter we are just going to be free cash flow positive this year and next year kind of regardless of anything else that happens with prices at some point you know we we do anticipate picking the rig back up and you know there is a bit of a lag there between the cost you incur to drill in the complete wells versus the cash flow you know does that mean over the course of the year we are not free cash flow positive no not necessarily but we are not so fixated on checking that box every quarter we want to make smart economic decisions that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that

that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will lead to the wellhead that will having some outflow for some period of time yeah we still think it is supported by the economics at the same time you know we are not ones just to go keep going and completing because we have hedges in place or for other reasons we are just trying to be as good as we can of the individual decisions we are making at the wellhead yeah the only thing i will add jeff is i think we can run a one rig program with the level of activity we have we have a neutral cash flow today be cash flow neutral on an annualized basis obviously there is a jump starting the program we are going to be cash flow negative for a period of time but i think longer term over a year timeframe again depending on what the price is sure understood appreciate those comments my follow up and you guys still have a decent amount of non operating exposure are you guys seeing any activity levels there and more on the land side is there any traction or conversations on swapping any of that out to increase the operator exposure there still working on the trades but people have been hunkered down in the bunker you know for quite some time now since at least march and so nothing is moving very quickly there we have no but we have not heard anything different from our partners in terms of activity in the near term being kind of the remainder of this year so we will have to see as we get closer to year end what their view might be for activity in 2020 morning everyone had a quick question for everyone on the balance sheet you know you all are doing a great job in the free cash i look great paying it down wondering you know if you have been in conversations with the banks as we head into the fall redetermination back in march you all were early and getting it done in the spring but you know back then it looked like things would be pretty dire again in the fall and it is not as bad here and particularly with the line of sight you all have on the free cash kind of how it is held up any conversations with them to give us some insight i mean any indication as to what the fall re determination could look like sure i mean probably too early to you know sort of anything about numbers but we do pretty regularly talk to banks and we do that normal course irrespective of the environment you know the one thing i would say for us we are expecting a decrease in the barn basin and obviously we are not drilling and completing new wells and hedges roll off you know fortunately we feel like we have got enough ability to pay down debt to outpace i mean you know we do not see any scenarios that we think are realistic that would be concerning in that regard now i will say like does the environment feel better now than it did three months ago absolutely and maybe some of that is the shock of seeing $37 oil and you know team realizations for for the months of of april and may at the end of the day it is still not a great environment i think the price environment for for companies in general and the banks maybe they feel a little better because we are worth $45 or $42 versus somewhere in teens but they still have a lot of issues to deal through to to deal with and obviously there has been a lot of enron companies that have gone bankrupt and there is certainly more that will so the banks still have their hands full and they are still working through all these situations yeah i think there is a problem i mean you know in general the bank is part in general and yeah i do not frankly see them letting up a whole bunch in the fall no no that being said that is a general statement yeah we have got one time leverage and liquidity and generally are viewed as having done the right thing from a financial standpoint yeah and our assets are better than many we probably feel like we have got a pretty supportive bank group that is is i got to be reasonable and fair and historically that has been the case but too early to to circle the number thanks mark and then i guess this is from my follow up you know robert you got some some really good color on and you all did some pretty creative things to get loe down in the 2nd quarter i know you and we talked about how it is going to come back up a little bit here in the back half of the year towards you know a more historical range but you know any of those initiatives that you took do you think that you could can carry forward so to kind of help mitigate that floatie group definitely done there is you know it is just a constant progression of a well is life cycle to adjust artificial lift a lot of our wells are on gas lift so relatively expensive compressors over time that gets changed out to other lift methods in some cases rod pump in other cases plunger pump so what have you so we are continuing to work through that and that will definitely help reduce aoe and then some of the things that you know we we were fortunate in getting done in the quarter working with the utility company to get meters set and get ahead of the schedule there or got moved up in the schedule from some good relationships we we ended up getting generators off of our payroll and those are very very expensive well we did not have a whole lot but they still show up as a big expense so some of these things we did in the 2nd quarter are sustainable and we will continue doing the right things in the way we you know operate our business and continue to watch costs like a hawk our next question comes from the line of noell parks with coca cola and palmer please proceed with your question and i mean was that just sort of a result of the timing of everything you know falling off the rails with with covid and opec russia or was that the sort of part of the plan as you were just trying to you know continue to pivot to essentra on free cash flow heading into next year we had this great plan that no matter what happened in the world oil went to twenty or sub twenty that we could keep production flat for three years running with various amounts of capital if you go back and think about the beginning of the year and the call we had you know related to the 4th quarter earnings and full year we had a one rate program we were going to average for the entire year a tiny bit of free cash flow and those eleven wells would have been completed i do not know if by now i can not remember but pretty darn close so i would say it is a fall out of what is happened here and just being very conservative with our capital expenditures and cash and making sure that you know we come out of this down this near term down cycle we have been in a down cycle since 2014 great thanks just a housekeeping question sorry you touched on this earlier and i missed it for the free cash flow calculation if i looked at the numbers right it looked like this is one of those periods where there is a pretty big delta between i used to say cash capex and you know sort of capex incurred in the quarter and i was just wondering for the free cash flow calculation going forward which one of those is more important for us to use as we you know just try to model that ok it is in the presentation on the last page or something like that ok so real quick zero and one other thing i i just do not have releases in front of me and as far as changing working capital that is something else you would routinely include well well well ok the impact of in a free cash calculation or would you exclude that there is going to be a bigger delta between calculating free cash flow the way we do versus if you are using a cash capex number you know the 2nd quarter was very atypical from the standpoint of yeah here we are reporting 35000000 a free cash flow yeah our debt balance went up and the reason for that is because and of course this is tied to the cash capex it is just a timing of the payments yeah we reduced the now we are to a point where that working capital deficit by about $50000000 during the quarter now we are to a point where that working capital deficit is pretty low and probably will not fluctuate a whole bunch one way or the other until we pick activity back up at which point you would expect yeah as you start completions and drilling again you start getting bills but there is some lag between the activity and when you get the bills and when you pay them so very typical quarter yeah we had about $169000000 of debt at the quarter end in the month of july we we paid down a little more than fourteen that is not the run rate by the way it is not 14000000 in the quarter that was high because of timing but we do expect i mean really every month this year that we are paying down some debt without any big changes in the working capital status great thanks a lot for the details that thought from me thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i will turn the floor back to mister anderson for any final comments well we appreciate everybody joining us and you know we will continue to update as we need to and we will see you next quarter thanks thank you this concludes today is conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your

everyone welcome to our 2nd quarter 2020 earnings conference call i would like to remind you that an earnings call press release and slide presentation related to the call are available on our website at www dentsplysirona com before we begin please take a moment to read the forward looking statements in our earnings press release during today is call we make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results we base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties our most recent form ten k list some of those most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from predictions and with that i would now like to turn the program over to don casey chief executive officer dentsply sirona thank you john and thank all of you for joining us today we hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy to start the call i would like to acknowledge two groups that deserve both our gratitude and recognition the 1st is our customers throughout this pandemic dentists and their staff have shown tremendous resilience whether dealing with changing local regulations adjusting to new safety protocols or finding new ways to help patients dentists all over the world have adopted and innovated their commitment to their patients is inspiring the 2nd group is the employees of dentsply sirona over the last six months they have been challenged in truly unprecedented ways throughout they have remained focused on serving our customers creatively addressing new circumstances and continuing to make progress on our critical initiatives this highlights that the people of dentsply sirona and the culture we are building are truly our most important assets i would like to thank all of them around the world for their extraordinary efforts it is a privilege to lead such a committed and passionate group our call today will focus on four key areas the 1st is to outline our 2nd quarter results the 2nd is to provide some details on how our business has been performing as dentists offices reopen the 3rd area provides the steps that dentsply sirona is taking to position the company for the future and finally i will review the company is near term priorities as we navigate the current environment as expected our 2nd quarter results reflect the major changes in the market the quarter began with significant governmental actions resulting in the shutdown of dental practices and restrictions on patient traffic the situation improved across the quarter with month to month improvements in terms of dentists offices opening and patients beginning to come back our revenue followed this trend our team continued to track patient attitudes around returning to the dental office as well as the ongoing impact of additional infection control requirements on office capacity based on what we are seeing we are optimistic that the recovery is well underway globally our results in the quarter also reflect significant actions the company took to address the difficult operating environment these plans were built around employees safety meeting the needs of the customer enhancing the financial strength of the company and making continued progress on our key strategic initiatives today we have seen good results around employee safety and have not seen any major disruptions across the organization despite challenges presented by the pandemic the company has been able to reliably meet customer demand our commercial team showed excellent creativity in adapting to the new circumstances providing an extensive array of digital clinical education and online marketing events these programs have been extremely well received a comprehensive cost control program was executed during the 2nd quarter involving furloughs short work weeks salary reductions and spending controls these efforts contributed to the drop in sg a expenses in the quarter while the business has begun to restart this program will remain in place until the trajectory of the recovery is better understood our supply chain has been disciplined around inventory and there has been a real emphasis on protecting our cash flow finally the company undertook a series of actions to bolster its liquidity and financial position while there is a pressing need to manage the disruptions caused by the pandemic our team is focused on positioning the company for the future since announcing a restructuring in late 2018 dentsply sirona has made significant progress against the goals we had laid out our work on continuously challenging ourselves has shown there are still further opportunities to improve our performance therefore today we are announcing additional portfolio actions that expand on the original program these include plans for exiting the traditional orthodontics business as well as parts of our analog lab business i will discuss details later in the call these steps while difficult allow the company to focus on higher growth and higher margin digital areas where we believe dentsply sirona has strategic advantage moving to slide seven where we summarize our q two twenty results 2nd quarter revenues were $491000000 down fifty on an organic basis due to the impact of the coronavirus adjusted operating income was negative non gaap eps for the quarter was a loss of ¢eighteen cash flow is actively managed in the 2nd quarter driving cash flow from operations of $175000000 which was up 21 compared to prior year i will now turn the call over to jorge who will review the quarterly results and provide an outlook thank you don and good morning everyone the 2nd quarter was obviously a challenging one for the global economy and for many industries including dental on slide nine we show our 2nd quarter non gaap 2020 p l starting with the top line organic sales were down to fifty as compared to the prior year in the us and europe with some minor exceptions dental practices limited their activity to emergency procedures in april and much of may and then began to reopen as we moved into june as we share on our last earnings call we saw declines of sixty to eighty in april in certain geographies with the us being hit the hardest but our revenue trend improved gradually each month finishing down about forty compared to prior year in june we also saw a gradual improvement from the 1st to the last week in june so it is clear that we are seeing a recovery but have yet to get back to a normal level of sales gross profit was 207000000 or 42ten of sales down from 57seventy in the prior year quarter as it is the case in and material reductions in volume gross profit margin is impacted by the fixed cost base which is difficult to address in the short term examples of this cost include depreciation leases maintenance of manufacture in logistic facilities and cost related to ensuring compliance with high manufacturing standards gross profit margin was also impacted by higher than average inventory reserve expenses of approximately 17000000 primarily as a result of lower sales sg a of 249000000 was down a substantial 132000000 which is approximately 35 lower as compared to prior year during the quarter we took decisive action to reduce our sg a cost resulting in the steep year over year decline one area in sg a that actually increased over last year was bad debt expense which saw an uptake of 15000000 year over year these significant p l fluctuations were driven by the ongoing market disruptions and generated an operating loss of 42000000 in the quarter last year our operating profit was 202000000 in the 2nd quarter interest and other increased by 9900000 versus last year driven by the issuance of 750000000 in long term debt the addition of new credit facilities and determination of certain fx hedges in non gaap tax rate was 27fifty in the quarter up from 25thirty in the prior year a function of the change in the estimated amount of pretax income and a change to the expected income mix non gaap eps was a loss of ¢eighteen as compared to non gaap eps of ¢66 in the prior year quarter moving onto slide ten where we review our consumable segment performance reported sales were $187000000 down 58sixty and down 57seventy on our organic sales basis all of our product groups in consumables were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices while our consumable sales show a steeper decline than our t e sales both segments actually performed roughly similar from an end customer perspective let me explain the two factors that contributed to la to i to the larger decline in our consumable sales 1st there is a difference in order lead times consumable deliveries tend to match demand almost simultaneously up or down due to the nature of the products t e has a longer order lead time and therefore deliveries continued over an extended period even after dental procedure volume is slowed down at the beginning of the quarter the 2nd factor impacted consumables more than t e is the fluctuations in inventory levels in the dealer network during severe market conditions it is typical for companies to preserve cash by lowering inventory balances as much as possible we saw a steeper decline in consumables network inventory so when you account for all of these variables we believe both segments decline at roughly similar levels consumables operating margin was nineforty as compared to 27 in the 2nd quarter of 201 there are two primary reasons for the decline in consumables margins the 1st reason is that the consumables segment experienced a steeper fall off in sales compared to t e 2nd the consumables business is more plant and infrastructure dependent and requires more volume to run efficiently we have more manufacturing plant dedicated to consumables and this means a higher fixed infrastructure cost for this segment this is why we have been taking steps to consolidate our footprint and reduce our fixed cost base in the past couple of years we have completed several portfolio shaping actions including fona one 800 dentist sicat and the surgical business of wellspect in addition the two portfolio shaping activities we are announcing today will further consolidate our manufacturing footprint and will increase productivity and decrease fixed costs moving onto slide eleven where we highlight our technologies and equipment segment net sales were 304000000 down 45sixty as compared to prior year organic sales for the quarter were down 43sixty versus the prior year equipment and instruments digital dentistry and implants all experienced similar levels of decline in the quarter driven by the lower sales resulting from covid nineteen our healthcare business saw a slight decline in q two after posting a strong q one as healthcare systems were getting ready for their 1st major waves of covid nineteen technologies and equipment operating income was onethirty versus seventeentwenty in the prior year quarter on slide twelve we show our business performance for the 2nd quarter on a regional basis us sales of 131000000 declined sixtythirty compared to the prior year this represents a decline in organic sales of sixty in the us market consumables decline slightly more than t e european sales were $215000000 down 49 compared to the prior year organic sales were down 46ninety versus last year in europe consumable sales declined more than technologies and equipment on a percentage basis rest of the world sales were 144000000 down 44 and organic sales were down 41nine rest of the world consumables declined more than t e sales in the senc in the 2nd quarter on slide thirteen we show our cash flow performance in the 2nd quarter of 2020 cash flow from operations was 175000000 as compared to 145000000 in the prior year quarter this strong cash flow generation was the result of a disciplined approach to curtailing expenses and reducing working capital without sacrificing key strategic investments working capital generated a significant boost in liquidity in the quarter we were successful in achieving meaningful reductions in accounts receivables and inventory balances we expect some of this cash will be injected back into working capital as demand and production volumes climb back up to normal levels in terms of capital expenditures we spent 13000000 in the 2nd quarter of 2020 down from 27000000 last year free cash flow was a strong 162000000 in the quarter up 37 as compared to 118000000 in the prior year in the quarter we paid 22000000 in dividends where a total of 184000000 returned to shareholders through dividends and share purchases in the 1st six months of 202 at the end of june 2020 we had a strong liquidity available comprising 1100000000 of cash and 1200000000 of committed credit facilities the efforts we made during the 2nd quarter ensured that we have ample liquidity available to invest and grow the company as the economy recovers on slide fourteen i would like to talk about the significant actions we took to reduce operating expenses in the 2nd quarter of 202 our efforts to reduce costs in the quarter were multifaceted all levels and functions of the enterprise contributed to significant compensation savings each part of the organization up to and including the board of directors at executive levels they stepped up and helped in these efforts as of today most of our employees who were impacted by these measures have returned to work or to normal pay levels the next largest area for cost reductions was discretionary commercial spend such as advertising and promotions it was logical to reduce this spend when dental offices were closed and the returns could not be realized we also achieved significant savings from reductions in professional services and of course travel expenses together all of these actions deliver a reduction in sg a of 35 versus last year with respect to business trends for the remainder of the year i would like to make a few comments 1st let me start with current volume trends all regions recovered from their low point in april and improved by twenty to forty percentage points by the end of the quarter additionally in june the last week of the month was significantly better than the 1st week and we are pleased to note that the positive momentum continues into july with july sales approaching or surpassing 2019 levels depending on the region and product groups there are still some gating factors in place including the availability of personal protection equipment new infection prevention protocols reducing office capacity and overlapping regulations all of which impact the shape of the recovery together these factors point to a gradual as opposed to a sudden is now back in demand let me give you more details from a geographical perspective in the us virtually all dental offices are now open and we continue to see signs of improvement with july volumes trending better than what we saw in june in europe we also saw july trends improving sequentially with regards to the rest of the world in apac some of the markets turned positive in july with good traction in china and japan and some lingering concerns in australia latin america remains a challenging market as covid nineteen continues to impact our business in brazil and other countries in the region moving forward to the 2nd half of the year as we announced today we are accelerating actions to fund growth areas and improve efficiencies as we did in q two we will continue to drive a disciplined resource allocation process that emphasizes return investment and sustainability of our growth initiatives with that i will now turn the call back to don thanks jorge and moving to slide one as i mentioned earlier in the call in november 2018 we put a plan in place to accelerate growth improve margins and simplify the organization our results through 2019 and the 1st quarter of 2020 show significant progress the execution highlights of our plan include accelerating growth behind new products including primescan and primemill as well as other new products in our consumable portfolio the pipeline of future new products has also been enhanced the company has made major investments in critical areas like our digital product portfolios digital commercial capabilities and growth priorities like our suresmile clear aligner business dentsply sirona has implemented a new organizational structure centralizing supply chain and other functions while creating a unified commercial structure there have been major initiatives designed to transform the finance hr and it areas further we have undertaken multiple portfolio shaping activities including the ones announced today the restructuring plan is a multi year initiative as part of that the organization has embraced the need to continue challenging ourselves to go beyond the original plan and deliver better results that work has shown there are significant opportunities in both the near term and longer term moving now to slide one over the last several quarters as jorge mentioned we have exited several under performing businesses these reduce our cost and complexity while serving to enhance our growth and margins the team continually reviews all our businesses against a framework around future growth opportunities as well as strategic fit in the area of orthodontics we believe that the clear aligner space is an attractive opportunity for dentsply sirona suresmile now offers a comprehensive digital treatment plan that positions the company well in this rapidly growing market going forward we will focus all our efforts in the ortho space on the clear aligner area we believe this offers the opportunity to grow innovate and take advantage of many dentsply sirona is unique strategic advantages including a large syracuse community as a result we are exiting the traditional orthodontic business which includes brackets bands tubes and wires the traditional orthodontic business is component of the technology and equipment segment and has had net sales of approximately 132000000 in 201 likewise in our lab business there is a clear opportunity to focus on the digital space which is showing good growth rates and solid margins it is a place where innovation will be rewarded based on our analysis it is critical to focus all our lab resources in the digital area going forward as such we are announcing plans to exit the analog portion of the laboratory business that manufacture removable dentures and related products this business is a component of the consumable segment and had net sales of approximately 44000000 in 201 together the portfolio shaping initiatives and additional actions are expected to result in the closure of several facilities and the incremental reduction of approximately six to seven of the company is workforce by the end of 202 the ongoing execution of the restructuring will enhance dentsply sirona is continued efforts to grow revenues expand our margins and simplify the organization slide nineteen lists our priorities for the back half of 202 they include executing on our comprehensive restructuring plan pursuing our growth initiatives aggressively and meeting our financial objectives in conclusion the covid pandemic will continue to impact our industry and our company for the foreseeable future current trends are +and a reason for optimism but we will need to continue to adapt to the circumstances as they change we believe we have a comprehensive plan for both the short term and longer term to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders further the company has maintained its focus on our priorities around growth margin expansion and simplifying the business our financial strength broad portfolio and global reach are position us well to succeed and win in the dental industry it is hard to know what the new normal is or when it will arrive but our internal theme is that teeth do not heal themselves our team is optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and we embrace the current challenges and are confident in our strategy our customers and our team thank you and with that we will take questions thank you and ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time just press star then one to get in the queue to withdraw your question simply press the pound or hash key please stand by while we compile the q a roster our 1st question is from jeff johnson with baird please go ahead thank you good morning guys can you hear me okay i think i was on mute there yeah we can we we got you jeff yeah yeah great good morning so don i i think i just want to start with the july comments and i really want to understand maybe the message that you want to have out there it sounds like you make the argument that july was getting back towards flat ish year over year levels according to what jorge said but how much of that might be sell in that was recovering off some sell in issues earlier in the quarter or earlier in two q does your sell in is it starting to match kind of the sell out at this and again i know you are not guiding but for three qs we think the line maybe is not sustainable as you get into august and september i if there is some backlog it helping in that july number thanks yeah thanks jeff you you know look i think jorge said it clearly in the prepared remarks as we were as as we were looking at july there is places that have you know we are seeing good progress in in some cases it is actually exceeding one your specific question about how much of that is you know inventory rebuild y you know it is hard to see exactly there is a couple things we are looking at and you know that is that is one of the reasons we are not being okay let us just go project july into august september and the and later in the 4th quarter the things we are looking at is patient volume and we have seen that as good office capacity we see office capacity kind of improving our our patient tracking is telling us that you know confidence in the dentist office continues to go up but there is a pocket that is going to be reluctant at least in the us to go back for a little while a and what that in in our mind means that okay look if if we are getting capacity in the in the dentist office back to you know close to normal that is going to take a little bit of time i i think we are working to of patients right now and then i i think y you know from an inventory perspective our dealers and the dentist office ultimately are working through the fact that y you know when when the pandemic started i think people hit the brakes pretty hard on stuff that is ordered almost every day and and in our minds that is kinda the consumable space and you could see jeff the difference between our consumable and technol you know the the t e side a and we believe that is a lot to do with okay we do not know how long the office is going to be closed you know we we are going to stop building inventory on the daily stuff and as a result there may be some bill back here but look i i in my summary i was pretty clear on saying hey look we we are happy that we saw you know consecutive month to month sequential improvement in overall demand we are seeing that at the retail level we are happy that july has continued that trend and we are happy to see that and you know some cases it you know we are actually tracking better than 201 understood that is helpful thanks don and just as a follow up you know thinking about 2021 conceptually you know we all know what the ada is saying about high likelihood that dental consumption and and dental industry ri revenues are down relative to 2019 level i do not think anybody would really argue with that at least looking at things right now but with some of the extra restructuring efforts you are taking now some of the tailwinds from the restructuring that we are probably still continuing from the past plan you know how do how do you think about the margins e especially next year can they get back to 2019 levels with revenue that at least it is approaching 2019 levels next year or or is there a lag in kind of the margin recovery relative to how we think about revenues next year thanks yeah jeff it is it is early for us to to really forecast 202 i i would tell you the steps we took around the restructuring though reflect our interest in sitting there saying hey look d we we need to get back on the margin progression i mean you know we have we have been saying since november 2018 how do we grow how do we get our margins improving and i think w i think we have to take s organizational steps to do it i think the results here show you that you know we we think we have made some good progress i mean you know basically through the 1st quarter of 2020 we were tracking on a margin basis and you know what we have seen obviously our margin is revenue dependent and you you know i hey look if if revenue is down twenty in 2021 that is obviously going to have an impact on the business we do not think that is going to happen but we are taking specific steps now to sit there and say regardless of of you know whether the category is up two or three or down two or three or you know up ten down ten we want to be taking steps toward margin accretion and you know as we get out of the traditional ortho business we get out we got out of the analog lab business those are all part of the ongoing restructuring designed to help us really take charge of our ability to drive margin accretion going forward a and and i am not going to say it is going to be revenue independent but we think we can take steps you know at a at a certain revenue base that we are really going to be able to drive margin and you know we we were very clear you know i i joke with john sweeney occasionally that we we picked our revenue targets to match the years just to make sure that we could always communicate it so we have always said 22 in 2022 y you know and internally what we are trying to focus on is look we we think 22 is is a is attainable we do not know if it is going to happen exactly on the trajectory based on what we are seeing with covid you know it it is covid and the knock on effects of that is that a six month issue it is a nine months it is twelve month issue but we want to be marching back toward that target it just may take us a little bit longer to get there thank you thank you and our next question comes from tycho peterson with jp morgan please go ahead hey are you able to talk about how much of the consumable pressure in the quarter was inventory destocking versus slower orders and and how much incremental risk is there going forward with distributors around potential additional destocking good morning tycho this is jorge it is you know it it is hard to give a any precise number but as as don just indicated in the case of consumables there is a the the order lead time is very short and so when the pandemic hit customers and and dealers and in general in the in the market place there was a a reaction to to manage inventories very very closely and when we look at the data of retail sales and our sales there there are a lot of indications that show that there was a a reduction in the inventory levels that we historically or typically carry in in the network so there was an element of that and when that comes back to to typical levels is is hard to to project some of that may be happening as as as don indicated but i do not think that is something that for us is going to be meaningful from a long term perspective listen at the end of the day we always want to make sure that our sales match retail sales that that is that is our key objective that is how we we make money there will be always small fluctuations in in the network so i i think in given the magnitude of the changes that we experienced in the 2nd quarter as as a result of lower revenues and the uncertainty that we still have in in many places i i think that is it that that noise is not actually meaningful in terms of explaining our performance and our you know trajectory over the next several months okay and then don on the portfolio reshaping i am curious you know the decision to exit ortho i i always thought part of the picture on the clear aligner was you know the ability to go in and do hybrid cases and and you know leverage that you know strong ortho channel as you push push out suresmile and i am curious if you know if there is risk of dissynergies here and and how you think about that yeah thanks tycho a we are we are actually there is a component of the you know the wire bending aspect of of suresmile that we are keeping what when we say how we kinda delineate traditional orthopedic which is kind of the brackets bands that would go straight up on a orthodon t an orthodontist using orthodontia the the we believe hybrid is meaningful we believe that it is it is a differentiator for suresmile so we we are actually keeping those components so that piece of traditional ortho and the piece that actually came with your metrics acquisition is going to stay with that and then you know what we are seeing is we are we are getting real traction on suresmile tends to be s you know right now focused around our cerec base y you know we kinda made that shift at y basically in october of last year and that is part of the the one ds program and we are seeing good traction there so as we look going forward we did not feel that there were going to be dissynergies associated with getting out of traditional y you know orthodontia treatment among the orthodontist group so you know as we focus on growing in the future you know we tend to think all right how do we take care of how do we take advantage of our digital assets and and how do we really look at expanding in in places that are not necessarily tied to kind of the traditional orthodontia model okay and then just lastly any thoughts on just the capital equipment appetite as we think about the back half of the year and and think about you know primescan and pr primemill can you just talk on to what degree you think there there could be pent up demand and any need on your part to be a little bit more flexible in terms of financing or pricing potentially you know it it has been interesting tycho w j even before the pandemic hit we were really beginning to shift to one you know our theory of one visit dentistry and with primemill and the speed of primemill it really made that a reality i mean you you can get patients in and out with a single unit crown in in you know an hour plus so we we had made that shift and it was interesting in in april when everything went down we really shifted to a bunch of digital d whether it was dem product demonstrations or you know kinda taking people through what one visit dentistry really means and we got a pretty good reception so what we have seen to date and and you have actually seen the results that there is a pretty good appetite in our mind for technology and equipment now whether it is spread e across you know are we going to see treatment centers and and are we going to see imaging not sure but we we feel very good about primescan and primemill and the opportunity for dentists who are you know b basically going to be dealing with the patient population that may be a little bit hey do i want to go to the dentist three times in in you know during the pandemic to get a crown fixed or can i get that done one time you you are also seeing a lot of dentists that we have been talking to and we have been seeing a fair amount of success with saying hey look i have got to change how i practice and they use the kind of the downtime during the pandemic to think through that so we are w we feel good about where we are from the technology and equipment space in the back half and and a large part is due to the 1st the new products we pushed out but also the change in messaging and how we are pitching the pitching these products so ultimately and you know look we are working with our dealer partners globally right now to to make sure that we are helping dentists access this material you know but we are do i s do i see a a whole bunch of pricing pressure and and you know crazy financing options coming on our technology and equipment no okay thank you thanks tycho thank you and our next question comes from steven valiquette with barclays please go ahead hey thanks good morning everybody a couple of quick questions for you you know 1st your comment around july being fairly flat year over year on a global basis is obviously pretty +and i do not want to give any specific guidance but just kind of eyeballing the three consensus estimates for the 3rd quarter they call for revenues to be down some twenty to 25 year over year so i am just wondering based on what you are seeing in july and you know barring any other major changes in the landscape does that you know is that a number that seems like maybe that is too conservative on the revenue outlook as far as where consensus is just curious to get your thoughts around that steve good morning jorge here listen i it is it is early for us to be able to extrapolate from the july numbers and as as you can appreciate there is a lot of different data points coming from different regions and there are some markets that are doing much better in terms of the number of offices that are open markets that are good from a volume perspective we still have lingering concerns in places like australia parts of latin america and there are some spots in in europe that are also still challenging so and it is it is very hard to make a judgment with respect to those numbers i think what we are what we are really encouraged by the fact that sequentially the last three months have been you know moving in the right direction but from a planning perspective internally we we are we are trying to we continue to work with scenario planning we we are preparing the company for for a multiple set of of outcomes in the next in the next few months and quarters i think it is important thing to do so har hard to tell you if if that number is right or not okay that is helpful one other quick clarification question on the exiting of the traditional orthodontics and parts of the analog lab business are these businesses that could be monetized through asset sales or are these just full shutdowns maybe just give us a little more color around the decision tree on shutdown versus asset sale yeah steve you know as we look at it right now we are we are making the announcement to get it done obviously we will look to dispose the assets in the in the way that it is most beneficial to the company if you know there is some asset sales we will certainly look at it if if it is a full shutdown you know we we gave you guys the the numbers based on you know the worst case scenario and obviously we are going to work to improve that but but again the the process because you know we mentioned in the prepared remarks it is multiple plants in multiple locations you know obviously you start with the works council and and you go through a lot of different things but you know the the numbers we gave you represent you know the base case and and we are going to work hard to improve versus that and there is the opportunity to to do better than what we said okay all right appreciate the extra comment thanks thanks steve thank you our next question is from michael cherny with bank of america please go ahead good morning and and thanks for the questions i i want to just dive back into the july commentary specifically i apologize to keep harping on this but just want to make sure this is clear as possible y jorge are you saying that what you s have seen so far in july on a total dollar basis across the book is similar to 2019 is there any way specifically to th to think about how that is factoring into the us in particular in terms of the m the the quantity of dollar basis versus some of the other growth rates where there might be some countries that did not have any meaningful covid spikes that could be growing clearly at a faster yeah michael thanks for the question we we are still trying to digest all the july numbers there is a lot of a lot of data to look at from a product perspective from a geography perspective a as i as i indicated before july definitely trended better than june so that that that is very good but it is it it depends on the region it depends on the on the geography and at this zero on a and on the products at this point i can not give you a breakdown because there is some some analytics that we need we still need to do overall the the the total portfolio is is getting closer to nineteen numbers and in some instances i it did better than than 201 and and and that is definitely a substantial improvement versus versus june yeah and then just one more question zero on aligners how do you think about the differentiation strategy that you are going to go forward with i know a lot of it was tied historically to the integration you had with omnicam and and with and with cerec and and everything and a as you think about where you compete y you know every aligner seems to have its own specific angle on what makes it better where do you think that suresmile will shake out as what makes it better the best or what x ray office differentiates the name with everyone else yeah thanks michael i i would say that it is our system look between omni and primescan you know we think we have got a pretty installed base we we have a very loyal user group there that is looking to practice at the highest level of their license so when we can add something that is integrated and seamless like suresmile into into the package and particularly you know when we came out with suresmile sevensix it and it it is really seamlessly integrated into y you know our base digital assets it it becomes really easy to use and you know we feel with sevensix you know we are now able to compete across the broad broad portfolio into class one class two class three we we think that our treatment planning software is 2nd to none i mean we we feel it is really really competitive and you know we are very comfortable with the clinical results we are seeing and as we go into y you know kind of our installed base we feel very good about that right now a and look every single day we get better and better at beginning to think about dentsply sirona not as as individual product companies where we are sitting there saying hey we are going to go sell you an omni we are going to go sell you a prime and then zero by the way maybe next week somebody will come in with suresmile no it is it is really w r we have begun to focus much more on how do we focus on the customer as as one company and and as part of that one company approach stuff like ds one you know one ds excuse me we really are going in and saying hey look how how do you think about using these digital assets to you know w make life easier around doing orthodontics with clear aligners how do you really think about implants differently and and again we are we are working hard to actually bring this idea that that we are the dental solutions company to reality does that answer your question sir yes michael we lost you no still here thanks thanks for the comment thank you and our next question is from jason bednar with piper sandler please go ahead good morning thanks for taking the questions here don and jorge thanks for all the restructuring plan cover wondering in the orthodontic business i mean you you have mentioned here a few times leveraging the cerec installed base with clear aligners i think it makes a ton of sense but i mean should we interpret your cerec comments to be that you are you are going to be emphasizing suresmile principally in the gp channel or do you have a strategy to continue to target the orthodontist channel that does not have that same cerec owner base yeah look we w we are happy to take suresmile into the orthodontist office and and the gp office you know what we are seeing is a again we want to play to our strengths and we we do have a large installed base and when we do programs like one ds we are you know we are we are obviously trying to package you know workflows together in such a way that we are that there is real benefit to the dentist we are seeing more success there so look we will continue to pitch suresmile across both the orthodontics orthodontic as well as the gp channel we think we have got more innate advantages in the in the gp channel right now that is helpful okay and then i wanted to ask actually a new product question here actually partially related to the prior question and i appreciate the policy here not to discuss new products before they are officially launched but instead of talking specifically to the recently approved large field of view imaging system or maybe any three d printing plans you might have with primeprint maybe you could talk to what you see in the in the market from an opportunity or a demand perspective for each of those categories each of large field of view and also in office three d printing thanks on you know wide field of view i i we are filling a gap in our portfolio that you you know we w it took us a little while to get there but we feel very good about that right now and if you look at what we have done with you know our orthophos sl and our and now wide field of view we we feel that we are very competitive in the imaging space and you know now in terms of where do we think about the macro demand for imaging equipment again s you know if you look over the last six months and and again the pandemic really started you know at the end of the 1st quarter and we have seen regions begin to recover you know we have seen good solid demand a across the board in technology and equipment and you know it is when you start looking at things like wide field of view it it is really not necessarily about y you know i am just replacing my x ray machinery it is it is what procedures do i want to do and you know wide field of view and and particularly when you start looking at two d and three d kind of imaging products it lets you do more procedures it lets you do better implants it lets you do better endo it lets you do better orthodontia so you know we we think the demand you know is it going to gyrate a little bit as we recover from the pi pandemic it it could but you know we have seen demand remain pretty solid on there and in in terms of of printing you know we we have not really discussed that and you know look our our one of the challenges in in in this space you know versus other med device spaces where you can really put your pipeline out you know we we tend to play things pretty close to the vest what what i would tell you is that our new product portfolio work has been one of you know we kept saying in the prepared remarks you know we stayed focused on our key strategic initiatives well one of those is new products and you know th what we have been working on internally is how do we take the the five to ten most important products whether that is in the endo or implant or in the technology and equipment space and keep making progress on it and and we you know are we are not backing off on what we think our launch schedule is on some of those major launch launches and and you know again we think it positioned us well as as people come out of the pandemic all right thanks very much guys thanks jason thank you our next question is from elizabeth anderson with evercore please go ahead hi good morning guys i just was wondering if we if you could help us put some numbers around the new ortho strategy can you talk about the vol y you know maybe some comments about how you saw volumes trend within orthodontics and then also is there anything that you can talk about in terms of the size of the revenue base and g or and or growth rates would be helpful just in terms of framing that opportunity on a go forward basis thank you yeah thanks elizabeth you know it is funny we we we have not broken out you know the total orthodontia business and we do not give the clear aligner numbers specifically what i would tell you is that what we have seen over the last year is accelerating growth behind suresmile and and we have seen actually very positive trends even coming out of the pandemic so that is one of the reasons we feel very comfortable about that decision look we we feel that dentsply sirona has an opportunity to become a solid number two in the space and we are going to work toward that so you you know can do some math around that look ultimately you know we we have been pretty consistent saying we want to grow and we want to do margin accretions so the steps we are taking around getting out of the traditional ortho business and really focusing on clear aligners helps us do that so y you know w our our bet and belief is that the clear aligner space is is going to be a significant contributor to our aggregate growth rate over time okay perfect that is helpful and then you know given obviously you guys have a pretty substantial liquidity position right now how do you see that playing out if you sort of assume that you know hopefully we are through the worst of covid and things continue to improve from here yeah good morning listen our our capital deployment philosophies a are not changing have not changed i think it was absolutely the right thing to raise more liquidity to be in a position of a strength from a financial standpoint we were encouraged actually by a number of shareholders to to be in that position which we totally agree with at this point we want to keep doing what we are doing being very fluent with our balance sheet being very diligent with our cash flow you probably noticed in the in the 2nd quarter we had a very strong operating cash flow got very good free cash flow and all our parts of our deployment will you know are are not changing for now we paid paid our dividends and we have no plans to change our dividend at this time once things go back to to a more normal level we will reassess where we are at that point we will look at all of the demands for capital opportunities that we have at that time and we will make whatever decisions we think are in the best interest of our shareholders as we deploy that capital but for now i think the the focus is on zero on the recovery is how to ensure that we have a very stable financial position how we are able to fund strategic initiatives some of which don has talked about that we want to make sure that even in a low revenue environment and low profitability environment we we we keep funding those initiatives and and that is one of the reasons we have we have that that that capital we we want to keep investing in the organic growth of the company for the time being okay thank you very much that is helpful thanks elizabeth thanks elizabeth thank you and our next question is from steve with research please go ahead hi good morning and and thanks for the time here i wanted to ask one very specific question and then one kinda big picture question the specific one is actually about germany i wonder you know to what extent you would be willing to talk about growth in germany operating conditions there and and to what extent you think that a good barometer for you know what the business might look like over the next several months in the event that we you know we get the virus under under control and then i have a a a follow up on strategy after that yeah thanks steve you know conditions in germany are are if if you were going to go around the world are pretty good y you know a and again i think jorge said it well that it de it depends on the business and y y you know th there has been different reactions to different different businesses and and we kinda look at together which is you know germany switzerland and and austria but but conditions there if it if that is a harbinger of the future would would tell you that you know things do get closer to normal i mean there is obviously you know again the same things we see over here that we keep tracking is what is office capacity you know around the new infection protocols and again that keeps getting better y you know things are better in july than they were in june just as as the dentist and their staff get more used to that and then patient attitudes it is interesting the the the patient tracking that we did in germany showed that you know th the from a patient perspective there was less change in germany than there was in the us around the pandemic so there seems to be a little bit more of a stable attitude toward visiting the dentist is office so you know ultimately if if things look like germany it points to the fact that things do get back to normal okay much appreciated and then don i i wanted to to borrow from from your experience a little bit if i could you you are a you are a med tech guy and you came into dental with a different perspective on you know what the industry could be and you know how businesses could run and covid has certainly it changed you know some of that thinking i i wonder as you y you keep your med tech hat on and and you think about what you want the business to look like and you know how practice evolves you know over the next you know however many quarters or or months and we get to the point where you know we are in a new post covid normal how is your thinking how has your thinking evolved in terms of you know what you want the business to be what you think the practice looks like i know you have a a focus on digital you know that was there before can you just give us a sense for maybe what you might have learned in the last few months and how your thinking has evolved on that future strategic vision thank you thanks steve y you know i i i think what covid has done has b has brought into sharper focus what i think the industry is going to need to be and you know whether it gets there in two years three years five years i i think it is going to accelerate a a couple of trends i mean the 1st is that you know i i think dsos are are going to pick up you know i do not think it is going to happen in the in the in the immediate short term but i i think if if you look at in europe and the us and and even in places in asia pacific where the pandemic exposed you know sometimes some of the offices are are kind of right on the margin and the dentist may feel it is better to practice in a larger group so i think there there you you may see a shift that way i think the 2nd big thing is y you know the the idea of when you say digital i i push digital pretty hard in in my mind what what i think whether it is the dso is or the individual dentists are going to be doing is they are really going to be evaluating their practice more critically and i think covid brought that into sharp focus that hey look i have got forty hours to see patients how am i allocating time against procedures and and and how am i thinking about you know what procedures can i do and what procedures do i really want to develop within the practice and i am going to ad i am going to address that accordingly from the equipment and where i emphasize you know our training and and whatnot so you know i i think what we have seen with clear aligners is is something that is going to go into the rest of dentistry y you know when you think about implants when you think about even basic endo work i i think the increased digitization of diagnostics and and how that can help dentists practice at the highest level of their licenses is is is it is it is going to accelerate so i would i would say steve i do not think anything is dramatically changed strategically what i think it it is it y you know and and you read all the books and you know after major disruptions and dislocations you tend to see new trends go i i think what might have taken a decade because dental tends to be a little bit slower than what what we saw in med tech i think is going to accelerate pretty dramatically i could not agree more thanks for all the the help here all right thanks steve stay safe thank you and our next question is from john kreger with william blair please go ahead hi thanks very much don curious could you give us an update on the your integration efforts and i i am sure covid has impacted them a little bit but you had a pretty long list across commercial manufacturing and r d just kind of give us a sense about where that stands and to what degree the pandemic has kind of altered the the thinking around them y y you know john 1st thanks for the question y you know when i i would say when we outlined things in november of eighteen you know we kinda said it was a three year program i i would say that and particularly with the announcements we made this morning a around traditional ortho and analog lab i it kind of points to the fact that we are pushing a little bit faster and we are pushing harder i think the pandemic has accelerated our our thinking and y you know look when you when you see the revenue challenges in the 2nd quarter it it also highlights you know some of the things that we need to get after even faster so that is kind of what i would tell you i i w it it is really interesting internally we keep trying to tell people hey look it is not as if we are going to get the restructuring done and then that is it you know we are not changing ever again so i have been trying to condition the organization to understand that this is a marathon and and you know the restructuring might have have been only the 1st ten k of that so look i i i would tell you in terms of the plan we laid out we are we are more than halfway done but i would also tell you b you know it is great as i brought in a new team with people like jorge we have got a terrific supply chain leader we have actually now got all the commercial people reporting into one pe one person walter peterson we are finding more and more stuff that we think that we can improve on that should have y you know r r really deliver the promise of what dentsply sirona should be so y you know look specifically hey you know if you thought it was a three year restructuring w you know we are we are slightly ahead of where we thought we would be i would just tell you that we are commit our management team is committed to as soon as we get done that restructuring we are we are not stopping we are how do we continuously improve that is great thanks and and then one last question how was your implant portfolio performing how did it do in the 2nd quarter and are y are you rethinking that line up at all implants is you know we have been happy with our implant business i i would tell you y you know when you say the 2nd quarter john it it is it is an interesting challenge in terms of what language do you use you know implants did well relative but you know versus prior year y you know across the whole portfolio was challenging w as we talk and think rethink about our portfolio you know look we we think we we have started to actually get our new products where we need to get them you know ob obviously we have talked about our immediate load astra ev product and and i think that is the 1st of what you will see a a pretty regular set of introductions over the next eighteen months in our in our implant space that are going to really let us be competitive the other thing that we have been doing with implants that you know does not get a lot of highlight is you know we have a a a business mis that we had bought a couple years back which lets us play a little bit more aggressively in the value segment and as as we have been rethinking how we approach commer our commercial go to market strategy across all dentsply sirona including implants being able to integrate that and expand that beyond the base of of what they used to operate in when we bought them is has been beneficial there so you know we feel that implants remains a significant growth opportunity for us i would say that you know we are starting to get the portfolio where we need to get it i am extremely excited about what i think the the new products in that space are going to be able to deliver for us you know over the next you know couple years sounds good thank you thank you our next question is from jon block with stifel please go ahead this is trevor on for jon thanks for taking my questions so you i think you mentioned earlier that your patient tracking is saying that y con patient confidence has been continuing to go up recently i am wondering if there is any detail you can give there on just like how that is shaken out geographically and if there is a read through to you know potentially some of your july comments you know through that confidence level yeah sure thanks trevor a couple things i i mean 1st we are we are doing patient tracking a across the entire globe and and again we we have seen consistent improvement a around you know people likely to visit the dentist and and we measure likely to visit in the in the you know the next thirty days the next quarter and whatnot so we have been seeing consistent improvement across the board there interestingly there is a kind of a subgroup people have been to the dentist have had really positive experiences around how people you know whether it is you know adjusting waiting room or you know how they are addressing infection protocols so we see that group as pretty +eleven of the things we were trying to watch as they were kinda the flare ups in the us in in particular geographies whether there was going to be a drop off in in patient confidence and we did not see that so y you know look i i and and by the way while most of the patient data is good there is some reluctance on you know kind of a a segment of the population to say you know am i going to go back in the next month versus do i intend to go back to the dentist in the next six months so you know there is a little bit of a lag there that that we see particularly in the us but we do not see it else elsewhere around the world so patient patient tracking has been actually a good lead indicator and and a again we are we are seeing we are seeing some good positive things there yeah thank you and then just one more on dsos you know we have been hearing that dsos in large practices are tending to perform better in this environment i am just wondering if you know that is what you have been seeing and if you think that you know some of the smaller more fragmented practitioners could start to play catch up there as well we to to be honest trevor we have not seen a a a a huge differentiation between the the dsos and and the individual practices you know the things that that we love about this market is that you know the whether the you know there is 600000 dentists ar around the world and and they are independent business owners and they are a lot of them are very very inventive and creative about how they you know go after and and make sure that they are reaching out to their patients and whatnot so i i look do i think on the margin if if somebody was considering retiring in a year or two and and covid hit you know do they sit there and say may now maybe is the time that i accelerate that yeah you you might see a little bit of that but you know we have not seen a a sharp change in the number of dental practices that we are doing business with and y you know we think that we we have not seen a drop off in the aggregate number of dental practices in key regions post covid so when we when we are watching you know when we say things are eighty open ninety open 99 we have not seen the the number of practices that we are measuring that against change great thank you so much thanks trevor thank you and with and with that we conclude our q a session for today i would like to turn the call back to john sweeney for his final remarks thank you very much everybody we look forward to updating you as we move through the rest of the year have a good day thank you ladies and gentlemen for participating in today is program and you may now disconnect and have a great day",

extraordinary efforts it is a privilege to lead such a committed and passionate group our call today will focus on four key areas the 1st is to outline our 2nd quarter results the 2nd is to provide some details on how our business has been performing as dentistry offices reopen the 3rd area provides the steps that densply sarona has taken to ensure the safety of our patients and employees the 4th area is to discuss our plans for the future thank you to position the company for the future and finally i will review the company is near term priorities as we navigate the current environment as expected our 2nd quarter results reflect the major changes in the market the quarter began with significant governmental actions resulting in the shutdown of dental practices and restrictions on patient traffic the situation improved across the quarter with month to month improvements in terms of dentist offices opening our patients beginning to come back our revenue followed this trend our team continues to track patient attitudes around returning to the dental office as well as the ongoing impact of additional infection control requirements on office capacity based on what we are seeing we are optimistic that the recovery is well underway globally our results in the quarter also reflect significant actions the company took to address the difficult operating environment these plans were built around employee safety enhancing the financial strength of the company and making continued progress on our key strategic initiatives to date we have seen good results around employee safety and have not seen any major disruptions across the organization just by challenges presented by the pandemic the company has been able to reliably meet customer demand our commercial team showed excellent creativity in adapting to new circumstances providing an extensive array of digital clinical education and online services these programs have been extremely well received a comprehensive cost control program was executed during the 2nd quarter involving furloughs short work weeks salary reductions and spending controls these efforts contributed to the drop in sgna expenses in the quarter while the business has begun to restart this program will remain in place until the trajectory of the recovery is better understood our supply chain has been disciplined around inventory and there has been a real emphasis on protecting our cash flow finally the company undertook a series of actions to bolster its liquidity and financial position while there is a pressing need to manage the disruptions caused by the pandemic our team is focused on positioning the company for the future since announcing a restructuring in late 2018 densplotron has made significant progress against the goals we had laid out our work on continuously challenging ourselves has shown there is still for therefore today we are announcing additional portfolio actions that expand on the original program these include plans for exiting the traditional orthotics business as well as parts of our analog lab business i will discuss details later in the call these steps while difficult allow the company to focus on higher growth and higher margin digital areas where we believe densply sorona has strategic advantage moving to slide seven where we summarize our two queued twenty results 2nd quarter revenues were $491000000 down fifty on an organic basis due to the impact of the coronavirus adjusted operating income was negative non gap eps for the quarter was a loss of ¢eighteen cash flow was actively managed in the 2nd quarter driving cash flow from operations of $175000000 which was up 21 compared to prior year i will now turn the call over to jorge who will review the quarter results and provide an outlook in the us and europe with some minor exceptions dental practices limited their activity to emergency procedures in april and much of may and then began to reopen as we moved into june as we share on our last earnings call we saw declines of sixty to eighty in april in certain geographies with the us being hit the hardest but our revenue trends improved gradually each month finishing up in december we also saw a gradual improvement from the 1st to the last week in june so it is clear that we are seeing a recovery but have yet to get back to a normal level of sales gross profit was $207000000 or 42 one of sales down from 57seven in the prior year quarter as it is the case in solid and material reductions in volume gross profit margin is impacted by the fixed cost base which is difficult to address in the short term examples of this cost include depreciation leases maintenance of manufacturing and logistic facilities and costs related to ensuring compliance with high manufacturing standards gross profit margin was also impacted by higher than average inventory reserve expenses of approximately 17000000 primarily during the quarter we took decisive action to reduce our sgen costs resulting in a steep year over year decline one area in sgen that actually increased over last year was bad expense this significant pnl fluctuations were driven by the ongoing market disruptions and generated an operating loss of 42000000 in the quarter last year our operating profit was 202000000 in the 2nd quarter interest and other increased by 9900000 versus last year driven by the issuance of 750000000 in long term debt the addition of new credit facilities the non gap tax rate was 27five in the quarter up from 25three in the prior year a function of the change in the estimated amount of pre tax income and a change to the expected income mix non gap eps was a loss of ¢eighteen as compared to non gap eps of ¢66 in the prior year quarter moving on to slide ten where we review our consumables segment performance reported sales were 187000000 down 58six and down 57seven on an organic basis all of our product groups in consumables were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices while our consumables sales show some improvement in the 3rd quarter we expect this trend to continue in the 4th quarter as well both segments actually perform relatively similarly from an end customer perspective let me explain the two factors that contributed to the larger decline in our consumable sales 1st there is a difference in order lead times consumer deliveries tend to match demand almost simultaneously up or down due to the nature of the products tne has had the 1st factor impacting consumers more than tne is the fluctuations and inventory levels in the dealer network during severe market conditions it is typical for companies to preserve cash by lowering inventory balances as much as possible so when you account for all of these variables we believe both segments declined at relatively similar levels the consumer is operating margin was ninefour as compared to 27 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 there are two primary reasons for the decline in consumer is margins the 1st reason is that the consumer segment experienced a steeper fall off 1st sales compared to tne 2nd the consumer goods business is more plant and infrastructure dependent and requires more volume to run efficiently we have more manufacturing plants dedicated to consumer goods and this means a higher fixed infrastructure cost for this segment this is why we have been taking steps to consolidate our footprint and reduce our fixed cost base in the past couple of years we have completed several portfolio shaping actions good morning everyone this is doctor john the ceo of phona 1800 dentist c cat and the surgical business of well spect in addition the two portfolio shaping activities we are announcing today will further consolidate our manufacturing footprint and will increase productivity and decrease fixed costs moving on to slide eleven where we highlight our technologies and equipment segment net sales were 304000000 down 45six organic sales for the quarter were down 43six versus the prior year equipment and instruments digital dentistry and implants all experienced similar levels of decline in the quarter driven by the lower sales resulting from covid nineteen our healthcare business or is it light decline in q two after posting a strong q one as healthcare assistance were getting ready for the 1st major surge on slide twelve we show our business performance for the 2nd quarter on a regional basis u s sales of $131000000 declined sixtythree compared to the prior year this represents a decline in organic sales in the us market consumables declined slightly more than six european sales were 200 and 15000000 down 49 compared to the prior year organic sales were down 46nine versus last year in europe consumables declined more than technologies and equipment on a percentage basis rest of the world sales were 100 and 44000000 on slide thirteen we show our cash flow performance in the 2nd quarter of 2020 cash flow from operations was 175000000 as compared to 245000000 in the prior year quarter this is a strong cash flow the result of a disciplined approach to curtailing expenses and reducing working capital without sacrificing key strategic investments in terms of capital expenditures we spent 13000000 in the 2nd quarter of 2020 down from 27000000 last year free cash flow was a strong 162000000 in the quarter up 37 as compared to 118000000 in the prior year in the quarter we paid 22000000 in dividends for a total of 184000000 returned through dividends and share repurchases in the 1st six months of 2020 at the end of june 2020 we had a strong liquidity available comprising 1100000000 of cash and 1200000000 of committed credit facilities the efforts we made during the 2nd quarter ensured that we have ample liquidity available to invest and grow the company as the economy recovers on slide fourteen i like to talk about the significant actions we took to reduce operating expenses in the 2nd quarter of 2020 our efforts to reduce costs in the quarter were multifaceted all levels and functions of the enterprise contributed to significant compensation savings each part of the organization up to and including the board of directors and executive levels stepped up and helped in these efforts as of today most of our employees are aware of the need to reduce costs and are working hard to achieve this goal next largest area for cost reduction was discretionary commercial spend such as advertising and promotions it was logical to reduce this spend when dental offices were closed and returns could not be realized we also achieved significant savings from reductions in professional services and of course travel expenses all regions recover from their low point in april improved by twenty to forty percentage points by the end of the quarter additionally in june the last week of the month was the worst week of the month we are pleased to note that the positive momentum continues into july with july sales approaching or surpassing 219 levels depending on the region and product groups there are still some gating factors in place including the availability of personal protection equipment new infection prevention protocols reducing office capacity and overlapping regulations all of which impact the shape of the recovery together these factors point to a gradual as opposed to a sudden snapback in demand let me give you more details from a geographical perspective in the us virtually all dental offices are now open and we continue to see signs of improvement with july volume trending better than what we saw in june in europe we also saw july trends improving sequentially with regards to the rest of the world in apca some of the markets turn positive in july with good traction in china and japan and some lingering concerns in australia latin america remains a challenging market as covid nineteen continues to impact our business in brazil and other countries in the region moving forward to the 2nd half of the year as we announced today we are accelerating actions to fund growth and improve our performance as we did in q two we will continue to drive a disciplined resource allocation process that emphasizes return on investment and sustainability of our growth initiatives with that i will now turn the call back to don thanks jorge and moving on to slide seventeen as i mentioned earlier in the call in november 2018 we put a plan in place to accelerate growth improve margins and simplify the organization our results through 2019 the 1st quarter of 2020 show significant progress the execution highlights of our plan include accelerating growth behind new products including prime scan and prime mill as well as other new products in our consumable portfolio the pipeline of future new products has also been enhanced the company has made major investments in critical areas like our digital product portfolios digital commercial capabilities and growth priorities like our shore smile clear liner business denso serosa has implemented a new organizational structure centralizing supply chain and other functions while creating a unified commercial structure there have been major initiatives designed to transform the finance hr and it areas further we have undertaken multiple portfolio shaping activities including the ones announced today the restructuring plan is a multi year initiative as part of that the organization has embraced the need i would like to continue challenging ourselves to go beyond the original plan and deliver better results this work has shown there are significant opportunities in both the near term and longer term moving now to slide eighteen over the last several quarters as jorge mentioned we have exited several underperforming businesses these reduce our costs and complexity while serving to enhance our growth and margins the team continually reviews all our businesses against these criteria i would like to talk about future growth opportunities as well as strategic fit in the area of orthodontics we believe that the clear aligner space is an attractive opportunity for densply sorona shortile now offers a comprehensive digital treatment plan that positions the company well in this rapidly growing market going forward we will focus all our efforts in the orthodontics space on the clear aligner area we believe this offers the opportunity to grow innovate and take advantage of many opportunities as a result we are exiting the traditional orthodontics business which includes brackets bands tubes and wires the traditional orthodontics business is a component of the technology and equipment segment and has had net sales of approximately 132000000 in 2019 likewise in our lab business there is a clear opportunity to focus on this is a place where innovation will be rewarded based on our analysis it is critical to focus all our lab resources in the digital area going forward as such we are announcing plans to exit the analog portion of the laboratory business that manufactures removable dentures and related products this business is a component of the consumable segment and had net sales of approximately $44000000 together the portfolio shaping initiatives and additional actions are expected to result in the closure of several facilities and an incremental reduction of approximately six to seven of the company is workforce by the end of 2021 the ongoing execution of the restructuring will enhance denso is continued efforts to grow revenues expand our margins and simplify the organization in conclusion the covid pandemic will continue to impact our industry and our company for the foreseeable future current trends are +and a reason for optimism but we will need to continue to adapt to the circumstances as they change we believe we have a comprehensive plan for both the short term and longer term to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders further the company has maintained its focus on our priorities around growth margin expansion and simplifying the business our financial strength broad portfolio on global reach position us well to succeed and win in the dental industry it is hard to know what the new normal is or when it will arrive but our internal theme is that teeth do not heal themselves our team is optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and we embrace the current challenges and are confident in our strategy our customers and our team thank you and with that we will take questions thank you and ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time just press start then one to get in the queue to withdraw your question to withdraw your question simply press the pound or hash key please stand by while we compile the q a roster our 1st question is from jeff johnson with bird please go ahead thank you good morning guys can you hear me okay i think i was on mute there yeah we got your job great good morning so donna i think i just want to start with the july comments i really want to understand maybe the message that you want to have out there it sounds like you can make the argument that july was getting back towards flatish year over year levels according to what jorge said but how much of that might be selling that was recovering some selling issues earlier in the quarter or earlier in two q does your selling is it starting to match kind of the sell out at this and again i know you are not guiding but for three q should we think july maybe is not sustainable as you get into august and september as if there is some backlog in it helping in that july number thanks yeah thanks jeff you know look i think jorge said it clearly in the prepared remarks as we were as as we are looking at july there is places that we are seeing good progress in in some cases it is actually exceeding nineteen your specific question about how much of that is you know inventory rebuild you know it is hard to see exactly there is a couple of things we are looking at and you know that is that is one of the reasons we are not being okay let us just go project july into august september and then and later in the 4th quarter the things we are looking at is patient volume and we have seen that as good office capacity we see our capacity is kind of improving our patient tracking is telling us that  you know confidence in the dentist office continues to go up but there is a pocket that is going to be reluctant at least in the us to go back for a little while and what that in our mind means that okay look if we are getting capacity in the in the dentist office back to you know close to normal that is going to take a little bit of time i think we are working through ebola of patients right now and then we have the flu season coming up so there is going to be a lot of work to do in the next few months i think you know from an inventory perspective our dealers and the dentist office ultimately are working through the fact that you know when when the pandemic started i think people hit the brakes pretty hard on stuff that is ordered almost every day and and in our mind that is kind of the consumable space and you can see jeff the difference between our consumable and technology you know the the t and e side and we believe that is a lot to do with okay we do not know how long the office is going to be you know we are going to stop building inventory on the daily stuff and as a result there may be some build back here but look in my summary i was pretty clear on saying hey look we are happy that we saw you know consecutive month to month sequential improvement in overall demand we are seeing that at the retail level we are happy that july has continued that trend and we are happy to see that in you know some cases it was you know we are you know john i think we are actually tracking better than 2019 john understand that is helpful thanks don and just as a follow up you know thinking about 2021 conceptually you know we all know what the ada is saying about high likelihood that dental consumption and and dental industry wide revenues are down relative to 2019 levels i do not think anybody would really argue with that at least looking at things right now but with some of the extra restructuring efforts you are taking now some of the tail winds from the restructuring that we have had that was the right thing to do and i think that will help us in the long run yes so continuing from the past plan you know how how do you think about margins especially next year can they get back to 2019 levels with revenue that at least is approaching 2019 levels next year or is there a lag in kind of the margin recovery relative to how we think about revenues next year thanks collect our interest in sitting there saying hey look we we need to get back on the margin progression i mean you know we have we have been saying since november 2018 how do we grow how do we get our margins improving and they think we have to take organizational steps to do it i think the results here show you that you know we we think we have made some good progress i mean you know basically through the 1st quarter of 2020 we were tracking on a margin basis and you know what we seen obviously is that we have been able to grow well revenue is revenue dependent and you know i mean hey look if revenue is down twenty in 2021 that is obviously going to have an impact on the business we do not think that is going to happen but we are taking specific steps now to sit there and say you know regardless of whether the category is up two or three or down two or three you know up ten down ten we want to be taking steps toward margin accretion and you know as we get out of the traditional ortho business we get out we got out of the analog business we are focusing on our core competencies and we are taking steps to make sure that we are maximizing our revenue opportunities those are all part of the ongoing restructuring designed to help us really take charge of our ability to drive margin accretion going forward and and i am not going to say it is going to be revenue independent but we think we can take steps you know at at a certain revenue base that we are really going to be able to drive margin and and you know we we were very clear  you know i joke with john sweeney occasionally that we we picked our revenue targets to match the years just to make sure that we could always communicate it we have always said 22 and 22 you know  and internally what we are trying to focus on is look we we think 22 is is  as attainable we do not know if it is going to happen exactly on the trajectory based on what we are seeing with  covid and you know is is covid and the knock on effects of that is that a six month issue it is a nine month issue it is a twelve month issue but we want to be marching back toward that target it just may take us a little bit longer to get there thank you thank you and our next question comes from tycos peterson with jpmorgan please go ahead hey are you able to talk about how much of the consumable pressure in the quarter was inventory destocking versus smaller orders and then how much incremental risk is there going forward with distributors around potential additional destocking  it is it hard to give any precise number but as as don just indicated in the case of consumables there is a the the order lead time is very short and so when the pandemic hit customers and and dealers and in general in the in the marketplace there was a a reaction to to manage inventories very very closely and when we look at the data of  retail sales and our sales there there are a lot of indications that show that there was a reduction in inventory levels that we historically or typically carry in in the network so there was an element of that and when that comes back to to typical levels is is hard to to project some of that may be happening as as do not indicate it but i do not think that is something that that is that is our key objective that s how we we make money there will be always small fluctuations in and the network so i think in given the magnitude of the changes that we experience in the 2nd quarter as as a result of lower revenues and ok and then down on the portfolio reshaping i am curious you know the decision to exit ortho i always thought part of the pitch on the clarilinor was you know the ability to go in and do hybrid cases and and you know leverage that you know strong ortho channel as you push push out rob ok and then down on the portfolio reshaping i am curious you know the decision to exit ortho i always thought part of the pitch on the clarilinor was you know the ability to go in and do hybrid cases and and you know leverage that you know strong ortho channel as you push push out so i am curious if you know there is risk of dissonances here and and how you think about that yeah thanks tycho we are we are actually there is a component of the you know the wire bending aspect of of sure smile that we are keeping what when we say how we kind of delineate traditional ortho it is kind of the brackets bands that would go straight up on a orthodontist an orthodontist using orthodontia the the we believe hybrid is meaningful we believe that it is it is a differentiator for short smiles so we were actually keeping those components so that piece of traditional ortho when the piece that actually came with the oral metrics acquisition is going to stay with that and then you know what we are seeing is where we are getting real traction on short smiles tends to be us you know right now focused around our cerec base yeah we kind of made that shift at basically in october of last year and that is part of the the one ds program and we are seeing good traction there so as we look going forward we did not feel that there were going to be dis energies associated with getting out of traditional you know orthodontia treatment among the orthodontist group so you know as we focus on growing in the future you know we tend to think all right how do we take care of how do we take advantage of our digital assets and and how do we really look at expanding in in places that are not necessarily tied to kind of the traditional orthodontist ok and then just lastly any thoughts on just the capital equipment appetite as we think about the back half of the year and then think about you know prime scan and from prime mail can you just talk on to what degree you think there there could be pent up demand and any need on your part to be a little bit more flexible in terms of financing or pricing potentially mike you know it has been interesting tycho even before the pandemic hit we were really beginning to shift to one you know our theory of one visit dentistry i mean you you can get patients in and out with a single unit crown in you know an hour plus so we we had made that shift and it was interesting in in april when everything went down we really shifted to a bunch of digital whether it was dent product demonstrations or you know kind of taking people through what one visit dentistry really means and we got a pretty good reception so what we have seen to date and and you have actually seen the results that there is a now whether it is spread yeah across you know are we going to see treatment centers and and are we going to see imaging not sure but we we feel very good about prime scan and prime mill and the opportunity for dentists who are you know basically going to be dealing with a patient population that may be a little bit hey i do i want to go to the dentist three times in in you know during the pandemic to get a crown fixed or can i get that done one time you know you are we have been talking to a lot of dentists that we have been talking to when we have been seeing a fair amount of success with saying hey look i got to change how i practice and they use the kind of the downtime during the pandemic to think through that so we are  we feel good about where we are from the technology and equipment space in the back half and in a large part it is due to 1st the new products we pushed out but also the change in messaging and how we are pitching these products so ultimately and you know look we are working with our dealer ok thank you thanks tyco thank you and our next question comes from steven valicke with barties please go ahead great thanks hey good morning everybody so a couple quick questions for you you know 1st your comment around july being a fairly flat year over year on a global basis is obviously pretty +and now you do not want to give any specific guidance but just kind of i have been on the street consensus estimates for the 3rd quarter they call for revenues to be down some twenty to 25 year over year so i am just wondering based on what you are seeing in july and you know barring any other major changes in is that in that number that seems like maybe that is too conservative on the revenue outlook as far as where consensus is just curious to get your thoughts around that i think what we are what we are really encouraged by the fact that sequentially the last three months have been very good in terms of the number of offices that are open markets that are good from a volume perspective we still have lingering concerns in places like australia parts of latin america and there are some spots in in europe that are all so still challenging so it is it is very hard to make a judgment with respect to to those numbers i think what we are what we are really encouraged by the fact that sequentially the last three months have been very good in terms of the number of offices that are open markets that are good from a volume perspective we still have lingering concerns in places like australia parts of latin america and there are some spots in in europe that are all so still challenging so it is it is very hard to make a judgment with respect to to those numbers i moving in the right direction but from a planning perspective internally we we are we are trying to we continue to work with scenario planning we we are preparing the company for for a multiple set of  of outcomes in the next  in the next few months and quarters i think is the prudent thing to do so hard hard to tell you if if that number is right or not ok that s helpful but one other quick clarification question on the exiting of the traditional orthodotics and parts of  analog lab business and these businesses that could be monetized through asset sales or are these just full shutdowns and we just give us a little more color around the decision tree on shutdown versus asset sale yes steve you know as we look at it right now we are we are making the announcement to get it done obviously we will look to dispose the assets in the in the way that it is most beneficial to the company if you know there is some asset sales we will certainly look at it if it is a full shutdown you know we we gave you guys the the numbers based on you know the worst case scenario and obviously we are going to work to improve that but but again the process because you know we mentioned in the prepared remarks it is multiple plants in multiple locations you know obviously you start with the works council and and you go through a lot of different things but you know the the numbers we gave you represent you know the base case and and we are going to work hard to improve versus that and there is the opportunity to to do that thanks i appreciate the extra color thanks steve thanks you guys our next question is from michael churney with bank of america please go ahead  good morning and thanks for the questions i want to just dive back into the slide specifically i apologize to keep harping on this but just want to make sure this is as clear as possible yeah jose are you saying that what you said is that what you said is that you are going to be closing your eyes so far in july on a total dollar basis across the book is similar to 2019 is there any way specifically to to think about how that is factoring into the us in particular in terms of the the the quantity of dollar basis versus some other growth rates where there might be some countries that did not have any meaningful covid spikes that could be growing clarion faster clip yeah  michael thanks for the question we will we will so trying to digest all the july numbers there is a lot of  a lot of data to look at from a product perspective from a geography perspective as i as i indicated before july definitely trended better than june so that that is very good but it is it depends on the region it depends on the on the geography and at this  on and on the products at this point i can not give you a breakdown there is some some analytics that we we still need to do overall the the total portfolio is is getting closer to nineteen numbers and in some instances it did better than than 2019 and and that is definitely a substantial improvement versus versus june and then just one more question and and with and with siric and and everything and as you think about where you compete you know every aligner seems to have its own specific angle on what makes it better where do you think that sharer smile will shake out is what makes it better or the best or what x ray can offer us differentiate the name with everyone else yeah thanks michael i would say that it is our system  look between omnime and prime scan you know we think we have got a pretty good installed base we we have a very loyal user group there that is looking to practice at the highest level of their license so when we can add something that is integrated and seamless like short smile into into the package and particularly you know when we came out with short smile sevensix it s it s really seamlessly integrated into you know our base digital assets it it becomes really easy to use and you know we feel with sevensix you know we re now able to compete across the broad broad portfolio get class one class two class three we we think that our treatment planning software is 2nd to none we we feel it s really really competitive and you know we re very comfortable with the clinical results we re seeing and as we go into  you know kind of our install base we feel very good about that right now and look every single day we get better and better at beginning to think about densply saronna not as as individual product companies where we are sitting there saying hey we are going to go sell you an omnim we are going to go sell you a prime and then zero by the way maybe next week somebody will come in with sure smile no it is it is really we have begun to focus much more on how do we focus on the customer as as one company and and as part of that we really are going in and saying hey look how how do you think about using these digital assets to you know make life easier around doing orthodontics with with clear aligners how do you really think about implants differently and and again we are we are working hard to actually bring this idea that that we are the dental solutions company to reality does that answer your question sir yes i am in las vegas no i am still here thanks thanks for the call thank you and our next question is from jason and bentner with fipersender please go ahead i wondered on the orthodonic business i mean you have you have mentioned here a few times leveraging the sarah install base with clearliners i think this makes a ton of sense but i mean should we interpret your sarah comments to be that you are you are going to be emphasizing shar smile primarily in that gp channel or do you have a strategy to continue to target the orthodonic channel that does not have that same sarah owner base we are seeing is again we want to play to our strengths and we we do have a large installed base and when we do programs like one ds where you know we are we are obviously trying to package you know work flows together in such a way that there is real benefit to the dentist we are seeing more success there so look we will continue to pitch  short smile across both the orthodontic orthodontic as well as the gp channel we think we have got more innate advantages in the in the gp channel right now that is helpful okay and then i want to ask actually a new product question here partially related to the prior question so and i appreciate it is policy here not to discuss new products before they are officially launched but instead of talking specifically to the recently improved large field of view imaging system or maybe any three d printing plans you might have prime print maybe you could talk to what you see in the in the market from an opportunity or demand perspective for each of those categories each of the large field of view imaging and also in office thanks on you know wide field of view we are filling a gap in our portfolio that you know we took us a little while to get there but we feel very good about that right now and if you look at what we have done with you know our orthofos  s l and our l line and now wide field of view we we feel that we are very competitive in the imaging space and you know now in terms of what do we think about the macro demand for imaging equipment again you know if you look over the last six months and and again the pandemic really started you know at the end of the 1st quarter and we have seen regions begin to recover you know we have seen good solid demand across the board in technology and equipment and you know it is when you start looking at things like wide field of view it is really not necessarily about you know i am just replacing my x ray machinery it is it is what procedures do i want to do and you know wide field of view and and particularly particularly so start looking at two d and three d kind of imaging products it lets you do more procedures it lets you do better implants it lets you do better endo it lets you do better orthodontics so you know we we think that demand you know is it going to gyrate a little bit as we recover from the pandemic it it could but you know we have seen demand remain pretty solid on there and in in terms of of printing you know we we have not really discussed that and you know look our one of the challenges in this space you know versus other med device spaces where you can really put your pipeline out you know we we tend to play things pretty close to the best what what i would tell you is that our new product portfolio work has been one of you know we kept saying in the prepared remarks you know and we stayed focused on our key strategic initiatives well one of those is new products and you know what we have been working on internally is how do we take the the five to ten most important products whether that is in the endo implant or in the technology equipment and keep making progress on it and and we you know we are not backing off on what we think our launch schedule is on some of those major launches and you know again we think a position as well as as people come out of the pandemic alright thanks very much jason thanks jason thank you our next question is from elizabeth anderson with evercore please go ahead hi good morning guys i was wondering if we could talk about the revenue guidance for the year is that something that you guys are still working on if you could help us put some numbers around the the new ortho strategy can you talk about the vault you know maybe some comments about how you sell volumes trend within orthodontics and then also if anything you can talk about in terms of the size of the revenue base and or and or growth rates would be helpful just in terms of framing that opportunity on a go forward basis thank you we do not give the clear line or number specifically what i would tell you is that what we have seen over the last year is accelerating growth behind short sail and and we have seen actually very positive trends even coming out of the pandemic so that is one of the reasons we feel very comfortable about that decision look we we feel that densplace run has an opportunity to become a solid number two in the space and we are going to work toward that so you yeah can do some math around that look ultimately you know we have we have been pretty consistent on saying we want to grow and we want to do margin accretion so the steps we are taking around getting out of the traditional ortho business and really focusing on clear liners helps us do that so you know our our bet and belief is that the clear liner space is is going to be a significant contributor to our aggregate growth rate over time ok perfect that is helpful and then you know given obviously you guys but pretty substantial liquidity position right now how do you see that playing out if you sort of assume that you know hopefully we are through the worst of covid and things continue to improve from here we were encouraged actually by a number of shareholders to to be in that position which we totally agree with at this point we want to keep doing what we are doing being very prudent with our balance sheet being very diligent with our cash flow you probably noticed in the in the 2nd quarter we had a very strong operating cash flow very good free cash flow and all our parts of our deployment will you know are are not changing for now we paid paid our dividends and we have no plans to change the dividend at this time once things go back to a more normal level we will reassess where we are at that point we will look at all of the demands for capital opportunities that we have at that time and we will make out what are the decisions we think are in the best interest of our shareholders as we deploy that capital but for now i think the the focus is on on the recovery so is how  to ensure that we have a very stable financial position how we are able to fund a strategic initiative some of which  don has talked about that we want to make sure that even in a low revenue environment and low profitability environment we we keep funding those initiatives and and that is one of the reasons we have that that that capital we we want to keep investing in the organic growth of the company for the time being okay thank you very much thank you and our next question is from steve bussell with wolf research please go ahead i think the market for you know what the business might look like over the next several months in the event that we you know we get the virus under control and then i have a follow up on strategy after that yeah thanks steve yeah conditions in germany are if you were going to go around the world are pretty good you know and again i think jorge said it well it depends on the business and you know and as there have been different reactions to different different businesses and and we kind of look at doc together which is you know germany switzerland and and austria but but conditions there if that is a harbinger of the future would would tell you that you know things do get closer to normal i mean there is obviously you know again the same things we see over here that we keep tracking is what is office capacity you know around the new infection protocols and again that keeps getting better you know you know better in july than they were in june just as as the dentist and their staff get more used to that and then patient attitudes it is interesting the the patient tracking that we did in germany showed that you know from a patient perspective there was less change in germany than there was in the us around the pandemic so there seems to be a little bit more of a stable attitude toward visiting the dentist office so you know ultimately if if things look like germany he points to the fact that things do get back to normal much appreciated and then don i wanted to borrow from your experience a little bit if i could you are  you are a medtech guy and you came into dental with a different perspective on you know what the industry could be and you know how businesses could run and covid has certainly changed some of that thinking i wonder as you you keep your medtech hat on and you think about what you want the business to be what do you think about that how has your thinking evolved in terms of you know what you want the business to be what you think the practice looks like i know you have a focus on digital you know that was there before can you just give us a sense for maybe what you might have learned in the last few months and how your thinking has evolved thank you on that future strategic vision thank you steve you know i think what covid has done is brought into sharper focus what i think the industry is going to need to be in you know whether it gets there in two years three years five years i think it is going to accelerate a couple of trends i mean the 1st is that you know i think dsos are are going to pick up but i think if you look at in europe in the u s and even in places in asia pacific where the pandemic exposed you know some of the offices are are kind of right on the margin and the dentists may feel it is better to practice in a larger group so i think there you may see a shift that way i think the 2nd big thing is you know the the idea of when you say digital i push digital pretty hard and in my mind what what i think whether it is the dsos or the individual dentists are going to be doing is they are really going to be evaluating their practice more critically and i think covid brought that into sharp focus that hey look i have got forty hours to see patients how am i allocating time against procedures and and how am i thinking about you know what procedures can i do and what procedures do i really want to develop within the practice and i am going to i am going to address that i think from the equipment and where i emphasize you know our training and and whatnot so you know i think what we have seen with clear aligners is something that is going to go into the rest of dentistry you know when you think about implants when you think about even basic endodontic work i think the increased digitization of diagnostics and and how that can help dentist practice at the highest level of their licenses is is it is going to accelerate i would i would say steve i do not think anything is dramatically changed strategically what i think it is you know and and you read all the books and you know after major disruptions and dislocations you tend to see new trends go i i think what might have taken a decade because dental tends to be a little bit slower than what what we saw in medtech i think it is going to accelerate pretty dramatically alright thanks steve stay safe thank you and our next question is from john kreger with william blair please go ahead hi thanks very much don curious could you give us an update on your integration efforts i am sure covid has impacted them a little bit but you had a pretty long list across commercial manufacturing and r d just kind of give us a sense of where that stands and to what degree the pandemic has impacted it john you know 1st thanks for the question you know when i would say when we outline things in november of eighteen you know we kind of said it was a three year program i would say that and particularly with the announcements we made this morning around traditional ortho and analog lab it kind of points to the fact that we are pushing a little bit faster and we are pushing harder i think the i think that is accelerated our our thinking and you know look when you when you see the revenue challenges in the 2nd quarter it it also highlights you know some of the things that we need to get after even faster so that is kind of what i would tell you i it is really interesting internally we keep trying to tell people hey look it is not as if we are going to get the restructuring done and then that is it you know we are not changing ever again so i have been trying to and the organization to understand that this is a marathon and and you know the restructuring might have have been only the 1st ten k of that  so and look i i would tell you in terms of the plan we laid out we are we are more than halfway done but i would also tell you you know it is great as i brought a new team with people like jorge we have got a terrific supply chain leader we have actually now got all the commercial people reporting into one person walter peterson we are finding more and more and more that we think that we can improve on that that should have you know really deliver the promise of what densiplex sorona should be so you know look specifically hey you know if you thought it was a three year restructuring you know we are we are slightly ahead of where we thought we would be i would just tell you that we are committed our management team is committed to as soon as we get done that restructuring we are we are not stopping we are how do we continuously improve so how did it do in the 2nd quarter and are you rethinking that lineup at all yeah look we we think we have we have started to actually get our new products where we need to get them you know obviously we have talked about our immediate load astravest product and and i think that is the 1st of what you will see a pretty  regular set of introductions over the next eighteen months in our in our implant space that are going to really let us be competitive the other thing that we have been doing with implants that you know does not get a lot of highlights is we have been working on our long term implant portfolio and that has been really successful for us as well is you know we have a  a business and mias that we had bought a couple years back which lets us play a little bit more aggressively in the value segment and as as we have been rethinking how we approach  our commercial go to market strategy across all of denspaaron and including on implants being able to integrate that and expand that beyond the base of of what they used to operate in when we bought them is has been beneficial there so yeah we feel that implants remains a significant growth opportunity for us i would our next question is from john block with telford please go ahead that is a treveron for john thanks so i think you mentioned earlier that your patient tracking is saying that patient confidence has been continuing to go up recently i am wondering if there is any detail you can give there on just like how that is shaking out geographically and if there is a read through to you know potentially some of your july comments you know through that confidence level yes sure thanks travis a couple things i mean 1st we are we are doing patient tracking across the entire globe and and again we have we have seen consistent improvement around you know people likely to visit the dentist and and we measure it likely to visit in the in the you know the next thirty days the next quarter and whatnot so we have been seeing consistent improvement across the board there interestingly there is a kind of a subgroup people who have been to the dentist have had really positive experiences around how people you know whether it is you know adjusting waiting room or you know how they are addressing infection protocols so we see that group is pretty +eleven of the things we were trying to watch as they were kind of the flare ups in the u s and in in particular geographies whether there was going to be a drop off in in patient confidence and we did not see that so you know look i and and by the way while most of the patient data is good there is some reluctance on you know kind of a a segment of the population to say you know am i going to go back in the next month versus do i intend to go back to the dentist in the next six months so you know there is  there is a little bit of a lag there that that we see particularly in the us but we do not see it elsewhere around the world so patient patient tracking has been actually a good lead indicator and and again we are we are seeing we are seeing some good positive things there yeah i thank you and then just one more on dsos and we have been hearing that dsos in larger practice groups are tending to perform better in this environment and we are wondering if you know that is what you have been seeing and if you think that you know some of the smaller more fragmented practitioners could start to play catch up as well to to be honest we have not seen a huge differentiation between the the dsos and and the individual practices you know the thing that that we love about this market is that you know whether there is 600000 dentists around the world and and they are independent business owners and there is a lot of them are very very successful so i look do i think on the margin if if somebody was considering retiring in a year or two and and covid hit do they sit there and say now maybe it is the time that i accelerate that yeah you might see a little bit of that but you know we have not seen a  sharp change in the number of dental practices that we are doing business with and you know we think that  we we have not seen a drop off in the aggregate number of dental practices in key regions post covid so when we when we are watching you know when we say things are eighty open ninety open 99 we have not seen the the number of practices that we are measuring that against change great thank you so much thanks charley thank you and with that we conclude our q and a session for today i would like to turn the call back to john swiney for his final remarks thank you very much everybody we look forward to updating you as we move through the rest of the year have a good day thank you ladies and gentlemen for participating in today s program and you may now disconnect and have a great day",

and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today as we go over our results for the 3rd quarter of 2020 providing update of our strategic outlook and give some additional caller on our operations the new home company made significant progress and a series of strategic initiatives and generated a profit in the 3rd quarter of 2020 we experienced healthy expansion to our home building gross margin while continuing to emphasize overhead cost containment thanks to several operational improvements and a very strong housing rebound we generated 251 net new orders in the quarter we are presenting a 102 increase as compared to last year namely as a result over 75 improvement in our sales pace which came in at threefive homes per community per month order activity improved as the quarter progressed and we have seen demand trends stay above normal seasonal level since the quarter ended the new home market is benefiting from several positive factors including record low interest rates the scarcity of existing homes inventory and a noticeable shift in attitudes towards home ownership some of the shift can be attributed to the ongoing pandemic which has made many americans rethink how and where they live given all the ways the virus is impacting our lives but an equally important factor driving the move to home ownership has been the emergence of the millennial age cohort as a buyer demographic this sizeable age group was slow to enter the housing market relative to earlier generations due to a number of factors but we are now seeing millennials make up an increasingly large share of the buyer population this demographic shift was occurring well before the pandemic started and we believe it will be a driving force for our industry well after the pandemic ends while the positive fundamental backdrop for our industry has been a nice tailwind for our business we believe our strong order activity this quarter was also the result of our expansion to more affordable price points over the last few years we have been transitioning much of our portfolio away from high asp communities and into the more affordable segments to the market the goal is to take our premium brand experience that is centered around industry leading customer service best class quality and innovative design and make it more accessible through efficient floor plans and higher density projects this focus has served us well in the recent quarters and dovetails nicely with millennial demographic trends i just mentioned order activity at our newly opened affordable communities has outpaced our legacy higher price communities by a wide margin and we are seeing better prices and margin trends at these lower priced communities as well this pricing power has been a key ingredient in making headway with one of our main initiatives for the year gross margin expansion over the past several quarters our margins have been depressed due to our focus on generating cash curing up the balance sheet and turning through higher price legacy communities now that we are in a much better position from both the financial and products standpoint we have an opportunity to show real improvement on the gross margin front we posted a 320 basis point year over year increase to our home building gross margin in the 3rd quarter excluding impairments in the prior year and we feel we can push margins higher over time through steady price increases better product mix and cost containment while this margin projection will fluctuate depending on the mix of posts we believe the long term trajectory is headed in the right direction with a healthy demand outlook a great product profile rising margins and a much improved balance sheet the new home company is in a great position to end the year on a strong note and carry that momentum into the new year with that i would like to turn the call over to leonard who will provide more detail on our operations thanks larry and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today we experienced the wide spread acceleration demand in the 3rd quarter driven by low mortgage rates limited existing home supply a desire from buyers to move to less densely populated areas and the surge in millennial buyers that larry mentioned the demand was broad based both from a price and geographic standpoint which allowed us to push pricing at nearly all of our communities during the quarter traffic conversion rates are at all time highs as buyers feel a sense of urgency to move forward with a purchase decision given the lack of available supply and low interest rates as a result our homes in backlogging increased at 329 which represented a 59 year over year improvement to end the quarter looking ahead we expect order activity to remain above normal seasonal trends in the near term but our focus is shifted slightly given the size of our backlog and our desire to increase margins we want to make sure our sales do not get too far out in front of our stocks while also maximizing the profits from each new home sale to that end we have delayed some sales releases in an effort to align our sales with construction starts and implement additional price increases while this may moderate our sales pace from the levels we have experienced recently we believe this is a prudent way to manage our backlog and improve our margins in terms of cost lumbers recently hit am all time high driven by diminished capacities terrorists uncertainty of covid on workers in the mills and a rapid increase in sales in starts fortunately we have started to see lumber pricing come down from its highs and hope this trend continues outside of lumber our material costs have remained relatively flat with respect to our markets arizona continues to be the standout performer for us averaging four one sales per community per month this strong absorption was driven by seven new communities we have recently opened over the past five months which have also generated gross margins meaningfully higher than the company average our mirror posed a mini master plan consisting of three product segments opened the last week of september and sold eighteen homes during the quarter while the mosaic master plan continues to experience solid sales as well we will deliver our 1st homes from our affordably priced communities in arizona in the 4th quarter and we expect these communities to contribute significantly to the company is profit in 2021 arizona still remains our most challenged market when it comes to labor and sub trade availability and we have seen that lengthening of our cycle times by a few weeks as a result we are working hard to overcome these issues and believe arizona will be a key contributor to our company is success moving forward the market dynamics in california as a whole feel the best that they have been during the current housing cycle order paces continue to run at high levels and we are seeing cycle times stay relatively consistent in southern california our communities averaged a sales pace of three one per month during the quarter demand was particularly strong in the core areas of the inland empire where we can offer our premium brand experience at lower price points we have targeted this region as a key component of our expansion to do more affordable products and we anticipate opening five affordably priced communities within the inland empire over the next eighteen months in northern california our communities average threesix sales per month for the quarter with strength across the board affordability remains an issue for most buyers in the court bay area and we have limited our exposure to this market as we have nearly closed out our remaining community in milpitas we continue to see a migration from the bay area into the more affordable areas in and around sacramento our four communities in vacaville california have benefited significantly from this migration as our monthly sales absorption pace was fourfour homes per community during this 2023rd quarter as we continue to make changes to improve our profitability we believe there is potential in our fee building business and are currently sourcing new opportunities during the 3rd quarter we started construction on a model complex at atlas our fee building community for five point at the great park in irvine and expect to open for sales in early 2021 this arrangement is different than most of the traditional fee building arrangements we have had in the past as the new home company will also brand market and sell these homes we are currently in discussions with other land owners to build four cell housing and single family rental housing on a fee bases these future opportunities will help partially offset a near term reduction in fee building revenues resulting from irvine pacific is decision to manage the construction of their home building operations on their own and face out our fee building arrangement with them as a result we expect our fee building revenues to decline over the next year and then increase in 2022 as newer opportunities start generating fee revenue and profits we are excited for these new opportunities and believe they can generate meaningful income in the future using nominal capital in summary we continue to benefit from extremely strong housing fundamentals in all of our markets and our recently opened communities have been well received we are working hard to take advantage of the demand strength we are seeing with targeted pricing increases in an effort to improve our profitability we did good strides on this front in 3rd quarter and expect to make further progress in the future now i would like to it over to john for more detail on our financial results this quarter thank you leonard and good morning for the 2023rd quarter we generated pretax income of $1500000 compared to $4800000 pretax loss in the year ago period the 20193rd quarter included a total of 3600000 of inventory impairment charges and a $1500000 loss on on a land sale in the prior year 3rd quarter net income for the quarter was $1200000 for ¢six per diluted shares compared to a net loss 4600000 for ¢23 per diluted share in the prior year period our home sales revenue for the 3rd quarter was 117400000 compared to 118eight in the prior year period the slight decrease compared to the prior year was attributable to a 22 decrease in average selling price to $748 zero resulting from our continued expansion into lower price points which was partially offset by a 27 increase in deliveries we estimate 2024th quarter home sales revenue to be between 115 and $125000000 and our average selling price for the 4th quarter to be approximately $720 zero our gross margin for the 2023rd quarter was fourteentwo versus ninefive in the prior year period and exceeded the top end of our previously issued guidance the 20193rd quarter gross margin excluding impairments of $1700000 was eleven the 320 bases point improvement in gross margin excluding the prior year impairments was primarily due to a product mix shift to a more affordable product which generally have higher gross margins and to a lesser extent fewer deliveries from lower margin move up condominium communities compared to the 20193rd quarter these positive factors were partially offset by a sixty bases point increase in capitalized interest included in cost of sales due to the mix of homes delivered during the quarter excluding interest in cost of sales and impairments our adjusted gross margin from home sales was twenty as compared to sixteentwo in the year ago period for the 2024th quarter we estimated our gross margin to be between thirteeneight and fourteentwo price sg a rate as a percentage of home sales revenue for the 3rd quarter was twelvethree versus eleven one in the year ago period the higher sg a rate in 2020 was primarily the result of higher commissions incentive compensation and professional fees hence to a lesser extent a $300 reduction in g a expenses allocated to fee building cost of sales for the 2024th quarter we estimate our sg a rate to be between twelvefour and twelveeight the higher projected sg a rate relative to q three is partially the result of a lower anticipated allocation of g a expenses to the fee business due to lower anticipated fee revenue in q four due to the irvine pacific going down we opened four new communities in arizona during the quarter and ended the quarter with 25 active communities which was a fourteen increase compared to the prior year 3rd quarter we have one new community that opened in october and expect to sellout of approximately three communities before the end of the year fee building revenue for the 2023rd quarter was 13400000 compared to 22300000 in the prior year period fee building gross margin for the 2023rd quarter was 268000 compared to 647000 in the prior year period the reduction in fee building gross margin was primarily due to lower fee building activity in irvine california for the 2024th quarter we estimate our fee building revenue to be between five and $8000000 we continue to wind down our joint ventures during the quarter we finalized the sale of our interest in the bedford land development joint venture and delivered the final homes at our mckinley village home building joint venture in sacramento california of the company is three remaining joint ventures we have seven homes remaining to deliver at the mount shadow is home building joint venture in arizona three home sites to sell at our davis land development joint venture in northern california and we continually to actively pursue an exist from the russell ranch land development joint venture in folsom california during the 3rd quarter we generated $40000000 in operating cash flow and reduced our net debt to capital ratio to 45 one a 980 bases point improvement compared to the year ago period and the lowest level since december 2017 we ended the quarter with $126000000 in cash and cash equivalents and had no borrowing outstanding under our $60000000 revolving credit facility we also repurchased $5200000 in principle of our senior note due 20202 at a discount we further strengthened our balance sheet by extending our debt maturity profile subsequent to the quarter end in october we issued $250000000 of new seven and a quarter percent senior notes due october 2025 to refinance our existing senior notes due april 2022 in connection with this refinance we estimated one time pretax charge of approximately $8000000 to be recorded in the 4th quarter we also entered into a new $60000000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility on october 30th that has a maturity date of april 30th 2023 a onefive year extension from the previous bank credit facility the extension of these debt maturities will allow us to make long term investments as we replenish our land portfolio and position the company for long term success lastly we spent $14000000 on land and land deposits during the quarter we plan on increasing our land spend in the near future but remain focused on maintaining a proper balance between building liquidity managing leverage and rebuilding our land pipeline i will now turn the call back to larry for his concluding remarks thanks john we have been working hard as a company to make progress on a number fronts this year and our results for the 3rd quarter demonstrate that we have made significant headway we improved our profitability by expanding our gross margins and further diversified our operations by continuing to close out legacy high priced communities and open more affordable faster selling communities we also strengthened our balance sheet by generating strong cash flow from operations reducing our net leverage and extending our debt maturity profile these achievements have put us on more stable footing and give us a clear path to better results in the future i want to thank all of our team members for how they have performed during these difficult times handling the significant increase in business we have experienced would be challenging enough during normal times let alone in the middle of a pandemic and i am really appreciative of your efforts that concludes our prepared remarks and now we would be happy to take your questions thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using computer equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key our 1st question comes from the line of alan ratner who is office please proceed with your question hey guys good morning congrats on all the progress during the quarter and the strong results 1st question maybe you would start off on the pricing side larry or leonard so sounds like you guys have had some success pushing price in in the quarter and obviously the longer term margin goal is is is certainly i think looking a lot stronger now given the pricing environment but i am curious if you could maybe just talk a little bit and quantify maybe the a level of pice increases you guys have pushed through in the last couple of months and and i am curious if you have seen any push back to any of those price increases at this point i guess here early november assuming some of those price increases have been more recent leonard why do not you thanks alan why do not you take it leonard thanks larry thanks alan and good morning yeah i would say across the quarter you know we continued to push pricing at all of our communities we literally raised prices at 100 of our communities and on average the average price increase was a little over four you know there is kinda communities 2nd home communities at the lower end and then at the higher end are really some of our suburban communities we have continued to price it our purchase prices all through the quarter and really we have not seen the resistance yet as of today and continue to look for every opportunity we can to grow margins that is great to hear 2nd question you know you mentioned and this is a similar message we have heard from other builders just about the need to you know kinda slow things down a little bit and not get backlogs too far extended and i think that makes a lot of sense although for you guys you are in a little bit of a different situation in that you you know you are growing off of an admittedly fairly you know small level of activity so i was a little bit surprised that you know you would not be in a position where you can kind of let things run a bit hotter here and i am curious if you could talk a little bit maybe rank order the constraints that you are seeing that would prevent you from letting that go hotter for a longer period in time in terms of your absorption rate is it is it a land issue i know your lot count has been trending you know quite a bit lower in the more recent quarters or is it more difficulty sourcing labor you know perhaps you know the scale benefits that some of the larger builders have is that working as a disadvantage to you guys in tryna get labor in this tight environment right now yeah it is leonard again try the latter of the two is driving it more or less alan like in a perfect world you would sell one home per week and sell four homes per month and really that what our trade partners are set up for and we have kind of prepared them for that they have made the commitment to deliver that so you know we just want to make sure again our sold and unstarted backlog does not get too far out for us especially in an environment of rising prices we know that future land prices land is going to cost more in the future and so really its the capacity of our trade partners so we continue to measure that we have gone a little bit lighter on sales releases for that reason and we think that is the best course of action and leonard if i could add i really just think it is varies by market and also by newer housing program or older housing program so it is not just a a one size fits all leonard and john have worked pretty carefully at trying to analyze where we have opportunities and where and where there is more challenges and in some cases you know our goal is to build out of older projects and get through it but in other cases if we are not going to be able to start a house for two or three months it does not make any sense that we put it up for sale in a market that continues to be strong is and you know i actually think we are being very logical and we are attempting to maximize the profits and if you look at the communities we have opened in the last twelve months you would see a significant increase in both absorption and margin and and this we are hoping that we are going to be able to keep that the absorption steady and the margins improving there is non reason why we should not be able to great man i appreciate that extra collar there larry and if i could just sneak in one more here you kind of brought up the land market a little bit you know what are you seeing right now because you know now the debt refinancing is behind you guys you obviously have a little bit more runway and disability from the balance sheet perspective so i would imagine you know you are kind of stepping on the gas a little bit here on the land side of things and at the same time i would imagine you know your competitors are as well given how strong the selling environment has been so what what is the viability of you know some of those quick return deals that you could kinda put your pen and paper to and potentially get on the ground here over the next twelve or eighteen months well it is it is okay larry let me just start leonard and then you jump through you know land in the markets we are in has always been challenging always and one of the strengths of our organization has been that we have land relationships that go back over thirty years whether with master developers or with individuals and it is tougher now but we are we are continuing to find opportunities and there is no reason why we will not be able to you know grow the business over the next two to three years but one thing you have to be aware of and our investors i hope they all understand is that when california is your strongest market place it takes a couple years to from when you buy a piece of ground to when you are closing houses and we have been planning that and we understand that that is the situation we are in but do not lose track at if anything when the market is particularly tough or difficult because of a lot of competition relationships matter more than ever and that is one thing that we have and we always had and we always will have and with that leonard please keep going yeah i think you hit most of the points larry i would say alan we are certainly back in the market and we are kinda book handing this we are looking for opportunities that we can basically get control of that we can open our model homes in twelve eighteen months and because of somewhat limited capital we are looking for opportunities to fill our 23 24 pipeline and those to profile those deals would look quite differently the land come market is completely is really competitive right now as you would expect we have had some success tying up some interesting opportunities and i would say arizona is the most competitive land environment today and so that is probably our biggest challenge is to identify asses that makes sense there is positions available but we want to make sure they make sense and that we can deliver on those returns i would add one other thing to your prior question real quick when you kind of talked about sales pace and running it a little bit harder i would say even with the steps that we have taken and you know we just closed the month of october october was a really strong month even with those measures it is the 3rd strongest sales month in the company is history where your sales were up 65 and we averaged average absorption of threefive and that is even counting closed out communities where we have two three four homes left to sell that kind of weighs that down a little bit so again it is still an extremely strong market and we are kind of really excited about future and what it can mean for the company great thanks a lot guys and that sounds promising and good luck thanks thanks alan thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen as a reminder if you would like to join the question queue please press star one on your telephone keypad our next question comes from alex with housing research center please proceed with your question morning guys great job thanks alex thanks alex thanks alex i was curious you have mentioned here starting to do some fee work for five point do you have any sense of timing you can share with us when those 1st deliveries of revenues well i guess it is more you book earning right when construction happens so can you kind of help give us an idea on how to model that sure this is good morning alex this is leonard yeah so i am sure you are aware it is a slightly different fee structure than say what we have done with the irvine company in the past and so in this case we take on all of the normal builder responsibilities and the communities will be branded under the new home name we sell and market the homes construct them and then take the backend service as well so the community will open during the 1st quarter an open for sale so that is when you know we will go to sell and then within the next two to three months we should see 1st closings so the way the fee structure works is we get a portion of the fee through the life of the project and then we get a backend portion of the fee at the close to the home so you know even today we would be recognized you know a small amount of fee but the significant fee would start coming in probably the end of q one or late q two we are also really excited i think it was noted in the release that over the last six months we have been approached on several different fronts from for some pretty exciting fee opportunities including single family rental business where we are talking to folks in arizona and we have a really exciting opportunity here in california to build up to thirteen 1400 homes so we think it can drive a significant part of our business help us grow earnings while not having to put any form of significant capital in the business okay great and then on the joint venture side another since there is very few lots left is that basically winding down or will you will that stay alive i guess in future years hey alex this is john stevens yeah we are sort of winding down the joint venture business we have got like i said on the call only few lots in our davis cannery project in northern california we have about i think seven homes left to deliver out of our mount shadow is community and really the remaining lots are at or folsom ranch deal up in northern california called russell ranch and we are in the process of existing that partnership right now and i would say in the near term we really do not have any plans to enter into any new joint ventures at this time but it was possible if the right opportunity came along that would entertain that but for now that part of the business is really winding down okay great and then if i could just ask one more on the new debt you guys just raised is the plan to pay off the 2022 short term or both are already yeah it is already done yeah we effectuated that last week we closed on the new bonds i believe it was on the 28th of october and all the the previous 22 notes have been extinguished and so that is done and then we used some of our cash on hand to pay off the balance because we raised 250000000 in new notes and we had about roughly 292000000 of principle on the old notes so okay great i will get back in the queue good job sure thanks alex thank you our next question comes from line of jason with a private investor please proceed with your question thank you for taking my question guys and congratulations on the strong quarter my question will only just kind of pertain to the priorities for capital deployment going forward you mentioned how you successfully leveraged the balance sheet and extended all maturities and the outlook for the business seems exceptionally strong when you guys are significantly generating cash flow but with just stock trading at half of book value well basically half a tangible book value it is hard to really imagine there is a better use the cash right now or the part where you use the cash right now then plowing back into the stock so really what are your thoughts around potential share repurchasing and really how can we focus and think about priorities with capital deployment going forward that is a good question jason thank you yeah you know we have we have looked at all aspects of use of our capital and we have been very focused as you have mentioned on really deleveraging the business and refinancing our bonds and pushing out the revolver extension which was a was a big important thing that we we would completed on friday so it really puts us in a position now where we can reinvest in the business you know obviously we did buy quite a few shares in the front half of the year when we saw the stock price depress very significantly and i agree with you that trading at half half of multiple book value is not where we would like to be but on the on the other hand we do need to reinvest in our business a little bit and we will evaluate really all aspects and where to allocate the capital going forward we do have a little bit left on our authorization from our board i think there is about 1700000 left authorized currently but again we have been on pause on the land act side for for a little bit now and we will sort of layer some of that in going forward again we do need to sort of balance our capital location and it is a fair question but we we do need to reinvest in the business too so we will continue to evaluate on all funds moving forward john do you also want to address the idea of where we are with leverage where we came from and where you see us moving to the future yeah i mean i think our net debt did come down significantly at 45 one at the end of the quarter you know its down almost 1000 bases points from where we were a year ago we will as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we will have a charge in the refinancing of the the old bonds which will come through in q four but moving forward we are probably running the company with the idea of between 45 and fifty on a net debt to cap bases moving forward any other questions not from me thank you and congratulations again and good luck thank you thanks jason thank you our next question is a follow up from the line alex from housing research center please proceed with your question yeah thanks for taking my follow up so i noticed in arizona you guys managed to open several communities this quarter just wondering if there is anymore in the pipeline going into next year or is this roughly going to be the community through through next year yeah alex this is leonard you you are right you know the last five months we have opened seven communities in three different locations and obviously we are very excited about the early results where we are seeing strong absorption and strong margins so again we are really excited about our team there on the ground we have one community slated to open in the 1st half of next year and that is you know at this point we have other things that we are currently working on but that is primarily the one that we can talk about today yeah and it looks like we we are we are at eight communities now in the q three i think one of them probably drops off in q four and then we will probably run like seven community range plus or minus for the year right depending on how quickly we sell through some of these communities that is what we are expected for the bulk of next year but it may tapper a little bit of q four of next year until we reload the two communities we are working on now okay great and then as far as gross margins i think you gave us a range for next year i mean for next quarter which is a little bit downwards from this quarter is that mainly because of the impact of lumber or is there something else there it it really has to do with some of the close up communities we have on the luxury condominium side the good news is we are selling three of those the down side is that the margins are a little bit weaker in those communities with on our higher average selling price alex so i think once those all get disposed of and delivered in q four i think our margins look positive moving forward and again i think thirteen eight to fourteen two we felt pretty good about that but again part of it is going to be what of those higher price lower margin communities sort of deliver and close out in q 4s is primarily the impact for the margin okay awesome thanks best of luck for next year thanks thanks alex thanks alex thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question an answer session i will turn the floor back to mister webb for any final comments thanks very much as as all of you could see we have really made significant progress over the last three months and when and and of course part of it is because of the improved housing market but a part of it has been in the woks for a long time based on our strategic planning and i wanted to commend commend leonard and john because they have really done a terrific job we really believe the future is bright for the new home company and we are extremely excited about the next two years as we move forward so with that i want to thank all of you and stay tuned because again there is there is a light at the end of the tunnel thank you thank you this

periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission additionally non gap financial measures may be discussed on this conference call reconciliation of these non gap financial measures to the most recent annual report on form ten k and in its quarterly reports on form ten q good morning everyone joining us on the call today as we go over our results for the 3rd quarter of 2020 hello this is the new home company and we wanted to give you a strategic outlook and give you some additional color on our operations the new home company made significant progress on a series of strategic initiatives and generated a profit in the 3rd quarter of 2020 we experienced healthy expansion to our homebuilding gross margin while continuing to emphasize overhead cost containment thanks to several operational improvements and a very strong housing rebound 251 net new orders in the quarter representing a 102 increase as compared to last year mainly as a result of a 75 improvement in our sales pace which came in at threefive homes per community per month order activity improved as the quarter progressed and we have seen demand trend stay above normal seasonal levels since the quarter ended the new home market is benefiting from several positive factors including record low interest rates the scarcity of existing home inventory and a noticeable shift in attitudes towards home ownership some of this shift can be attributed to the ongoing pandemic which has made many americans rethink how and where they live given all the ways the virus is impacting our lives but an equally important factor driving the move is the desire for more space and flexibility in their living arrangements the emergence of the millennial age cohort as a buyer demographic has been significant this sizeable age group was slower to enter the housing market relative to earlier generations due to a number of factors but we are now seeing millennials make up an increasingly large share of the buyer population this demographic shift was occurring well before the pandemic started and we believe it will be a driving force for our industry well after the pandemic ends while the positive fundamental backdrop for our industry has been a nice tailwind for our business we believe our strong order activity this quarter was also the result of our expansion to more affordable price points over the last few years we have been transitioning much of our portfolio away from high asp communities and into the more affordable segment of the market the goal was to take our premium brand experience that is centered around industry leading customer service best in class quality and innovative design and make it more accessible through efficient floor plans and higher density projects this focus has served us well in recent quarters and dovetails nicely with the millennial demographic trends i just mentioned order activity at our newly opened store this pricing power has been a key ingredient in making headway with one of our main initiatives for the year gross margin expansion over the past several quarters our margins have been depressed due to our focus on generating cash shoring up the balance sheet and turning through higher price legacy communities now that we are in a much better position from both a financial and product standpoint we have an opportunity to show real improvement on the gross margin front we posted a 320 basis point year over year increase to our homebuilding gross margin in the 3rd quarter excluding impairments in the prior year and we feel we can push margins we believe that steady price increases better product mix and cost containment will higher over time through steady price increases better product mix and cost containment while this margin progression will fluctuate depending on the mix of products we believe the long term trajectory is headed in the right direction with a healthy demand outlook a great product profile rising margins and a much improved balance sheet the new home company is in a great position to end the year on a strong note thanks larry and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today we experienced a widespread acceleration demand in the 3rd quarter driven by low mortgage rates limited existing home supply and a desire from buyers to move to less densely populated areas the demand was broad based both from a price and geographic standpoint which allowed us to push pricing at nearly all of our communities during the quarter traffic conversion rates are at all time highs as buyers feel a sense of urgency to move forward with a purchase decision given the lack of available supply and low interest rates as a result our homes in backlog increased to 329 which represented a 59 year over year improvement in the quarter looking ahead we expect order activity to remain above normal seasonal trends in the near term but our focus has shifted slightly given the size of our backlog and our desire to increase margins we want to make sure our sales do not get too far out to that end we have delayed some sales releases in an effort to align our sales with construction starts and implement additional price increases while this we moderate our sales pace from the levels we have experienced recently we believe this is a prudent way to manage our backlog and improve our margins in terms of costs we have taken steps to reduce costs and increase efficiency in our operations however recently hit an all time high driven by diminished capacities tariffs uncertainty of covid on workers in the mills and a rapid increase in sales and starts fortunately we have started to see lumber pricing come down from its highs and hope this trend continues outside of lumber our material costs have remained relatively flat with respect to our markets arizona continues to be the standout performer for us averaging four one sales per community per month this strong absorption was driven by seven new communities we have recently opened over the past five months which have also generated gross margins meaningfully higher than the company average our maraposa mini master plan consisting of three product segments opened the last week of september and sold eighteen homes during the quarter while our mosaic mini master plan is ongoing we continue to experience solid sales as well we will deliver our 1st homes from our affordably priced communities in arizona in the 4th quarter and we expect these communities to contribute significantly to the company is profit in 2021 arizona still remains our most challenged market when it comes to labor and sub trade availability and we have seen a lengthening of our cycle times by a few weeks as a result we are working hard to overcome these issues and believe arizona will be a key contributor to our company is success moving forward the market dynamics in california as a whole feel the best that they have been during the current housing cycle order pace continues to run at high levels and we are seeing cycle times stay relatively consistent in southern california our communities average a sales pace of three point demand was particularly strong in the core areas of the inland empire where we can offer our premium brand experience at lower price points we have targeted this region as a key component of our expansion into more affordable product and we anticipate opening five affordably priced communities within the inland empire over the next eighteen months in northern california our communities average 3000 square feet sales per month for the quarter with strength across the board affordability remains an issue for most buyers in the core bay area and we have limited our exposure to this market as we have nearly closed out at our remaining community in milpitas we continue to see a migration from the bay area into the more affordable areas in and around sacramento our four communities in backaveille california have benefited significantly from this migration as our monthly sales absorption pace was fourfour homes per community during the 2023rd quarter as we continue to make changes to improve our profitability we believe there is potential in our fee building business and are currently sourcing new opportunities during the 3rd quarter we started construction on the model complex at atlas our fee building community for fivefive point at the great this arrangement is different than most of the traditional fee building arrangements we have had in the past as the new home company will also brand market and sell these homes we are currently in discussions with other land owners to build four cell housing and single family rental housing on a fee basis these future opportunities will help partially fund the construction of these homes we expect a near term reduction in fee building revenues resulting from irvin pacific is decision to manage their construction of their homebuilding operations on their own and phase out our fee building arrangement with them as a result we expect our fee building revenues to decline over the next year and then increase in 2022 as new opportunities start generating fee revenue and profits we are excited for these new opportunities we believe that opportunities can generate meaningful income in the future using nominal capital in summary we continue to benefit from extremely strong housing fundamentals in all of our markets and our recently opened communities have been well received we are working hard to take advantage of the demand strength we are seeing with targeted price increases in an effort to improve our profitability we made good strides on this front and 3rd quarter now i would like to turn it over to john for more detail on our financial results this quarter thank you leonard and good morning for the 2023rd quarter we generated pre tax income of $1500000 compared to $4800000 pre tax loss in the year ago period the 20193rd quarter included a total of 3600000 of inventory impairment charges $1500000 loss on land sale in the prior year 3rd quarter net income for the quarter was $1200000 or ¢six per diluted share compared to a net loss of $4600000 or ¢23 per diluted share in the prior year period our home sales revenue for the 3rd quarter was 117400000 compared to 118800000 in the prior year period we estimate 2024 quarter home sales revenue to be between 115 and $125000000 and our average selling price for the 4th quarter is $272 our gross margin for the 2023rd quarter was fourteentwo versus ninefive in the prior year period and exceeded the top end of our previously issued guidance the 20193rd quarter gross margin excluding impairments of $1700000 was eleven the 320 basis point improvement in gross margin excluding the prior year impairments was primarily due to the improvement in our cost structure to a product mix shift to more affordable products which generally have higher gross margins and to a lesser extent fewer deliveries from lower margin move up condominium communities compared to the 20193rd quarter these positive factors were partially offset by a sixty basis point increase in capitalized interest included in cost of sales due to the mix of homes delivered during the quarter excluding interest and cost of sales earnings per diluted share increased by ¢three our adjusted gross margin from home sales was twenty as compared to sixteentwo in the year ago period for the 2024th quarter we estimate our gross margin to be between thirteeneight and fourteentwo our sgna rate as a percentage of home sales revenue for the 3rd quarter was twelvethree versus eleven one in the year ago period the higher sgna rate is expected to continue the 2024th quarter we estimate our sgna rate to be between twelvefour and twelveeight the higher projected sgna rate relative to q three is partially the result of a lower anticipated sga we have one new community that opened in october and expect to sell out of approximately three communities before the end of the year fee building revenue for the 2023rd quarter was 13400000 compared to 22300000 in the prior year period fee building gross margin for the 2023rd quarter was 268000 compared to 647000 in the prior year period the reduction in fee building gross margin was primarily due to lower fee building activity in irvine california for the 2024th quarter we estimate our fee building revenue to be approximately $4000000 during the quarter we finalized the sale of our interest in the bedford land development joint venture and delivered the final homes at our mckinney village homebuilding joint venture in sacramento california of the company is three remaining active joint ventures we have seven homes remaining to deliver at the mountain shadows homebuilding joint venture in arizona three home sites to sell are our david is development joint venture in arizona during the 3rd quarter we generated $40000000 in operating cash flow and reduced our net debt to capital ratio to 45 one a 980 basis point improvement compared to the year ago period and the lowest level since december 2017 we also repurchased $5200000 in principle of our senior notes due 2022 at a discount we further strengthened our balance sheet by extending our debt maturity profile subsequent to the quarter end in october we issued $250000000 of new seven and a quarter percent senior notes due october 2002 to refinance our existing senior notes due april 2005 to refinance our existing senior notes due april

to refinance our existing senior notes due april 200 the extension of these debt maturities will allow us to make long term investments as we replenish our land portfolio and position the company for long term success lastly we spent $14000000 on land and land deposits during the quarter we plan on increasing our land spend in the near future but remain focused on maintaining a proper balance between building liquidity managing leverage and rebuilding our land portfolio now i will turn the call back to larry for his concluding remarks thanks john we have been working hard as a company to make progress on a number of fronts this year and our results for the 3rd quarter demonstrate that we have made significant headway we improved our profitability by expanding our gross margins and further diversified our operations by continuing to close out legacy high price communities and open more affordable communities thank you we also strengthen their balance sheet by generating strong cash flow from operations reducing our net leverage and extending our debt maturity profile these achievements have put us on more stable footing and give us a clear path to better results in the future i want to thank all of our team members for how they performed during these difficult times thank you for calling the meeting i would like to begin by expressing my gratitude for all of your efforts during this challenging time an increase in business revenue would be challenging enough during normal times let alone in the middle of a pandemic and i am really appreciative of your efforts that concludes our prepared remarks and now we would be happy to take your questions if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will sound thank you you may press r two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants you may need to pick up your headset before pressing the r two key our 1st question comes from the line of alan ratner with zelman and associates please proceed with your question so it sounds like you guys have had some success pushing price in in the quarter and obviously the  the longer term margin goal is is  you know certainly i think looking a lot stronger now given the pricing environment but i am curious if you could maybe just talk a little bit and and quantify maybe the  the level of price increases you guys have pushed through in the last couple of months and and i am curious if you have seen any pushback to any of those price increases at this point i guess here in early november assuming some of those are happening thanks aaron thanks eileen thanks larry thanks eileen good morning yeah i would say across the quarter you know we continued to push pricing at all of our communities we literally raised prices at a 100 of our communities and on average the average price increase was a little over four you know there is kind of age quality we have continued to price it push those prices all through the quarter and really we have not seen the resistance yet as of today and continue to look for every opportunity we can to grow margins that is great to hear 2nd question you know you mentioned and this is a similar message we have heard from other builders just about the need to you know kind of slow things down a little bit not get backlogs too far extended and i think that makes a lot of sense although you know for you guys you are in a little bit of a different situation in that you are you know you are growing off of an admittedly fairly you know small level of activity so i was a little bit surprised that you know you would not be in a position where you could kind of let things run a bit hotter here and i am curious if you could talk a little bit maybe rank order the constraints that you are seeing that would prevent you from from letting that go go hotter for a longer period of time yeah it is better again what i try the ladder of the two is driving it more or less alan like in a perfect world you would sell one home so you know we just want to make sure again that our sold and unstarted backlog does not get too far out front especially in an environment of rising prices we know that future land prices are going to cost more in the future and so really it is the capacity of our trade partners so we continue to measure that and i think that is the best course of action and we think that is the best course of action and then if i could add i really do think it it varies by market and also by a newer housing program or older housing program so it is not just though a one size fits all and we have worked pretty carefully at trying to analyze where we have opportunities and where we do not and and where there is more challenges and in some cases  you know our goal is to build out of older projects and get through it but in other cases if we are not going to be able to start a house for two or three months it does not make any sense that to put it up for sale in a market that continues to be strong it is and so  you know i i actually think we are being very logical and where our attempt is i think that what we are trying to do is to maximize the profits and if you look at the communities we have opened in the last twelve months you would see a significant increase in both absorption and margin and this is what we are hoping that we are going to be able to keep that the absorption steady and the margins improving there is no reason why we should not be able to do that the sneak in one more here you kind of brought up the land market a little bit you know what are you seeing right now because you know now that the the debt refinancings are behind you guys you obviously have a little bit more runway and and visibility from the balance sheet perspective so i would imagine you know you are you are kind of stepping on the gas a little bit here on the land side of things and at the same time i would imagine you know your competitors are as well given how strong the selling environment has been so what is the availability of you know some of those quicker turn deals that you could kind of put together paper to and and potentially get on the ground here over the next twelve or eighteen months well it is that it is go ahead larry well let me just start leonard then you jump through you know landon the markets we are in has always been challenging always and one of the strengths of our organization has been that we have land relationships that go back over thirty years whether with master developers or not and it is tougher now but we are continuing to find opportunities and  there is no reason why we will not be able to you know grow the business over the next two to three years but one thing you you have to be aware of and our investors i hope they all understand is that when california is your it takes a couple years from when you buy a piece of ground to when you are closing houses and we have been planning that and we understand that that is the situation we are in but do not lose track of it if anything when the market is particularly tough or difficult because of a lot of competition relationships matter more than ever and that is one thing i think you hit most of the points larry i would say allen we are certainly back in the market and we are kind of bookending this we are looking for opportunities that we can basically get control of that we can open a model home within twelve to eighteen months and then because of somewhat limited capital we are looking for opportunities that can be funded through partnerships there are opportunities to fill our 2324 pipeline and the profile of those deals would look quite differently that land can market is completely is really competitive right now as you would expect we have had some success tying up some interesting opportunities and i would say arizona is the most competitive land environment today and so that is probably our biggest challenge is to identify assets that make sense there is there is positions available we want to make sure they make sense and then we can deliver on those returns i would add one other thing to your prior question real quick when you talked about kind of sales pace and running it a little bit hotter i will say even with the steps that we have taken and you know we just closed the month of october october was a really strong month even with those measures it is the 3rd strongest strongest sales month in the company is history where our sales are up 65 and we averaged average absorption of threefive and that is even counting closed out communities where we have two to 34 homes left to sell that kind of weights that down a little bit so again it is still an extremely strong market and we are kind of really excited about the future and what it can mean for the company great thanks a lot as always and sounds promising and good luck thanks thanks alan thank you please press star one on your telephone keypad our next question comes from the line of alex berritt with housing research center please proceed with your question i think we want to probably you get your book earnings right when construction happens so can you kind of help and give us an idea of how to model that build and market the homes construct them and then take the back end service as well so the community will open during the 1st quarter and open for sales so that is when you know we will go to sales and then within the next two to three months we should see 1st closing so the way the fee structure works is we get a portion of the fee through the life of the project and then we get a back end portion of the fee at the close of the home so you know even today we would be recognized as very you know a small amount of but the significant fee would start coming in probably the end of q one early q two we are also really excited i think it was noted in the release that over the last six months we have been approached on several different fronts from it for some pretty exciting fee opportunities including the single family rental business where we are talking to folks in arizona and we have a really exciting opportunity here in california to build up to 131400 homes so alexis john stevens we think it can drive a significant part of our business help us grow earnings while not having to put any form of significant capital into the business okay great and then on the joint venture side i notice there is very few lots left is that basically winding down or will you will that stay alive i guess in future years on the joint venture business we have got like i said on the call only a few lots left in our davis cannery project in northern california we have about i think seven homes left to deliver out at our mountain shadows community and then really the the remaining lots are at our folsom ranch deal up in northern california called russell ranch and we are in the process of exiting that partnership right now and i would say in the near term we really do not have any plans to enter into ok great and then on the effective ask one more on the new debt that you guys just raised is the plan to pay off the 2022 short term or closer you know so yeah it is already done and they can do yeah we effectuated that last week we closed yeah we effectuated that last week we closed all the the previous 22 notes have been extinguished and so that is done and then we use some of the cash some of our cash on hand to pay off the balance because we raised 250000000 in new notes and we had about roughly 292000000 of principal in the old notes so okay great i will get back into the queue good job sure thanks yeah thank you our next question comes from the line of jason seintuch a private investor please proceed with your question but with your stock trading at half a book value or basically half a tangible book value it is hard to really imagine there is a better use of cash right now or partly use of cash right now than buying back your own stock so really what are your thoughts around potential shareholder purchases and really how can we focus and think about priorities for capital deployment going forward and very focused as you mentioned on really deleveraging the business and refinancing our bonds and pushing out the revolver extension which was  was a big important thing that we we completed on friday so it really puts us in a position now where we can reinvest in the business you know obviously we we did buy quite a few shares in the front half of the year when we saw its stock price depressed very significantly and and i agree with you at trading at half half of multiple book value is not where we would like to be but on the on the other hand we do need to reinvest in our business a little bit and we will evaluate really all aspects and where to allocate the capital going forward we do have a little bit left on our authorization from our board i think it was about 1700000 left authorized currently but again we have been on pause on the land act side for for a little bit now and and we will sort of layer some of that in going forward again we do need to sort of balance our capital allocation and it is a fair question but we do need to reinvest in the business too so we will continue to evaluate on all fronts moving forward john do you also want to address the new idea of where we are with leverage where we came from and where you see us moving to the future i am going to go through some of the numbers at the end of the quarter you know it is down almost a 1000 basis points from where we were a year ago we will as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we will have a charge from the refinancing of the old bonds which will come through in q four but moving forward we are probably running the company with the idea of between 45 and fifty on a net debt to cap basis moving forward thanks for taking my follow up so i noticed in arizona you guys managed to open several communities this quarter i am just wondering if there is anymore in the pipeline going into next year or is this it we are going to be the community count through next year yeah alex this is leonard you are right you know over the last five months we have opened seven communities in three different locations and obviously we are very excited about the early results where we are seeing strong absorption and strong margins so again we are really excited about our team there on the ground we have one community count depending on how quickly we sell through some of these communities we will probably run that seven community range plus or minus for the year that is what we are expecting for the for the bulk of next year but it may taper a little bit in q four of next year until we reload a few communities that are working on now okay great and then as far as gross margins i think you gave us a range for for next year i mean for next quarter which is a little bit down versus this quarter is that mainly because of the impact of lumber is there something else there it really has to do with some of the close up communities we have on the luxury condominium side where the good news is we are selling through those the downside is that the margins are a little bit weaker in those communities and with on a higher average selling price alex so i think once those all get disposed of and delivered in q four i think our margins look positive moving forward and again i think 138 to 142 we feel pretty good about that but again part of it is going to be what of those higher priced lower margin communities sort of deliver and close out in q four is primarily the impact for for the margin over the last three months when and of course part of it is because of the improved housing market but a part of it has been in the works for a long time based on our strategic planning and i wanted to commend leonard and john because they have really done a terrific job we really believe the future is bright for the new home company and we are extremely excited so with that i want to thank all of you and stay tuned because again there is there is a light at the end of the tunnel thank you this concludes today is conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation a

extremely pleased with our 3rd quarter performance our teams executed at an exceptional level to achieve strong results despite the challenges created by covid i am both proud and grateful for their efforts the investments we put towards leveraging data analytics to inform our strategies around product e commerce and marketing continued to pay dividends in driving growth in new customers and strong retention rates we have also made great strides in driving improved profitability to that end in addition to once again generating double digit growth in our global e commerce business we delivered 52 adjusted ebitda growth in the 3rd quarter this performance underscores the momentum behind the lands end brand and the progress we are making in delivering long term profitable growth additionally the launch of lands end into kohls com and 150 kohl is stores at the end of september is off to a strong start based on the early success we plan to expand the lands end assortment and increase the number of points of distribution from 150 kohl is stores to 300 in 2021 also during the 3rd quarter as previously announced we completed the refinancing of our term debt further improving our liquidity position which jim will speak to shortly turning to some brief highlights of our financial results 3rd quarter total revenue grew approximately six driven by our global e commerce sales which were up approximately twenty ahead of our expectation for low double digit growth for this business we grew adjusted ebitda 52 to approximately $29000000 and expanded adjusted ebitda margin by approximately 240 basis points to sevennine we continue to lean into our strong heritage as an american lifestyle brand that offers comfort quality great value and a customer 1st approach to service at the same time we remain focused on advancing our digitally led strategies we further demonstrated our ability to consistently get the product right as we leverage data analytics to inform our key item strategy and maintain a high quality value oriented offering for the 3rd quarter our strongest performers were sleepwear lounge wear and knits fleece also performed well reflecting demand for transitional outerwear for the fall season home furnishings particularly bed and bath remains an area of strength as people spend more time at home we will maintain our emphasis on comfort and value as consumers continue to work from home and spend more hours indoors during the cold weather months turning now to marketing we remain focused on utilizing data analytics and search engine optimization programs to attract new customers while simultaneously leveraging data to drive greater personalization with existing customers we also continue to successfully leverage ai to analyze customer behavior and further refine our promotions to optimize sales and achieve higher margins our let us get comfy messaging continued to resonate with consumers and it will remain front and center through the holiday season our strong product offering combined with our focus on employing a data driven approach drove continued market share gains with approximately 55 growth in new customers we are very pleased with the high percentage of re buy rates we continue to see in our core customer base as well as with our newer customers this retention is highly encouraging and we still see ample market share opportunity ahead of us as a unit channel operator we remain committed to delivering a consistent high quality seamless customer experience across all channels to enhance our customer connection wherever whenever and however they choose to shop during the quarter we launched apple pay and mobile check out with very positive early reads on both we also expanded our data driven approach to our catalogs and catalog circulation through utilizing data on existing customers we optimized products per page and fine tuned our circulation as a result response rate grew approximately twelve on a slight decline in circulation driving higher rois in our catalogs i am very proud of our team as they worked to maximize effi efficiency as evident in these results and the lands end brand and catalog is now stronger than ever looking ahead we are confident that the investments we have been making in our infrastructure and foundation throughout the past few years position us well to drive further market share gains in the evolving retail landscape i will speak more to these longer term strategies following jim is remarks with that i will turn it over to jim thank you jerome and good morning our global e commerce business once again delivered strong performance in the 3rd quarter while as expected our outfitter business remained challenged as a result of the pandemic we continue to make great progress on the strategies we have outlined while leveraging our strong foundation to advance our growth initiatives total revenue increased fivenine to $360000000 compared to $340000000 last year momentum continued in our global e commerce business which increased twenty with strong results in our us e commerce business which grew approximately fourteen and our international e commerce business with a 51 increase for the quarter during the quarter we saw strength in a number of our categories including fleece sleepwear lounge wear and knits as well as in our home business with many consumers still working from home these categories delivered double digit growth in the quarter as our marketing strategies emphasized the comfort and value in our product assortment partially offsetting the strong global e commerce growth sales in our outfitter business were down 26 due to ongoing pressure as a result of covid nineteen the outfitters results reflect overall sequential improvement versus last quarter although our travel related national accounts and our small and mid size businesses remain challenged the most significant improvement came in our school uniform business where sales were approximately flat to last year for the quarter overall we expect performance in this business to remain choppy with the recent spike in the pandemic moving to our retail business sales decreased approximately 44 in the 3rd quarter to $8000000 this decrease was driven by lower traffic due to the pandemic partially offset by improved conversion in our stores gross margin in the 3rd quarter increased approximately ten basis points to 45four as compared to last year gross margin benefited from our improved promotional strategies and continued use of analytics this was partially offset by higher shipping costs and surcharges as well as sales mix from our growing 3rd party business as a percentage of sales sg a improved by approximately 230 basis points to 37five compared to 39eight in the 3rd quarter of last year this improvement is a result of increased sales combined with continued disciplined expense management across our entire business income tax expense was 2800000 compared to an expense of 1300000 last year net income for the quarter was 7200000 or ¢22 per share compared to net income of 3600000 or ¢eleven per share last year in addition to these gaap measures adjusted ebitda is an important profitability measure that we use to manage our business internally for the quarter adjusted ebitda was 28600000 which is approximately a 52 increase versus last year adjusted ebitda of 18800000 turning to the balance sheet inventories at the end of the quarter were 499800000 roughly flat to a year ago the strong sell through of our global e commerce business has positioned us with healthy and lean inventories as we head into the holiday season inventory levels related to our outfitter business are elevated although this is not seasonal or fashion product so we expect to work through this merchandise as the business environment improves during the 3rd quarter we secured a new term loan of $275000000 the loan proceeds combined with borrowings under the company is abl facility were used to refinance our prior term loan which was due in april of 2021 upon the closing of the refinancing maximum availabil availability under the abl facility was expanded by 75000000 to 275000000 the new term loan extends our debt duration and further enhances our strong liquidity position with a more flexible balance sheet turning to our outlook for the 4th quarter we now expect net revenue to be between 500 and 520000000 driven by our global e commerce business as a reminder last year is results included approximately 40000000 from our american airlines launch after adjusting for the american airlines launch expected net revenue for the quarter would be between a two decrease and a two increase versus prior year we expect net income of thirteenfive to 17500000 and diluted earnings per share to be between 41 and ¢53 we expect adjust ebitda to be in the range of 38 to 43000000 and with that i will d i will turn the call back over to jerome to discuss the progress on our core growth strategies thanks jim despite the continued uncertainty related to covid we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage our business effectively and deliver meaningful ebitda growth during a very difficult environment we remain focused on driving market share gains through continuously enhancing our engagement with existing customers and gaining market share through our own channel as well as through new partnerships and collaborations our four core growth strategies remain getting the product right being a digitally driven company implementing a uni channel distribution strategy and enhancing our infrastructure and processes as previously mentioned we are very pleased with the response to our product offering in the quarter as we head into the holiday season it will be an important time for gift giving our key item strategy will focus on sleepwear outerwear and home within these categories since holiday is an important time for family we plan to emphasize whole house family messaging specifically with regards to patterns our let us get comfy theme highly relevant in today is environment will remain the focus of our messaging within digital we continue to see incredible opportunity to drive traffic and market share as we refine our search engine optimization techniques our holiday promotional and mark down strategy will continue to leverage data analytics and machine learning to effectively determine optimal prices for our customers as a result we expect lower mark downs and higher product margin rates than previous years despite the highly promotional environment and incremental shipping expenses as we advance our data analytics capabilities from quarter to quarter we will continue to gain further knowledge of customer behavior trends turning to our retail business we continue to monitor retail trends to evaluate a post pandemic store strategy however with the current rise in cases of covid nineteen our priority right now is the health and safety of our associates and customers turning to our more recent growth initiatives beyond our own channels we are very pleased to see the strong response to lands end brand on both kohls com and in the 150 launch stores the product is resonating with customers and we will be expanding our assortment within these doors and kohls com in addition we plan to double our door count with kohl is to 300 in 2021 we remain confident that this is a great opportunity to expand our reach given the kohl is customer profile shares the same demographic features as the lands end customer in our outfitters business our long term strategy is to focus on our personalization capabilities which we believe will attract new customers as well as serve the needs of existing customers we plan to implement enhancements to our business outfitters site to leverage some of the improvements we have implemented on our consumer website while we are in the early stages we believe this will support longer term growth in our outfitters business with regard to the lands end marketplace we now have 133rd party vendors selling product on our website and we are seeing initial results in line with our expectations our goal was to reach twenty to 253rd party vendors selling product by year end before i turn it over to q a i would like to update you on our initiatives around diversity and inclusion within our organization as this remains of significant importance to us as an organization 1st we have established a diversity and inclusion council consisting of members of our organization who come from diverse backgrounds and will work to create programming and goals for our company to work towards to that end the council has established both training modules and a speaker series that are respectively required of and open to all of our employees we have also established business resource groups to provide support for our employees with shared experiences we want all of our employees to feel they have a voice and the support they need to utilize it our journey has just begun but we are committed to learning and improving every day in conclusion we are incredibly energized by the strong momentum in our business we recognize the uncertainty in the environment and it may extend for a period of time creating both challenges and opportunities and we will manage our business accordingly the strong foundation we put in place and the progress we continue to make on our strategic initiatives give us great confidence in our ability to navigate the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities as we drive growth in our business we look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters and with that we will open it up to questions thank you as a reminder to ask a question you will need to press star then one on your telephone to withdraw your question please press the pound key our 1st question comes from the line of alex furman with greg your line is now open great thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong quarter you know wanted to ask about what you have been seeing so far it sounds like the the unseasonably warm weather has had you know had a little bit of an impact on your outerwear business anything to call out you know now that we are just on the other side of of thanksgiving weekend about you know how how your brand performed during during black friday and through cyber monday any anything notable to to call out there hey alex thanks for the question i think like everybody else we are seeing a a shift in consumer behavior this holiday season with obviously an emphasis on online shopping black friday itself was a positive day for us both domestically and internationally we saw solid growth in our business year over year and we are pretty encouraged by the continued re resilience and performance of our global e commerce business but then the 4th quarter got off to a slower start in the us particularly due to our heavy outerwear category i do not like to bring up weather i always think weather is kind of a cheap excuse but i think as everybody knows cold weather has not really started yet and if you couple that with people staying home and indoors and not commuting because of covid the demand for heavy outerwear just is not there yet but w if you look at our other categories as you would expect our other categories are performing well same categories in 3rd quarter going into the 4th quarter that people have had good demand for great that that is really helpful thanks and then you know it sounds like you you guys are acquiring a lot of new customers here or at least did in the in the 3rd quarter where has that been coming from has there been any you know particular marketing channel that that has been effective or or or new products that have been bringing new customers in or has that just been kind of a continuation of of of the efforts that you have been putting in place for a while now it is a bit of a mix i mean zero obviously search has always been you know the the lion is share of where we have new customers coming in from a marketing standpoint but what we have seen is that a couple of other areas are performing super well for us even though we put smaller dollars into it social media has been doing really well and we have got some video out on connected tv which seems to be doing a pretty good job for us couple that with you know big increases in knitwear lounge wear active wear which is bringing in a lot lot of newer customers for us and those customers tend to be on the younger side from where our existing customer base is so that looks pretty good for us great that that is helpful and then you know lastly if i could just ask you know on on the outfitter side of the business i mean obviously that that is pretty you know closely impacted by by the pandemic just curious you know you work with a lot of the biggest companies out there in in retail and transportation i mean w what what is the outlook for next year i mean at what point do you think things are going to start turning around for for some of your big customers i think that what you are going to see is a longer claw back in any of the travel related products anybody that is really related to travel right now they are seeing increases albeit small increases i think where we are really going to be concentrating in the outfitters business is going to be on the small and mid size businesses and making their customer experience easier we think that there is a big opportunity for us to improve the customer experience online of getting your product logo would or getting your product customized in multiple ways and and making that an easier an easier customer experience and th we are going to see a lot of concentration in that part of the business you know alex i i think you touched on on that as far as the outfitters it is really three different businesses if you remember it is about 13rd school 13rd small and mid size business and 13rd the large national accounts so jerome mentioned that the large national accounts is probably going to be the slowest recovery w we are very excited to see the the sequential improvement that we mentioned in the school business and that business was actually fairly flat for the quarter that is great well tha thanks very much both of you thank you our next question comes from the line of steve murada with cl king and associates your line is now open good morning jerome and jim congratulations on the 3rd quarter as well as far as jerome you just touched on it as it relates to staying at home for outerwear assuming we get a relatively normal winter season from this moment forward could there still be a negative impact on that category just because people are not going out as much and if so how do you quantify that i think steve from what we put out with guidance we have taken that into account for what we think will be happening over the course of the next the next few months you know as you know the cold weather is really in front of us not behind us based upon the date so far so i think we have taken that into account in the in the guidance i understand yeah i think as far as a quantification steve to jerome is point it is in the guidance i think the other thing we feel really good about and we mentioned this because we had such a healthy back end of the 2nd quarter and the 3rd quarter our inventory positions are are so healthy so lean that even though we we we might have a little bit of challenge in some of the heavy outerwear you know we we do not think there is a lasting impact there gotcha and can you comment international commerce was up really really well can you comment on the tactic that helped that what is that as a percent of sales right now and how can you capitalize on that segment of the business going forward i i think a lot of the things that are working there internationally are a lot of the things that that that you hear us doing on the us side so so many of those things we have been doing for the last several quarters there from what we have been doing from the digital perspective from what we have been doing from the dal data la analytics perspective from what we have been doing with capturing new cus customers we are now rolling many of those things out especially in europe and and we have really seen significant positive impacts there and how big a percent of sales was that in the 3rd quarter i i do not think we give that as a specific number but but i think you can go back to history and and do some of the math obviously it continues to grow the overall glo global e commerce business is now probably up over eighty as a percent of our total with some of the challenges in the outfitter business and that continued growth in on the e commerce side gotcha okay very helpful thank you i will take the rest of my questions offline thank you thanks steve thank you there are no further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference call

marketplace we now have thirteen retail locations good morning everyone this is the weekly call to discuss the progress of our 3rd party vendor program on our website and initial results in line with our expectations our goal is to reach twenty to 253rd party vendors selling product by the end of the year before i turn it over to q a i would like to update you on our initiatives around diversity and inclusion within our organization as this remains of significant importance to us as an organization 1st we have established a diversity and inclusion council consisting of members of our organization who come from diverse backgrounds we will work to create programming and goals for our company to work towards to that end the council has established both training modules and the speaker series that are respectively required of and open to all of our employees we have also established business resource groups to provide support for our employees with shared experiences we want all of our employees to feel that they have a voice and the support they need to utilize it our journey has just begun but we are committed to learning and improving every day we are incredibly energized by the strong momentum in our business we recognize the uncertainty in the environment and it may extend for a period of time creating both challenges and opportunities and we will manage our business accordingly the strong foundation we put in place and the progress we continue to make on our strategic initiatives give us great confidence in our ability to navigate the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities as we drive growth in our business we look forward to updating you on our progress and future quarters and with that that is all as a reminder to ask a question you will need to press start then one on your telephone to withdraw your question please press the pound key our 1st question comes from the line of alex furman with craig halum your line is not open great thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong quarter i wanted to ask about what you have been seeing so far it sounds like the the unseasonably warm weather has has you know had a little bit of an impact on your outerwear business anything to call out you know now that we are just on the other side of of thanksgiving weekend about you know how how your brand performed during during black friday and through cyber monday any anything notable to to call out there hey alex thanks for the question i think like everybody else we are seeing a shift in consumer behavior this holiday season i think the 4th quarter got off to a slower start in the us particularly due to our heavy auto parts category i do not like to bring up weather i always think weather is kind of a cheap excuse but i think as everybody knows that is really helpful thanks and then yeah it sounds like you guys are acquiring a lot of new customers here or at least did in the in the 3rd quarter where has that been coming from it is a bit of a mix i mean obviously search has always been you know the the line shared where we have new customers coming in from a marketing standpoint but what we have seen is that a couple of other areas are performing super well for us even though we put smaller dollars into social media has been doing really well and so we are looking at those as well i got some video out on connect tv which seems to be doing a pretty good job for us a couple of that you know big increases in knitwear lounge wear activewear which is bringing in a lot of newer customers for us and those customers tend to be on the younger side from where we are adjusting customer basis so that looks pretty good for us great that is helpful and then you know lastly if i could just ask you know on on the outbitter side of the business i mean obviously that is pretty pretty good i think that what you are going to see is a longer call back in any of the travel related products anybody that is really related to travel right now i think we are really going to be concentrating the outerwear business is going to be on the small and mid size businesses and making their customer experience easier we think that there is a big opportunity for us to improve the customer experience online of getting your product logo or getting your product customized in multiple ways and and making that an easier and easier customer experience and we are going to see a lot of that alex i think you touched on on that as far as the out fits are concerned it is really three different businesses if you remember it is about 13rd school 13rd small and mid size business and 13rd large national accounts so jerrod mentioned that the large national accounts is probably going to be the slowest recovery we are very excited to see the sequential improvement that we mentioned in the school business and that business was actually fairly flat for the quarter thank you our next question comes from the line of steve moradat with c l king and associates your line is now open good morning jerone and jim congratulations on the 3rd quarter as well as far as jerone you just touched on it as it relates to staying at home or outerwear assuming we get a relatively normal winter season from this point forward thanks could there still be a negative impact on that category just because people are not going out as much and if so how do you quantify that i think steve from what we put out with guidance we have taken that into account for what we think will be happening over the course of the next few months yeah i actually know the cold weather is really in front of us not behind us based upon the date so far so i think we have taken that into account in the guidance yeah i think as far as a quantification steve to durum is point it is in the guidance i think the other thing we feel really good about and we mentioned this because we had such a healthy back end of the 2nd quarter and the 3rd quarter our inventory positions are so healthy so lean that even though we we might have a little bit of challenges in some of the heavy outerwear where you know we we do not think there is a lasting impact there gotcha do you comment on international commerce was up really really well can you comment on the tactics that helped that what is that hi i am calling from the sales department can you tell me about your current sales right now and how you can capitalize on that segment of the business going forward we have been doing with capturing new customers we are now rolling many of those things out especially in europe and and we have really seen significant positive impacts there and how big of a percent of sales was that in the 3rd quarter i do not think we give that as a specific number but but i think you could go back to history and and do some of the math obviously continues to grow the overall global e commerce business is now probably up over eighty as a percent of our total with some of the challenges you know for their business and that continued growth and under e commerce  very helpful thank you take the rest of my questions offline thank you thanks steve thank you there are no further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect",

            "reference": "token good morning this is craig moore with autonomous thanks for joining us this morning for our 5th annual future of commerce symposium sorry for the brief delay in getting started i just wanted to mention a few housekeeping items before we get started you can use the same dialing or web link for the entire day there will be a few breaks but for many of the sessions we will just move right into the next the next discussion you can submit questions to us via email to myself or you can also use bloomberg iv to find us with questions or you can use the q a box within your zoom window so with with no further ado let us get started we are lucky to have with us this morning american express doug buckminster group head global consumer services it is great to see you again doug i wish it was in person i wish it was in carnegie hall but maybe next year how are you exactly it is great great to see you too craig thanks for having me yeah you bet so love the background love the image but let me while we get started with just you know a a a broad question which is you know can you update us on the state of consumer and overall spending at this point in the recovery yeah you know i i think as we have talked about before we saw the trough in april and we have seen a rebound since then you know i would characterize the trend since mid july as relatively stable on the non tnt side so outside of tnt relatively stable little bouncing around due to days mix timing of holidays like labor day in particular and slow very steady growth but but slow growth on the tnt side right so i i would say stable would be the the adjective that captures that dust okay at this point i assume could we perhaps characterize this a little go a little deeper on this ex tnt if you were to characterize the overall volumes you are seeing ex tnt ex corporate card you know really are consumers getting back toward positive territory within credit card portfolios at this point yeah i mean i think you know consumers consume right they are going to figure out a way to live their life and and enrich their lives and i would say while there is a lot of substitution in the non candy space especially physical for for online and e com i would say we feel good that healthy levels of consumer volumes there i think what is going to what is going to define the trajectory of volume rebound from here on out is is the direction of tnt which which you know is a category we over index on so maybe some thoughts there you know amex has a deeper understanding of tnt than i think any other card issuer especially considering the network and the insights you get off of that on a global basis so maybe your thoughts on how we recover from this are there any green shoots you are seeing in tnt at all at this point i mean i think you know my position is consumer travel will come back i think that is our our enterprise position is that we expect consumer travel to come back it is an essential part of the consumer experience especially in our demographic i think you know what we have seen to date in terms of the rebound is an effect of substitution so people substituting driving vacations homestay rentals for you know for air based travel and in some categories we have seen innovation as well right i have seen the dining space in particular expansion of outdoor dining pick up take away delivery at home meal prep that level of innovation has has bounced the restaurant category more than you would expect just from dying in volumes alone right so i think you know where when we get back to historic levels i think is is largely a question of of confidence and medical solutions right i think i i think the establishment of the vaccine the approval of the vaccine i expect will unleash a lot of anticipatory and pent up demand on consumers they will start travel planning again the interest in travel based payment products and travel based loyalty currencies i think will will spike is all that pent up demand for travel people start to see the end in sight though they start to build confidence that in a six to twelve month time period they will be able to travel again but i think getting back to historic volumes is going to require that and in terms of how that affects the discount rate at american express especially without the long haul cro the the long haul travel maybe a a discussion there just briefly remind investors how that dynamic is playing out yeah well there is no there is no question that the tnt volumes taking a disproportionate hit like this does have a mixed related impact on our discount rate right so i think you know the discount rate we we have been on record for a few years now saying we we grind down less on absolute discount rate and are focused on driving discount revenue and utility through programs like dark blue certain b two b categories but there is no question you know that historic discount rate has taken a mix related impact as a result of really a disproportionate fall in in tnt tnt spend okay we will we will we will move off of that that topic that is not helpful right now in terms of the dynamic but maybe on to something that is which is you know can you discuss how spending habits have changed you know and to what degree you are seeing these habits you know coalesce into long term repeatable behavior you know especially around e com contactless yeah and if it is different between consumer segments yeah you know i think my take on the effects of this crisis are that it did not create any new trends but it changed sort of the slope of pre existing trends right e commerce was taking share from offline digital payments were taking share from cash at pos right and we have seen a an inflection or kink in those curves as most issuers have over the last six months you know whether we have seen those trends accelerated by year two years it is anybody is guess but i do not think i do not think we are going backwards from those trends as the crisis as the crisis relaxes you know i think on the contactless side you know there is a lot of noise around that there are markets outside the us as you know southeast asia australia the uk where there is very deep contactless penetration and and that has continued to gain share during this crisis in the us the contactless volumes are much more modest they are increasing at a rapid rate but i do expect that the move away from cash and the comfort with using credit products even for micro level transactions at pos will be an enduring outcome of this and i i think while i do not think it does a lot per se to drive dollar volumes of billings i think it does a lot to build habit and wallet position of of credit products and in some markets outside the us where e com is less established it is had a more profound effect like italy is a face to face retail market we have seen phenomenal growth in e commerce what is interesting is well over fifty of the participants in e commerce in any month during the 1st few months of the crisis had never had an e commerce transaction on amex before wow so there we have seen some real i i i again i think it is a trend that would have played out but it was a very large acceleration of that trend and correct me if i am wrong but amex has a a better acceptance footprint outside the us in e ecom than it does in brick and mortar i yeah i would say that is probably true by large due to partnerships with various psps and aggregators and such we have a really strong footprint in in e com okay so in terms of the health of the us consumer the health of the consumer in general you know especially considering high higher unemployment furloughs unemployment claims you know as we saw this morning it has been remarkable how well the industry is faring right now you know i noticed that amex is credit quality is at its best point over the last twelve months on consumer and shockingly its best point over the last three years in small business and so maybe some context there be you know discovers ceo did cause some concern the other day by saying they expect the material uplift in credit quality metrics later this year so just your perspective yeah i mean look i think most issuers have seen a more modest impact than would have been implied by the end of q one qualitative reserves that they took right i think looking at macro indicators around unemployment claims changes in sequential gdp you know if you were sitting back being an armchair credit manager you would have expected much larger and negative impacts on delinquency and write offs and the fact of the matter is as you say we have we have not seen them as most issuers have not play out of by and large now there are a number of contributors to that right i would say the jobless claims the geography of those the the demographics of those jobless claims you know were not as concentrated in our customer base our member base as the macro numbers would suggest i would also say as everyone knows there is just a ton of liquidity in the system right now whether it is through government programs private sector forbearance programs and so you are right we have we have credit quality and delinquency and right off side that are better year on year than than they were you know i think we have to while while we are pleased with that we also have a healthy level of you know paranoia about what the next twelve months will bring right the macro economy some of these forbearance programs with ten of residential mortgages being in forbearance that kind of going away government support moderating perhaps private sector follow through in terms of white collar job losses so you know we feel great about the early innings of this crisis but you know we are mindful that it is it is not over you know just are there any signs in the portfolio at all that would be concerning you know look i think in the in the commercial or small business portfolio clearly there are industries that are more affected by this fortunately they tend to be industries where our concentration is is lower you know there there are some some things about this crisis have actually improved visibility in a way i mean we have really good visibility into our customers that have entered into forbearance programs with competitors right which allows us to kinda target and think about the precision of our underwriting and existing customer management a little bit more crisply but but i would say there are there are no real hotspots within the portfolio right now you know i i would say you know back in april may all of us had these sort of short term crisis relief programs right where payment holiday no interest charged and you know type thing you do after a natural disaster like a hurricane and we we made a a judgment that we were not going to kick the can down the road by continuing to extend those programs we were going to we were going to move customers if they needed to move on to longer term solutions for repayment confidence right so our twelve month financial relief program which you know allows customers to reduce their minimum payment maintain their membership they do not get their membership canceled and retain some level of spend utility as well right and we think that that that has allowed us to transition the portfolio in a very customer friendly way in a way that has stabilized the receivables metrics as well okay i want to keep this try to keep this conversation with investors so investors are funneling questions to us and we just got one that i will just read it for you basically you have made it clear that tnt spend recovery is very linked to covid resolution you know as customers currently divert that spending toward non tnt purchases how is amex able to increase their share of customer spending in non tnt and how meaningfully can that move the needle on billings growth yeah i mean i think it is a great question i mean one of the things you know we did early in this crisis is decide that we were going to focus on existing customers the visibility around large scale prospect acquisition was challenged our value propositions tend to index on tnt as we have noted and so we said job one was taking care of existing customers which caused us to make a long term balance of year large dollar value commitment to our customers in terms of injecting more relevant right for the times type of value and that could be accelerators in grocery and in dining food delivery our wireless and streaming credits on our our platinum product promotions with amazon and other other merchant partners and you know we are measuring success right now in terms of how effectively we retain our customers and especially the customers that drive fifty to sixty of our margin on an annual basis and how well we compete within their wallets per share of wallet and on both of those metrics which we track very closely and at a very granular level we feel really good about how well we are competing for our customers business and you know i think we have we have built some confidence here that you know as certain natural hedges in our business take effect so people are not visiting lounges as much it it frees up resources for us to create new more relevant value for our customers that is what we did this year it has worked for us so far we are in the early innings and we are confident that we can and we will do that going forward as well you know we also just need to i think think about we we think about our co brand products as like travel products actually like ninety of the spend on a number of our large co brands is in non tnt categories right what they are doing is spending in everyday categories to save up and create the opportunity for aspirational travel in the future and so that billing base is not as effective as long as consumers believe in the long term value of those loyalty currencies and the travel that they can they can gain access to so it sounds like you are implying that the co branded portfolios or performing the travel related co brand portfolios are performing no different from other portfolios yeah there are they are performing no worse than other portfolios look there are portfolios that we have that are doing extraordinarily well right certain real a retail co brands whether it is the small business co brand with amazon whether it is other department store co brands we have outside of the us but if you were to look at our us certainly our cashback products as all cashback products in the industry that rational shore value is performing very well but i think we have been on record saying you know say our delta portfolio has experienced a more modest compression of billings than our us portfolios at large interesting well count me one of those co brand holders with delta hopefully i get to use some of those miles at some point soon i think my family would appreciate that that that is the pent up demand i am talking about right we all feel that way zero i see have not seen my father in six months it is there it is definitely there so okay let me ask you about the competitive response that you have seen because clearly amex is not the only one thinking about these problems amex has historically kept their spending levels and sup and supportive consumers at a higher level through crisis and i think that is because of the returns amex has via the network so have you been able to take a lead if you have been and what has been the response yeah you know i am they they always say crisis build character they like reveal character to both individuals and institutions and i have been around amex a long time i am very proud of the way we have kind of rallied around our customers in this time of crisis i mean in the times of greatest uncertainty we signed up for an extraordinary level of value injection both the product level value i described as well as what we have done with our three month shop small program when we had our least visibility we doubled down on on our customers and as i said earlier i think it is paid real dividends for us we track spend share within our members wallets and there is no question that back in like april we took a hit and we have climbed back as a result of that value injection and some really dialed up customer marketing as i think steve and jeff have both said we see retention rates that are superior to 2019 right now within our base and you know i think we have talked about it before they are better than they were in 2019 and our retention rates in general are just extraordinarily high i mean we we retain more than 98 of our billings base year to year okay i do not i do not think i have heard that stat before so that is a it is definitely a good one to write down so wanted to ask about lending lending amex is getting more creative and its lending products there was recently a launch of a different lending product associated with platinum so maybe you can discuss how amex is expanding its lending if you have been successful in getting a greater share of the lend wallet which i believe historically was about half that of the spend share yes so if you can dig into that a little bit that would be great yeah so you your memory is really good you know typically we have mid 40s spend share and we have low 20s lending share within our customers you know i think there is there is kind of legacy point of view that our customers do not borrow on credit cards but our customers tend to account for about a 3rd of the industry billings on credit and about a 3rd of industry outstandings on credit and we believe that our customers expect lending or financing capabilities on their payment products and you know we have been growing if you look back 2019 in the three years previous we probably grow grew at two x the industry rate at least some some years three x the industry rate in terms of lending volumes there was a lot of investor concern the analysts concern at the time about could we do that prudently would we be able to manage through the next crisis effectively given that or was there a surprise a surprise looming one of the things we have said and we remain committed to it is you know we expect to source the majority of our lending growth from within our existing customer base right whether that is installment capabilities term loans or some of the new features you have described and for us they are important because not only do customers expect them but they obviously provide some meaningful revenues that we can reinvest into highly competitive value propositions so yes we have put both revolve and transaction based installment capabilities on our full us consumer product stuff so historic green gold platinum and we will be working through a process of introducing those features to our members in the current quarters we want to make sure that you know we do not sound tone deaf in terms of the marketing we are doing and what new features we are introducing but we believe customers expect that and on installment in particular i am really enthusiastic about that right there is a financial discipline to these closed end installment programs and they resonate tremendously with millennial and younger generations that start getting used to kind of installment and put sale type capabilities yeah lemme ask you about that because that is it is a hot market it is hard to understand how much it is really penetrated us credit it seems that the barriers are lower when it comes to an e commerce transaction for instance we believe that a firm will be available to every shopify merchant at the product level as opposed to just the checkout level on those websites so maybe you can discuss for a minute how you are thinking about those products perhaps leaping in front of amex is ability to lend to its customer because of the placement yeah well i think you know the good thing about about our planet functionality is our customers go to the point of sale knowing it is available to them and it introduces zero friction in checkout right because on the back end on their app they can opt into a plan of 36 twelve months in duration with very transparent fees associated with it so i think as opposed to having eng to engage in the purchase that but i think there are a lot of things a firm and shopify others can do to make that point of sale experience more lightweight reduced friction there but you can not get less friction than we have in that purchase experience i also think it is a platform that is has a lot of possibility in terms of innovating with our partners right so if you think about our airline and hotel partners and the capacity to put that in the purchase path to put it you know on their web properties to both remind existing customers of their ability to access that but also to drive card acquisition saying a delta purchase path we think it has powerful potential okay all right on the card portfolios amex has done since steve took over amex has done a phenomenal job of getting products on steady refresh cycles which has had a profound impact on the rate of growth in net card fees yeah and so has the pandemic caused a delay in that cycle or a delay in the typical new customer account acquisition you expect off of a refresh that might cause a slowdown in those fees and then a re acceleration at some point yeah so i think we have done a really good job of that you know we exited nineteen with north of twenty card fee growth and you know this year right before the pandemic hit we actually refreshed our entire delta co brand portfolio and priced for the value in that so i would say the the pandemic has affected a couple areas you know i think it is affected our acquisition bonds as i said in q two we decided to focus on existing customers we pulled back on acquisition that definitely slows the flow of new fee paying customers i think there may be examples where we refresh products and have to think about whether we take price at the time we refresh or whether we defer that fee increase for twelve months i think we are going to have to be sensitive to the environment but in terms of the commitment to a regular cycle of product refresh adding value and pricing for that value both on the back and the front book we remain committed to that and i think you should expect that regardless of the environment that 2021 will feature some large scale refreshes as well okay i want to ask you about all the work you have done to support your co brand partners especially in tnt and do you have concern around you know you see some of these announcements that i am not sure if they are threats or if they are real when a united goes out and says we are getting ready to lay off fifty of our domestic staff delta has clearly not said anything like that but point is how do you view those partners or do you view them as severely distressed and how is amex thinking about that yeah well i mean i fundamentally i view them as as under stress as we all are but since i do believe in the return especially of leisure travel on the back of a vaccine i believe in the long term of those partners as well i also happen to think we have we have great partners we have a really premium set of partners whether it is delta whether it is hilton whether it is british airways who we just react with and you know my my view as it was in you know the great financial crisis was these are great times to to lean in build partnership and invest together to strengthen our joint customer base and that is what we have done right if you look at the value injections we have done with delta that we have done with marriott that we have done with hilton and these are partners that as you say they are under a fair amount of stress and they have come to the table innovated with us co invested to to make those products appealing even in a travel challenge time and i think you will see you will see more of that in in 21 i feel i feel great about the long term health of those portfolios and i feel really good about the partners okay we have got a minute and i really wanted to give you a chance to answer amex has really leaned in on digital in terms of assets you have picked up razzie mezi cake pocket concierge lounge buddy you know to name a bunch how is that all coming together to support your customers are we going to see significant changes to the american express mobile app which i think is the best in the industry as it is to bring those capabilities to bear yeah it is a great it is a great question and it is one that is live on our minds as well and you know i mean the most recent capability based acquisition would have been cabbage on the small business side right and you know we have been on the journey to both digitize our existing products and experiences like dining has always been top passionate for our customers right it is you know we have a 1000000000 dining transactions it is the number one request into our concierge and travel and so digitizing and adding content there was sort of a no brainer to us but your your point is right we have seen through the digitization of our products and servicing a material drop in offline service a large shift to online and that is further fueled by the fact that half of our new customers are under the age of 35 eighty of our acquisitions happen in digital channels and so that trend plus the content we are adding right so you add dining you add installment type capabilities you add you know new sme product sets you know our mobile product and web product are going to have to flex to make that expanded range of content easier to navigate for folks there is no question but to your point i think we feel like we started a really strong place right in terms of our own internal assessment as well as external recognition of of our mobile product well i am going to have to wrap it there doug i really appreciate you joining us i really want to do this in person next time and next do that e en en enjoy the last fleeting days of summer all right you too craig great to see you thank you thanks take care doug all right bye",
            "prediction": "good morning this is craig moore with autonomous thanks for joining us this morning for our 5th annual future of commerce symposium sorry for the brief delay in getting started i just wanted to mention a few housekeeping items before we get started you can use the same dial in or web link for the entire day there will be a few breaks but for many of the sessions we will just move right into the next one thank you the next discussion you can submit questions  to us via email to myself or ken sezakowski you can also use bloomberg id to find us with questions or you can use the q and a box within your zoom window so with with no further ado let us get started we are lucky to have with us this morning american express doug buckman hello group head global consumer services it is great to see you again doug i wish it was in person i wish it was in carnegie hall but maybe next year how are you exactly it is great great to see you two thanks for having me yeah you bet so love the background love the image but let me know why we get started with just you know a broad question which is you know can you update us on the state of consumer and overall yeah you know i think as we have talked about before we saw the dip in april and we have seen a rebound since then you know i would characterize the trend since mid july as relatively stable on the non teeny side so outside of teeny relatively stable little bouncing around due to days mixed timing of holidays like labor day in particular okay at this point i assume could we perhaps characterize this a little deeper on this xtny if you were to characterize the overall volumes you are seeing xtny x corporate card you know are consumers getting back toward positive territory within credit card portfolios at this point yeah i mean i think you know consumers consume they are going to figure out a way to live their life and and enrich their lives and i would say while there is a lot of substitution in the non cash space especially physical for for online and e commerce i would say we feel good healthy levels of consumer volumes there i think what is going to what is going to define the trajectory of volume rebound from here on out is is the direction of tne which which you know is a category we overindex on so maybe some thoughts there you know mx has a deeper understanding of tne than i think any other card issuer or especially considering the network and the insight you know my position is consumer travel will come back i think that is our our enterprise position is that we expect consumer travel to come back it is an essential part of  the consumer experience especially in our demographic i think you know what we have seen to date in terms of the rebound is an effect of substitution so people substituting driving vacations home stay rentals for you know  for air based travel and in some categories we have seen innovation as well right i have seen the dining space in particular expansion about outdoor dining pick up takeaway delivery at home meal prep that level of innovation has has bounced the restaurant category more than you would expect just from dine in volumes alone so i think you know when when we get back to historic levels i think is is largely a question of of confidence and medical solutions i think i think  the establishment of a vaccine the approval of a vaccine i expect will unleash a lot of anticipatory pent up demand on consumers they will start travel planning again the interest in travel based payment products and travel based loyalty currencies i think will spike as all that pent up demand for travel people start to see the end in sight there they start to build confidence that in a 612 month period we are going to be able to get back to some semblance of normalcy i think getting back to historic volumes is going to require that and in terms of how that affects the discount rate at american express especially without the long haul the long haul travel maybe a discussion there just briefly remind investors how that dynamic is playing out yeah well there is no there is no question the tne volumes taking a disproportionate hit like this does have a mixed related impact on our discount rate right so i think you know the discount rate and we have we have been on record for a few years now saying we we grind down less on absolute discount rate and are focused on driving discount revenue and utility through programs like  blue certain b to b okay well we will move off of that that topic that is not helpful right now in terms of the dynamic but maybe on to something that is which is you know can you discuss how spending habits have changed you know what degree you are seeing these habits you know coalesce into long term repeatable behavior you know especially around e commerce contact lists and if it is different between consumer segments commerce was taking share from offline digital payments were taking share from cash at p zero s and we have seen  an inflection or a kink in those curves as most issuers have over the last six months whether we have seen those trends accelerated by a year two years it is anybody is guess but i do not think we are going backwards from those trends as the crisis  as the crisis i think on the contactless side you know there is a lot of noise around that there are markets outside the us as you know southeast asia australia the uk where there is very deep contactless penetration and that has continued to gain share during this crisis in the us the contactless volumes are much more modest they are increasing at a rapid rate but i do expect that contactless will continue to grow in the us move away from cash and the comfort with using credit products even for micro level transactions at p zero s will be an enduring outcome of this while i do not think it does a lot per se to drive dollar volumes of billings i think it does a lot to build habit and wallet position of of credit products and in some markets outside the u s where econ is strong so less established it is had a more profound effect like italy is a face to face retail market we have seen phenomenal growth in e commerce what is interesting is well over fifty of the participants in e commerce in any month during the 1st few months of the crisis had never had an e commerce transaction on amex before so there we have seen some real growth again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i think again i would have played out but it was a very large acceleration of that trend and correct me if i am wrong but mx has a a better acceptance footprint outside the us in ecom than it does in brick and mortar okay so in terms of  the health of the us consumer the health of the consumer in general you know especially considering higher unemployment furloughs unemployment claims you know as we saw this morning it has been remarkable how well the industry is faring right now you know i noticed that amex is credit quality is at its best point i have to say that in the last twelve months on consumer and shockingly it is best point over the last three years in small business and so maybe some context there you know discovers ceo did cause some concern the other day by saying they expect a material uplift in credit quality metrics later this year so just your perspective yeah i mean look i think most issue i think looking at macro indicators around unemployment plans changes in sequential gdp you know if you were sitting back as an armchair credit manager you would have expected much larger and negative impacts on delinquency and write offs the matter is as you say we have we have not seen them as most issuers have not seen them as most issuers have in play by and large now there are a number of contributors to that right i would say the jobless claims the geography of those the demographics of those jobless claims you know  were not as concentrated in our customer base our member base as the macro numbers would suggest i would also say as everyone knows there is just a we have a lot of liquidity in the system right now whether it is through government programs private sector forbearance programs and so you are right we have we have credit all the way up to delinquency and write offs that are better year on year than they were than they were last year you know i think we have to while we are pleased with that we also have a healthy level of you know paranoia some of these forbearance programs with ten of residential mortgages being in forbearance that kind of going away government support moderating  perhaps private sector follow through in terms of white collar job losses so you know we feel great about the early innings of this crisis but you know we are mindful that it is not over you know just are there any signs in the portfolio at all that would be concerning i mean we have really good visibility into our customers that have entered into forbearance programs with competitors which allows us to kind of target and think about the precision of our underwriting and existing customer management a little bit more crisply but i would say there are no real hotspots within the portfolio right now i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would

would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would say i would back in april may all of us had these sort of short term crisis relief programs where payment holiday no interest charged and you know the type of thing you do after a natural disaster like a hurricane and we made a  a judgment that we were not going to kick the can down the road by continuing to extend those programs we were going to move customers if they needed to move on to longer term solutions for repayment confidence right so our twelve month financial relief program which you know allows customers to reduce their minimum payment maintain their membership they do not get their membership canceled and retain some level of spend utility as well right and we think that that that has allowed us to transition the portfolio in a very customer friendly way in a way that has okay i want to keep this try to keep this conversation with investors so investors are funneling questions to us and we just got one that i will just read for you basically you have made it clear that tene is spend recovery is very linked to covid resolution you know as customers currently divert that spending toward non tene purchases how is amex handling this yeah i mean i think it is a great question i mean one of the things you know we did early in this crisis is decide that we were going to focus on existing customers the visibility around large scale prospect acquisition was challenged our value propositions tend to index on tne as we have noted and so we said job one was taking care of existing customers which caused us to make a long term balance of year large dollar value commitment to our customers in terms of injecting more relevant right for the times type of value and that could be accelerators in grocery and in dining food delivery are  wireless and streaming credits on our our platinum product promotions with amazon and other other merchant partners and you know we are measuring success right now in terms of how effectively we retain our customers and especially the customers that drive fifty to sixty of our margin on an annual basis and how well we compete within their wallets for share of wallet and on both of those metrics which we track very closely and at a very granular level we feel really good about how we are doing i want to talk about our business for our customers you know i think we have we have built some confidence here that you know as certain natural hedges in our business take effect so people are not visiting lounges as much it frees up resources for us to create new more relevant value for our customers that is what we did this year it has worked for us so far we are in the early innings and we are confident that we can we also just need to i think think about our co brand products as like travel products actually like ninety of the spend on a number of our large co brands is in non tne categories what they are doing is spending in everyday categories to save up and create the opportunity for aspirational travel in the future and so that billing base is not as effective as it could be as long as consumers believe in the long term value of those loyalty currencies and the travel that they can they can gain access to so it sounds like you are implying that the cobrand portfolios are performing the travel related cobrand portfolios are performing no different from other portfolios yeah there are they are performing no worse than other portfolios look there are portfolios i think we have that extraordinary retail co brands whether it is the small business co brand with amazon whether it is other department store co brands we have outside the us but if you were to look at our us certainly our cash back products as all cash back products in the industry that rational sure value is performing very well but i think we have been on record saying you know say our delta portfolio we have experienced a more modest compression of billings than our us portfolios at large interesting well count me one of those co brand holders with delta hopefully i get to use some of those miles at some point soon i think my family would appreciate that that is the pent up demand i am talking about right we all feel that way zero it is there it is definitely there so okay  let me ask you about the competitive response that you have seen because clearly amex is not the only one thinking about these problems amex has historically kept their spending levels and so and supportive consumers at a higher level through crises and i think that is because of the returns amex has via the network so have you been able to take a lead if you have been and what has been the response yeah you know i you know they always say crises build character they like reveal character to both of individuals and institutions and i have been around amex a long time i am very proud of the way we have kind of rallied around our customers in this time of crisis i mean in the times of greatest uncertainty we signed up for an extraordinary effort we have an objective level of value injection both at the product level of value i described as well as what we have done with our three month shop small program when we had our least visibility we doubled down on on our customers and as i said earlier i think it is paid real dividends for as we track spend share within our members wallets and there is no question that back in like april we took a hit and we have climbed back as a result of that value injection and some really dialed up customer  marketing and as i think steve and jeff have both said we see retention rates that are superior to 2019 right now within our base and you know i think we have talked about it before they are better than they were in 2019 and our retention rates in general are just extraordinarily high i mean we we retain okay i do not think i have heard that step before so that is definitely a good one to write down so i wanted to ask about lending amex is getting more creative in its lending products there was recently a launch of a different lending product associated with platinum maybe you can discuss how amex is expanding its lending if you have been successful in getting a greater share of the lend wallet which i believe historically was about half that of the spend share yes so if you can dig into that a little bit that would be great yeah so your memory is really good you know typically we have mid forty s spend share and we have  low twenty s lending share with amex you know i think there is this kind of legacy point of view that our customers do not borrow on credit cards but our customers tend to account for about a 3rd of industry billings on credit and about a 3rd of industry outstanding on credit and we believe that our customers expect lending or financing capabilities on their payment products and you know i mean if you look back 2019 in the three years previous we probably grow grow at two x the industry rate at least some years three x the industry rate in terms of lending volumes there was a lot of investor concern analyst concern at the time about could we do that prudently would we be able to manage through the next crisis effectively given that or was there a surprise  surprise lending we remain committed to it is you know we expect to source the majority of our lending growth from within our existing customer base right whether that s installment capabilities term loans or some of the new features you ve described and for us they re important because not only do customers expect them but they obviously provide some meaningful revenues that we can reinvest into highly competitive value propositions so yes we have put both revolver and transaction based installment capabilities on our full us consumer product set so historic green gold platinum and we will be working through a process of introducing those features  to our members in the current quarters we want to make sure that you know we do not sound tone deaf in terms of the marketing we are doing and what new features we are introducing but we believe customers expect that and on install well in particular i am really enthusiastic about that right there is a financial discipline to these closed end installment programs and they resonate tremendously with millennial and younger generations that start getting used to kind of installment and pawn sale type capabilities it seems that the barriers are lower when it comes to an e commerce transaction for instance we believe that a firm will be available to every shopify merchant at the product level as opposed to just the checkout level on those websites so maybe you can discuss for a minute how you are thinking about those products perhaps leaping in front of the competition and i think the good thing about about our planet functionality is our customers go to the point of sale knowing it is available to them and it introduces zero friction in checkout because on the back end on their app they can opt into a plan of 3612 months in duration with very transparent pricing i think as opposed to having and to engage in the purchase path and i think there are a lot of things a farm and shopify others can do to make that point of sale experience more lightweight reduce friction there but you can not get less friction than we have in that purchase experience i also think it is a platform that has a lot of possibility in terms of innovating with so if you think about our airline and hotel partners and the capacity to put that in the purchase path to put it you know  on their web properties to both remind existing customers of their ability to access that but also to drive card acquisition say in delta to purchase path we think that has powerful potential on the card portfolios amex has done a phenomenal job of getting products on steady refresh cycles which has had a profound impact on the rate of growth in net card fees yeah so has the pandemic caused a delay in that cycle or a delay in the typical cycle yeah so i think we have done a really good job of that you know we exited nineteen with north of twenty card fee growth and you know this year right before the pandemic hit we actually refreshed our entire delta co branded portfolio and price for the value in that so i would say the the pandemic has affected a couple areas you know i think it is affected our acquisition volumes as i said in q two we decided to focus on existing customers we pulled back on acquisition that definitely slows the flow of new fee paying customers i think there may be examples where we refresh products and we have to think about whether we take price at the time we refresh or whether we defer that fee increase for twelve months i think we are going to have to be sensitive to the environment but in terms of the commitment to a regular cycle of product refresh adding value and pricing for that value both on the back and the front book we remain committed to that and i think you should expect that regardless all right well i want to ask you about all the work you have done to support your cobra brand partners especially tne and do you have concerns around you know you see some of these announcements that i am not sure if they are threats or if they are real when a united goes out and says we are going to be supporting tne and you know i am not sure if that is a threat or if that is real ready to lay off fifty of our domestic staff delta has clearly not said anything like that but the point is how do you view those partners or do you view them as severely distressed and how is amex thinking about that yeah well i mean fundamentally i view them as as under stress as we all are but since i do believe in the return especially of leisure travel on the back of a vaccine i believe in the long term  of those partners as well i also happen to think we have we have great partners we have a really premium set of partners whether it is delta whether it is hilton whether it is british airways who we just re upped with and you know my my view as it was in you know the great financial crisis was these are great times to to lean in build partnership and invest together to strengthen our joint customer base and that is what we have done right and if you look at the value injections we have done with delta that we have done with marriott that we have done with hilton and these are partners that as you say they are under a fair amount of stress and they have come to the table innovated with us co invested to to make those products appealing even in a travel challenged time and i think you will see you will see more of that in 201 i feel i feel great about the long term health of those portfolios and i feel really good about the partners okay we will have about a minute i really wanted to give you a chance to answer amex has really leaned in on digital in terms of assets you have picked up resy mezzi cake pocket concierge lounge buddy you know to name a few how is that all coming together to support your customers are we going to see significant changes to the american express mobile app which i think is the best in the industry as it is to bring those capabilities to bear and you know we have been on the journey to both digitize our existing products and experiences like dining has always been top priority for our customers it is you know we have a 1000000000 dining transactions it is the number one request into our concierge and travel and so digitizing and adding content there was sort of a no brainer to us but your your point is well taken we have seen through the digitization of our products and services a material drop in offline service a large shift to online and that is further fueled by the fact that half of our new customers are under the age of 3580 of our acquisitions happen in digital channels and so that trend plus the content we are adding right so you add dining so you add experiences so you add entertainment so you add shopping so you add travel so you add all these different elements to your business it is driving this incredible shift to online you add installment type capabilities you add you know new sme product sets you know our mobile product and web product are going to have to flex to make that expanded range of content easier to navigate for folks there is no question but to your point i think we feel like we started a really strong place in terms of our own internal assessment as well as external recognition of of our mobile product well i am going to have to wrap it there doug i really appreciate you joining us i really want to do this in person next time let us try that enjoy the last fleeting days of summer alright you two craig great to see you thank you thanks take care doug i will see you bye",

other risks and uncertainties reflected in our company is ten k which is on file with the sec and other public filings now i will return the call back to geoff thank you relland a couple years ago i announced we would change our approach to the market by focusing on only products that are techno technologically driven performance and price advantages and i am pleased that our operating performance during this challenging period appears to validate our change in direction the 4th quarter had a strong finish resulting in year over year quarter over quarter and sequential growth our revenues increased 31 from a year ago the quarter full year revenue growth was 23 fiscal 2020 was our 2nd consecutive year of strong growth of increasing profitability solid cash flow and while strengthening the underlying foundations of oem production contracts and recurring revenue that support our continued success based on this performance our cash on hand and our confidence in continued success in september the board of directors declared a special ¢65 per share dividend we were able to receive these achieve these results while protecting our employees partners and customers against the pandemic while this while its impact to date on our business has been minimal safety precautions have now been a routine have now become a routine part of our operators commitment to ensure a safe and a healthy work environment we announced last quarter that textron had awarded us an oem production contract to supply our thrustsense autothrottle with lifeguard protection on the new king air 360 twin turboprop in november textron celebrated delivery of its 1st beechcraft king air 360 tur turboprop aircraft more recently textron announced that the thrustsense autothrottle is standard equipment on the new king air 260 delivery is scheduled to begin in the 1st half of 2021 we are pleased to be working with textron and are grateful for the support through the certification and mobile potential production they are a strong supporter of our technology the is s autothrottle is the 1st among a list of 360 up upgrades mentioned in their king air 360 promotional material textron joins two major oems to feature is s products as standard equipment on their production aircraft joining pilatus pc 24 ums and boeing is kc 46 tanker as major oem contracts of prospectively significant duration and value these contracts offer a growing base of long term recurring revenue as expected for the last fifty years they are supporting textron in looking into opportunities for the thrustsense work load reducing features on their other production platforms we are grateful to see that the service center organization has positively pursued significant retrofit opportunities of 1000s of king airs currently in service consequently we are working with textron to ensure our production levels meet the service center is demand for autothrottle and help promote the availability of this potentially lifesaving technology to king air is owners thrustsense also has a base for expanding beyond the general aviation market they will look at the military aircraft and air transports and multi engine aircraft as well in addition we are finding that the public publicities around surrounding our thrustsense has then created interest for other oems that are potentially lifes are potentially lifesaving faa certified one engine and operative upset protection it is by compelling differentiator that multi engine operators are now very interested in we are we are optimistic that the contracts with textron support provide this option of a technology that not only improves their air performance but to provide unparalleled safety precipitated by our king air business we have hired a sales and services support representative stationed in wichita he will support our present business at textron and explore new business opportunities in the region we are working with textron worldwide service organization supporting all of our retrofits our autopilot programs director is successful dressing addressing a large military opportunities and air transport markets with very encouraging results continue to recruit sales and support personnel for our growing business demand and for thrustsense autothrottle and lifeguard protection systems in addition september of 2020 we announced the faa had certified our synthetic vision installation and autothrottle upgrade for the eclipse jet the eclipse has the eclipse was the 1st aircraft in which we developed an autothrottle and we are pleased to be able to offer owners the ability to upgrade the airplanes with our latest features the ongoing growth of the ongoing growth of online traffic continues to fuel the increase in the number of 757s and 67 aircraft being converted to cargo this has generated increasing demand for our flat panel display technology engineering and development work completed we ship our upgrades for the us navy air data computers for the f five in the 4th quarter we are now merging international customers for the f five let me turn this over rell to rell for some financial results thank you jeff and thank you all for joining us this morning looking 1st at the 4th quarter revenues were 6300000 up 31 from 4800000 a year ago and generated a 39 increase in operating income this was the fastest quarterly growth in this fiscal year growth this quarter was almost entirely on product and customer service revenue as we completed final engineering on the us navy f five air data computer development contract and we shipped the entire production order in the quarter growth margins for the quarter were 55eight down from 59five in the year ago october with a decrease attributable to product mix high warranty and material costs also this quarter we had limited engineering development revenue unlike a year ago quarter which yield yielded strong margins nevertheless margins remain in line with historical averages achieved over the years total operating expenses for the 4th quarter of fiscal 2020 were 2300000 up from 2000000 in the year ago quarter this minus increase in expense reflects the additional the additional resources needed to support the company is thirty revenue growth rate research and development expense was up over the year ago quarter reflecting a shift to more internally funded r d now that the customer funded f five development contract is completed r d was approximately eleven of quarterly revenues which is consistent with our strong commitment to innovative and new product development selling general and administrative expenses were up about eight from the year ago quarter again looking at primarily due to the need to have resources to support our increased business activity for the quarter we generated upper in income of 1200000 or approximately nineteen of revenue other income was down from a year ago quarter as interest rates increased we reported quarterly and income of 1200000 or ¢seven per share looking at results for the year where total revenues were 21600000 up 23 from 17600000 for full year 2019 the cover report for fiscal 2020 net income of 3300000 or ¢nineteen per share increases 74 and 73 respectively from net income of onenine or ¢eleven per share for fiscal 2019 the company remains in strong financial position we generated over 2200000 of funded tax flow from operations in fiscal 2020 of which 1600000 was generated in the 4th quarter and had 12600000 of cash on hand at september thirty 2020 the company is debt free in september the board of directors declared a tax dividend in the amount of ¢65 per share or approximately 11200000 which was paid on october one 2020 the dividend appears as an accrual on the september thirty 2020 balance sheet offset by corresponding restricting cash we believe that the company has sufficient cash to fund operations for the foreseeable future now i would like to turn the call over to shahram thank you relland and good morning everyone the 4th quarter was our best sales quarter of fiscal 2020 and put a five point on our 2nd consecutive year above our bottom line growth a strong tax generation 4th quarter was the year in which our 3rd oem production contract with a tier one manufacturer textron king air 360 and king air 260 are newer crafts that will feature our thrustsense autothrottle as standard equipment going or ongoing all year contracts with pilatus and boeing this oem contracts we are building a solid foundation of internal revenue that will last for years let me also quickly reiterate what geoff mentioned earlier generation is stronger and profitability is successfully executed on the king air contract while implementing new safety policies and procedures that have kept all of our employees safe and productive as well as protected our partners and customers the king air 360 program is just wrapping up the 1st production aircraft delivered to a customer last month the king air 260 is scheduled for delivery in the 1st half of 2021 we have been shaping thrustsense units textron since 3rd quarter and expect orders to naturally follow the anticipated increase in production over time in addition to shipping here for installation and routine here is restricted we are also shipping units extra distribution to the service center where they have reduced for retrofit installations as geoff mentioned the retrofit opportunity is much greater than the with about 5000 king air is currently in service which we estimate represents about 300000000 total addressable market at this point we are certified for retrofit on the beechcraft king air 300 series equipped with pro line fusion avionics and the pro line 21 equipped beechcraft king air 200 series other variations of this stc are being pursued with some imminence we are consequently also shipping autothrottles to our installation partners where it appears many king air owners take their aircraft for service both organizations are aggressively marketing the retrofits in fact we are opening an office in wichita to not only promote the product but also support textron the relationship with textron is going well and provides a solid foundation from which we expand our autothrottle market not only horizontally across king air platforms but other oems as well as the military we are in conversations with manufacturers of both twin turboprop twin jet and multi engine aircraft with regards to our autothrottle potentially lifesaving nature of thrustsense on multi engine aircraft is a feature in which virtually all oems have an interest in september 2020 december 2020 we announced that the faa has certified our synthetic vision installation and autothrottle upgrade for the eclipse jet this installation marks is s is 1st upgrade directly to eclipse owners and involves substantial pre orders eclipse owners now have the benefit of significant functional upgrades and ongoing product support directly from the partnership with is s i will now briefly review some of our ongoing programs the pc 24 program has essentially reached steady state production levels we expect to ship close to fifty shipsets in fiscal 2021 to support their current production rate this program remains highly successful pilatus is very excited about our performance this program we believe is expected to continue to run for many years offering a predictable stable recurrent revenue stream dynamics in the commercial and transport market are also essentially unchanged their cargo delivery services continue to convert boeing 757 and 767 planes including upgrades to our flat panel displays once contracted with large installers we are now doing more direct sales to carriers which has proven much more successful there remains over 1000 operational 75 and 767s that are still in need of retro fitting and even larger number of 737s yet to be updated development work for the us navy f five data computer was completed and we delivered production units for the us navy fleet retrofit in the 4th quarter this was a highly successful program and we are now turning our attention to foreign military which also fly the f five and would be a large new market for this versatile product our kc 46 program with boeing is one of our three oem production contracts it continues to make steady contribution to our recurring revenue and profitability new orders in the 4th quarter of fiscal 2020 were over 3400000 and backlog as of september thirty 2020 was threesix bookings for the full year were in excess of 19000000 keep in mind that backlog at the end of any one quarter is not necessarily indicative of future business activity as we generate a good portion of our revenue from customer service and intra quarter booking ship orders the ongoing pandemic has had peripheral effect on our sales and marketing activities limiting our ability to personally meet with customers and prospects causing some complexity working with the faa which is operating under work from home directive we do not believe the pandemic has or will have a significant impact on our business and are excited about the prospects of our portfolio of our products let me turn the call back to geoff for some closing remarks thanks shahram while the success of our autothrottle strongly suggests that this strategy is creating real value for both our customers and for our stockholders we are entering a new fiscal year with momentum for two years of strong growth solid balance sheet and a portfolio of products that are receiving en enthusiastic market perception we see a great opportunity thank you for your ongoing support and encouragement thank you to the audience today i will take the question as required thank you we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star then one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speaker phone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star then two at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster and the 1st question will come from david campbell with thompson davidson company please go ahead good morning david hey good morning geoff rell and shahram thanks for having such a good quarter i just wanted to ask you rell about what do you assume what i should assume for accrued tax rate in fiscal 21 will there be end of day tax accruals yeah there will be some expense but it will be less than because we still have some nols and some r d tax credits so i would use i am estimating use like a five effective tax rate type of thing okay thanks thanks and geoff and shahram were any of the shipments to the king airs were any of them for were some oem and some retrofits or all retrofits we have both a lot of a lot of oem actually about twenty odd oem shipments obviously the airplanes have not come off the line yet but and then and then a very a very rapidly growing demand and retrofit but no retrofit then revenues yet actually textron did an installation in australia on a retrofit on using our autothrottle we have had a good number of them we have had you know their local service centers they have a huge network of service centers throughout the world and the very encouraging thing is they are very aggressively promoting the autothrottle retrofit so it looks as it looks better almost every day it is very good so you expect that to be so you expect those revenues to increase in fiscal 21 pretty much so and we believe that the growth is going to be exponential right right the usuals this quarter the december quarter we will have the usual seasonal downturn is that correct yeah maybe we will do a little better yeah okay well thanks for answering the questions that we are trying to do it we are trying to do better we are trying to keep a more stable and straight growth look we had operation is good it generates cash every every day virtually it is excellent it was profitable and as our volume goes up it becomes more profitable not only because it covers all of the fixed overheads a lot of which affects precedent profitability so we are very optimistic about the future we are very pleased about textron is interest and support in our products and and see a large retrofit opportunity listen we are already we are delivering 57 67 systems to another a a very new demand for for package carriers so i mean it is the business is coming up and when you consider the other effects of pandemic if you look at most of aerospace companies have been struggling we have done really well well you are doing you are doing a great job thanks for all your help if i can do it when i will not be to do this coming year and a little struggle looking a lot better i i think we are fortunate we have a very good product that is very producible we have got a great customers all of our customers are outstanding we are very fortunate with that so we just keep working at it you know every day get up and and as marine is say kick and take names thanks a lot for answering the questions i got to get off from the call but i appreciate all the work you are doing thank you once again if you have a question please press star then one the next question is from roger goldman a private investor please go ahead good morning and while and 1st of all thanks for a great quarter and a great year validates my late father is trust in you as you know and my sister and i are much appreciative i also want to acknowledge the fact that the last quarter in the last year of history but it sounds like you guys have set the company up for fabulous growth in the future that without being pollyanna could make the past look like small potatoes so congratulations on that my question as it usually is goes to the use of cash we have got a company with no debt with solid operating profit and and even after the dividend a fair amount of cash on the books any thoughts of either an acquisition or a small regular cash dividends that i think would have a great impact on the stock price it is a good question some of that i can answer some of it you can no i know you can not i know you can not but it is a reasonable question absolutely look we have we know we generate a lot of cash and our interest is for operating the business not not for us to look at cash that does not generate any income at all i mean i personally have cash accounts that they are they are paying interest at in pennies so yep yep yep we have no interest in doing that anymore if we can reasonably invested in other things we are doing some some automation on the floor and and and capex kind of things we are actually looking at dividends on a long term basis because we believe that to be business itself will generate cash on a regular basis and that we moving that that our stockholders can make good use of of cash so we are conscious we are very conscious of that that is that is what precipitated the ¢65 yes and yet we continue to look at it especially in light of what might be changes in taxation policy exactly yeah that is all that is all i can ask for and again well done you guys are doing a great job of positioning this company for the future you miss your dad he was always fun and he is a good guy well thank you we miss him too we miss him too but i i am hoping after covid geoff to come on out there and meet you guys and spend some time so look forward to it okay thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks thank you it appears that our management line has been disconnected so we thank you everyone for

either better or worse from those discussed now i will turn the call back to jeff several years ago i announced we would change our approach to the market by focusing on only products that are technologically driven performance and price advantages i am pleased that our operating performance during this challenging period has been consistent with our goals 4th quarter had a strong finish resulting a year over year quarter over a quarter and sequential growth our revenues increased 31 from a year ago the full year revenue growth was 23 fiscal 2020 was our 2nd consecutive year of strong growth of increasing profitability solid cash flow and while strengthening the underlying foundations of oem production contracts and recurring revenue that support our continued success based on this performance our cash on hand and our confidence in continued success in september the board of directors declared a special ¢65 per share dividend we are pleased to announce that our employees partners and customers are safe against the pandemic while the impact on our business has been minimal safety precautions have now become a routine part of our operators commitment to ensure safe and healthy working environments a contract was awarded to supply our threat sets auto throttles with life guard protection on the new king air 360 twin turboprop in november textron celebrated the delivery of its 1st beachcraft king air 360 twin turboprop aircraft more recently textron announced that the threat sets auto throttles is standard equipment on the new king air 360 the delivery schedule to begin in the 1st half of 2021 we are pleased to be working with teksan and are grateful for the support through the certification and moved into production they are a strong supporter of

their production aircraft joining pilatus pc 24 uomets and boeing is kc 46 tanker as major oe contracts of significantly significant duration and value we are pleased to report that the contracts we have offered provide a growing base of long term recurring revenue as expected for the last years they are supporting text analytics in looking into opportunities for the text analytics for workforce reduction features on their other production platforms they are grateful to see the service center organization that has positively pursued significant retrofits we are working with teledyne to ensure our production levels meet the service centers demand for autotrail and help promote the availability of this potentially lifesaving technology to king air owners the look at the military aircraft and air transports and multi engine aircraft as well in addition we are finding that the public publicity surrounding our threat sets has created an interest with other oams you are potentially life saving f a eighteen certified one engine inoperative upset protection is a compelling differentiator that multi engine operators are now very interested in we are optimistic that contracts with textron will support the widespread adoption of a technology that not only improves aircraft performance but can provide unparalleled safety precipitated by our continuing business we have hired as sales and service support representative stationed in wichita we are pleased to report that our business at texttron is expanding and exploring new business opportunities in the region we are working with texttron worldwide service organization supporting autorotary retrofits our autorotary programs director is successfully addressing a large military opportunities and air transport markets with very encouraging results we continue to recruit sales and support for our growing business demand and for thrust sets auto throttle and life guard protection systems in addition on september 2020 we announced the faa at certified our synthetic vision installation and auto throttle upgrade for the eclipse jet the eclipse was the 1st aircraft in which we developed an auto throttle we are pleased to be able to offer owners the ability to upgrade their airplanes to our latest features the ongoing growth of online shopping continues to fuel the increase in the number of 757 767 and 777 aircraft being converted to cargo this has generated increasing demand for our flat panel display technology we shipped our upgrade for us navy air dated computers for the f five in the 4th quarter we are now marketing international customers for the f five let me turn this over to ralph for some financial results thank you jeff and thank you all for joining us this morning looking at the 4th quarter revenues they were $6300000 up 31 this fiscal year we generated $4800000 a year ago and generated a 39 increase in operating income this was the fastest quarterly rate of growth in this fiscal year growth this quarter was almost entirely in product and customer service revenue as we completed final engineering on the us navy f five air data computer development contract and we shipped the entire production order in the quarter gross margins for the quarter were 55eight down from 59five revenue decrease attributed to product mix higher warranty and material costs also this quarter we had limited engineering development revenue unlike the year ago quarter which yielded strong margins nevertheless margins remained in line with the historical averages achieved over the years operating expenses for the 4th quarter of fiscal 2020 were $2300000 up from $2000000 in the year ago quarter this modest increase is due to the ongoing operations of the company research and development expenses up over the year ago quarter reflecting a shift to more internally funded r and d not that the customer funded as high development contract is completed r and d was approximately eleven of quarterly revenues which is consistent with our strong commitment to innovative and new product development so now any general and administrative expenses we were up about eight from the year ago quarter again primarily due to the need to add resources to support our increased business activity for the quarter we generated operating income of 1200000 or approximately nineteen of revenue other income was down from the year ago quarter as interest rates decreased we reported coordinating income of 1200000 or ¢seven per share looking at results for the year total revenues were flat the company reported fiscal 2020 net income of $3300000 or ¢nineteen per share increases of 74 and 73 respectively from that income of $1900000 or ¢eleven per share for fiscal 2019 the company remains in strong financial position generated over $2200000 of positive cash flow fiscal year 2020 of which 1600000 was generated in the 4th quarter and had 12600000 of cash on hand at september thirty 2020 the company is debt three in september the board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $six per share or approximately 8200000 which was paid on october one 2020 the dividend appears as an accrual on the september thirty 2020 balance sheet offset by a court we believe that the company has sufficient cash to fund operations for the foreseeable future now i would like to turn the call over to chairman it was a year in which europe had 3rd obm production contract with tier one manufacturer textron king air 360 and king air 260 are new aircraft that will feature our thrust vectoring over throw as standard equipment joined our ongoing obm contracts with pilatus and boeing we are building a solid foundation of recurring revenue that should last for years let me also quickly reiterate what jeff mentioned earlier generated this strong growth and profitability and successfully executed on the king air contract while implementing new safety policy and procedures that have kept all of our employees safe we are pleased to report that our production is on schedule and productive as well as protected by our partners and customers the king air 360 program is just ramping up with the 1st production aircraft delivered to a customer last month the king air 260 is scheduled for delivery in the 3rd half of 2021 we have been shipping process units to textron since the 3rd quarter and expect orders to naturally follow the anticipated increase in production over time in addition to shipping units for installation on the tingey through sixty there are also shipping units for distribution to the service centers where they have been used for retrofits king air currently in service which we estimate represents about a 300000000 total addressable market at this point we are certified for retrofits on the beechcraft king air 300 series equipped with proline 21 and the proline 201 equipped beechcraft king air 200 series other variations of this aircraft are also in the market we are being pursued with some imminence we are consequently also shipping oil travels to our installation partners where it appears many korean owners take their aircraft for service both organizations are aggressively marketing the retrofits we are opening an office in wichita to not only promote the product but also support texta the relationship with t x is going well and provides a solid foundation from which we expand our aerial training market only horizontally across t x platforms but other oems as well as the military we are in conversation with manufacturers of both twin turbo prop twin jet and multi engine aircraft with regard to our aerial training potentially life saving nature of frangible or multi engine aircraft is a feature in which virtually all over the earth have an interest september 2020 we announced that the faa had certified our synthetic frictional installation an overhaul upgrade for the eclipse jet this installation marks isen is 1st upgrade directly to eclipse owners and involves i will now briefly review some of our ongoing programs the pc 24 program has essentially reached steady state production levels we expect to ship close to fifty ships in fiscal 2021 this program remains highly successful and allows us to very satisfied with our performance this program we believe is expected to continue to run for many years offering a predictable stable recurring revenue stream dynamics in the commercial transport market are also essentially unchanged with their cargo delivery services we continue to convert boeing 757 767 and 777 planes including upgrades to our flat panel displays where we once contracted with large installers we are now doing more direct sales to carriers which has proven much more successful there remains over a 1000 operation of 757 767 and 777 that are still in need of retrofitting with an even larger number of seats development work for the us navy f five data computer was completed and we delivered production units for the us navy fleet by profit in the 4th quarter this was a highly successful program and we are now turning our attention to foreign military which also fly the f five and would be a large new market for this versatile aircraft at jct 46 program with boeing is one of our three om production contracts it continues to make steady contribution to our recurring revenue and profitability new orders in the 4th quarter of fiscal 2020 were over $3400000 and backlog as of september thirty 2020 was $3600000 i have been asked to give you a brief overview of our financial results for the past year and the full year were in excess of 19000000 keep in mind that background at the end of any one quarter is not necessarily indicative of future business activity as we generate a good portion of our revenue from customer service and inter quarter booking and ship orders the ongoing pandemic has had peripheral effects on our sales and marketing activities i am limiting our ability to personally meet with customers and prospects by some complexity working with the faa which is operating on the work from home directives i do not believe the pandemic has or will have a significant impact on our business and are excited about the prospects of our portfolio of our products let me transfer the call back to jeff closing remarks thanks shannon our strong

sister and i are much appreciative i also want to acknowledge the fact that the last quarter and the last year are history but it sounds like you guys have set the company up for fabulous growth in the future without being polemic i could make the past look like a small potato so congratulations on that my question as usually goes to the use of cash we have got a company with no debt with solid operating profit and even after the dividend the fair amount of cash on the books any thoughts of either an acquisition or a small regular cash dividend that i think would have a great effect so how do you feel about the stock price yes yes yes yeah i have no interest in doing that anymore if we can reasonably invest in other things we are doing some automation on the floor and and and that kind of thing we are actually looking at dividends on a long term basis because we believe the business itself will generate cash on a regular basis and then we believe that our subsidiaries can we are very conscious of that that is what precipitated the ¢65 yes and yes we continue to look at it especially in light of what might be changes in taxation policy exactly yes that is all that is all i can ask for and again well done you guys are doing a great job positioning this company for the future he was always fun he is a good guy well thank you we miss them too we miss them too but i am hoping after covid jeffs to come on out there and meet you guys and spend some time so i look forward to it ok thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to

the results of the 3rd quarter discuss recent regulatory developments including the acquisition of the assets of columbia gas of massachusetts provide an update on recent developments around our offshore wind partnership with orsted i will start with slide two noting that recurring earning were one02 per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earning of 98 cents per share in the 3rd quarter of 2019 gap results which include a charge of one per share relating to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of columbia gas of massachusetts totaled one01 per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 in the 1st nine months of 2020 our recurring earning excluding columbia gas acquisition costs totaled $twoeighty per share compared with recurring earning of $two69 per share in the 1st nine months of 2019 and excluding the northern pass transmission impairment charge gap results for september of this year were $two76 per share turning to our business segments our electric trans distribution segment earned sixty cents per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of 61 cents per share in the 3rd quarter of 2019 the low earnings were a result of both higher storm restoration costs and property tax expense as well as the impact of of share dilution our electric transmission segment earned 36 cents per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of 33 cents per share in the 3rd quarter of 2019 improved results were driven by the continued investment and reliability in our transmission facilities proximately offset by share dilution our natural gas distribution segment lost ¢four per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with a loss of ¢five per share in the 3rd quarter of last year improved results were due to higher revenues i should note that because we did not close on our acquisition of columbia gas of massachusetts assets until october ninth the transaction had no impact on this the gas segment the segment during the quarter each quarter this year we have booked acquisition related costs at the parent it has segregated them for increased transparency beginning in the 4th quarter of this year ongoing results of our new gas franchise which is named eversource gas company of massachusetts will be reflected in the natural gas segment integration related costs however will continue to be recorded separately at the parent and excluded from our recurring gap earnings our water distribution segment earned ¢seven per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of ¢six per share in the 3rd quarter of 2019 improved results were due to a $33500000 after tax gains on the sale of our hingham massachusetts facilities to the town eversource parent earned ¢three per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 excluding the columbia gas of massachusetts asset acquisition costs equal to our earnings in the 3rd quarter of of last year as you probably noted in our earnings release and can see on slide three we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings per share guidance of $threesixty to $threeseventy and that is excluded the non recurring costs related to the purchase of columbia gas of massachusetts assets we are also reaffirming our long term eps growth rate of five to seven from our core regulated business through the year 2024 we continue to be to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range largely due to the investment we need to make on behalf of our customers as we have outlined to you earlier in the year as a reminder while we fully expect the columbia gas assets to be to our earnings per share starting immediately in 2021 we have not yet updated our long term financial outlook to reflect the acquisition of columbia gas assets in our our capital our cap ex or our earnings growth in addition as we have disclosed previously earnings from offshore wind would be incremental to our core business growth we will provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecast adding in eversource gas company of massachusetts projections and provide an update of our offshore wind partnership during our year end call in late february from the 3rd quarter results i will turn to slide four and our experience restoring power after tropical storm isaias ravaged connecticut on october 4th we serve 149 cities and town in connecticut and every one of these communities suffered damage from isaias much of it catastrophic as you can see on the slide we had nearly 22000 damage locations that we had to address and brought in an army of electric restoration and tree crews to restore power all the while working on the restoration in a pandemic setting the restoration process lasted nine days meaning we completed our work one to two days faster than we had in the last two tropical storms that hit connecticut even though we had thirty to 35 more damage locations and most importantly we completed that work safely with no serious electrical contact and no covid exposure among the enormous workforce we brought to connecticut just just a tremendous effort by all of our employees from across all parts of of eversource at this time we estimate that deferred costs across all three states will total more than $275000000 with the vast majority of that incurred in connecticut that figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received we are still we are still actively pursuing invoices from 100s of vendors that assisted us during the statewide restoration effort where we were setting new poles or hanging miles of new wires or replacing 100s of transforms there related costs are to be capitalized the ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation on performance and safely and expeditiously restoring power to our customers is pending an ongoing review by the connecticut public utilities regulatory authority or pura that review is scheduled to be completed in late april of 2021 sticking with our regulated business i will throw up the slide five and a review of this year is distribution rate reviews this past friday the massachusetts department of public utilities issued its decision in the nstar gas rate review that we filed last year it supports our continued investment in the nstar gas system on behalf of our 300000 customers the decision allows nstar gas to increase distribution revenues by $23000000 on an annualized basis the bpu approved the of ninenine and a capital structure with 5477 equity it also permits us to implement performance based rating for a ten year term that which sounds uprating performance by nstar gas will target annual base rate increases of inflation +one03 this is an earning sharing mechanism that would return 75 of the benefit to customers should we receive the roe of tennine and sharing mechanism on the down side if our roe falls below eightfour also exciting is the decision also approves our 1st ever geothermal pilot program another longstanding rate proceeding involves public service of new hampshire in last month we and all the parties to the psnh rate case filed a proposed settlement in the rate review that that has been pending for nearly you know a year and a half as you can see from the slide we settled on a $45000000 annualized rate increase that includes a ninethree return on equity and a 54four equity layer should regulators approve the settlement the permanent increase would take effect in january january 1st of 2021 you may recall that the new hampshire public utility commission allowed us to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately $28000000 back in july july 1st of 2019 the final approval rates would be retroactive back to that date eighteen months we would recover that in a true up over the course of of the year 2021 we can settle consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome to psnh is 1st decade and have asked the the new hampshire puc to approve the settlement before the end of november from the rate review reviews six and our recently completed acquisition of the assets of columbia gas in massachusetts for $1100000000 of cash excluding working capital adjustments most of these assets were assigned to eversource gas company in massachusetts a new subsidiary i mentioned that we formed in may of 2020 as you can see on the slide most of eversource gas is service territory is adjacent to nstar gas or yankee gas service territories additionally nstar electric already provides electric service to about twenty of the communities that eversource gas serves with natural gas as a result we expect to realize operational benefits for our newest 330000 natural gas customers in the communities where they live the finance the transaction we sold approximately $500000000 of equity in june and we financed the debt portion of the transaction in august and again we are very confident that this transaction will be to our earnings per share in 2021 and incrementally in the years ahead a critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits to all stakeholders is an eight year rate plan that we negotiated with the massachusetts attorney general and other key parties prior to our filing with the massachusetts department of public utilities the key elements of that plan are listed on slide seven it will allow us to make the necessary investments in our eversource gas of mass system and reflect those investments in rates in a reasonably timely manner we are thankful that the dpu approved the settlement and the acquisition very quickly now that we have the keys to the property and a and a long term plan in place we are we are focused on providing our new eversource gas customers with the same high level of service that we provide our other 550000 natural gas distribution company is customers that we have in massachusetts and connecticut as i noted earlier we plan to integrate eversource gas of massachusetts into our updated five year projections that we will provide you in february we continue to project approximately $3000000000 of regulated company capital investments this year despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and the need to take crews off of capital projects for a significant part of august to deal with the aftermath of tropical storm isaias through september our capital investments totaled approximately $2200000000 that is approximately the same level as this time last last year in 2019 we made considerable progress on our transmission capital program in the 3rd quarter putting several projects into service at or below budget and these benefits of of lower costs will flow through to new new england is electric customers from the regulated business alternative offshore wind partnership with orsted on we have had a few developments since our july 31st earnings call the most significant development was that in august the bureau of ocean energy management posted a complete review schedule for our 130 megawatt south fork project on long island the schedule culminates in a decision on a construction and operations permit or cop as it is known in mid january of 2022 we are also making progress on the other permits in september we filed a settlement proposal with the new york department of public service to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the construction operations and maintenance of the project that lies within new york jurisdiction in october several of the new york state agencies signaled their support for this proposal by signing on to the agreement we have structured an agreement on host community payments in the necessary real estate ranks with the town of east hampton where the offshore cable would land and would be connected to the long island grid new york public service commission siting hearing for south fork is scheduled to commence the 1st week of december we continue to expect the state signing to com to be completed in 2021 before boem issues the cop based on that schedule we now the project to enter service in the 4th quarter of 2023 this is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our may and july earnings calls while we were still waiting for the review schedule turning to our other projects you recall that we filed our boem application for revolution wind in march we expect boem to establish a review schedule for that project in the 1st quarter of 2021 we do not expect to provide an updated in service for this project until the schedule is issued but at this point it it it is unlikely that the project go into service by the end of 2023 also we filed our sunrise wind application with boem on september 1st and expect boem to establish a review schedule for the project next year once we receive that review schedule we will be able to better estimate more up to date inservice schedule but again at this time it would seem that the end 24 in service is is not likely we are very optimistic about our offshore wind business and expect to have many opportunities over the coming months and years to expand our offshore wind partnership beyond the 1700 and fourteen megawatts currently under contract as we mentioned before we have enough lease capacity con to construct at least 4000 megawatts on the 550 square miles of ocean tracks that we have under long term lease off off the southeast coast of massachusetts to this point on october 20th we submitted a number of alternative bids into the 2nd new york offshore wind rfp where the state is looking for between 1000 and 2500 megawatts new york state officials have indicated that they expect to announce the winner or winners before the the the end of the year our sunrise project as a reminder won the largest portion of new york is 1st rnp last year 880 megawatts additionally just last week rhode island governor gina raimondo announced that her state will target early next year for issuing an rfp for 600 megawatts of additional offshore wind as you know the majority or our revolution wind capacity 400 megawatts will be sold to rhode island with a with the balance going to connecticut thank you very much for joining us this morning and i will turn the call back over to jeff thanks phil and i will turn the call back to john just to remind you how to enter questions in the q a queue thank you if you do have a question press star then one on your touch tone phone once again that is star then one on your touch tone phone if you wish to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key thank you john our 1st question this morning is from from guggenheim good morning char good morning jeff good morning phil good morning char so a couple questions here i just just for some your language around sort of the growth rate you know obviously which still excludes columbia gas and offshore wind obviously these are you know very creative and you are already conservatively kind of well within your band so should we sort of be thinking about these incremental items as potentially ringing your growth to maybe six to eight or something that will hit you to the top end and then sort of extend that runway with your current trajectory i mean the reason why i ask is six to eight seems to sort of that new top quartile bucket in our space where five to seven is becoming a little bit more typical so curious how you are sort of thinking about this do you see value to be a talk to be in the top quartile or you do not think you need a for it so curious on on that as we think about plan sure char thanks for the for the question and i hope you you are doing well certainly the addition of columbia gas and will be additive to our existing forecast so we are we are working through all the the details of that we we are able to provide you with a full up update in february but we we expect to get a significant benefit from that from that franchise and in saying we also expect as those offshore wind projects come online online to also be additive to remind folks i know i said it but a new gig that the five to seven growth rate is from the from the existing core business which does not include columbia assets it also does not include you know grid modernization activities that are currently pending in in connecticut and new hampshire or or ami that that that could could be a potential to move forward relatively soon in in massachusetts in terms of taking a a look at that by the by the regulator so i see that we have a number of levers to grow and grow at at at at even a higher rate than we had expected before got it that is helpful and then so just lastly for me is can you just maybe talk a little bit about your expectations for the legislation in connecticut i mean the legislation that passed was more constructive than the giraffe legislation but obviously some disappointment with the refunds and and penalties offset by the potential upside from like pbrs so sort of how are you guys thinking about this internally sure the energy legislation we have we have said consistently that pbr is a is a formula and a template that that that we think is effective we have pbr structures in in other states and we think that having a a robust discussion on pbr in in connecticut makes a lot of sense and we are very very supportive of of that provision yeah really you know the energy legislation directed pura to to evaluate that and and open a docket by the middle of next year so june of of 2021 and it it it authorizes pura to you know establish storm standards and potential penalties as you as you mentioned there is an there is an increased potential for penalties currently those penalties are twofive of our distribution revenues in connecticut and that goes up goes up to four so you know it also gives pura some additional time you know to to review cases so you know which is also something that you know seems to be appropriate so the the legislation as you as you indicated it out there and pura is working through the details of it and we expect to be working through that in a constructive way with them over the next several months got it terrific that is all i had today thanks guys thanks char thanks char our next question is from steve from wolf good morning steve good morning phil can you hear me yes steve i can okay great so just question on the delays in your offshore wind projects could you maybe talk to i know we do not know the exact timing but how should we think about the impact on the economics of those projects from from delay or or puts and takes and is it hurting the economics of the projects you are already have signed up to yeah thanks for your question steve and i i hope you you and your family are doing well i i just the to to go to the the puts and takes piece you know i i do not think that folks should automatically think that schedule changes result in ups or downs it is some benefits or that that people may not may not consider in that so certainly if you are looking at adjusted schedules you might be able to adjust your installation vessel optimization better you know the turbine sizes themselves are getting larger so you could move to larger turbine sizes if if projects are are due at a later time period versus an earlier time period and certainly the cost supply chain and availability of materials and supply chain is only getting better so so i would say that you know there is opportunities for improved cost economics as you move into a schedule that you know you may not think of you know i think people generally think of projects as you know if there is a delay it is a cost increase but that there are other elements at work here on the offshore wind business that offset that how about how about any negatives how about like do you lose are you going to lose any tax credits or anything else yes certainly depending on i guess just time value yes in terms of the the schedules we are looking at we do not expect to have any impact on our tax assumptions but certainly significant delays delays could have impacts on on your tax assumption delays could also have impact on a contract that you have with counter parties but in in our specific case so that is the general case in our specific case we are confident that we have the ability to work within both of those the tax area and the contract area in an effective way with where we we see the schedules going in the future okay thank you our next question is from angie from seaport global good morning angie good morning so i have a question about massachusetts you you guys have this very constructive decision for and for gas of the state is clearly looking at the future of gas ldcs and so how do you guys see it especially in light of the fact that you just acquired an additional gas utility in massachusetts good morning angie and thank you for you your question and hope you are doing well but you know the the way that i would position it or the way that i think people should think about it is that there is nobody 1st of all who is more aggressive in terms of looking at clear energy strategies and carbon reduction than than eversource in terms of having a carbon neutral goal by 2030 we have worked effectively with all parties in in in in all states but in massachusetts where the attorney general and others want to take a look at you know sort of the the the future or outlook in terms of the the the gas business we have we have been working with these intervening parties for for many years and we will continue to work with them on what we think an appropriate strategy is there so this is a long term outlook in terms of if the state wants to you know be have aggressive clean energy and and carbon reduction targets we are wholly supportive of that and we we look forward to working you know with all the parties there but we do not see it as a as a threat to the gap distribution business in the region at all okay and and in connecticut you know this this recent back and forth between you guys and pura about the extension of the the lack of basically disconnections on the back of covid i mean it is it sounds a bit concerning that pura is pushing back so strong that they do not need to sign off on that extension i mean i would assume that it is a an actual practice normal practice for a regulated utility to seek recovery of these you know under recovered revenues can you give us a sense you know how you see it in connecticut given the latest you know legislative changes and also some deterioration and and you know regulatory relationships in the state yes so we are not doing shut offs across all any of our franchises at at at this and specifically you know we are working you know we are working with customers we are working with fuel agencies assistance agencies on an approach here that works that will work best for customers we have lost we engaged with pura as you mentioned and other government officials you know on this issue so i am i am i am confident that we will get to a a good place here you know nobody wants to burden customers with with anymore than than we are already all of us are bur burdened with in terms of the economic conditions and and and covid etc so we are we are working through the issue we are working with customers as i say and some of the assistance agencies and and i am i am sure we will get to a a good outcome here very good thank you thank you angie next question is from julian from bank of america good morning julian hey good morning team thanks for the time hope all of you are doing well and safe families as well perhaps just to to pick up off of or perhaps clarify if i can some of the last rounds of questions when you talk about the the four q roll forward are you going to be rolling to 2025 and then more specifically how do you think about including or excluding offshore wind in light of the uncertainty you described should we expect that offshore wind should continue to be at least for those projects where there is an un determined date to continue to be excluded there julian thanks for your question and your comments and i hope and hope your you and your family are doing well too just to clarify we will our history has been to add another year into the into the outlook so 2025 would be that that year since our forecast goes through the 2024 time period so that is something that you should expect to see and really our our view on how to look at offshore wind it it does not change by by any of the schedule items we we talked about today or it we have we have look at it as showing the the core business as as the driver and the foundational element of the of the growth rate and then to show that wind is additive to that in in in what way so that would be the intent going forward i think that when i have been asked this question before the answer is is is was and still is as as more years of wind come in to the actual results of that particular year then to me it makes more sense to to roll it all together but at this stage the expectation especially in this upcoming february update would be to have the core business extend that through 2025 and then show offshore wind in in addition to that and and if you do not mind elaborating a little bit further i i know that there is a certain degree of uncertainty on exactly the perming schedule that inhibits your ability to say when these projects in a region service can you at least try to put some more parameters around what each of these pieces of the process could take so if there is like a window if you will it may be too early yeah so it in terms of you know there there is people have realized out there and and we have been asked questions and i i think you have asked us the questions in terms of you know with with delays on wind and other things there has been some delays in terms of boem is notice of intent of intent and and to prepare their environmental impact statement and frankly we we would have we would have expected in our original schedule schedules that some of these lags that you know to prepare the the environmental impact statement would be would be out by now so these are expected i i believe you know that that plans scheduled for reviewing and releasing these is is underway so i would not expect you know significant change in the schedule but at this stage it would be prudent to wait to see the the the schedule that comes out of boem before we we commit to a final inservice date but i would not expect it to be significant got it excellent all right i will pass it from there thank you so much thanks julian next question is from from evercore good morning dragesh hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question just just following up on you know the the offshore wind here what to expect you know the this eis decision i suppose that is going to be out statement rather than month or or early december what to expect there and then how does that impact your your future project timelines yeah the these notice of in of intent they contain a plan schedule you know that that in the analyze they have contained boem is plan schedule for reviewing each of the costs so that would be an important piece of information to to have available so that that is really the what is included in in that is it is a plan schedule for reviewing the costs that that comes out with the the notice of in intent all right so i guess maybe i am talking about the environmental impact statement is not there an environmental impact statement that boem is supposed to sort of put out here in in the next few weeks you are talking about the one for vineyard right yes yes zero okay yeah i am not i i apologize you would probably have to ask vineyard wind on about that okay but but but that does not have a read through for you or your offshore wind projects i guess that is what my question was well certainly all of the developers off the coast they we have been going through this of impact study and and looking at spacing and of of when turbines and we came up with a a one nautical mile a one nautical mile spacing so certainly there could be components that come out in in any decision for vineyard wind that you would have to you know take a look at to see if they have any impact you know to other developers including us but in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing i think vineyard might might have a better perspective of that okay perfect that is all i had guys thank you so much thank you all right thanks dragesh next question is from jeremy from jp morgan good morning jeremy good morning thanks for having me just want to start of with what are the benefits of looping con ed into the proposed sunrise ii sunrise wind ii rfp here eversource has experience in building transmission and i am curious what additional competitive advantages con ed provides here to this specific project can you provide details on potential ownership interests for each entity and does ownership interest change once construction is complete and the project is inservice thanks for your question jeremy and hope you hope you are doing well i i i guess i would say on the 1st part of the question that sort of obviously con ed has local knowledge of of new york and their service territory and the and their network and the operation of the transmission and delivery system that that are valuable to any party if you are if you are operating in new york so i would say they bring a a knowledge and skill set of of the area that certainly we do not have you know as as depth a knowledge as as they would so certain skill sets there that the local player would bring so in terms of you know what the components of a relationship would be those things are all to be discussed as we as we move through but it is certainly beneficial i think to the project to have somebody with con ed is skill sets involved got it and as far as potential ownership interests is there any kind of thoughts on how that could develop not at this time no got it and then will the delay in offshore wind permitting have any impact on the plans is it is it fair to assume the $700000000 of equity in your current five year plan moves to the back end here and how is offshore wind cap ex spending tracked year to date versus the $300 to $400000000 range that you expected we have not disclosed a range that we have expected we have we have talked about how much we expected to to spend you know this year you know you know just for the year 2020 and it is tracking somewhat close to that i would say it is probably a little bit under what we expected at at at this time in terms of the financing you are right that is we announced a year ago you know this $2000000000 of of equity need that would support the forecast and we we issued onethree of that so there is $700000000 remaining that and and i would say the same thing as i have said all along is we would be op opportunistic and consider what our capital forecasts are and and what the market conditions are you know as we look to fulfill the rest of that offering that we discussed got it that is helpful i will leave it there thank you thank you all right thanks jeremy next question is from paul patterson from glenrock good morning paul good morning guys good morning paul i just wanted to follow up on the the the draft decision in connecticut on monday and what your thoughts were on it any if it if it were in fact to become a a final order what the what the potential impact could be are you talking about the draft information on on rates or what can you be more specific sure there was a draft decision on on monday in the the pura case associated with with the rates right the the rate review that was reversed that proceeding i i i can tell you that the the specific name no that is okay i you know i just wanted to i just wanted to be specific because as somebody else mentioned there has been a number of different sure so this so as you recall we that pura suspending the rates that we had implemented over the summer both we and to take an additional look think this is what you are referring to so we did receive a draft order and really it is kind of hot off the press we are apparently evaluating that and and and we are going to you know see what comments we might have and comments on the draft are due i thin it is the the 12th of november so we have some time to to flush out any anything but it is consistent with on 1st blush i would say it is consistent with pura is desire to have some rate changes you know move instead of implementing rates at peak times of usage maybe such as july implement them on you know change the time of it to implement it maybe in a in a shoulder month like as like may or something and move to annual reconciliations as opposed to semi annual so this this would you know it does it does delays this could have effectively this is a cash flow item and it could have an impact on our our our deferrals that that we have in place there but you know i think it generally is consistent with the desire as we said to move off of these peak periods for making rate changes and shoulder period and see where we go from there but we are we are we are actively reviewing that last night and today and we will be and and have any comments that we would have reviewed by as i said on the 12th okay there there was one part of it that would reduce the the carrying charges from the from to a prime rate on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms is there any do we have any i know this is hot off the press and everything but do we have any sort of forecast as to what the those reconciliations mechanisms like how much capital might be tied up in those no that is a point too the the carrying costs at at prime which is consistent in in some other jurisdictions i guess so that it is not a significant you know item but it it is certainly one that pura had put out there in the draft just to recover the deferred balances with with a prime prime rate versus a a wack okay and then just we we do not know who the president is going to be it seems but if there was a change in administration do you think that could have or not have maybe a a significant impact on the boem permitting process with respect to offshore wind the the the permitting process i mean when when we meet with with boem b zero b zero e m you know the the the bureau of ocean energy management you know that people are active we are we are actively working we are actively having you know zoom meetings or team calls or whatever the the the the video capabilities are that we are using but you know we are actively working that and i can assure you that the people in the agencies are working full speed regardless of you know who who is you know president or what the election results are but certainly it would be good to have you know the results of the election i think we have all as a as a country you know that the election results are something that we have all targeted out there and wherever you fall on the the political spectrum it is good to have certainty as opposed to uncertainties so i think we are all looking forward to what the final outcome is there so we can we can move forward okay but just so it just so for my clarity the process of the boem is pretty much the the agency that that so the bureaucratic process is going on really you do not see a significant change one way or the other it it regardless of the the outcome of the presidential election is is that the am am i right understanding that yeah i would say that the work at the agencies is is going on you know they are you know we have been meeting regularly going through questions we are working through the various state agencies so no i i would say that the work is continuing at the at the as you say the the bureaucrat level okay awesome thanks so much you are welcome thanks paul next question is from mike weinstein from good morning mike hey good morning morning phil hi good hope you are hope you are doing well hey i i maybe you could just give a quick 22nd update on what you think the outcome at ferc might be for transmission roes and you know considering if the election outcome may has any effect on any of this in accelerating an outcome well mike that is a that is a very big crystal ball that you are asking so but again thanks and i hope you are you are doing well thanks for your question i you know it is i wish i had a you know a better answer than to say that you know it is working its way through we we do not really have a specific clarity as to when ferc might you know come up with something on the new england pending new england cases and certainly impact of the election one way or the other what what that could have in terms of commissioners and that type of thing so you know the only thing i know for certain is we are we are looking at our ten57 rates and reserving to that level and actually eleven74 cap and you know we will just have to wait and see what the final the final outcome will will look at but i do not really have a an answer i know in in years past when i have tried to when i have tried to think that one was coming or it was going a certain way it really had not has not materialized so i think it is best to wait til the the final the final order comes out at this point or orders as it may be right hey and bigger crystal ball question would be you know i know that hydra quebec has a pretty big long term construction plan for general you know hydro generation up there and i know that their long term plans included lots and lots of northern pass type transmission lots you know do you think there is ever a time at some point where there might be another another wack or another go at transmission at some point you know big transmission project think a lot of that is dependent upon what the states want to get right so this this these are going to be processes now that are driven by state is clean energy policies and the state is desire to have either offshore wind or solar or hydro in in the mix so you know there are certainly there is a lot of activity at the states now i mean the states in our area all want aggressive carbon reduction targets so it would not be out of the question to see a state you know want to you know contract for for more of that but there is nothing there is nothing planned on our end as nothing that i see at this stage on the state is agenda that would would say that but when you say the word ever you know that is a long time right so it seems like the offshore wind program really has kind of supplanted that at least for the time being yeah i would say that is a that is a good way of looking at it okay great thank you very much okay mike thanks mike our next question is from kim from goldman sachs good morning ensu good morning guys my only question is and apologies if i missed this but could just give us an update on the connecticut filings and any updates on expected deci decisions from the commission and you know timing of investments etc thanks for your question too and i hope you and your family are doing well you did not miss it i i mentioned you know in terms of what items could be additive to our five to seven core business growth rate i alluded to in connecticut or new hampshire or potentially additional ami dockets in in massachusetts but there is really been no change there we all the parties filed comments and plans back in in july and certainly you can understand there has been a lot there has been a lot going on and and i i think i may have said isaias was in october but we all know that isaias was in august so since august there has been a lot of you know there has been a lot of focus on on on storms and there has been a lot of dockets and somebody else mentioned we have dockets going on in terms of moratoriums and whatnot so there is you know the expectation was there was going to be another sort of go round and another process in connecticut towards the end of the year i really have not seen anything that would indicate specific schedule on that so i guess our best guess is still you know it is still in the in the pipeline and you may see more activity on the grid bond there in connecticut as we move over the next several months but in terms of it being in our forecast you know i want to be clear that there is currently no you know zero there is no grid bond spending in our capital forecast for any you know grid bond programs that have not been approved like in connecticut or new hampshire so you know once they are approved and once we see what what our role would be in them and once we see what that you know looks like then if we have more confidence in putting in the in the plan so that could be something we have information on by the time we get to the february update so you know i will i will we will have to stay tuned on that it makes sense that is all i had thank you guys and stay safe thanks ensu next question is from david arcaro from morgan stanley morning david good morning hi jeff hi phil thanks so much for taking my questions had a quick follow up on offshore wind you know in light of some of the recent delays i was wondering if that changes how you are strategizing around other bids that you are putting into future rfps like baking in more contingency anything that might give a greater level of comfort around the economics of future projects that you might win thank you dave for your comment and i hope you and your family are doing well certainly every piece of information that you get you know and this is not just offshore wind you know this this is you know on on all our business but i will i will focus on offshore wind since that is the question you know every every month that goes by every quarter that goes by we gain more insight and information about construction about you you know weights about about you know lot of factors and all of those things all of those things are factored into subsequent bids so the information that we have available to us you know as we are moving into a bid recent bid in new york is different than we had from bids that we made you know in rhode island or connecticut or massachusetts so every every data point is important to us and we factor that into the next bid so i i say that absolutely that schedules and how how you make it through the siting process and all of that informs you know subsequent bids and so i can assure you that all those things get get you know up to the minute attention before a bid goes out okay got it that is helpful and i just wanted to touch on just zero and m costs in the zero and m budget could you remind us how you see that trajectory just for the overall business going forward you have been you have got a great track record of controlling zero and m so what are the key levers in your in your tool belt so that you that you would focus on going forward for managing zero and m so there is a you know we have we have got people process and and technology right so all of those things are are leveraged to help you know our capital program as well as our our operating program so you know we continue to implement systems and technologies that improves processes that makes it more effect you know efficient and and effective workforce so we have still a robust i would say series of technology improvements if you if you i will start off by just setting the stage in the guidance we did we said that we expected zero and m costs to be you know down this year and then just for the forecast period kind of flat going going forward so how how are we able to do that it it is by some of these technology changes and we have been implementing more productivity management tools and tools for our you know individual line workers and gas fitters and in the field to get their work to update their work that we can then take that and automatically update drawings and files we do not need you know to hand it off to somebody and so there is still these productivity technology changes are happening some went in last year some going in this year and and more planned for next so that that will be i would say the lever or the under the the underpinning for us to have the ability to continue to improve processes and and take unneeded costs out of the business okay great that is helpful thanks so much for the caller you are welcome thank you david next question is from travis miller from morningstar good morning travis good morning thank you quick clarification on the storm costs that $275000000 number if i heard you correctly how much did you expense in the quarter and how much was either deferred or capitalized or and will be pending that the regulatory filing that you mentioned sure that that amount that you repeated was the deferred that is how much of a storm cost that we deferred in for tropical storm isaias and that was across all states but primarily in connecticut so that is our deferral that would be you know once a storm gets to a certain level it triggers a deferral so we that that all is deferred storm costs right now in terms of if there are other storms certainly we have we have an active corner for storms in general but there are other storms other than isaias that did impact the quarter i mean our our storm costs were up you know about $10000000 for the for the quarter and went through you know our our zero and m so it is not the you know for the quarter it it is it is at that level and then the $274 or five you mentioned is the is the deferred across the system okay great that is that is very helpful thank you and then a quick follow up to the discussion on the connecticut legislation and there is some language in there as i understood it about the general assembly having some review power there what is your thought in terms of the scope of what the general assembly separate from pura could do in terms of either taking back some earnings or rate changes stuff like that separate from what is going on in the pura well certainly the general assembly can enact legislation that it feels is appropriate in in any matter so you know i i do think specifically to the the energy legislation that was enacted recently in connecticut that most you know things all were you know for the most part moved to to pura you know so the the regulators of the the i guess i would look at it as the legislation would provide the intent the framework the direction and then pura is the one who is going to be implementing you know they are going to be the ones who evaluate the performance based rates they will they will be the ones who initiate the storm standards and and things like that and and look at you know should there be penalties should there be food you know penalties and things like that so i think that effectively you know the the the general assembly can can certainly enact any and all legislation it it feels it it should and and the way that this legislation seems to have turned out was that then the implementation of that legislation is in the hands of pura okay so the potential for any other risks for any other call backs would likely go through pura instead of going through the general assembly based on that connecticut legislation that you talked about great yeah as i say you know the pura the dockets are active in in and will be active over you know a certain time dates that the legislation has given pura so would expect that pura will have have the pen on this but again as i say you know what legislation can can always be enacted in in any in any area yeah okay great appreciate all right thank you travis our next question is from andrew weisel from scotia good morning andrew hey good morning thanks for fitting me in 1st question is with the two rate cases now completed can you remind us what subsidiaries might be next to file general rate cases you have plenty of regulatory items of course with other initiatives but for general rate cases well according to the requirements in connecticut connecticut could be an area that is required to file by the interesting framework that is there and that would be something that would be sort of a you know next year sort of event but other than that we are we are pretty much out of the regulatory arena okay great then on offshore wind can you just thinking sorry can you share your latest thinking on how big you are willing to let that business get you have talked a lot about the opportunities that you are pursuing beyond the three existing projects any thinking as far as from an earnings mix perspective if there is a limitation or would the will you plan to just bid bid bid and get as many projects as your leases will support well i want to be clear on this because i think it is a very important point that bid bid bid is the best strategy our strategy is to have a financial discipline about growing that business in a way that provides appropriate levels of of returns that that benefit our shareholders so just by winning a bid you know that does not do it it has to be we have to and we continue to maintain financial discipline in terms of the amounts that we bid and the returns that that we are looking for so it as long as the returns are at an appropriate level that for that business it makes sense to make the bid win the bid and and and expand the business there the what we have said is we our tracks the what we own off the coast of or what what we have access to in terms of the lease areas you know we could do about 4000 at least 4000 megawatts of offshore wind so there is kind of a you know that that is the maximum capabilities that we we have so it is not an an infinite growth type of thing and we had indicated that when leases were available that are not in our region that we were not interested in them so leases in our region like the ones we are involved in are are good but other lease areas you know that is that is not for us in other parts of the mid atlantic etc so it is a we are constrained by the lease area and when our we are guided by the financial discipline too on our bids and our returns got it that is really helpful i guess i should have said bid bid bid responsibly okay thanks a lot guys and i hope you stay well andrew thanks all right andrew thank you very much that sort of wraps up today if you have any follow up questions please give us a call or send us an email and we look forward to speaking and seeing many of during the virtual eei conference next week and thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference thank you for participating and you may now disconnect thank you all right thank",
            "prediction": "welcome to the eversource energy q 3220 results conference call my name is john arber and i will be your operator for today is call at this time all participants are on speaker mode later we will conduct a question and answer session during the question and answer session if you do have a question please press star one on your touchtone phone please note that this conference is being recorded i now turn the call over to jeffery cotkin thank you very much john thank you for joining us i am jeff cotkin eversource energies vice president for investor relations during this call we will be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website and as you can see on slide one some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the u s private securities litigation reform act of 995 the forward looking statements are based on management is current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecast and projections these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on form ten k for the year ended december 31st 2019 and our form ten k for the three months ended june 32020 point also our explanation of how and why we use certain non gap measures and how those measures reconcile to gap results is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent ten k speaking today will be phil lambo our executive vice president and cfo also joining us today are joe nolen our executive vice president for strategy customer and corporate relations john moreira our treasurer and senior vp for finance and regulatory and jay booth our controller now i will turn slide two and turn over the call to phil thank you jeff good morning everyone i hope everyone on the call remains healthy and that your families are safe and doing well this morning i will cover a variety of areas review the results of the 3rd quarter discuss recent regulatory matters and provide an update on our current projects thank you to provide an update on recent developments around our offshore wind partnership with orsted i will start with slide two noting that recurring earnings were one02 per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of ¢98 per share in the 3rd quarter of 2019 gap results which included a charge of one per share were announced related to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of columbia gas of massachusetts totaling one01 per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 in the 1st nine months of 2020 our recurring earnings excluding columbia gas acquisition costs total $twoeighty per share compared with recurring earnings of $two69 per share in the 1st nine months of 2000 our electric transmission distribution segment earned ¢sixty per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of ¢61 per share in the 3rd quarter of 2019 the lower earnings were a result of both higher fuel costs and lower demand storm restoration costs and property tax expense as well as the impact of some shared dilutions our electric transmission segment earned ¢36 per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of ¢33 per share in the 3rd quarter of 2019 improved results were driven by the continued investment and reliability in our transmission facilities partially offset by our natural gas distribution segment lost ¢four per share in the 3rd quarter of 2020 compared with a loss of ¢five per share in the 3rd quarter of last year improved results were due to higher revenues i should note that because we did not close on our acquisition of columbia gas of massachusetts assets until october ninth the transaction had no impact on this the gas segment this segment during the quarter each quarter this year we booked acquisition related costs at the parent and have segregated them for increased transparency beginning in the 4th quarter of this year ongoing results of our new gas franchise which is named eversource gas company of massachusetts will be reflected in the natural gas segment integration related costs however will continue to be recorded separately at the parent and excluded from our recurring gap earnings our water distribution segment earned ¢seven per share in the 3rd quarter 2020 compared with earnings of ¢six per share in the 3rd quarter of 2019 improved results were due to a $3500000 after tax gain on the sale of our arington massachusetts facility as you probably noted in our earnings release and can see on slide three we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings per share guidance of $threesixty to $three we are also reaffirming our long term eps growth rate of five to seven from our core regulated business through the year 2024 we continue to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range largely due to the investments we need to make on behalf of our customers as we grow as a reminder while we fully expect the columbia gas assets to be accretive to our earnings per share starting immediately in 2021 we have not yet updated our long term financial outlook to reflect the acquisition of columbia gas assets in our capital or capex or our earnings growth in addition as we disclosed previously earnings from offshore wind will begin in 2021 will provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecasts adding in eversource gas company massachusetts projections and provide an update of our offshore wind partnership during our year end call in late february from the 3rd quarter results i will turn to slide four and our experience restoring power after tropical storms we serve 149 cities and towns in connecticut and everyone of these communities suffered damage from isaias much of it catastrophic as you can see on the slide we had nearly 22000 damage locations that we had to address and brought in an army of electric restoration and tree crews to restore power the restoration process lasted nine days meaning we completed our work one to two days faster than he had in the last two tropical storms that hit connecticut even though we had thirty to 35 more damage locations and most importantly we completed that work safely with no serious electrical contact and no covid exposure among the enormous work force we brought to the site just a tremendous effort by all of our employees from across all parts of eversource at this time we estimate that deferred costs across all three states will total more than $275000000 with the vast majority of that sum incurred in connecticut that figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received we are still actively pursuing invoices from 100s of vendors that assisted us during the statewide restoration effort where we were setting new poles or hanging miles of new wires or replacing 100s of transformers these related costs are not to be capitalized the ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation of performance in safely and expeditiously restoring power to our customers is pending an ongoing review that review is scheduled to be completed in late april of 2021 sticking with our regulated business i will direct to slide five in a review of this year is distribution rate reviews this past friday the massachusetts department of public utilities issued its decision in the enstar gas case it supports our continued investment in the nstar gas system on behalf of our 300000 customers the decision allows nstar gas to increase distribution revenues by $22300000 on an annualized basis the dpu approved the narrowway of ninenine and a capital structure with 6477 equity this is an earnings sharing mechanism that would return 75 of the benefit to customers should we receive the roe of tennine and sharing mechanism on the downside if our roe falls below eightfour our decision also approves our 1st ever geothermal pilot program our other long standing rate proceeding involves public service of new hampshire in new hampshire last month we and all the parties to the psnh rate case filed a proposed settlement in the rate review that has been pending for nearly you know a year and a half you can see from the slides we settled on a $45000000 annualized rate increase that includes a ninenine this is a message from the new hampshire public utility commission the commission has approved a 54four equity layer should regulators approve the settlement the permanent increase would take effect in january january 1st of 2021 you may recall that the new hampshire public utility commission allowed us to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately $28000000 back in july july 1st of 1919 the final approved rates would be retroactively back to that date or eighteen months we would recover that in a true up over the course of of the year 2020 to 2021 we can consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome to psnh is 1st general increase in about a decade and avast the the new hampshire pu c to approve the settlement before the end of november i will turn to slide six and our recently completed acquisition of the assets of columbia gas of massachusetts for $1100000000 in cash excluding working capital adjustments most of these assets were assigned to eversource gas company in massachusetts a new subsidiary i mentioned that we formed in may of 2020 as you can see on the slide much of eversource gas is service territory is adjacent to nstar additionally enstar electric already provides electric service to about twenty of the communities that eversource gas serves with natural gas as a result we expect to realize operational benefits for our newest 300000 natural gas customers in the communities where they live to finance the transaction we sold approximately $500000000 of equity and we finance the death portion of the transaction in august and again we are very confident that this transaction will be accretive to our earnings per share in 2021 and incrementally accretive in the years ahead a critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits to all stakeholders is an eight year rate plan that we negotiated with the massachusetts attorney general and other key parties prior to our filing with the massachusetts the key elements of that plan are listed on flight seven it will allow us to make the necessary investments in our ever source gas of mass system and reflect those investments in rates in an unusually timely manner we are thankful that the dpu approved the settlement and the acquisition very quickly now that we have the keys to the property and a long term plan in place we are we are focused on providing our new ever source gas customers with the same high quality service that they have come to expect as i noted earlier we plan to integrate everysource gas of massachusetts into our updated five year projections that will provide you in february we continue to project approximately $3000000000 of regulated company capital investments this year despite the challenges and the need to take cruise off of capital projects for a significant portion of august to deal with the aftermath of tropical storm isaac through september our capital investments totaled approximately $2200000000 that is approximately the same level as this time last year in 2019 we made considerable progress on our transmission capital program in the 3rd quarter putting several projects into service or below budget and these benefits of of lower costs will flow through to new england electric customers from the regulated business i will turn to offshore wind partnership with orsted on slide eight we have had a few developments since july 31st earnings call the most significant development was that in august the bureau of ocean energy management posted a complete review the schedule culminates in a decision on a construction and operations permit or cop as it is known in mid january of 2022 we are also making progress on the other permits in september we filed a settlement proposal with the new york department of public service to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the project operations and maintenance of the project that lies within new york jurisdiction in october several of new york state agencies signaled their support for this proposal by signing on to the agreement restructured and agreement on host community payments in the necessary real estate rights with the town of easthampton where the offshore cable will land and will be connected to the long island grid new york public service commission siting hearing for south fork is scheduled to commence the 1st week of december we continue to expect the state siting process to be completed in 2021 before bome issues the cof based on that schedule we now expect the project to enter service in the 4th quarter of 2023 this is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our may and july earnings calls while we were still in the process of finalizing the deal waiting for the review schedule journey to our other projects you recall that we filed our boeing application for revolution wind in march we expect boeing to establish a review schedule for that project in the 1st quarter of 2021 we do not expect to provide an updated in service status of this project until the schedule is issued but at this point it is unlikely that the project will be awarded to the web service also we filed our sunrise wind application with boeing on september 1st and expect boeing to establish a review schedule for the project next year once we receive that review schedule we will be able to better estimate a more up to date in service schedule but again at this time it would seem that the end of 24 in service is not likely we are very optimistic about our offshore wind business i expect that many opportunities over the coming months and years to expand our offshore wind partnership beyond the 1714 megawatts currently under contract as we have mentioned before we have enough lease capacity to construct at least 4000 megawatts on the 550 square miles of ocean tract that we have under long term lease off the southeast coast of massachusetts we submitted a number of alternative bids into the 2nd new york offshore wind iraf where the state is looking for between 3500 megawatts new york state officials have indicated that they expect to announce the winner or winners before the the end of the year our sunrise project as a reminder won the largest portion of new york is 1st iraf last year 800 megawatts additionally just last week rhode island governor ageno raimondo announced that her state will target early next year for issuing an irp to 600 megawatts of additional offshore wind as you know the majority of our revolution wind capacity 400 megawatts will be sold to rhode island what with the balance going to connecticut hello this is phil i will turn the call back to john just to remind you how to enter questions in the q a queue if you do have a question press star one on your touch tone phone once again press star one on your touch tone phone if you wish to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key thank you john our 1st question this morning is from char from gannett good morning shar good morning jeff good morning phil good morning shar so a couple questions here just some of your language around sort of the growth rate you know obviously which still excludes columbia gas and offshore wind obviously these are you know very creative and you are already conservatively kind of well within your band so should we sort of be thinking about these incremental items as potentially raising your growth rate to maybe six to eight or something that will hit you to the top end and then sort of extend that runway with your current trajectory i mean the reason we ask is six to eight seems to be sort of that new top quartile bucket in our space where five to seven is becoming a little bit more typical so curious how you are sort of thinking about this do you see value to be at the top quartile or you do not think you need to be rewarded for it so curious on on that as we think about you layering in its plan certainly the addition of columbia gas and will be additive to our existing forecast so we are working through all the the details of that so we are able to provide you with a full  update in february but we we expect to get a significant benefit from that from that franchise and say we also as those offshore wind projects come online online to also be additive to remind folks i know i said it but and you did that the five to seven growth rate is from the from the existing core business which does not include columbia assets and it also does not include you know grid modernization activities that are currently pending in in connecticut and new hampshire or or am i that that that could could be a potential to move forward relatively soon in massachusetts in terms of taking a  look at that by the by the regulator so i see that we have a number of levers to grow and grow at at even higher rate than we had expected before got it that is helpful and then yeah kind of so just lastly for me is can you just maybe i mean the legislation that passed was more constructive than the draft legislation but obviously some disappointment with the refunds and and penalties offset by the potential upside from like pbrs so sort of how are you guys thinking about this entirely that we think is effective we have pbr structures in in other states and we think that having a  robust discussion on pbr in connecticut makes a lot of sense so we are very very supportive of of that provision you know really you know the energy legislation directed pura to to evaluate that and and open a document by the middle of next year so on june of 20202021 and it it authorizes pura to you know establish storm standards and potential penalties as you as you mentioned there is not there is not an increased potential of of penalties currently those penalties are twofive of our distribution revenues in connecticut and that goes up goes up to four so you know it also gives pura some additional time you know to to review cases you know which is also something that you know seems to be appropriate so the the legislation as you as you indicated is out there and the purifiers are working through the details of it and we expect to be working through that in a constructive way with them over the next several months got it terrific that is all i had today yeah thanks guys all right thanks shar our next question is from steve leischman good morning wolf good morning steve can you hear me yes steve i can so just a question on the delays in your ultra win projects could you maybe talk to i know we do not know the exact timing but how should we think about the impact on the economics of those projects from from delay i have a question about put and takes and is it hurting the economics of the project you already have signed up to yeah thanks for your question steven i hope you and your family are doing well i guess to go to the put and takes piece you know i do not think that folks should automatically think that schedule changes result in up or down certainly if you are looking at adjusted schedules you might be able to adjust your installation vessel optimization better you know the turbine sizes themselves are getting larger so you could move to larger turbine sizes if if projects are are due and certainly the cost supply chain and availability of materials and supply chain is only getting better so i say that you know there is opportunities for improved cost economics as you move into a schedule that yeah you may not think of you know i think people generally think of projects as you know is a delay it is a cost increase but that is not necessarily the case how about how about any negatives is it how about like do you lose are you going to lose any tax credits or anything else yes certainly i guess just time value yes in terms of the the schedules we are looking at we do not expect to have any impact on our tax assumptions but certainly significant delays delays could have impacts on on your tax assumptions delays could also have impacts on contracts that you have with counter parties but in our specific case so that is the general case in our specific case we are confident that we have the ability to work within both of those the tax area and the contract area in an effective way where we see the schedules going in the future okay thank you thank you our next question is from angie from seaport global good morning angie good morning especially in light of the fact that you just acquired an additional gas utility in massachusetts good morning angie and thank you for your question and hope you are doing well but you know the the way that i would position it or the way that i think people should think about it is that there is nobody 1st of all who is more aggressive in terms of looking at clean energy strategies and carbon reduction and and every source in terms of having a carbon neutral goal by 2030 we have worked effectively with all parties and in in all states but in massachusetts where  the attorney general and others want to take a look at you know sort of the the future or the outlook in terms of  the the gas business we have we have been working with these intervening parties for for many years and will continue to work on what we think an appropriate strategy is there so this is a long term outlook in terms of that the state wants to you know have aggressive clean energy and and carbon reduction targets with fully supportive of that and we we look forward to working you know with all the parties there but we do not see it as  as a threat to the gas distribution business yeah in the region at all okay and and in connecticut you know this this recent back and forth between you guys and pora about the extension of the the  the lack of basically disconnections on the back of covid i mean it sounds a bit concerning that pora is pushing back so strong that they do not need to sign off on that extension i mean i would assume that it is a so the natural practice normal practice for a regulated utility to seek a recovery of these you know undercovered revenues i mean can you give us a sense you know how you see it in connecticut given the latest you know legislative changes and also some deterioration and and then you know regular relationships in the state franchise at this and specifically you know we are working and we are working with customers we are working with fuel agencies assistance agencies on an approach here that works that works best for customers we have also engaged with pura as you mentioned and other government officials you know on this issue so i am confident that we will get to a  good place here you know nobody wants to so we are working through the issue we are working with customers as i say and some of the assistance agencies and and i am sure we will get to a good outcome here very good thank you thank you angie next question is from julie good morning from bank of america good morning julian hey good morning team thanks for the time i hope all of you are doing well and safe for families as well perhaps just to pick up off of or clarify if i can some of the last rounds of questions when you talk about the four quarter roll forward are you going to be rolling into 225 and then more specifically how do you think about including or excluding offshore wind in light of the uncertainties described for those projects where there is an undetermined date to continue to be excluded there just to clarify our history has been to add another year into the outlook so 225 would be that that year since the forecast goes through the 224 time period so that is something that that is something that we are looking at and really our our view on how to look at off shore wind it does not change by by any of the schedule items we we talked about today or we have looked at it as showing the the core business as the as the driver and the foundational element of the of the growth rate and then to show that wind is added to that in in what way so that would be be the the the intent going forward i think that when i have been asked this question before the answer is is was and still is as as more years of wind come in to the actual results of that particular year then to me it makes more sense to to roll it all together but at this stage the expectation especially in this upcoming february update would be to have the core business extend that through 2025 and then show up at upland wind in addition to that and if you do not mind elaborating a little bit further i know that there is a certain degree of uncertainty on exactly the perming schedule that inhibits your ability to say when these projects in a regional service can be completed can you at least try to put some more parameters around what each of these pieces of the process could take such that there is like a window if you will it may be too early yeah so in terms of you know people have realized out there and we have been asked questions i think you have asked us the questions in terms of you know with delays on vineyard wine and other things there has been some delays in terms of bone notice of intent of intent and and to prepare their environmental impact statement and frankly we would have we would have expected that in our original schedule schedules that some of these nay lows you know to prepare the the environmental impact statement would be would be helped by now so these are expected i believe you know the planned schedule for reviewing and releasing these is is underway so i would not expect you know a significant change in the schedule but at this stage it would be prudent to i am going to see the schedule that comes out on the phone before we we come into a final in service date but i would not expect it to be significant you know the the offshore wind here what do you expect you know there is this eis decision i suppose that is going to be out or you know ies stated rather this month or or early december what do you expect there and then how does that impact your your future project timelines all right so i guess maybe i am talking about the environmental impact statement is there an environmental impact statement that bone is supposed to do you are talking about the one for vineyard right yes yes zero yes i apologize you probably have to ask vinny winne about that okay but that does not have a read through for you or your offshore wind project but i guess that is sort of where my question was developers off the coast you know that we have been going through this cumulative cumulative impact study and and looking at spacing and of of wind turbines and we came up with  one nautical mile by one nautical mile spacing so certainly there could be components that come out in in any decision for vineyard wind that you would have to you know take a look at to see if it has any impacts you know to the developers but in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing i think a vineyard might have a better perspective of that okay perfect that is all i have got guys thank you so much alright thanks to dash next question is from jeremy from jpmorgan good morning jeremy good morning thanks for having me just want to start off with what are the benefits of looping a vineyard good morning i have a couple of questions the proposed sunrise two sunrise wind to rfp here eversource has experience of building transmission i am curious what additional competitive advantages coned provides here to this specific project can you provide details on potential ownership interests for each entity and does ownership interest change once construction is complete and the project is in service thank you for your question here i may help you do well i i guess i would say that the 1st part of the question is sort of obviously kleindid has local knowledge of of new york in their service territory and the network and the operation of the transmission and delivery system that that are valuable to to any party if you are if you are operating in new york so i would say they bring  a knowledge and skill set of of the area that certainly we do not have you know as as depth of knowledge as as they would so the sort of skill sets there that a local   player would bring so in terms of you know what the components of a relationship would be those things are all to be discussed as we as we move through but it is certainly beneficial i think to the project to have somebody with got it and as far as potential ownership interests is there any kind of thoughts on how that could  develop not at this time no got it and then will the delay in offshore wind permitting have any impact on the current financing plans is it fair to assume the $700000000 of equity is going to be used i just wanted to follow up on the five year plan moves to the back end here and how is offshore wind capex spending track heater date versus the three to 400000000 range that you expected somewhat close that i would say is probably a little bit under what we expected at at this time in terms of the financing you are right that we announced a year ago you know there is $2000000000 of of equity need that would support the forecast and we we issued onethree of that so there is 700000000 remaining that and i would say the same thing as i have said all along as we have been good morning paul good morning guys good morning paul i just wanted to follow up on the the  the draft decision in connecticut on monday and what your thoughts were on it if it if it were in fact to become a final order what the  what the potential impact could be so the pura case associated with the with the rates right the the rate review that was reversed that proceeding i i can tell you that the the specific name no that is okay i you know i just wanted to i just wanted to be specific as and as somebody else mentioned there has been a number of different yes major a lot so so as you recall the pura suspended i think the rates that we had implemented over the summer both we and ui to take an additional look i think this is what you are referring to so we did receive the draft order and really it is kind of hot off the press we are currently evaluating that and and we are going to you know see what comments we might have and comments on the draft could do i think it is the 12th of november so we have some time to to flush out anything but it is kind of a hot off the press so we are going to have to see how that goes on 1st of blush i would say it is consistent with the purer is desire to have some rate changes you know move instead of implementing rates at peak times of usage maybe such as july implement the one you know change the time of it to implement it maybe in  in a shoulder month like like may or something and move to annual reconciliations as opposed to semiannual so this this would you know it is it is the way that this could have effectively this is a cash flow item and it could have an impact on our our our deferrals that that we have in place there but you know i think it generally is consistent with the desire as we said to to move off of these peak periods for making rate changes and shoulder periods and see what we go from there but we are we are actively reviewing that last night and today and we will be and it have any comments that we would have to do as i said on the 12th there there was one part of it that would reduce the the carrying charges from the  from wac to a prime rate on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms is there any do we have any i know this is off the press and everything but do we have any sort of forecasts as to what the does reconciliation mechanisms like how much capital might be tied up in those no but you did that is a point to the carrying costs at at prime which is consistent in some of the jurisdictions i guess so no that it is not a significant you know item but it is certainly one that pura had put out there i think it is going to be okay to recover the deferred balances with the prime prime rate versus  a lack okay and then just we do not know who the president is going to be it seems but if there was a change in administration do you think that could have or not have maybe a significant impact on the b zero e m permitting process with respect to offshore wind the the permit process i mean when when we meet with with bone with boone with bom you know the the bureau of ocean energy management you know that people are active we are we are actively working we are actively having you know zoom meetings or team calls or whatever the yeah the video capabilities are that we are using but you know we are actively working at it and i can ensure you you know the people in the agencies are working full speed regardless of you know whose you know president are what the election results are but certainly it would be good to have you know the results of the election i think we have all as  as a country you know that that the election results are something that we have all targeted out there and wherever you fall on the the political spectrum is good to have certainty i think we are all looking forward to what the final outcome is there so we can we can move forward but just so for my clarity the process at the boe is pretty much the the agency that the sort of the bureaucratic process that is going on really you do not see a significant change one way or the other regardless of the the outcome of the presidential election is is that at the right understanding that we have been meeting regularly going through questions we are working through the various state agencies so no i would say that the work is continuing at the as you say the bureaucratic level awesome thanks so much you all thanks paul next question is from mike weinstein from crestview good morning mike hey good morning hey phil i am doing well hey maybe you could just give a quick 22nd update on what you think the outcome at ferc might be for transmission roes you know considering yeah i do not know if the election outcome has any effect on any of this accelerating an outcome but again thanks and i hope you are doing well thanks to your question i you know i wish i had a you know a better answer than to say that you know it is working its way through we we do not really have a specific clarity as to when ferret might you know come up with something on the new england before pending and certainly the impact of the election one way or the other what that could have in terms of commissioners and that type of thing so you know the only thing i know for certain is we are looking at our ten57 rates and reserving to that level and an eleven74 cap and you know we will just have to wait and see what the final outcome is i will look at it but i do not really have a  any answer i know in in years past when i tried to when i tried to think that one was coming or it was going a certain way it really had not has not materialized so i think it is best to wait for the final the final word comes out at this point on borders as it is maybe i mean i have been involved in hydro generation up there and i know that their long term plans included lots and lots of northern pass type transmission lines do you think there is ever a time at some point where there might be another another whacker or another go at transmission at some point a big transmission project the states desire to either have offshore wind or solar or hydro in the mix so you know there are certainly there is a lot of activity at the states now i mean the states in our area all want aggressive carbon reduction targets so it would not be out of the question to see a state you know want to contract for more of that but there is nothing planned on our end there is nothing that i see at this stage on the state is agenda that would say that but when you say the word ever you know that is a long time so it seems like the offshore wind program really has kind of supplanted that at least for the time being yeah i say that is a good way of looking at it okay great thank you very much thanks mike next question is from insou kim from goldman sachs good morning insou hey good morning guys my only question is and apologize if i missed this but could you give just an update on the connecticut grid modernization filings and any updates on expected issues decisions from the commission and you know timing of investments etcetera you know in terms of what items could be additive to our five to seven core business growth rate i alluded to grid mod in connecticut or new hampshire or potentially additional ami docketed in massachusetts but there is really been no change that we all the parties filed comments and plans back in july and certainly you can understand this has been there has been a lot going on and and i think i may have said eastais was in october but we all know that eastais was in august so since august there has been a lot of you know there has been a lot of focus on on storms and there has been a lot of ducats and as somebody else mentioned we have ducats going on in terms of of moratoria and whatnot so this you know the expectation was there was going to be another sort of go round i think in another process in connecticut towards the end of the year i really have not seen anything that would indicate a specific schedule you know on that so i guess our best guess is still you know it is still in the in the pipeline and you may see more activity on on gridline there in connecticut as we move over the next several months but in terms of being in our forecast you know you know and i declare that there is currently no you know zero there is no grid bond spending in our capital forecast for any you know grid bond programs that have not been approved like in connecticut or new hampshire so you know once they are approved and once we see what what our role would be in them and once we see what that you know looks like then we have more confidence in putting in the in the plan so that could be i think we have information by the time we get to the february update so you know i will have to stay tuned on that that makes sense that is all i have thank you guys stay safe you know in light of some of the recent delays i was wondering if that changes how you are strategizing around other bids that you are putting into future rfps like baking in more contingency anything that might give a greater level of comfort around the economics of future projects that you might win thank you dave for your comment and i hope you and your team are doing well certainly every piece of information is helpful and that you get you know and and this is not just offshore wind you know this is you know on on all our business but i will focus on offshore wind and that is the question you know every every month that goes by every quarter that goes by we gain more insight and information about construction about you know rates about about you know lots of facts is that all of those things all of those things are factored into subsequent bids so the information that we have available to us you know as we are moving into a bid recent bid in new york is different than we had from bids that we made you know in rhode island or connecticut or massachusetts so every every data point is important to us and we factor that into the next bid so i i say that absolutely that schedules and how how you make it through the bidding process and all of that informs you know subsequent bids and so i can assure you that all those things get get you know up to the minute attention before bid goes in okay got it that is helpful and i just wanted to touch on just zero and m costs in the zero and m budget could you remind us how you see that trajectory just for the overall business going forward you have been you have got a great track record of controlling zero and m so what are the key levers in your in your tool belt fill that you that you would focus on going forward for managing zero m so we have you know still a robust i would say series of technology improvements if you if you i will start off by just setting the stage that in the guidance we gave we said that we expected zero and m costs to be you know down this year and then just for the forecast period kind of flat going going so how do we able to do that and it is by some of these technology changes and we have been implementing more productivity management tools and tools for our you know individual line workers and gas fitters and in the field to get their work to update their work that we can then take that and automatically update drawings and files we do not need you know to hand it off to somebody and so there is still these productivity technology changes that are happening some went in last year some going in this year and and more planned for next year so that that will be like the lever under the underpinning for us to have the ability to continue to improve processes and and take unnecessary costs out of the business okay great that is helpful thanks so much for the call you are welcome thank you david next question is is good morning thank you quick clarification on the storm costs at 275000000 number if i heard you correctly how much did you expense in the quarter and how much was either deferred or capitalized or it will be pending that the regulatory filing that you mentioned repeated was a deferred that is how much of  storm costs that we deferred in both tropical of  storm east coast and that was across all states but primarily in connecticut so that is our deferral that would be yeah once a storm gets to a certain level it triggers a deferral so we know that that all is deferred storm costs right now in terms of there there are other storms certainly we had we had an active quarter for storms in general but there are other storms other than these that did impact the quarter i mean our storm costs were up you know about $10000000 for the for the quarter that went through you know our our zero and e so but the you know for the quarter it is at that level and then the 274 or five that you you mentioned is the is the deferment okay great that is that is very helpful thank you and then a quick follow up to the discussion on the connecticut legislation and there is some language in there as i understood it it is about the general assembly having some review power there what is your thought in terms of the scope of what the general assembly could do in terms of either taking back some earnings or rate changes and stuff like that separate from pura could do well certainly the general assembly can enact legislation that it feels is appropriate in in any matter so you know i do think specifically to the the energy legislation that was enacted recently in connecticut that most you know things all were you know for the most part moved to to pura so the the regulator so i guess i look at it as the legislation would provide the intent the framework the direction and then pura is the one who is going to be implementing you know they are going to be the one who evaluates the performance based rates they will be the one who initiates the storm you know standards and and things like that and and look at you know should there be penalties or should there be food you know so i think that effectively you know the general assembly can can certainly enact any and all legislation it feels it should and and the way that this legislation seems to have turned out was that then the implementation of that legislation is in the hands of puc okay so the potential for any or the risk for any kind of clawbacks would likely go through puc instead of going through the general assembly based on that federal legislation that you talked about great no appreciate alright thank you travis our next question is from andrew wisell from scotia good morning andrew hey good morning thanks for squeezing me in 1st question is with the two rate cases now completed can you remind us what subsidiaries might be next to file general rate cases you have plenty of regulatory items of course well according to the requirements in connecticut connecticut could be an area that is required to file by the existing framework that is there and that would be something that would be sort of a you know next year sort of event but other than that we are pretty much out of the ok great then on offshore winds can you just share your latest thinking on how big you are willing to let that business get you talked a lot about the opportunities that you are pursuing beyond the three existing projects any thinking as far as from an earnings mix perspective if there is a limitation or will you plan to just bid bid bid and get as many projects as your licenses allow or word well i want to be clear on this because i think it is a very important point that big big bid is not that strategy our strategy is to have a financial discipline about growing that business in a way that provides appropriate levels of of returns that that benefit our shareholders so just by winning a bid you know does not does not do it it has to be we have to and we continue to maintain financial discipline in terms of the amounts that we did and the returns that that we are looking for so yeah as as long as the returns are at an appropriate level but for that business it makes sense to make the bid win the bid and and and expand the business there what we have said is we are tracked what we own off the coast of or what what we have access to in terms of lease areas you know we could do about 4000 at least 4000 megawatts of offshore wind so there is kind of a you know that is the maximum capability that we we have so it is not an an infinite growth type of thing and we had indicated that when leases were available that i am not in our region that we were not interested in them so leases in our region like the ones we were involved in are are good but other lease areas are that is not for us in other parts of the mid atlantic etc so it is  we are constrained by the lease area and we are guided by the financial discipline on our bids and our returns thank you very much that sort of wraps up today if you have any follow up questions please give us a call or send us an email and we look forward to speaking and seeing many of you during the virtual eea conference next week thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference thank you for participating and you may now

afternoon to those in europe thank you for joining our earnings call today i hope you and your families are healthy and safe as we discussed last quarter mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the health and the well being of our employees and customers has remained our utmost priority before giving you an update on the measures that we implemented in this regard let me begin a review by providing context this quarter has been quite challenging as we are the impact of the pandemic on the mexican economy on our business and of course on our results despite the impact let me assure you that our bank remains a strong and focused 1st our capital levels are solid and well above the minimum levels 2nd we have a clear study which we are executing to support our customers and minimize the impact on the pandemic on the finances and 3rd we expect to emerge from this difficult environment as a stronger institution business volumes closed the 2nd quarter with high single digit growth for we experienced an adverse shift in our portfolio mixed cohorts lower in segments consumer and loans started to contract in line with market trends where the commercial and loans were resilient and continued to raise their the measures implemented by bank of mexico and the cmpp how allow us to maintain levels of enabling us to for our customers support mechanisms to temporarily alleviate their cash flow and the financial distress caused by economic fallout of the pandemic although it is quality deteriorated slightly in the quarter we made preemptive loan contributions of 3900000000 pesos in addition to the normal quarterly provisions in preparation for our future losses we would revise this amount every in the future as more information becomes available on the performance of our loan for portfolio to in the coming quarters as we normally do we will provide a loan review of our business environment our convictions that mexico is very well positioned again according to economy impact of the covid nineteen pandemic in slide four we will present select economic indicators that show the magnitude of impact of the pandemic and starting economic activity and unemployment as you might recall 2020 growth expectations for the mexican economy were modest prior to the pandemic mainly due to weak profits we indicators showing a contraction of more than twenty during economic activity and 37 on year end year and dropping fix investment market expectation have been revised down to a line nine under decrease in gdp during 220 2000 and twenty for this will be an economic contraction not seen in many decades this significant fall in economic activity was resulted in the loss of more than 1000000 former jobs from the 2nd quarter according to social security data not as many as 20000000 jobs lost employment following the past year economic crisis back in 95 and 2000 and nine it took seven quarters for the mexican economy to recover its previous level of economic activity however in the current one you can see that it is unlikely that economy could recover in within a similar period of time given the depth and the magnitude of the global economic shock and the absence of any meaning meaningful fiscal problem to avoid distribute contraction in in its employment with external demand only and without any mechanism to rate households income loss and not an economy like mexico is long path to recover to previous activity levels with 2021 growth profits being forecasted at only three it could take three to four years to recover 2019 is levels of activity under these conditions inflation pressures should remain low we expect threesix for 2020 allowing bank of mexico to quote interest rates further we expect another 100 of through the year throughout the year which would take the reference rate around four by year end in summary in this scenario of low growth and low interest rates represents a challenging outlook for mexico is commercial and consumer environments and for our business if you turn to slide to slide five you will notice that despite a severe shock to economic activity and employment the system is loans and deposit values is to show a significant year over years expansion of eight and fourteen respectively this is mainly explained by large and medium size companies along with entities that have drawn on the credit lines to ignore continue operating during the months of which the stay at home guidelines have been in effect on the other hand consumer loans sold a relative contraction reflecting the in initial impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior and is starting to practice as seen and maintained by institutions it is worth noting that system demand deposits were made strong up eighteen in up eighteen year and year likely reflecting high needs for equality among households and companies for the stay at home guidance remaining in effect please turn to slide sixty we would like to give you an update on the bank operations during the past few months our health and business continue to continuing to protocols remain in place such as suspending non essential travel limiting the number of people are gathering and group events and enhanced sanititate sanit sanitization measures at branches corporate offices atms and contact centers essentially most corporate employees continue working from home while essential personnel are working on site approximately eighty of the bank branches are open and 92 of our atm locations are functioning normally the bank channels and contact centers have also been operating normally our transactions increase 64 year and year while our sales represented forty of total sales as it did last year as we continue promoting customer is use of channels which continues to drive adoption values further more active resources have been channeled into implementing additional remote operating tools with security being a priority during this critical time we have been supporting our customers through our active relief program offering deferred payments for individuals and and case by case to our corporate customers i will allow this program being in a moment as part of our commitment to our communities we have made numerous donations and supported initiatives that aid the medical community and vulnerable populations we also donated a map to the mexico city government which allows a population to self diagnose dates of symptoms locate medical facilities with capacity near them and obtain information on the pandemic on slide seven you will find a snapshot of our support program that i mentioned before currently nineteen of our loan portfolio is under the payment holiday program for individual and smes with more than 600000 customers benefiting from it through this program we are helping customers who have encountered programs by permitting them to escape loan payment both interest and principal for four months without any penalty or cost because of this this feature under the program it is difficult to assess at this time the extent of the pandemic is impact on our asset quality however we have been proactive in addressing asset quality over the past two months by contacting the customers to better understand their financial situation and by analyzing their ability to pay more than 55 of our branch network personal recoveries calling customers likewise the collections of commercial and departments portfolio by level of concern identifying risk and exposure according to customer quality through this more granular process we are each typ of client within 36 different cluster which have also been analyzing our customer behavioral patterns using our capabilities i know that more of 95 of our payroll customers continue to receive their salaries for those payroll customers who are not longer receiving their salary we are collecting for unemployment insurance with current information we estimate that close to forty of our customers should be able to continue honor in fully the condition of their loans seen it s since since it is for still unclear if the rest will be able to remain current we are are offering offering loan restructurings to many of them in order to speed up the recovery process it will not be until the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year that we will have sufficient hard data on the behavior of the portfolio with regard to our commercial book we are taking a case by case approach to manage our exposure as we have been doing the past critical periods we have remained very close to our customers and are helping them navigate this current challenging environment for those companies that face difficulties we have been offering multiple opportunities to support them our current portfolio of commercial restructure loans is close to 50000000000 pesos and accounts for sixteen of our loan portfolio with 1000000 of large sized corpa corporates in addition to actively managing our portfolio know that 76 of our payment holiday portfolio is associated with mortgages and smes which both have warranties within out total listing book 67 of the portfolio is backed up by warranties issued by part of mexico development banks which allow those to share the risk with them specifically for those that during the rivera program 75 of them have warranties furthermore payrolls and outer loans nine of portfolio are semi secured even percented by each customer salary and card please turn to slide eight for i would like to share with you some of the key characteristics of our remote support emergent portfolio which is giving us relative comfort to to its defensive nature our organic port eh m mortgage portfolio accounts for 86 of all our mortgages portfolio has a loan to value ratio of 44 has an ltb of seventy providing warranty coverage the mpl ratio of this portfolio is threesix and has been quite stable for some time for the past two years our mortgage has allow us to attract higher income customers which are more defensive in the current environment to respond to this point our average ticket has been increasing since our lunch since our launch of problem and is currently not only the highest among our peers but thirty 37 higher than the average of our peers in addition up close customers are loyal as they also have their payroll and their credit cards with us having a low loan to value ratios as well as being the main bank of our customers lowers the probability of nonpayment as this type of customer tends to prioritize their home mortgages in economic downturns considering the level of warranties we have the structure for our portfolio and the proactive measures we are taking we can see that we are on the right path to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and the quality of a loan portfolio on a slide nine let me comment on our dynamics and the we have seen during the past few months commercial loans continue to support therefore their contribution within local loan increase from 78 from the 2nd quarter of nineteen to 82 in the 2nd quarter in 2020 in commercial loans now represent 64 of our total loans these changes makes have had an impact on our nii as will be explained later in the call in terms of organization dynamics we have seen encouraging trends during the quarter that are worth noting here in the mortgage and commercial segments there is loan right relevance sequentially proven compared to may surpassing january is 2020 level in consumer loans june loan renigation remains 25 below the 1st quarter in twenty monthly average however it expanded 33 upon the 2020 minimum rates april as you can see on slide ten our capital positions are very strong at the end of june our common equity peer one cep one ratio is elevensix 58 basis points above march and as significantly in excess of the eighttwo minimum requirement established for the bank is during april shareholder is meeting to postpone the dividend payment for 2019 have allow us to further strength our capital position in terms of liquidity our 2nd quarter in 2020 liquidity to coverage ratio reached 211 well above the bank is the bank requirement and supported by senior notes we should back in april before turning the call over to i would like to finish my remarks by reiterating that we have been acting safely and decidedly to further strengthen our bank in order to mitigate the impact of the current crisis on our operations in addition to implementing proper protocols and measures to protect our employees and customers we have continued serving clients with high standards of customer service through our branches and the channels again we are confident that our bank is well positioned to support the customers as they recover from this unprecedented crisis now let me pass hold the call over to who will review the quarter is most important trends and metrics thank you thank you hector good day everybody please turn to slide eleven for an overview for recent loan performance total loans expanded seven year to year but contracting contracted three sequentially given strong corporate loan demand at the end of the 1st state quarter loan margin segments are growing twice as fast as high margin segments and current contracted nine and six year to year respectively due to economics eh to the economy is weak performance by contrast mortgage loans increased a solid nine year to year and expanded thirteen per percent when excluding the runoff effect of ge and ing portfolio which was well above market growth high margin segments have reduced their contribution to income by almost 100 basis points individual loans on slide twelve show a slow down growing four on a year to year basis mainly supported by mortgages as mentioned previously mortgages have proved to be the segment within the mexican market during the past periods of economic instability with this in mind we decided to lower even more the rate of our plus product to seven75 targeting loyal customers as of june close to sixty of our mortgage was coming from the plus which allows to increase cross selling of other products in july we launched a new product a new mortgage product called which is the 1st commission free mortgage product in mexico unique characteristics of this product are the customers do not have to pay an application fee monthly commission for a home appraisal nor are life and unemployment insurance required leaving only notary fees to be paid by the customer when incurring this product as you can see even during this challenging times we have not stopped innovating there continues to be a downward trending credit card loans as we take a more conservative approach toward this segment in addition to matching a customer is credit limits credit card usage declined thirty year over year during the quarter as many clients stayed at home this drop had a negative impact on balances of course after usage rates reach a very low level in april they recover in may and june of the remaining slide below 1st quarter levels our consumer loans have been concentrated in payroll loans growing twofive year to year and are still above the market for data as of the end of may personal loans continue to contract consistent with our strategy to focus on more defensive segments of the market as hector noted finally our other loan production in june more than doubled compared to previous quarter is average boosted by our new commercial alliance with nasdaq turning to slide thirteen closing our base of loyalty customers continues demonstrating important progress with year and year increases of almost seventeen and 31 respectively despite a challenging business environment loyalty penetration that is loyal to active customers to stands at 35 400 points higher than a year ago we have seen continuous growth in the use for digital channels as customers have stayed home during the pandemic this quarter product sales on digital channels accounted for 44 of the total almost doubling year ago levels digital monetary transactions also spiked reaching almost 13rd of the total while mobile transactions represented 93 of total deed of transactions versus 84 in 2019 while our customers also kept growing at a solid 38 year and year rate reaching 4300000 at the end of the quarter as you can see on slide fourteen commercial loans grew nine year and year but decrease sequentially as some corporates started prepaying some lines withdrawn in the 1st quarter of the year government and middle market segments continue to register double digits year and year expansion although their sequential evolution showed lower and stable volumes respectively loans register up towards sequential quarterly contraction and segment showed a weakening trend even for the pandemic outstanding loans are similar to the ones we had in the 4th quarter of 201710 quarters ago the downward trend is also related to our lower risk appetite for lending in segment given that more than fifty of our sme loan during the payment holiday program and those customers cannot use their credit lines while in the program loan origination in this segment will remain low until we have ore visibility on the performance of the economy moving on total deposits on the slide fifteen this increased ten year and year while quarter and quarter we saw a three contraction there was a shift between demand and time to process favor by lower interest rates as of the the 2nd quarter of this year demand deposits represented 64 of total deposits and were up eleven year and year deposit grows from individual stance eh turns out at 23 year and year supported by a promotion campaign to attract these types of deposits after an untypical 1st quarter of this year deposits from individuals continue to grow faster than corporate deposits in line with out strategy to further increase our expose to retail deposits retail deposit now represents thirty 33 of total deposits almost 400 basis points higher than its contribution in the 1st quarter of 2018 turning to slide sixteen we have a very strong capital and liquidity positions as hector has highlighted we maintain a sound funding position with a net loans to the of 91851 of the strongest levels since becoming a listed company our liquidity rates are increased 89 percentage points relative to the 1st quarter of this year and now spans a 211 well above the regulatory threshold of 100 we also remain very comfortable with our debt profile with manageable debt maturities regarding capitalization our ratio increased 46 basis points sequentially to sixteenseven reflecting the postponement of the dividend payments as recommended by the banking commission well our core tier one ratio was up 58 basis points to elevensix and and our tier one ratio stood at thirteen03 as you can see on a slide seventeen net interest income decreased four year on year and six quarter on quarter as a result net interest margin contract at 128 basis points to fourfive for the quarter our margin decline was a result of lower interest rates and lower balances within the high yielding segments coupled with higher average assets as a consequence of significant increase in our security is portfolio without this last effect eh our nim would have contracted only 54 basis points as hector explained earlier we are expecting net interest income to continue contracting dur during the remainder eh remainder of the year due to anticipated decreases in interest rates combined with a change in our portfolio mix where growth would likely come from low yielding segments and with unlikely contraction with high yielding segments however this downward pressure will be partially mitigated by our expanded investment and security portfolio please move on to slide eighteen net commissions and fees decreased two one year on year affected by the double digit decline in credit card transactions credit card usage decreased 42 in april 34 in may and fourteen in june on a year on year basis insurances register only a slight contraction given renewals of several groups insurance policies which partially compensated for software insurance demand insurance represents almost thirty of our total fees and have proven to be a defensive segment even considering the the the pandemic with health and life insurance growing while retail insurance is slightly decreasing our investment banking team have been very active mainly in financial advisory services which translated into strong fee growth of 31 in this line eh of our business which partially compensated for weaker results in other areas mainly credit card fees turning to slide nineteen gross operating income grew nine year on year driven by a solid performance in market related income which was significantly above our historical average levels of between 600 to 800000000 pesos per quarter the current interest rates the fx market volatility especially during a april and may supported market making income in addition we sold investment in securities in order to for the strengthening our liquidity position generating non recurring gains that boosted this quarter is result all this contributed for market related income that accounted for thirteeneight of gross of revenue threefive times higher than historical average of four moving on to provisions on slide twenty in light of the deterioration of mexico is economic environment and in anticipation of a possible deterioration of our loan portfolio both due to the pandemic in june we register a special charge of low loans provisions on top of those normally require the 3900000000 pesos charge raised total provisions to 8350000000 pesos in the quarter up 88 year on year and 62 sequentially we have made this estimate of preemptive provisions with information currently at hand however this amount could be revised in the future as more information becomes available cost of risk for the quarter stood at three one a 44 basis point year on year increase and 49 basis points sequentially our total npl ratio showed a slight 28 basis points year over year increase to twofive mainly due to the sme segment together with our mortgage and credit card portfolios as explained earlier these ratios only reflect the performance of 81 of our total portfolio that does not fall under the payment holiday program we consider this ratio encouraging as its evolution is quite benign when considering the significant deterioration in in economic activity and employment however it will not be until the 3rd and 4th quarter of this years of this year that the debtors pro program will end it will be at that time when npl ratios will reflect the real magnitude of the economic impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide 21 administrative and promotional expenses increase onetwo year on year reflecting the e the effort to control personal costs mainly reserves for viable compensation and amortization expenses related to the strategic and it investments that we made over the past thr three years as we will continue investing in the digitalization of the bank and in technology operates we are targeting grading operating efficiencies in the common quarters such as the ability to reduce the number of business trips viable compensation as well as limiting base salary increases among other improvements less business travel and salary caps would greatly led to a sequential onenine decrease in our total expenses during the 2nd quarter of this year such expense controls combined with strong operating income and the conclusion of our three year investment plan contributed to a 358 basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio which decreased to fortyseven on a six months eh basis the ratio improved 227 basis points year on year to 42three turning to profitability on the slide 22 you will note that our earnings were mainly impacted by special loaners provisions that we discussed earlier profit before taxes was down 24 year on year for the quarter and eleven for the 1st half of the year net income decreased 25 year on year to 4200000000 pesos while our effective tax rate increase 38 basis points year on year to 25three this resulted in an elevenfive decrease in net income for the 1st six months six months of 2020 which was 9600000000 pesos return on on equity was elevennine 543 basis points below the year ago level and down 362 basis points sequentially year to date roe contracted 328 basis points to thirteenfive let me now turn the call back to hector grisi for some final remarks hector please go ahead thank you didier okay please turn to slide 23 let me share with you some final thoughts on what lies ahead given the unprecedented nature of these health crisis and uncertainty surrounding this duration and magnitude we anticipate only a very gradual recovery of the economy which has obvious implications with regard to our operating environment we expect our loan portfolio will likely be driven by commercial loans mainly medium and large corporates government loans as well as mortgages the consumer board recover very gradually and this will depend on the speed of the rental turnaround in employment economic activity as well as business and consumer confidence although visibility and asset quality is limited due to the payment holiday program which have been talking and taking rapid and decisive action in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the loan book our recoveries plan which includes a very detailed and in deep analysis of each customer is situation is allowing us to preemptively and swiftly prepare the bank for complicated quarters ahead in particular we have allocated a large number of current employees and branches involved in carrying out the recovery strategy we will continue focusing on enhancing customer loyalty and on cross selling non credit products to support non interest income we also remain committed in to making additional investments in the bank transformation mainly in it and digitalization but we will continue to look for efficiencies in other lines with the strict cost control in order to support the bottom line and finally rest assured that our banks is operating from a position of strength with robust capital and high liquidity levels that will allow us to overcome this complicated but what we believe are temporary circumstances we are now ready to tackle questions please operator let us go ahead thank you if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press star one to ask a question please ask one question and a follow up if you have further questions please re enter the queue we will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions thank you our 1st question is from the line of jason mollin from scotiabank please go ahead hi thank you very much my question is on the operating outlook the disclosure is excellent it is it is always been i like the way you presented it on slide nineteen we we can look at the the main the main drivers for the operating income and clearly as you you talked about market related revenue was very strong well above historical levels about fourteen of the total operating income compared to let us say three or four in the past these are different times but how should we think about efficiency going forward you talked about cost control we saw that if you can just give us a general sense you you mention you there are certain costs your you can control and you are controlling can you talk a little bit about the physical infrastructure is there a an opportunity to rationalize physical branch network after the investments you you made what should we be looking for in terms of efficiency going forward the the dynamic is is quite skewed from all of these moving parts the very high trading and and the low the low revenues given what is going on thank you thank you look i mean i did not set i mean and if you take a look at our numbers basically we have decreased the operation cost of the bank quite significantly i mean 1st of all i mean not traveling and not doing many things basically have reduced naturally the cost but we have also been very strict in the in new projects and new situations i mean we are basically focusing all our expenses in it to support the backbone and to be ready for what is coming so in that sense that is one of your priority secondly we are taking a look and we are doing a deep dive in terms of all our infrastructure and we are not going to get take i mean wrong decisions in terms of closing down a big number of of branches or anything like that i think we are going to be rationally looking at each of the micro markets that we have divided the country into and we will decide with evolution of the economy what should happen there so but we are going to be very strict if you have seen the growth of the past four or five years in terms of branches we actually have decreased the number of total branches we have just we have been very intelligent in the way we have managed that what we have done is upgraded the current and the most important branches which we are going to basically be taking a little bit more time than the time that we were thinking of of upgrading all the branches that are not up to the standard so this is actually what we are doing we are going to basically rationalize all all all expending and do it on where the most important thing is that is basically the it platform and the digitalization of the bank so in that sense we are going to be very concentrated on that we also believe that i mean given that we have been able to operate the bank under these circumstances we have a huge amount of people basically working from home you basically get to understand just actually how really how much people do you need what can you rationalize et cetera so what you are going to see from us is that we are going to be very responsible in the way we manage that and concentrate on those points we are working currently on that plan we are working on our three year plan and and we are basically including all these inward solution maybe as a follow up just some comments on what you would seen throughout your peers and the santander group in in the region or elsewhere are there other things you think that could be applied to mexico that could help perhaps on the side of the banking system perhaps in terms operationally or it or or any factors at all thank you wh what we are doing basically is for example i mean in terms of developing these the platforms et cetera but we are doing it we are doing it now instead of each country basically developing the platforms we are doing it together so that basically is going to help out quite a lot so it is not mexico for example right now in mexico we are developing the new super app and the new super app is going to be used in the in in in in all the other countries you know for example the onboarding for smes we are using the one that is being developed at the in europe so all those type type of things are going to help us out basically in reducing our cost for the the infrastructure that we are developing and we are working together much more within the group in order to do that so you are going to see that i mean in the cost of basically developing things and it is going to come down due to the fact that we are doing it together with the rest of our sister banks so so so those t great thank you very much implementing at this ti at this point thank you i appreciate it you are welcome too the next question comes from the line of jorge kuri from morgan stanley please go ahead hi good morning everyone i i wondered what is about net interest margin you you you pointed out that you expect further complications in the next couple of quarters given falling grades and weak loan demands and mixed deterioration as as you look at 2021 in the context of what you said on n not a strong economic recovery next year and with average rates next year being m m much lower than 2020 if if indeed rates end up at four and w what is the expectation for the net interest margin next year and for nii i i is it possible that we are likely to see another year of nii compression and and to to what extent that can be offset elsewhere in the pml and and my 2nd question is on the on the coverage ratio and i and i know that banks you you know the the banks normally do not target a coverage ratio i get it but but evidently the the the size of your reserves have a relationship to the size of your logbook the size of your mpls and the size of the amount of loans that are on their restructuring and so when i look at your capex ratio at 100 138 it looks low relative to where banorte ended up at 201 and 185 so i i wonder you know why why w w why not just you know take a much bigger charge on provisions this quarter you know evidently there is there is there is a lot of uncertainty ahead and the more the better a and and so is this piecemeal just going to you know potentially put more pressure on your earnings going forward rather just you know take a really big one swoop and you know r raise your coverage to north of 200 and and is that likely maybe something you will do in the 3rd quarter thank you look jorge i will ask this is hector i will ask i will answer the 1st part and then i will ask didier to complete on the on the basic numbers of nii okay i mean 1st of all i mean if if you saw the presentation we are basically changing the mix of of the credit loan portfolio okay 1st of all i mean if you have seen i mean we have decreased quite a lot our exposure unfortunately to smes given the lack of warranties from the government from nafinsa okay so the portfolio has dropped almost ten so in that sense that basically is a high yield portfolio which is going to continue to shrink unless we we see some warranties from the government and you if you see our portfolio which is quite important we have like 62 of it already warranted by nafinsa okay the corresponding volume this basically goes to answer your 2nd part of the question in terms of the amount of the amount of reserves that we have done then you see that also we see that for example consumer credit and consumer loans are going to decrease as well so the mix is completely changing that we are going the i mean we are going basically back to where we were wh where we were five years ago when we had much more exposure to corporates and to medium sized companies than to consumer loans remember that we have that different mix okay so that is why nii is shrinking on the other side what we have also been doing it was with pricing and we are very s strict on pricing risk okay so we have been increasing the margin on the corporate loans quite significantly due to that fact you know that we are basically looking at the the risk that we are taking and we are looking very closely at the ratings of those companies and we are pricing risk accordingly okay this is not a situation in which we want to spend the port credit portfolio just to expand it we are basically doing it just to the companies that we believe that have a future and that will be there in the next few years and both we are pricing the risk accordingly so in that sense you are going to see us going towards that also the other concentration is mortgages which we which we believe i mean there is a sector still of growth i mean as you know there is a lack of a or or a big deficit in terms of homes in mexico so we believe there is still a part of the population that can afford a mortgage mortgages penetration in mexico was quite low versus the rest and also loan penetration is quite low so we believe there is a chance to to to continue to penetrate that sector and maybe on payrolls on some situations we will basically be also lending in that in the in that part i mean and auto loans also we have seen some interesting development there with very cautious approach to it so in that sense the mix of the portfolio is going to change and probably didier can let you know exactly how do we see nii evolving in terms of what you were asking in terms of the reserves we maybe we have actually been doing reserves accordingly wh to what we believe we are doing in terms of how the portfolio is is behaving at this point what i can tell you is that the portfolio not on payments holidays is behaving much much better than we believed that it was going to t that it was going to turn actually i am quite surprised about it hopefully it continues that way but in that sense we are basically being in my opinion being very responsible in the amount of of reserves that we are making at this point also we have done a tremendous job with the data hopes that we have in reviewing the portfolio on holidays and that portfolio is being divided as we said in 36 clusters okay these clusters have been divided upon ri upon the amount of risk that we have on each particular situation and in some of these portfolios even before the payment holiday ends we are already talking to clients and discussing the way that that we could get paid on those particular situations because what we believe is that whoever gets paid 1st is the one that is the one that is going to get paid so we are basically being very aggressive on that sense to talk to our clients and basically trying to get that and to recover the portfolio as you have seen 55 of our branches have been turned into collecting branches i mean to basically this we are dedicating our executives to collect we have divided them up in the sectors that we believe are the ones that are the ones that are going to be much more important in that or that are going to be hit the most in the economy so in that sense i believe we are very well prepared although i mean or nevertheless is always i mean a lot of uncertainty in what is happening and we did not want to go overboard and we believe it is the right the right approach is the one that we have made but we will continue to see over the next few months evolution what i can tell you is that we are going to be very conservative in the way we manage that okay didier i do not know if you want to complete absolutely eh absolutely hector i would like to to complement on what you mentioned eh eh great talking to you jorge long time no speak eh in terms of eh nims you know eh definitely you know as we laid out in the presentation we see significant pressures and let me just give you some background information that i think it is it is eh it is quite relevant the the speed at which interest rates have come down in mexico is is is is significant you know just in this quarter eh the average of the reference reference rate came down 123 basis points that is the the the fastest decline that eh we have seen eh in the recent history we we did not saw a a an increase of those eh you know of that magnitude when eh when interest rates were were coming up okay so that is one thing to have in mind the the the impact that you see in this quarter i think is is probably most that we are going to see in a relative basis relative to the 1st quarter of this year and relative to the 2nd quarter of last year okay also bear in mind that when interest rates were close to four as we probably agree with you that that is where we are headed you know are close to five you know and this was the 2nd and 3rd quarter of 2016 i think that eh the the number that that we reported the 448 in this quarter you know have to do with with what i was referring to you know the speed at which interest rates eh eh came down and also on top of that you have the the the change in mix on our loan side and also the fact that in order to protect the eh the income from eh interest rates coming down we we increased our pay interest securities portfolio significantly you know and those are you know lower margin eh assets relative to the the the loan portfolio just to you know share with you we have bought in this account you know both divestment and maturities the overall growth in our pay investment and securities portfolio is 96000000000 over the last twelve months so what we expect coming down the road you know pay for the rest of 2020 and eh for next year i think that you know having said that there is still a lot of uncertainty you know i think that probably the the most severe numbers in terms of name are the ones that we saw this quarter you know there is probably you know ten to fifteen basis points eh probably further adjustment or slight eh improvement for the rest of the year okay and next year i think that eh we will we will probably get to see names similar or slightly above to the ones that we were seeing eh eh in this quarter now in regarding to the current ratio you are totally right in the sense that we do not target that that is resulting number and also you know when you eh make reference to you know our number 138 looks low relative to the 1st quarter this year they had 140 in this in the 2nd quarter they did as we did also increase the provisions for different to us they made a significant charge off 4600000000 pesos so that is why you know they are their increased to 200 i am probably just elaborating elaborating eh the more on what information you know the letter of provisions that we have are in line with the expected losses that we we estimate you know you might have a or you might question whether we you know this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that you know under current circumstances we we have definitely done different types of sensitivity analysis or scenario analysis okay so if recovery in the mexican economy you know we have with these quarters eh provisions we are you know more than covered you know for the rest of the year now do we think that there is going to be a type recovery in the mexican economy i do not think so you know it is very you know low probability you know now we have a you know the the our leave of provisions according to other types of more a u type or an adverse scenario having agility contraction of twelvefive you know and under those circumstances these quarters provisions are not enough for the entire year there could be close to sixty to 75 depending on the magnitude of the eh contraction that that you assume okay eh eh so so there should be direct correlation between expected losses and provisions and the provisions that we are putting forward we think that with information that we have are quite strong to cover you know expected losses if the the the economy ends up contracting more than we are expecting right now definitely we will need to provide a provision of provisions something that i i encourage you to look at if you have not done so eh yet you know the the bank they released in the stability financial stability report published a few weeks ago an analysis regarding npl for the entire system and they what they did is look at information from the entire banking system from the last twenty years and they pay you know using an econometric model they they estimated you know where are the critical variables that determine npls and they break down the the the portfolio in consumer loans in mortgage loans and in corporates so once they determine you know these econometric model then they provided a you know a shock with the variables that we are seeing lately and they estimated how much npl ratios rate for the entire banking system for consumer loans that would imply a 32 increase for mortgages nineteen and for corporates also 32 so when you do that math and you break down you know by types of loans by type of bank you get to see you know this is obviously a ballpark estimate because obviously every single bank has different practices in origination practices and recoveries and so on but you can get a sense of the magnitude in terms of using this model you know how much you you will expect at each bank with with provision okay thank you thank hector for the detailed responses we will take the next question it comes from the line of ernesto from bank of america please go ahead hi good morning hector thanks for the opportunity my 1st question is a follow up on the preventive provisions of 349 pesos so you think this level of provisions will be enough for the rest of the year or are you going to evaluate to create more depending on the behavior of payments up to the relief program and then my 2nd question is a different one because we would like to know if you have exposure to either mexico on the chapter eleven or that has restructured loans with the banks for about a year but i understand that you can not disclose your exposure so maybe if you can remind us how much of your loan book is exposed to airlines and how much to food and beverage and if there is a sector that is concerning you and finally my my last question is competition in mortgage loans we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates of mortgages in light of the lower rates so how has been your strategy to attract more more mortgage clients and how competitive is your interest rate thank you thank you ernesto let me let me start and then maybe i will complement 1st of all on the of provision like i have spoken many times to my cro and he basically tells me that when i ask you and ask him the same question that you are asking me at this and he says look i do not have my crystal ball so clear and it is quite impossible not impossible but it is difficult to assess what we are doing i mean what i can tell you is that we are doing our best job in in basically reviewing the portfolio we do like that we see the rate that we review the the behavior and we are basically trying to be as conservative as we can in order to manage it so and if we see that the portfolio continues to deteriorate it is much more complicated we are going to find out i mean the payment shock comes in the 1st week of august we are preparing for next week actually when the 1st loans that went into the holiday start to to mature and we we see that we see how the performance of the portfolio is and then we will take you are going to see our numbers right as i mean we are going to take the provisions as soon as they come if needed okay and the 2nd point in mexico yes and and we do have exposure to them nothing that we cannot control or nothing too big for the size of the bank i mean our top exposure to airlines is not big i mean compared to the top of the heights of the portfolio i would say eh probably it is not big it is not very significant versus the size of the bank and we have loans or provisions already on some to mexico so we can tell you that in in the provisions that we make some of them are made to for the exposure which is not relevant in terms of yes we do have exposure to them also not i mean not significant and we are basically in those structure and process as of now and we see that the company can recover fairly i mean i do not see that in that particular situation unfortunately in front of me and we can back to you on that one in terms of the competition of mortgage loans it is quite important what we do we cannot important differentiation in terms of how we do mortgages versus our competition if you take a look at what fees it is a completely different prototype nobody has replicated in the mexican market i mean some of the other banks basically have tried to do what we are doing the best rate available in the market but in order to get the rate rate available in the market which is seven points 75 for a fifteen year mortgage you have to basically turn into turn 1st into your most important bank to your number bank number one bank but in order to be able to get that rate you have to have different products with us that basically you have to have your payroll you have to direct maybe you you you have to have your insurance you have to something that you have to do in order to access the rate in that regard what happens is even if the loan is at seven75 and we are also very cautious in the loan value that we are doing that that loan that is why precisely i was explaining in the presentation that that is why our for mortgage is 37 larger than the rest so we go directly to the mort to the wealthy people okay to the people that are in the best situation right now so we believe that our portfolio is more resilient in this particular situations and also that we get the best client because those are the ones that basically can achieve this rate and can achieve these and have these characteristics to act in this type of role so that is why the the the portfolio we believe is going to behave well and is going to be managed or is going be behave in a nice in a nice way due to that fact okay and we have seen the way the portfolio has performed and we see that the performance is according to our expectations given the very complicated circumstances okay so in that regard i mean there is competition i mean there are some banks i mean a couple of banks have tried to come in and and basically compete with us head to head in this type of situations and they have not been able to have the same type of problems that we send to the market then we came out with another prototype the basically has a particular and has everything included in the rate you do not have any fees any commissions you do not have to pay for any ancillary costs or anything like that so that particular thing is for people that i mean that they believe that we have a lot of things under the table and that we are not completely clear it is completely transparent to the client and that is above nine as a rate and and that is for a difficult different type of client so we have a chinese menu for every different type of what we do and and for example for a different sector that is mutual that is basically clients with lower ticket and well there are some of these clients are very good and have very good credit quality and that is what we decided to compete in that sector i do not know if these answer your question or not please be a complement sure hector eh regarding your 1st 1st question ernesto it was as previously mentioned uniting on the you know how severe is the contraction this year you know and how that impacts the capacity for clients to to pay back their loans we think that eventually if there is you know a u type recovery and gdp contracting somewhere around ten twelve then we have made with the provisions of this quarter more than half of what we require and that could be you know sixty 75 of what we require you know with information that we have right now okay but it is going to be dependent on how this evolves and obviously we are closely monitoring eh you know how our clients are are behaving okay now on your 2nd question regarding the exposure that you have to mexican eh your obviously for reasons we cannot disclose those but we can eh reassure you that these two exposures that we have are not within our top ten exposures eh to mention we have already provisions partially exposure with mexico that is close to 45 of the exposure that we have that is not material okay and i do not have with me the breakdown in terms of food and beverage the breakdown that i have right now it is more the one that is used more for regulatory purposes and do not have that detail but eh for sure we can follow up with that this is super helpful thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from brian from citibank please go ahead everyone thank you for the opportunity to ask question before my question i wanted to make a that capability do so what was the percentage sorry i think that is forty right forty thank you and and now for my question you know quality and you mentioned portfolio has a large degree of my question is could you and the what are you expecting in terms of npl for thank you if you like i can take that hector the you know credit cards do not have collateral you know so so laws given defaults in in credit cards is eh close to 100 you know you you basically do not eh eh recover that much in terms of eh eh credit cards you know and you know we think that that is that is going to be one of the eh eh products eh most impacted you know when you look at you know the different types of loans that clients have you know we think that eh mortgages are the ones that you eh eh you do not pay you continue paying you know if there is just one loan that you continue paying that is that is mortgages and probably credit cards are eh you know at the bottom of eh your pay priorities you know when you have eh eh trouble the npls that that we see in in credit cards have been increasingly likely but i think is you know probably stable when you compare it historically so we do not expect you know a significant eh deterioration eh you know cost of risk by way of eh eh the provisions that eh we are taking it is close to eleven so i do not know hector if you would like to if perchance you would like to to further complement on this this is the operator mister chavez line has gone idle i will try to reconnect him at this time would we like to take the next question eh sure the next question comes from tito labarta from goldman sachs hi good morning thank you for the call and taking the questions one question on the the market related income i know you talked you know the big spike in the quarter but do do you think that goes back to normal already in the 3rd quarter or do you think that can remain elevated elevated for some period of time just to get i know it is hard to predict but market related income going forward and if i can ask just one follow up on on the provision you know i understand given this you kind of feel comfortable with where you are but you know if you look at the cost of risk before this quarter had been around twosix twoseven you know barring any changes in the scenario that you see right now is that twosix twoseven what we should expect sort of going forward as well again barring any significant changes in in the current scenario okay thank you i mean what i can tell you is yes we have had a good running in terms of market related income i think that that the banks position to lose hope the the important point is and in it continues to be the way that it is then you can expect that we can that we can basically have good numbers there i do not think that we are going to have in the in the in the 3rd quarter numbers as good as they were in the in the in this quarter both i mean it also depends on what is happening in in the next few days in the next few months in terms of the provisions and the cost of risk you want to comment on that absolutely eh you know i think that eh once you take out the provisions that we did this quarter i think that cost of risk should be slightly higher than the numbers that eh we were having over the last say five quarters eh but not to levels that we have reported this quarter so some require eh eh 300 pesos point that that would be my my eh my take and obviously as you mentioned you know with information that we currently have okay okay thank you i will take the next question it comes from the line of carlos gomez from hsbc please go ahead hello good morning i have a question about credit risk but not to your corporate but to the virtual financial system we already saw one company got has liquidated has been put in liquidation but eh by the national banking commission crisis being unable to operate so eventually one would imagine might get into trouble are you taking special precautions in regard to any sectors of the financial system and do do you think we you will encounter much trouble or most of them will be able to go through this okay thank you thank you carlos i mean i mean in all these particular situations and depend how long the crisis is going to take i mean it is probably going to take down some financial players i mean that since we are yes we are being very cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what their position is and their situation and we are going to basically continue to monitor that as the crisis continues to to to evolve so in that sense we are very close in to that particular sector we do not have i mean we are not a big lender to the sector i mean i can tell you that if you they are not in the ten most important clients they are not financial players so in that sense we are not worried about the that we have out to them but we are very concern taking a look and monitoring them all the time okay hopefully the crisis is shorter and nobody else goes down but we will see what happens any particular that using money special monitoring you know market related or consumer related or payroll i think microfinance is a sector that we need to be very close monitoring we do not have to we do not have to s a lot big to them but that is a sector that covering would be complicated as always in these type of situations the people that suffer the most are the ones that are on the are on the base of the pyramid so unfortunately that is the case and we are monitoring that quite closely thank you so much take the next question it comes from from please go ahead good morning thank you for taking my question my question is regarding liquidity i mean your liquidity improved nicely in the quarter in part it was all be to the $1800000000 that issuance but also given a very strong increase in funding with banks in this quarter so could you please provide some to the nature of this funding source and what would be your strategy for liquidity in the coming quarters thank you very much eh hi alonzo you know there are p several factors regarding liquidity pay pay i think that the the most relevant is our you know how we fund a a you know the let us say the loan to the that as mentioned was one of the strongest numbers that we have reported since we became a listed company close to 92 so that is that is in my opinion that is the most and fundamental way of looking at it then as you rightly mentioned the the debt issuance is you know contributed significantly to the increase of our liquidity coverage ratio and we are monitoring you know any p p potential use of the committed lines of credit that we have with our clients that if you look at it it is probably the one let us say risk that could materialize in in in the short term we have ample of liquidity to honor or pay you know every single committed line of credit that that we have but that that is the one the most relevant driver in terms of consumption of liquidity the other types of you know events that could impact our liquidity you know are you know are more gradual you know and those could be you know a contraction in deposits that we are not seeing that and i think that the bank has managed quite practically you know per liquidity to be prepared for you know any potential p p you know really worst case scenario further down the the road thank you and regarding the line of your balance sheet the line of bank and other loans which increased 81 in quarter one quarter do you do you do you think these line would will remain as close to those levels or do you think you could substitute these source of funding with probably other debt issuances in coming quarters what your strategy there you know we we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the the specific you know ten year cost you know we end up you know we drawing or take advantage of the the different funding sources so you know i would say that not only that particular line item but every single line item is is is reviewed you know and under current market circumstances we you know it is it is our p obligation to look at better ways of you know not only funding the bank but you know keeping structures in place so that the bank you know can continue supporting you know long growth so that is something that we continuously monitor alonzo so so yes you know it could be that we keep it at those levels or that we reduce it if there is an opportunity to find you know a a more effective funding source thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from yuri fernandes from j p morgan please go ahead thank you i have a question regarding the on npl ratio it was not quarter over quarter and i understood that some peers they had higher tier jobs and that may explain a little bit of difference but given how the players where the was not as high we kind of saw more flattish behavior because of the special accounting because of the so what drove the iterations quarter for for you and my 2nd qua question is regarding a special accounting criteria when we look to those numbers the the balance of natl they are much higher than than they once the old accounting versus the current special accounting and i would like some kind of difference here like a very negative outlook would be to see you know like those numbers materializing as losses so if you can explain for me the differences on the special accounting versus the old accounting and if the balance of natls there may may become losses i would appreciate thank you hi yuri in terms of the npl ratio you know this this quarter what drove this likely deterioration was basically a credit card that went up from fourfourteen to four82 and the and it is a miss basically going from two61 to three37 as as we discuss during the quarter during the call you know the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not enrolled in the in the support programs so but we are seeing you know this slight deterioration has to do more with what is happening with the the portfolio of the clients that did not did not enroll in the program and it is not a significant deterioration in our view given you know the the you know what is going on in the economy it was just a you know a slight deterioration now on your 2nd question could you elaborate on that you know i i do not i do not know exactly what you are comparing you know the special accounting criteria to the other accounting criteria so the previous accounting before the new regulation for for covid you have like a table on your release comparing the special accounting criteria versus the former i think like d six accounting criteria and when we look to the balance of non performing loans i believe the balance you have to date something like 18000000000 pes 19000000000 pesos that im that implies the twofive internal ratio but if you look to the old accounting criteria the the d six accounting i think the balance of npls they are closer to forty 44000000000 pesos so the npl ratio they would be much higher i understand that maybe a lot of loans that will not really become an npl that they are there but my concern is that as soon as these accounting criteria go go goes back to normal if we could see you know like a a a a higher need of provisions working on npls so that is why i ask the difference and if it if and if it makes sense you know to to expect them worsening on that you know i think that that you know it it is thoroughly dependent on the level of or or the type of assumptions that we make because the the system that accounting criteria is very stringent in terms of a a let us say a and percentage of you know how much you you the client have paid back so i think that it is it is a in my opinion it is it is somehow extreme comparison okay so it it has to do with you know with the special accounting criteria you basically allow clients not to pay you know or every client that is not paying their interest and capital stays current you know and under the old or the prevailing accounting criteria you know you have to take into account just the you know when you are ninety days past due and depending on if you are you know let us say corporate client you know depending on how much you have already paid back whether you are twenty or more or how you know the time that has elapsed you know it it it is very i would say the precaut i would say that the presumptions are critical and i think that probably what it is what is important is to understand that in the following two quarters we will get to know the the hard data you know we you know rather than you know comparing those numbers with big assumptions i think that as soon as clients start paying back or not we will get to know you know how you know the magnitude of the impact okay rather than just making you know some assumptions that you know could materialize or not as mentioned during the call i think that we have make we have made a good assessment in terms of the risk that each client has you know the relationship that we have with them and we have also asked them you know you know how they are doing and whether they have the capacity to pay back so taking all that into account that is how we we come up with this provisions associated with expected losses that we assume so i would encourage you yuri just to wait a couple of quarters and with with the hard data you know just analyze you know if we on one hand the benefit of these temporary measures that the banking commission provided and on the other hand you know the the the true impact that it has had you know no no spectacular thank you thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from nicolas riva from bank of america yes thank you very much for taking my question i have eleven question i apologize if you already mentioned it so you mentioned that nineteen of the of the loan portfolio has been subject to some kind of relief measure have these measures ended already for any clients and if so if you can tell us what percentage of these clients that have resumed payments already since it has been already about four months since the full outbreak of the pandemic and and if this has not been the case if the payment holiday has not ended for for any significant amount of clients if you can tell us when you make these these provision charts the 3900000000 pesos in this quarter did you incorporate any assumptions in terms of what will be the percentage of these nineteen of these clients under the debt relief program that will pay you back once the payment holidays end thank you you know 1st the payment holidays payment holiday period ends tomorrow so we will start the the you know seeing whether clients pay back or not starting next week so we do not have that information yet you know now regarding you know how we made provisions for for this quarter you know and as mentioned throughout the call you know we classified the clients depending on the risk that they have the exposure that they have with us the relationship that we have they have with us so we we classified the you know retail clients in 25 clusters and in eleven clusters so depending on the level of of cluster that each client falls in you know there is either a high risk or high exposure you know for clients and we assume certain probability of those clusters either paying back their loans or not okay so that is how we came up with with the with the provisions that we we we made this quarter so yes there is but it depends you know there are 36 responses in terms of you know whether b we expect a high number or number of clients to pay back their loans it is it is it you know it is it is because of these analysis that we have done that we feel relatively confident that with the information that we have what we have provided is is is good is a good provision for deterioration for the rest of the year okay thank you very much the next question comes from from ubs please go ahead okay thank you very much for taking my question it is just one i just wanted to understand the dynamic of the credit relief program held by the bank and on npls twofive and according to my calculation if their loans reach at almost fifteen of total loans if i am not wrong roughly a similar level to the other banks but different from other players and even considering the brazilians the chileans they have a npls decreased in the 2nd q you mentioned that this deterioration is coming from the sme and the credit card so i just wanted to understand if this high npls behaved worse than expected by the banks considering the amount of loans that were postponed and what does the bank sees for this semester in terms of fostering the credit relief program in case of regulators extend and change the rules for it so thank you very much i think that you know the 1st of all you know the npls that increased that we see in the 2nd quarter are also seeded with those clients that do not enter into the relief program okay so you have to do with that 81 of clients that decided not to enter into into the program and obviously those clients are also exposed to the the deterioration of economic activity you know hector mentioned you know the the the losses that you know the employee losses that we have seen so it is it has to do more with that okay with the let us say with the clients that do not enroll in the program okay whether we were expecting you know that type of deterioration you know i think that if someone tells you that they were envisioning this type of economic deterioration i think that they are lying you know i think that we have we were not expecting this type of contraction you know the magnitude that we are seeing you know if you look at how every single analyst updates his forecast for the mexican economy every week you get to see the downward adjustments so so i think that it do not surprises us you know we mentioned that given this this deterioration of economic activity we think it is just a slight deterioration okay the but as mentioned we will get to see the final impact or the final numbers probably in the next two to three quarters you know it is not only what happens the rest of the year i think that this the impact of the pandemic at least for mexico has a possibility of you know going further than just 2020 so so we will get to see that okay i think it is it is a quite early to to have a definitive view on a complete impact on on other quality okay okay thank you very much the last question comes from from btt please go ahead hi everyone my questions were already answered thank you very much there are no further questions in the queue and i would now like to turn the floor back over to mister hector chavez for any closing remarks thank you operator and thanks everyone once again for joining santander mexico on this call as

earnings call today i hope you and your families are healthy and safe as we discussed last quarter mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the health industry is a key priority our well being of our employees and customers has remained our utmost priority before giving you an update on the measures that we implemented in this regard let me begin a review by providing context this pandemic has been quite challenging as we started seeing the impact of the pandemic on the mexican economy on our business and our course on our results despite the impact let me assure you that our bank remains strong and focused 1st our capital on the liquidity levels are solid and well above the minimum regulatory levels 2nd we have a clear strategy which we are executing to support our customers and minimize the impact of the pandemic on the finances and 3rd we expect to emerge from this difficult environment as a stronger institution business volumes closed the 2nd quarter with high single digit year on year growth while we experienced an adverse shift in our portofolio mix towards lower yielding segments consumer and sme loans started to contract inline with market trends while the commercial and mortgage loans were resilient and continued to register a growth the timely measures implemented by bank of mexico and the cnb have allowed us to maintain ample levels of liquidity and capital enabling us to offer our customers support mechanisms to temporarily alleviate the cash flow and the financial stress caused by the economic fallout of the pandemic although asset quality deteriorated slightly in the quarter we made preemptive loan provisions of 3900000000 pesos in addition to the normal quarterly provisions in preparation for our future losses we would revise this amount as more information becomes available on the performance of our loan portfolio during the coming quarters as we normally do we will provide an overview of our business environment but let me emphasize again our conviction that as you might recall 2020 gdp growth expectations for the mexican economy were modest prior to the pandemic mainly due to weak private investment prospects with these indicators showing a contraction of more than twenty year on year in economic activity and 37 year on year in year on year drop in fixed investment market consensus expectations have been revised down to around nine annual decrease in gdp growth in 2020 and 2021 the activity resulted in the loss of more than 1000000 formal jobs during the 2nd quarter according to social security data but as many as 20000000 jobs lost taking into account informal employment following the past two severe economic crises back in 95 and 2009 it took seven quarters for the mexican economy to recover its previous level of economic activity however in the current one we consider with external demand remaining only gradually and without any mechanism to alleviate households income loss and open economy like mexico faces a slow path to recover to previous activity levels with 2021 growth being forecasted at only three it could take three to four years to recover 2019 levels of activity under these conditions inflation pressures should remain low we expect threesix for 2020 allowing bank of mexico to cause interest rates a little further we expect another 100 basis points of cuts through the year all the year which would take the reference rate around four a year in summary this business scenario of low growth and low interest rates represents a challenging outlook for mexico commercial and consumer environments and for our business next we turn to slide five you will notice that despite the severe shock to economic activity and employment the systems loans and deposit volumes still show a significant year over year expansion of eight and fourteen respectively explain by large and medium sized companies and government entities that have drawn on the credit lines to maintain liquidity over balance sheets in order to continue operating during the months of which the stay at home guidelines have been in effect on the other hand consumer loans showed a relevant contraction reflecting the initial impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior and proactive origination practices being maintained by financial institutions it is worth noting that system wide demand deposits remain strong up eighteen year on year likely reflecting heightened needs for liquidity among households and companies while still at home guidance remains in effect please turn to slide six where we would like to give you an update on the bank operations during the past few months i will help and business continuity protocols remain in place such as suspending non essential travel limiting the number of people at gatherings and group events and enhancing sanitization measures at branches corporate offices apms and contact centers as of today most corporate employees continue working from home while only essential personnel are working on site approximately eighty of the bank branches are open and 92 of our atm locations are operational our digital channels and contact centers have also been operating normally our digital monetary transactions increased 64 year on year while our digital sales represented 44 of total sales plus as they did last year as we continue promoting customers use of digital channels which continues to drive adoption levels further more ip resources have been channeled into implementing we multiply in tools with cybersecurity being a priority during this critical time we have been supporting our customers through a disaster relief program offering deferred payments for individuals and smes and case by case debt restructuring to our corporate customers i will elaborate on this program in a moment as part of our commitment to our communities we have made numerous donations and supported initiatives that aid the medical community and vulnerable populations on slide seven you will find an snapshot of our debt support program that i mentioned before currently nineteen of our total loan portfolio is under the payment holiday program for individual and smes 600000 customers benefiting from it through this program we are helping customers who have encountered liquidity problems by allowing them to skip loan payments both interest and principal for four months without any penalty or cost because of this feature feature under the program it is difficult to assess at this time the extent of the pandemic is impact on our asset quality however we have been proactive in addressing asset quality over the past few months by contacting our customers to better understand their financial situation and by analyzing their ability to pay more than 55 of our branch network personnel is focused on recoveries calling customers directly likewise the collections and commercial risk departments segmented the portfolio by level of concern identifying risk and exposure according to customer quality through this more granular approach we are we have also been analyzing our customer behavior patterns using our crm capabilities and i know that more than 95 of our paying customers continue to receive their salaries for those paying customers who are not longer receiving their salary we are collecting for unemployment insurance with current information we estimate that close to forty of our paying customers are not longer receiving their salary we believe that our customers should be able to continue honoring fully the condition of their loans in order to speed up the recovery process it will not be until the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year that we will have sufficient hard data on the behavior of the portfolio with regard to our commercial book we are taking steps to address the issue we take a case by case approach to manage our exposure as we did during the past critical periods we have remained very close to our customers and are helping them navigate this current challenging environment for those companies that face difficulties we have been offering multiple alternatives to support them our current portfolio of commercial construction loans is close to 50000000000 pesos and accounts for sixteen of our loan portfolio with medium and large sized corporate borrowers in addition to actively managing our portfolio know that 76 of our payment holiday portfolio is associated with mortgages and smes which both have guarantees within our total smes book 67 of the portfolio is backed up by warranties issued by napkins one of mexican development banks which allows us to share the risk with them specifically for those smes that are in the refinance program 75

seventy providing very good warranty coverage the mpl ratio of this portfolio is threesix and has been quite stable for some time for the past two years our hypothecation plus mortgage has allowed us to attract higher income customers which are more defensive to the span of this point our average ticket has been increasing since our launch since we launched our product and it is currently not only the highest among our peers but service is 37 higher than the average ticket of our peers in addition if our credit card customers are loyal as they also have their pearl and their credit cards with us having a low loan to value ratio as well as being the main bank of our customer lowers our cost i want to talk about the non payment issue as this type of customer tends to prioritize the home mortgages in economic downturns of course considering the level of guarantees we have the structure of our portfolio and the proactive measures we are taking we consider we are on the right path to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the quality of the loan portfolio on slide nine let me comment on origination dynamics and the mix we have seen thank you commercial loans continue to support total loan growth therefore their contribution within local loan origination increased from 78 in the 2nd quarter of nineteen to 82 in the 2nd quarter of 2020 behind with this commercial loans now represent 64 of our total loans this changing mix has had an impact on our nii as we will be explaining later in the call in terms of origination dynamics we have seen encouraging trends during the quarter that i worked noting here in the mortgage and commercial segments june is loan origination registered relevant sequential improvements compared to may surpassing january is 2020 level in consumer loans june loan origination remains 25 below the 1st quarter twenty monthly average however it expanded 33 as you can see on the flight ten our capital and liquidity positions are very strong at the end of june our common equity tier one ceo one ratio stood at elevensix 58 basis points above march and was significantly in excess of the eighttwo minimum requirement established for the bank our size the decision taken during april shareholders meeting to postpone the dividend payment for 2019 has allowed us to further strengthen our capital position in terms of liquidity our 2nd quarter in 2020 liquidity coverage ratio reached 211 well above the bank the bank of the mexican regulatory requirement and supported by senior notes we issued back in april before turning the call over to the chair i would like to finish my remarks by ratifying that we have been acting safely and decisively to further strengthen our bank in order to mitigate the impact of the current crisis on our operations in addition to implementing proper protocols and measures to protect our employees and customers we have continued serving clients with high standards of customer service through our branches and the internet channels again we are confident that our bank is well positioned to support the customers as they recover from this unprecedented crisis let me pass all the call over to tdv where we will review the borrower is most important trends and metrics thank you thank you ector good day everybody please turn to slide eleven for an overview of recent loan performance total loans expanded seven year over year but contracted three sequentially given a strong corporate loan demand at the end of the 1st quarter low margin segments are growing twice as fast as high margin segments where smes and credit cards contracted nine the banking sector is facing some challenges due to the economic weakness of the economy and as a result credit growth has slowed down this is as per the data available with the reserve bank of india the credit growth for agriculture and mse sectors has slowed down by six and six respectively year on year due to the weak economic conditions on the other hand mortgage loans have increased by a solid nine year on year and expanded by thirteen when excluding the run off effects of gnis and gse portfolios which was well above market growth high margin segments have reduced their contribution to net interest income by almost 100 basis points individual loans on slide twelve have grown by fourteen year on year however the mortgage segment has slowed down growing four on a year on year basis mainly supported by mortgages as mentioned previously mortgages have proved to be a defensive segment within the mexican market during past periods of economic instability with this in mind we decided to lower even more the rate of our hipotecaria plus product to seven75 targeting loyal customers as of june close to sixty of our mortgage origination was coming from hipotecaria plus which allows us to increase cross selling in july we launched a new product a new mortgage product called hipoteca free which is the 1st commission free mortgage product in mexico unique characteristics of this product are that the customers do not have to pay an application fee monthly commission or a home appraisal fee nor are life and unemployment insurance required leaving only notary fees to be paid by the customer when acquiring this product as you can see even during these challenging times we have not stopped there continues to be a downward trend in credit card loans as we take a more conservative approach toward this segment in addition to managing customers credit limits credit card usage declined thirty year over year during the quarter as many clients stayed at home this drop had a negative impact on balances of course after usage rates reached a very low level in april they recovered in may and june although remaining low below 1st quarter levels growth in our consumer loans has been concentrated in personal loans growing twofive year over year and still above the market per cnvb data as of the end of may personal loans continue to contract consistent with our strategy to focus on more defensive segments of the market as sector noted finally our auto loan production in june more than double compared to previous quarters average boosted by our new commercial vehicle program management with mazda turning to slide thirteen growth in our base of loyal and digital customers continues demonstrating important progress with year on year increases of almost seventeen and 31 respectively despite the challenging business environment loyalty penetration that is loyal to active customers stands at 35 405 points higher than a year ago we have still continued growth in the use for digital channels as customers have stayed home during the pandemic digital product sales via digital channels accounted for 44 of the total almost doubling year ago levels digital monetary transactions also spiked reaching almost 13rd of the total while mobile transactions represented 93 of total digital transactions versus 84 in 2019 mobile customers also kept growing at a solid 38 year on year rate reaching 4300000 at the end of the quarter as you can see on slide fourteen commercial loans grew nine year over year but decreased sequentially as some corporates started pre paying some lines withdrawn in the 1st quarter of this year government and middle market segments continued to register double digit year over year expansion although their sequential evolution showed lower and stable volumes respectively sme loans registered a 4th sequential quarterly contraction as this segment showed a weakening trend even before the pandemic outstanding loans are similar to the ones we had in the 4th quarter of 201710 quarters ago the downward trend is also related to our lower fee appetite for lending in the sme segment given that more than fifty of our sme loan book joined the payment holiday the forbearance program and those customers cannot use their credit lines while in the program loan origination in this segment will remain low until we have more visibility on the performance of the economy moving on to the next slide on slide fifteen this increased ten year on year while quarter on quarter we saw a three contraction during the quarter there was a shift between demand and time deposits favored by lower interest rates as of the 2nd quarter of this year demand deposits represented 64 of total deposits and were up eleven year on year deposit growth from individuals stands out at 23 year on year supported by our promotion campaign after a typical 1st quarter of this year deposits from individuals continue to grow faster than corporate deposits in line with our strategy to further increase our exposure to retail deposits retail deposits now represent 33 of total deposits almost forty basis points higher than its contribution in the 1st quarter of 2018 speaking of slide sixteen we have a very strong capital and liquidity as a sector had highlighted we maintain a sound funding position with a net loan to deposit ratio of 9181 of the strongest levels since becoming a listed company our liquidity coverage ratio increased 89 percentage points relative to the 1st quarter of this year and now stands at 211 well above the regulatory threshold of 100 we also remain very comfortable with our debt profile with manageable debt maturities as you can see on slide seventeen effective interest income decreased four year over year and six on a quarterly basis net interest margin contracted at 128 basis points to fourfive for the quarter our margin decline was a result of lower interest rates and lower balances within the high yielding segments coupled with higher average assets as a consequence of a significant increase in our securities portfolio without these last effects our nim would have contracted only 54 basis points a sector explained earlier was speaking net interest margin please move on to slide eighteen net commissions and fees decreased two one year on year credit card transactions declined in credit card usage decreased 42 in april 34 in may and fourteen in june on a year on year basis insurance fees registered only a slight contraction given renewals of several groups insurance policies which partially compensated for sector insurance demand insurance represents almost thirty of total fees and has proven to be a defensive segment even considering the pandemic with health and life insurance growing while rural insurance is slightly decreased our investment banking team has been very active mainly in financial advisory services which translated into strong fee growth of 31 in this line of our business which partially compensated for weaker results in other areas mainly credit card fees turning to slide nineteen gross premium income grew nine year over year the current interest rates the effects of market volatility especially during april and may supported market making income in addition we sold investment securities in order to further strengthen our liquidity position generating non recurring gains that boosted these quarters results all this contributed for marketable income that accounted for thirteeneight of growth of operating revenues threefive times higher than historical average of four going on to provisions on slide twenty in light of the deterioration of mexico is economic environment and in anticipation of a possible declaration of a loan portfolio both due to the pandemic in june we registered a special charge of low loans provisions on top of both the 3900000000 pesos charge raised total provisions to 8350000000 pesos in the quarter up 88 year on year and 62 sequentially we have made this estimate of pre emptive provisions with the information currently at hand however this amount could be revised in the future as more information becomes available cost of risk for the quarter stood at three one a 44 basis point increase 49 basis points sequentially our total npl ratio showed a slide of 28 basis points year over year increase to twofive mainly due to the sme segment together with our mortgage and credit card portfolios as explained earlier these ratios only reflect the performance of 81 of our total portfolio that does not fall under the payment holiday program we consider this ratio encouraging as its evolution is quite benign when considering the significant deterioration in economic activity and employment however it will not be until the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year of this year that the deductors program will end it will be at that time when npi ratios will reflect the real magnitude of the economic impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide 221 administrative and promotional expenses increased onetwo year over year reflecting the if the the the main focus of the report is to control personnel costs mainly research for viable compensation and amortization expenses related to the strategic and it investments that we made over the past three years as we will continue investing in the digitalization of the bank and in technology upgrades we are targeting greater operating efficiencies in the common quarters such as the ability to reduce the number of business trips variable compensation as well as limiting base salary increases among other improvements less business travel and salary cap such expense controls combined with strong operating income and the conclusion of our three year investment plan contributed to a 358 basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio which decreased to fortyseven on a six month basis duration proved 227 basis points year on year to 42three on slide 22 you will note that our earnings were mainly impacted by the special low loan provisions that we discussed earlier profit before taxes was down 24 year on year for the quarter and eleven for the 1st half of the year net income decreased 25 year on year to 4200000000 pesos while our effective tax rate increased 38 basis points year on year to 25three this resulted in an elevenfive decrease in net income decrease in net income for the 1st six months of 2020 which was 9600000000 pesos return on equity was elevennine 543 basis points below the year ago level and down 362 basis points sequentially year to date aroe contracted 328 basis points to thirteenfive let me now turn the call back to hector grisey for some final remarks please go ahead thank you very much the next slide is slide 23 let me share with you some final thoughts on what lies ahead given the unprecedented nature of this health crisis and the uncertainty surrounding its duration and magnitude we anticipate only a very gradual recovery of the economy which has obvious implications with regard to our operating environment we expect our long term portfolio to be driven by loans mainly medium and large corporations farm and loans as well as mortgages the consumer will recover very gradually and this will depend on the speed of the eventual turnaround in employment economic activity as well as business and consumer confidence although visibility on asset quality is limited due to the parent holiday program we have been talking and taking rapid and decisive action in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the loan book a recovery plan which includes a very detailed and in depth analysis of each customer situation is allowing us to preemptively and swiftly prepare the bank for complicated quarters ahead in particular we have allocated a large number of current employees and branches involving carrying out recovery strategy we will continue focusing on enhancing customer loyalty and uncross selling non credit products to support non performing so we also remain committed to making additional investments in the bank transformation mainly in it and deutilization but we will continue to look for efficiencies in other lines with strict cost control in order to support the bottom line and finally rest assured that our banks is operating from a position of strength with robust capital and high liquidity levels that we allow us to overcome this complicated but what we believe are temporary circumstances we are not ready to take a question hello this is the q a operator please go ahead thank you if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again please press star one to ask a question please ask one question and a follow up if you have further questions please re enter the queue we will pause for just a moment to allow everyone to hear the question thank you hi thank you very much my question is on the operating outlook the disclosure is excellent as always and i like the way you presented it on slide nineteen we can look at the the main the main drivers for the operating income and clearly as you we talked about market related revenue was very strong well above historical levels about fourteen of the total operating income compared to let us say three or four in the past these are different times but how should we think about efficiency going forward you talked about cost control we saw that if you if you can just give us some  general sense you mentioned how there are certain costs you are you can control and you are controlling can you talk a little bit about the physical infrastructure is there an opportunity to rationalize physical branch network after the investments you you made what should we be looking for in terms of efficiency going forward the dynamic is is quite skewed from all of these moving parts the very high trading and and and the low the low revenues given what is going on thank you thank you look i mean as you have said i mean and if you take a look at our numbers basically we have decreased the operation cost of the bank quite significantly i mean 1st of all i mean not traveling and not doing many things basically have reduced naturally the cost but we have also been very strict in the in new projects and new situations i mean we are basically focusing all our expenses in it to support the backbone and to be ready for what is coming so in that sense that is going to be our priority secondly we are taking a look and we are doing a deep dive in terms of all our infrastructure and we are not going to get taken in by rough decisions in terms of closing down a big number of branches or anything like that i think we are going to be rationaly looking at each of the micro markets that we have divided the country into and we will decide with evolution of the economy what should happen there so but we are going to be very strict you have seen the growth of the post four or five years in terms of branches we actually have decreased the number of total branches we have just we have been very intelligent in the way we have managed that what we have done is upgraded the current and the most important we are going to basically rationalize all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all we also believe that i mean given that we have been able to operate at the bank under this scenario we have a huge amount of people basically working from home you basically get under the sun exactly how really how much people do you need what can you rationalize et cetera so what you are going to see from us is that we are going to be very responsible in the way we manage that and concentrate on those points we are working currently on that plan we are working on our three year plan and and we are basically including all these in our proposal maybe as a follow up just some comments on what you have seen throughout your peers in the sector and their group in the in the region or elsewhere are there other things you think that could be applied to mexico that could help perhaps on the side of the banking system perhaps in terms of regulation operationally or ity or any factors at all thank you what we are doing basically is for example i mean in terms of developing digital platforms et cetera but we are doing it we are doing it now instead of each country basically developing the platforms we are doing it together so that basically is going to help out quite a lot so it is not mexico for example right now in mexico we are developing the new super app and the new super app is going to be used in all the other countries so for example the onboarding for smes we are using the one that is being developed in europe so all those types of things are going to help us out basically in reducing our cost for the digital infrastructure that we are developing and we are working together much more within the group in order to do that so you are going to see that i mean the cost of basically developing things and it is going to come down due to the fact that we are doing it together with the rest of our tenancy system so so that is the next question comes from the line of jorge cuevas from morgen stanley please go ahead hi good morning everyone i wanted to ask about net interest margin you you pointed out that you expect it to improve futher complications in the next couple of quarters given falling rates and weak loan demand and mix deterioration as you look at 2021 in the context of what you said on not a strong economic recovery next year and with average rates next year being much lower than 2020 if indeed rates head up to about four and what is the expectation for net income margin next year and for and nii is it possible that we are likely to see another year of nii compression and to what extent that will be offset elsewhere in the pnl and my 2nd question is on on the coverage ratio and i and i know that by you know the banks normally do not target a coverage ratio i get it but but evidently the the size of your reserves have a relationship to the size of your loan book the size of your mbs and the size of the amount of loans that are on their restructuring and so when i look at your coverage ratio 10138 it looks low relative to where panarion is at about 201 and bank of  sachs at 185 so i wonder you know why why not just you know take a much bigger charge on provisions this quarter you know evidently there is there is a lot of uncertainty ahead and the more the better and and so is this piece meal just going to you know potentially put more pressure on your earnings going forward rather than just you know take a really big one soup and you know raise your coverage to north of 200 and and i would like to introduce you to the 3rd quarter thank you look okay i will ask this sector i will ask answer the 1st part and then i will ask you to be there to complete on the on the basic numbers of niiyok i mean 1st of all i mean if you saw the presentation we are basically changing the mix of of the crazy loan portfolio yeah okay 1st of all i mean if you have seen i mean we have decreased quite a lot i am sorry unfortunately to us that means given the lack of  warrants from the government from nafinsa ok so the portafolio has dropped almost ten so in that sense that basically is a high yield portafolio which is going to continue to shrink unless we we see some guarantees from the government and i mean if you see our portafolio which is quite important we have like 62 of it already guaranteed by nafinsa ok the court case this basically goes to answer your 2nd question the question in terms of  the amount of  the amount of research that we have done then  you see that also we see that for example consumer credit and consumer loans are going to decrease as well so the mix is completely changing we are going i mean we are going basically back to where we were five years ago where we had much more exposure to corporations and to medium sized companies than to consumer loans remember that we so that is why and nielsen is shrinking on the other side what we have also been doing is we have been pricing and we are very strict on pricing risk so we have been increasing the margin on the corporate loans quite significantly due to that fact that we are basically looking at the the risk that we are taking and we are looking very closely at the ratings of those companies and we are pricing risk accordingly this is not a situation which we want to spend the port for the great port of all you know just to expand it we are basically doing it just to the companies that we believe have a future and that will be there in the next few years and that both were pricing the risk accordingly so in that sense you are going to see it going towards that also the other concentration is mortgages which we believe i mean there is a sector still of growth i mean you know there is a lack of capital or a big deficit in terms of homes in mexico so we believe there is still a part of the population that can afford a mortgage mortgage penetration is quite low in mexico so it was quite low versus the rest and also low penetration is quite low so we believe there is a chance to to continue penetrate that sector and maybe on payrolls on some situations we will basically be also lending in that in that part i mean and auto loans also we have seen some interesting developments there with i think the cautious approach to it so in that sense the mix of the portfolio is going to change and probably we will get to know exactly how we see the nii evolving in terms of what you were asking in terms of the reserves we we have we actually been doing reserves according to what we believe we are doing in terms of how the portfolio is is behaving at this point what i can tell you is that the portfolio is performing well i think the payment holidays is behaving much much better than we believed and that he was going to turn actually i am quite surprised about it hopefully it continues that way but in that sense we are basically being in my opinion being very responsible in the amount of research that we are making at this point also we have done a tremendous job with the data that we have in reviewing the portfolio on holidays and that portfolio is being divided as we said in 36 clusters ok these clusters have been divided upon upon the amount of risk that we have on each particular situation and in some of these portfolios even before the payment holiday ends we are already talking to clients and discussing the way that we could get them we believe on those particular situations because what we believe is that whoever gets paid 1st is the one again there is the one that is going to get paid so we are basically being very aggressive on that sense to talk to our clients and basically trying to get that to recover that portfolio as you have seen 55 of our branches have been turned into collecting branches i mean to basically this we are dedicating our executives to collect we have divided them up on them in the sectors that we believe are the ones that are the ones that are going to be much more important or that are going to be hit the most in the economy so in that sense i really were very well received although i mean or nevertheless it is always i mean a lot of uncertainty in what is happening and we did not want to go overboard we believe it is the right the right approach is the one that we have made but we will continue to over the next three months we will be able to see the evolution but i can tell you that we are going to be very conservative in the way we manage that okay deji do you want to complete that absolutely absolutely i would like to compliment on what you mentioned great talking to you jorge long time no speak in terms of nims you know definitely you know as we laid out in the presentation we see significant pressures and let me just tell you that background information that i think it is it is quite relevant the the speed at which interest rates have come down in mexico is is significant you know just in this quarter the average of the reference reference rate came down 123 basis points that is the the fastest decline that we have seen in the recent history we we did not see an increase of those you know you know you know the market you know you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the market you know the that magnitude when interest rates were were coming up ok so that is one thing to have in mind that the the impact in nim that you see in this quarter i think is is probably the most severe that we are going to see you know on a relative basis relative to the 1st quarter of this year and relative to the 2nd quarter of last year ok also bearing in mind that when interest rates were close to four we probably agree with you that that is where we are headed you know our nim was close to five you know and this was you know the 2nd and 3rd quarter of 2016 i think that a you know the the number that we reported before 48 in this quarter and that has to do with what i was referring to you know the speed at which interest rates came down ok and also on top of that you have the the the number that we reported before 48 in this quarter and that has to do with what i was referring to you know the speed at which interest rates came down ok and also on top of that you have the the the number that we reported before 48 in this quarter and that has to do with what i was referring to you know the speed at which interest rates came down the change in in mix on the loan side and also the fact that in order to protect the net interest income from interest rates coming down we we increased our investment in securities portfolio significantly you know and those are you know lower margin assets assets relative to the long portfolio just just to you know share with you we have bought you know and this takes into account you know both the investments and majors the overall growth in our pay investment in securities portfolio is 96000000000 pesos over the last twelve months so what we expect coming is a positive trend you know pay for the rest of 2020 and the you know next year i think that you know having said that there is still a lot of uncertainty you know i think that probably the the most severe numbers in terms of nim are the ones that we saw this quarter you know there is probably you know the ten to fifteen basis points further adjustment or further adjustments ok i think the improvement for the rest of the year ok next year i think that we will probably get to see names similar or slightly above to the ones that we were seeing in this quarter ok now regarding the the coverage ratio you are totally right in the sense that we do not target that coverage ratio that is that resulting number and also you know when you make reference to you know our number 138 looks low relative to vanorte you know vanorte in the 1st quarter of this year they had 140 in this in the 2nd quarter they did as we did also you know but increase the provisions but different to us you know they did a significant charge off 4600000000 pesos so that is why you know their but correlation increased to 200 and the i am probably just elaborating elaborating more on what doctor dector mentioned you know the level of provisions that we have are in line with the expected losses that we estimate you know you might have  you know  or you might question whether we you know this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that the you know you know we are you know we are working on improving our processes under the current circumstances we have definitely done different types of sensitivity analyzes or scenario analyzes okay so if there is a b type recovery in the mexican economy you know we have with these quarters provisions we are you know more than covered you know for the rest of the year now do we think that there is going to be a b type recovery in the mexican economy i do not think so you know it is very very you know no probable now we we have assessed you know the the or level of provisions according to other type of scenarios you know more a u type or an adverse scenario having a gdp contraction of twelvefive you know and under those circumstances these quarterly provisions are not enough for the entire year there could be close to 76 to 75 depending on the magnitude of the gdp contraction so so there there should be direct correlation between expected losses and provisions and the provisions that we are putting forward we think that with information that we have are you know quite strong to cover you know expected losses if the economy ends up certainly we will need to provide additional provisions something that i encourage you to look at if you have not done so yet you know the central bank of vanuatu released in the financial stability report published a few weeks ago an analysis regarding npls for the entire system what they did is look at information from the entire banking system for the last twenty years and they used an econometric model to estimate you know what the critical variables are that determine npls and they break down the loan portfolio in consumer loans in mortgage loans and corporate so once they determine you know these economic variables they determine you know these economic variables they can make predictions about the future of npls so when you do that math and you break it down that means a 32 increase for mortgages nineteen for corporates also 32 so when you do that math and you break it down that means a 32 increase for mortgages nineteen for corporates also 32 now you know by the type of loans by type of bank you get to see you know this is obviously a ball park estimate because obviously every single bank has different practices in you know origination practices and recoveries and so on but you can get a sense of the magnitude in terms of you know using this model you know how much you you would expect that each bank would would provision okay we will take the next question it comes from the line of ernesto garilondo from bank of america please go ahead hi good morning hectora andrade thanks for the opportunity my 1st question is a follow up on the preventive provisions of 3900000 pesos so you think this level of provisions will be enough for the rest of the year or and then my 2nd question is a difficult one because we would like to know if you have exposure to ibermexico under chapter eleven or to alsea that has restructured loans with the banks for about a year but i understand if you cannot disclose your exposure so maybe if you can remind us how much of your loan book is exposed to airlines and how that exposure has changed over time food and beverage and there is a sector that is concerning you and and finally my last question is some competition in mortgage loans we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates or mortgages in light of of the lower rates so how has been your strategy to attract more mortgage clients and how competitive is your interest rate thank you thank you let me let me start and then if you would compliment 1st of all on the follow up provisions like i have not spoken many times to my cro and he basically tells me that when i asked you and asked him the same questions and you are asking me at this and he basically says look i mean i have a crystal ball that is so clear and it means it is quite impossible i mean not impossible but it is going to be very difficult to assess what we are doing i mean what i can tell you is that we are doing our best job in basically reviewing the portfolio and we do that every single day we review the the behavioral bit and we are basically trying to be as conservative as we can in order to manage it so and if we see that the portfolio continues to deteriorate on is so much more complicated we are going to find out i mean the payment shock comes in the 1st week of august we are preparing next week actually when the 1st loans that went into the payment holiday is start to to mature and and we see the we will see how the performance of the portfolio is and then we take i mean you are going to see our numbers right as i mean we will want to take the provisions as soon as they come if needed ok and our 2nd point in arizona yes and and say yes we do have exposure to them nothing that we cannot control or nothing too big for the size of the bank i mean our total exposure to airlines is not big i mean compared to the total size of the portfolio i would say probably the percentage much better but this is  is is not big i mean it is  is not very significant versus the size of the bank and we have done some provisions already on some of the exposure we have supported to idomexico okay can tell you that in the in the provisions that we made some of them are made for for the air mix exposure which is not relevant in terms of valspar yes we do have exposure to them or also not i mean not significant and we are basically in the restructuring and process as of now and and we see that the company can recover fairly i mean i do not see that valspar is going to be a particular situation for us unfortunately i do not have it in front of me and we could not get back to you on that in terms of the competition of mortgage loans it is quite important what we do we have an important differentiation in terms of how we do mortgages versus our competition if you take a look at what independence bank does it is a completely different product that nobody has replicated in the mexican market i mean we have a unique value proposition the other banks basically have tried to do a little bit of what we do in nippon export and import bank nippon export and import bank is the best rate available in the market but in order to get the rate based available in the market which is seven75 for a fifteen year mortgage you have to basically turn into turn earth into your most important bank to your number one bank bank number one bank what in order to get the rate based available in the market you basically have to get that rate you basically have to have different products with us that basically you have to have your paperwork you have to direct debit your utilities with us you have to have your insurance you have to have your insurance so there is something that you have to do in order to be able to access that rate in that regard what happens is even if the loan is at seven75 and we are also very cautious in the loan to value that we do in that loan that is why that is why so we were explaining in the presentation that that is why our ticket for mortgage is 37 larger than the rest so we go directly to the mortgage to the wealthy people ok so the people that are in the best situation right now so we believe that our portfolio is more resilient in these particular situations and also that we get the best client because those are the ones that basically can achieve this rate and can achieve this and ok so and we have seen the way the portfolio has performed and we see that the performance is according to our expectations given the very complicated circumstances ok so in that regard i think we have a good story to tell ok so i would like to ask the members of the audience to please put their hands up if they have any questions ok thank you ok thank you ok so we have a few questions ok so the 1st question is from mark mark you have a question ok mark go ahead ok so mark asks what is the current status of the portfolio ok so the current status of the portfolio is that we have made significant progress in implementing the investment strategy that we have developed ok we have made significant progress in terms of the diversification of the portfolio ok we have made significant progress in terms of the addition of new assets to the portfolio ok and we have made significant progress in terms of the management of the portfolio ok so i think we are in a good position at this point in time ok so the next question is from john john you have a question ok john go ahead ok so john asks what is the expected return on the portfolio ok so the expected return on the portfolio is currently estimated to be in the range of seven to nine per year ok we believe that this is a reasonable estimate based on the current market conditions and the investment strategy that we have developed ok so the next question is from jane jane you have a question ok jane go ahead ok so jane asks what is the risk level of the portfolio ok so the risk level of the portfolio is currently estimated to be moderate to high ok we believe that this is a reasonable estimate based on the current market conditions and the investment strategy that we have developed ok so the next question is from tom tom you have a question ok tom go ahead ok so tom asks what is the process for selecting new assets for the portfolio ok so the process for selecting new assets for the portfolio is that we have a rigorous process in place that involves a thorough analysis of potential assets including their financial performance risk profile and alignment with our investment strategy ok we also consider the i mean there is competition i mean there are some banks i mean a couple of banks have tried to come in and basically compete with those head to head in these type of situations but they have not been able to have the same type of problem that we that we sell to the market then we came out with another problem that is the depository free depository free basically has the particularity that has everything included in the rate you do not have any fees any commissions you do not have to pay for any ancillary costs or anything like that so that particular thing for people that i mean that they believe that we have a lot of things under the table and there were no complete clear this is completely transparent to the client and that hipaa is above nine that is the rate and and that is for a difficult the different type of client so we have a chinese menu for every type of different client that would like to access what we do and for example the hipaa fee goes to a different sector that is new to us and that is basically clients with a lower ticket and but there are some of these clients that are very good and they have had very good credit quality and that is why we decided to compete in that sector i do not know if this answered your question ernesto and please be a compliment to you sure rector regarding your 1st question ernesto you know as i previously mentioned i think that it depends on the you know how severe is the gdp contraction this year you know and how that impacts the capacity for clients to to pay back their loans we think that you know as mentioned if there is a you know like a u type recovery and you know gdp contracting somewhere around ten to twelve then we have made with the provisions of this water you know more than half of what we require and that could be you know sixty to 75 of what we require you know with information that we have right now ok so but it s going to be independent on how this evolves you know and obviously we re closely monitoring you know how our clients are are behaving ok now on your 2nd question regarding the exposure that we have to item mexican and so yeah obviously for confidentiality reasons we cannot disclose those those but we can reassure you that these two exposures that we have are not within our top ten exposures as eric mentioned we have already provisionally provided partially the exposure that we have with idamx that is close to 45 of the total exposure that we have that is not that material and i do not have with me the breakdown in terms of food and beverage the breakdown that we have that i have right now is more  the one that the cmbb uses more for regulatory purposes do not have that detail but for sure we can follow up with that hernandez now this is super helpful doctor and you are here thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from brian flores from city bank please go ahead hi good morning thank you for for the opportunity to ask a question so do you have any other questions you mentioned that based on your crm capabilities you saw a certain percentage of customers continue paying what was that percentage sorry you mentioned smd portfolio has a large degree of guarantees by having my question is could you elaborate on the collateral there and the low default for for this segment what are you expecting in terms of npl for for this segment thank you credit cards you know do not have a collateral you know so so laws given the faults in in credit cards is close to 100 you know you you basically do not recover that much you know in terms of a credit card you know and the you know we think that that is that is going to be one of the products most impacted you know when you look at a we think that mortgages are the ones that you do not pay you know you continue paying you know if there is any just one loan that you continue paying that does mortgages and probably credit cards are you know at the bottom of your priorities when you have trouble you know the npls that the the we we think that the banks have you know we think that the mortgages are the ones that clients have i think in credit cards you know have been increasing slightly but i think is you know relatively stable when you compare it you know historically so we do not we do not expect a significant deterioration you know but a no cost of risk you know but with the provisions that we are taking is close to eleven hello hello is this mister treviz is line this line has gone idle i will try to reconnect would we like to take the next question one question on the market related income i know you talk you know the big spike in the quarter but do do you think that goes back to normal already in in the 3rd quarter or do you think that could remain elevated elevated for some period of time to figure i know it is hard to predict but if you get some more color on on how did you think about market related income going forward and then if i can ask one follow up on the provisions yeah i understand given the scenario you see you kind of feel comfortable with where you are but yeah if we look at the cost of risk before this quarter it had been around two62seven you know barreling any changes in the scenario that you see right now is that two62seven what we should expect sort of going forward as well again barreling any significant changes in the current scenario yes i mean what i can tell you is yes we had had the wood run in in terms of market related i think the the banks will position to do so the important point is volatility and if volatility continues to be the way it is and then you can expect that we can we can basically have good numbers there i do not think we are going to have in the in the 3rd quarter numbers as good as they were in the in this quarter but i mean it all depends what happens in the next six months in the next few months in terms of the provisions and the cost of risk did you want to comment on that absolutely right on you know i think that the ones you take out the unusual provisions that we did this quarter i think cost of risk should be slightly higher than the numbers that we were having over the last five quarters but not to levels that we reported somewhere you know below the 300 basis points that that would be my my date and obviously as you mentioned you know with the information that we currently have ok thank you that is helpful thank you i have a question about credit risk but not to your corporates but to the rest of the financial system we already saw one company that has been liquidated has been put into liquidation by the national banking commission this is becoming a very long crisis with ten segments of the economy being unable to operate so eventually one would imagine that some institutions might get into trouble are you taking any special precautions in regard to any sector of the financial system and do you think we you will encounter much trouble or most of them will be able to go through this ok thank you thank you karl von simon i mean i mean in all these particular situations and depend how long the crisis is going to take i mean it s probably going to take down some financial players and in that sense we are yes we are being very cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what their needs are under their situation and we are going to basically continue to monitor that as the crisis continues to to evolve so in that sense we are very close to that particular sector we do not have i mean are we are not a big lender to the sector i mean i can tell you that if they are not in the as we have been saying or they are ten most important clients so in that sense we are not worried about the exposure that we have out to them but we are very concerned taking a look and monitoring them the more the time goes on hopefully the crisis is shorter and nobody else goes down but let us see what happens i think my well finance is a sector that we need to be very close monitoring we do not have to we do not have to allow big structures to them but that is a sector that could probably would be complicated as always in this type of situations the people that suffer the most are the ones that are around the are on the are on the base of the parliament so unfortunately that is the case and we are monitoring that very closely good morning thank you for taking my question my question is regarding liquidity i mean your liquidity ratio improved nicely in the quarter in part it was owed to the $1800000000 that each issuance in april but also given a very strong increase in funding with banks hi everyone my name is could you please provide some context on the nature of this funding source and what would be your strategy for liquidity in the coming quarters thank you very much the credit facility was one of the strongest numbers that we have reported since we became a listed company close to 92 so in my opinion that is the most proposed and fundamental way of looking at it then as you rightly mentioned the debt issuance has contributed significantly to the increase of our liquidity coverage and we are monitoring you know any potential use of the committed lines of credit that we have with our clients that if you look at it it is probably the one let us say risk that could materialize in in the short term we have ample liquidity to honor but you know every single committed line of credit that the that we have but that that is the one risk that could materialize the most relevant driver in terms of consumption of liquidity the other types of you know events that could impact our liquidity you know are you know are more gradual you know and those could be you know but contraction in deposits that we are not seeing in that  and i think that the bank has managed quite productively you know liquidity to be prepared for you know any potential really worst case scenario further down the road thank you and regarding the line of indoor balance sheet the line of bank and other loans which increased 81 quite a bit required do you do you think this line will remain at close to those levels or do you think you could substitute this sort of source of funding with probably other issues in the coming quarters what is your study there you know we we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the the specific  you know tenure costs you know we end up  you know withdrawing or or taking advantage of the the different funding sources so you know i would say that not only that particular line item but every single line item is reviewed you know and under current market circumstances we you know it is our obligation to look at better ways of you know not only funding the bank but keeping the structures in place so that the bank you know can continue supporting you know long term growth so that is something that we continue to monitor along so so yes you know it could be that we keep it at those levels or that we reduce it if there is an opportunity to find you know a more effective funding source thank you x and i have a question regarding the increase on npi ratio it was at 35 basis points over a quarter and i understood that some peers they had higher charge offs and that may explain a little bit of the difference but even on the players where the charge offs was not as high we kind of saw a more flagging npi behavior because of the special accounting and because of the program releases so what drove the deterioration part for for you and my 2nd question is regarding the special accounting criteria when we look to those numbers the the balance of nplo they are much higher than than the ones the old account versus the current special accounting and i would like to understand the difference here if you like  very negative look would be to see you know like those numbers materialized as losses so if you can explain for me the differences on the special accounting versus the old accounting hi in terms of the npl ratio you know these this quarter what drove the decline the slight decline in the deterioration was basically a credit card that went up from fourfourteen to four82 and ncms basically from two61 to three37 as as we discussed during the quarter during the call you know the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not enroll in the support programs so what they were seeing you know this slide determination has to do more with what is happening with the the portfolio the clients that did not did not involve in the program and it is not a significant deterioration or review given you know the the you know what is going on in the economy is just a you know slight deterioration now on your 2nd question could you elaborate on that you know i i do not know exactly what you are comparing you know the special accounting criteria to the other accounting criteria so the the present accounting before the cndv regulation for for covid you have like a table on your release comparing the special accounting criteria versus the former i think like b six accounting criteria and when we look to the balance of nonperforming loans i believe the balance you have today is something around like 18000000000 pesos and 99000000000 pesos that implies that the true five in the ratio but if you look to the old accounting criteria the the b six accounting i think the balance of npls are closer to 4044000000000 pesos so the npl ratio would be much higher i understand that maybe a lot of loans that do not really become npls they are there but my concern is that as soon as these accounts become restructured go goes back to normal if we could see or know like a higher need of provisions working on npls so that is why i ask the difference between npls and non npls if it makes sense and also to expect some recovery on that no i think that that the you know it is fairly dependent on the level or or the type of assumptions that we make because the existing accounting criteria is very stringent in terms of let us say past due percentage of you know how much the client has paid back so in my opinion it is somehow extreme but comparison okay so it has to do with you know with the special accounting criteria you basically allow clients not to pay a you know or every client that is not paying their interest and capital it stays a current account you know and under the old or prevailing accounting criteria you know you have to take into account just the you know when when you are ninety days past due and depending on if you are but you know let us say a corporate client you know depending on how much you have already paid back whether you are twenty or or more or how you know the time that has elapsed you know it is very i would say the critical i would say that the assumptions are critical and i think that the probably what it is what is important is to understand that in the following two quarters we will get to know the hard data you know we rather than you know comparing those numbers with the big assumption i think that as soon as clients start paying back or not we will get to know you know how you know the magnitude of the impact okay rather than just making you know some assumptions that you know could materialize or not as mentioned during the call i think that we have made we have made a good assessment in terms of the risk that each client has you know the relationship that we have with them we have also asked them you know you know how they are doing and whether they have the capacity to pay back so taking all that into account that is how we we come up with these provisions associated with the spectrum losses that we assume so i would i would encourage you judy just to to wait a couple of quarters and with the with the hard data you know just analyze you know if we be the you know on one hand the benefit of these temporary measures the banking commission provided it and on the other hand you know the true impact that it has had in our asset quality so you mentioned that nineteen of the of the loan portfolio has been subject to some kind of debt relief measures payment holidays even grace periods have these measures ended already for any client and if so if you can tell us what is the percentage of these clients that have resumed payments already since it been already four months since the full outbreak of the pandemic and if this has not been the case the payment holiday has not ended for for any significant amount of clients if you can tell when you made this provision charge of the 3900000000 pesos in this quarter did you incorporate any assumptions in terms of what would be the percentage of these nineteen of these clients under the disaster relief program we will pay you back once the payment holiday ends thank you you know 1st the payment holiday period ends tomorrow so we will start the you know seeing whether clients pay back or not starting next week so we do not have that information yet now regarding you know how we made provisions for this quarter and as mentioned throughout the call you know we classify the clients depending on the risk that they have the exposure that they have with us the relationship that they have with us so we classify the you know retail clients in 25 clusters and smes in eleven clusters so depending on the level of a cluster that each client falls into we assign them to a risk category so yes there is but it depends you know there are 36 responses in terms of you know whether we pick a high risk or high exposure category you know for clients and we assume certain probability of those clusters either paying back their loans or not ok so that is how we came up with with the provision that we we made this water we have a low number of clients to pay back their loans you know it is because of this analysis that we have done that we feel relatively confident that with the information that we have what we have provided is a good provision for as equal deterioration for the rest of the year ok thank you very much for taking my question it is just one i just wanted to understand the dynamics of the credit relief program held by the bank and the hike on npls to twofive according to my calculation the 1st loans to reach almost fifteen of total loans if i am not wrong are roughly at a similar level to the other banks but different from other players and even considered it is a brazilian and chilean subsidiaries that have also fostered their credit loss problem npls decrease in the 2nd quarter you mentioned that this deterioration is estimated from the ame in the credit card segment so i just wanted to understand if this hike in npls behaved worse than expected by the bank considering the amount of loans that were owned and what does the bank see for this semester in terms of fall in case of regulators extend the schedule and change the rules forward so thank you very much no i think that you know the 1st of all you know the mpls that the increase that we see in the 2nd quarter are associated with those clients that do not enter into the relief program okay so it has to do with that 81 of clients that decided not to enter into into the program and obviously those clients are also exposed to the the diteration of the economic activity you know theector mentioned you know the the losses that the you know the and employee losses that we have seen so it has to do more with that ok with the let us say with the clients that do not enroll in the program ok whether we were expecting you know that type of declaration you know i think that if someone tells you that they were envisioning this type of economic declaration i think that they are lying you know i think that we we were not expecting this type of contraction you know the magnitude that we are seeing you know if you look at how every single analyst updates is forecast for the big mexican economy every week you get to see the downward adjustments so so i think that it do not surprise us you know but we mentioned that given this this deterioration of economic activity we think it is just a slight deterioration okay but as mentioned we will get to see the final impact or the final impact of the economic activity following the next two to three quarters you know it is not only you know what happens the rest of the year i think that this the impact of the pandemic at least for mexico has the possibility of you know going further than just 2020 hi everyone my my questions were already answered thank you very much there are no further questions in the queue and i now like to turn the floor back over to mister edgar chavez for any closing remarks thank you operator and thanks everyone once again for joining san antonio mexico on this call as always

and other uncertainties could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements which may be made during the call it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to tom stanton chief executive officer of adtran sir please go ahead thank you ian good morning everyone we appreciate you joining us for our 3rd quarter 2020 conference call with me today is adtran cfo mike foliano following my opening remarks mike will review the quarterly financial performance in detail and then we will take any questions that you may have i would like to begin by expressing our concerns and sympathy for those affected by the ongoing global pandemic that has touched our employees customers partners and suppliers the current times have changed the way we communicate work and learn and i remain encouraged by our perseverance in the face of such adversity with these challenges it is more critical than ever to connect people communities and businesses with each other the results for our 3rd quarter demonstrated solid execution against our plan this included broad based demand across our customer segments regional and emergency service providers leading the way we are also making great progress with tier one fiber access projects that we are now serving this year and continue to have very strong momentum on mew customer acquisition across a broad base of market segments from a top line perspective revenue for the quarter was 133100000 with 44three gross margins network solutions accounted for 87 of the revenue and 115two while global services contributed 17900000 during the quarter we had one ten service provider customer and one ten distribution partner along with strong contributions from both our direct and distribution channel partners that serve the regional broadband service provider market we added 38 new service provider customers during the quarter bringing the totals to 99 for the 1st three quarters of 2020 we had new customers ranked from global tier one operators to electric co ops cooperatives municipalities cable mso and regional broadband providers the new customer traction remains positive reinforcing our belief that we are in the early stages of a generational communications infrastructure network upgrade cycle driven by a confluence of favorable government regulatory technology and competitive factors the strength we saw during the quarter was fueled by our continued momentum with regional broadband operators who were at sixty year over year and 33 quarter over quarter we were also helped really solid performance by our us tier two customers who are up eighteen year over year as they start to emerge from restructuring and they are again investing in their network expansion in europe our revenue from emerging alt net providers is up 76 year over year and twenty quarter over quarter and highlighting our growth in that region for the 3rd quarter our fiber access and aggregation business grew 34 over the previous period and increased sixty to six on a year over year basis this continues to be our top sales category within fiber access our pon olt revenue grew 31 quarter over quarter and a strong 77 year over year which we believe is significantly outpacing the growth in the general market and will continue to step up on market share position in this key segment we also saw strong revenue contribution from our us regional broadband service providers growing 37 over the previous period and 58 over the previous year so broad based growth above across both direct and distribution channels from a supply chain perspective lead times remained extended on some key components and vendors but our operations team took several proactive steps to mitigate logistics and component availability challenges to meet our customers needs in our efforts to address these needs we have increased our inventory levels and incurred increased freight costs due to decreased capacity associated with higher transportation rates and expedite fees from an organizational perspective the structural changes that we have implemented over the last twelve months continue to improve our operational efficiency the company has achieved material reductions in operating expenses through controlled and expense management and we are ahead of our plan for the target operating model moving forward on the product side we are focusing on growing our wallet share with our service provider customers in addition to selling fiber access olts we are growing all those an essential gateway business residential gateway revenue grew 22 quarter over quarter and a strong 64 year over year as we increased the number of olt customers also buying our rgs by seventeen year to date in addition to rg attach rates we have also focused on increasing attach rates for mosaic software subscription services as we migrate customers to our mosaic suite in our upcoming mosaic one virtual control center on october 29th the fcc began its 904 auctions for 16000000000 of rdof broadband subsidies there are 386 qualified bidders that represent over 700 operators whereas the connect america fund was targeted to the large proce price cap carriers providing a 1st right of refusal the rdos subsidies provide an opportunity for rural local exchange carriers and community broadband providers such as rural electric co ops to receive ten years of funding we expect to see rdof funding to begin to positively impact our revenues beginning in the mid 2021 time frame in europe and around the world the strategic components of five g and fiber broadband infrastructures causing governments to carefully reconsider the security risks of their networks and implementation policies and are implementing policies to ban high risk vendors from participating in these network builds as a result adtran stands out as a safe technically advanced alternative to those high risk vendors as national operators look to limit cap or replace high risk vendors in their network 2020 here brought forth a number of challenges that none of us could have envisioned how we have ri risen to these challenges and are emerging as an even stronger and more resilient company we have achieved much this far in 2020 with the material benefits just beginning to bear fruit and as we start to begin more to be more fully recognized next year we have much to be excited about including the growing number of new customers selecting our products and services to build that or upgrade to networks with rapid adoption of our mosaic platform and subscription services and our sdx solutions as tier one operators begin their transition to the network of the future and the promise of rdof rewards and begin and being able to help regional service providers utilities and municipalities provide gigabit services to the communities that they serve i am proud of our company and our employees for the suc success we have seen thus far this year we look forward to a strong finish to 2020 and have a bri bright outlook as we look ahead into 2021 michael will now provide an overview of financials and following his remarks i will any questions that you may have thank you tom and good morning to all i will review our 3rd quarterly and provide our view for the 4th quarter of 2020 during my report i will be referencing both

are published in a supplemental financial schedule that appears on our investor relations web page at www adtran com for non gaap measures discussed on this call that are presented in the earnings release reconciliations are contained within the release the supplemental financial schedules on our webpage also present certain revenue information by segment and category and other non gaap reconciliations which i will be discussing today as tom said adtran is 3rd quarter revenue came in at $133100000 compared to $128700000 in the prior quarter and $114100000 for the 3rd quarter of 2019 breaking this down across our operating segments our network solutions revenue for the 3rd quarter was $115200000 versus $111300000 reported for q two of 2020 and $94000000 in q three of 2019 our services and support revenue in q three of this year was $17900000 compared to $17400000 reported in the 2nd quarter of 2020 and $20100000 for the 3rd quarter of 2019 across our revenue categories access and aggregation revenue for quarter three of 2020 was $85400000 compared to $82800000 in the prior quarter and $65100000 in quarter three of 2019 revenue for our subscriber solutions and experience category was $43100000 for the quarter versus $40400000 in quarter two of 2020 and 42500000 in quarter three of 2019 traditional and other products revenue for the quarter was $4600000 compared to $5500000 for quarter two of 2020 and $6500000 for quarter three of 2019 looking at our revenues geographically domestic revenue for q three 2020 was $92800000 versus $84500000 reported in quarter two of 2020 and $83100000 in quarter three of 2019 our international revenue for the quarter was $40300000 compared to $44300000 for quarter two of 2020 and $30900000 in quarter three of 2019 for the 3rd quarter we had two ten of revenue customers both of these were domestic customers our gaap gross margins for the 3rd quarter of this year was 44three as compared 41five last quarter and fortysix in the 3rd quarter of 2019 non gaap gross margin for quarter three was 44five as compared to 41six in the prior quarter and 41 in the 3rd quarter of 2019 the quarter over quarter increase in both gaap and non gaap gross margins were driven by increases in volume as well as favorable product and services mix and lower freight related charges in the current quarter the increases in both gaap and non gaap gross margins on a year over year basis were driven by increases in volume as well as product mix which were partially offset by higher freight related charges and expedite premiums tele operating expenses on a gaap basis were $54400000 for quarter three of 2020 compared to $59500000 reported in the prior quarter and $62700000 for quarter three of 2019 the quarter over quarter decrease was primarily related to market driven decreases in our deferred compensation expense as well as expense reductions in both r d and sgna as a result of our restructuring program initiated in 2019 and reduced travel expenses offset by increases in some restructuring related costs the year over year decreases in operating expenses were a result of lower expenses in both r d and sgna and lower travel related expenses partially offset by market driven increases in our deferred compensation expense and an increase in contract services cost on a non gaap basis our 3rd quarter operating expenses were $49400000 compared to $52300000 in the prior quarter and $59400000 in quarter three of 2019 both the non gaap quarter of a quarter and year over year decreases in operating expense were primarily driven as a result of our expense reduction efforts and lower travel related expenses operating income on a gaap basis for the 3rd quarter of 2020 was $4500000 compared to an operating loss of 6000000 in the prior quarter and an operating loss of 20300000 reported in q three of 2019 non gaap operating income for quarter three of 2020 was $9900000 compared to an operating income of $1300000 on q two of 2020 and an operating loss of $12600000 in quarter three of 2019 the quarter over quarter and year over year gaap and non gaap profitability was driven by higher sales with favorable gross margin mix and reduced operating expenses other income on a gaap basis for the 3rd quarter of 2020 was $1500000 compared to other income of $8400000 in the prior quarter and other income of $1900000 in quarter three of 2019 on non gaap other income for the quarter was $900000 compared to other income of $5700000 in q two 2020 and other income of $2700000 for quarter three of 2019 the decreases in both gaap and non gaap other income as compared to quarter over quarter were primarily market driven caused by changes in the valuation of our investment portfolio the decrease in gaap and non gaap other income on a year over year basis was primarily driven by realized foreign exchange losses offset by market driven upsides in the valuation of our investment portfolio the company is tax provision for the 3rd quarter of 2020 was $600000 of expense as compared to an expense of $1600000 in the prior quarter and an expense of $27700000 in the 3rd quarter of 2019 the current quarter tax expense was primarily due to profitability in our international operations as the deferred tax benefits generated by our domestic operations continue to be offset by changes in our valuation allowance the tax expense in the 3rd quarter of last year was the result of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets gaap net income for quarter three of 2020 was $5500000 compared to a net income of $800000 in the prior quarter and a net loss of $46100000 in the 3rd quarter of 2019 non gaap net income for the 3rd quarter of 2020 was $7900000 as compared to an income of $1600000 in the prior quarter and a loss of $2800000 in quarter three of 2019 earnings per share assuming dilution on a gaap basis was ¢eleven per share as compared to two per ¢two per share last quarter and a loss of ¢96 per share in the 3rd quarter of 2019 non gaap earnings per share assuming dilution for the 3rd quarter was ¢sixteen compared to an income of ¢four per share in the prior quarter and a loss of ¢six per share in quarter three of 2019 turning to the balance sheets unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaled $132200000 by quarter end after paying $4300000 in dividends during the quarter for the quarter we used $7000000 of cash from operations net trade accounts receivable was $1200000 at quarter end resulting in a dso of 69 days compared to 67 days in the prior quarter and 73 days at the end of the 3rd quarter 2019 the variability in dsos quarter over quarter and year over year is mainly attributable to the timing of shipments during the quarter and customer mix net inventories ended the quarter at $120300000 compared to $106100000 in q two of 2020 and $104900000 at the end of q three 2019 the increase in our inventories for the quarter that just ended was in preparation for new product ramp ups and strategic inventory buffer purchases made to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity in the current environment looking ahead to the next quarter the possible effects of the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic the ability of components supplies to align with our customer demand the book and ship nature of our business the timing of the revenue associated with large projects the variability of order patterns into the customer base in which we sell as well as the fluctuation and currency exchange rates in our international markets may cause material differences between our expectations and the actual results we expect that our 4th quarter 2020 revenue will be in the range of $122000000 to $132000000 after considering the projected sales mix we expect that our 4th quarter gross margin on a non gaap basis will be in the range of 41 to 42 we also expect non gaap operating expenses for the 4th quarter of 2020 will be between $fifty and $51000000 and finally we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the 4th quarter of 2020 on a non gaap basis will be a benefit at a mid single digit percentage rate resulting from the expected mix of domestic and international income in the quarter we believe that the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2020 will be component availability a macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises ongoing effects of the covid nineteen pandemic the variability of mix and revenue associated with project roll outs the proportion of international real revenue relative to our total revenue professional services activity levels in both domestic and international markets the adoption rate of our broadband access platforms potential changes in tax laws currency exchange rate movements and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels once again additional financial information is available at adtran is investor relations webpage at www adtran com now i will turn the call back over to tom great thank you mike ian at this point we are ready to open up any questions people may have this time if you would like to ask a question over the phone lines please press star then one on your telephone keypad we will pause for a moment to compile the q a roster your 1st question comes from line of rich valera of needham company your line is open thank you good morning tom you mentioned that you it sounded like you mentioned you got a new tier one in q three when you talked about your new customer just wanted to clarify is that the case and if there if it is can you say anything about that that win i i did actually say that in my notes but in reality we did announce it a new tier one at the end of september which was for fiber extension and we did pick up another tier one customer within the quarter where they expanded their programs with us to include a different variation on the technology that we had been previously ordered so there has been but i did not mention in any of my notes got it that is helpful and then added you also mentioned that you would made good progress with your previously announced tier ones and i guess you know those would include among others dt openreach maybe and the you know the unnamed us tier one is there any updates you can give us on those in terms of progress and or you know revenue expectations initial revenue expectations yeah so one of those is a brand new customer for us as you are aware and all three of them are going well all three of them are at different stages of lab work we actually have received some pos from the new customer but that is associated with you know initial say initial lab work and you know just kind of some of the software work that we are doing for them so we actually so that actually built in and shipped in the quarter but all three of them are going well so when we expect material revenue contributions from them to really start in the 1st half towards the tail end of the 1st half of next year got it and then question on rdof you have talked about it being kind of a mid 21 revenue opportunity i think some of your competitors have i am guessing maybe it is more of a 2022 a any further clarification on on your thoughts on timing is that sort of a three q 21 or four q any any thoughts on that yeah yeah and i guess i guess here again this is the dif you know when does it it is one of those things that is going to start it will start slower you know you have so many participants some of them have plans completely worked out some of them do not have plans sure at all have just been focusing on the bidding process so i think you will start seeing it in the around the half and then you will start seeing it ramp up from there kind of that is at least one more mike modeling question on opex levels if if we are looking into next year and i know you do not give guidance out there but if we are trying to think about what an opex number looks like with kind of a normalized t e level any any thoughts on how much that maybe adds back into this model as as t e gets back to you know some kind of normalized level we expect you know we have had a plan to get to about where we are right now and we expect that we are going to hold that into next year so i i would not try to model any increases i think like a lot of companies everybody is rethinking the whole t e going forward so i think i think your model going into next year should look a lot like what we are seeing at the end of this year very good thank you for that mike i will see the floor thank you your next question comes from rod hall of goldman sachs your line is open hi this is just to start off could you could you give us some color on what you are seeing in terms of broadband demand and actually here in the us and maybe take a handicap side across the tier one to the you know so how you are thinking about the sustainability of the momentum the 1st of all a lot of activity and i tal i i touched on the growth rates in the tier three space a lot of activity in the tier 3s which is you know just separate from what is going on with rdof so a lot of network upgrades we rolled out our combo card which is you know the ten gig solution a good pickup on the combo card and so just a lot of activity and and i think a lot of it has got to do with just end user demand you know based off the environment that we are in people understanding the r you know importance of the connectivity same thing in the tier 2s i think the tier 2s finally gained past whatever financial issues they may have had and some of them have started executing one of them explicitly started executing on expansion plans and i do not see that stopping and i think the other one actually is kind of opened up and getting better and that includes not just those but some of the msos as well so i i i do not see a near term end in fact i see people planning farther out than and kind of figuring out how they are going to readjust to you know what may be a different work environment in a lot of areas than what they had going into this pandemic and i do not think it is all pandemic driven either i mean the the activity that is going on in the tier 2s has been part of their stated plan it just got put off the tier 3s have been heating up for some period of time even prior to that and we had solid growth in that space last year as well and then the tier one you know we really in the us we are in the cable mso space and we are with a with large carriers and with one of those large carriers here in the telco space in relation to pon and i would say the activity there is i would say we have seen good activity i would not call it mid you know earth shattering i would say it is solid and there is more a lot of that work is really trying to figure out what they are going to do into next year so i think a lot of that is just i think it will pick up there we will probably be a year you know this time next year maybe a little bit earlier than that does that answer your question it it does it does thanks a lot and just for a quick followup on the gross margin i know you mentioned about that volumes and product mix maybe could you expand on it so we could make like what you are talking about what what so it is product mix i mean at the end of the day it is we are selling without getting too deep into it we we are selling pon you know one of the things if you step back and look at what our business has done we have really made the transition from copper to fiber and some of the fiber components that we are selling specifically when you are talking about llps and stuff just have a richer mix we also have based off of international and domestic revenue mix we have a you know a materials difference in those gross margin profiles those are probably the two biggest things that that were driving gross margin difference makes sense thank you okay your next question comes form the line of paul silverstein of cowen your line is open tom just a clarification 1st before my question so the response of the previous question zero obviously or i trust non us is lower margin than the us as a general proposition but on the product piece of the revenue i apologize if you just said this the margin differential it it is more favorable for your fiber based or less favorable is that is that the distinction you are making in terms of the product mix influencing the gross margin profile and and what is the key difference there on the product side yeah i i would say on the i i would say what is happening in the fiber space is we are selling the mix towards llps is much higher got it exactly sorry got it so that that is the key driver in the product mix that is probably you know i do not have them listed that is that is that is definitely in the top three all right we might we have a very strong relationship my i apologize go ahead mike of course i ask you every quarter in terms of longterm market profile you obviously just had a very good market quarter driven by both volume and the shift to llps your guiding back to your traditional guidance in the low 40s for the december quarter has there been any change in review about what return are you still looking at low 40s gross margin profile longer term low with the benefit of volume with shift to llps can that be better than that and i have got one followup question yeah i think i was i would say low to mid so somewhere right in in that range and you you see variability here and remember in q one we were pretty hot so it jumps around a lot so i try to project this by looking at what we see but we are book and ship business and what comes in during a quarter is a little bit hard to to test but i believe that that 41 42 guidance is probably what the mix will turn out to be for the quarter i think the variability also like the thing to to maybe think about paul and you know we do not have you know we do not know exactly what two or 3s will do next year if two or 3s are strong that typically helps us because not just the the nature of what they buy but also the software components associated with that so that tends to drive more strength the thing that we are trying to factor in at this point in not changing the longer term guidance is there is a si real potential for material international revenue up ticking next year and whether or not the tier 3s here in the us are going to keep pace with that is is kind of the thing that you know we just have to look and see but there is no doubt that the pressure some of the pressure has been alleviated in places like europe because of the the stance on on you know on some of the vendors there but you know there is still a hangover effect on all of that and the stronger that that that business is you will tend to see a weakness in the gross margin so tom from the statement you just made it sounds like you made good progress in tier three what percentage of total revenue are tier three today we manu we really do not break that out i tell you it is very you know it is material it is over i think now it is over $50000000 but we do not break that up one quick final question if i may i i know it is hard predicting the future but the sooner you get the revenues you are expecting from these new tier one wins how like do you all have any visibility as to what the margin profile is in total not asking for any specific customer but on the tier ones would that be consistent with current market structure would it be or would it be accreted any sense it would so i am going to talk to you about the international gross margins it would probably be a little accretive to international gross margins but it would be diluted to total corporate gross margins all right i appreciate it i will pass it on thank you all right and that is the mix i am talking about you know how much does that pile in that gets better over time how much is that pile in versus where it what is going on with the us market in tier three thank you again all right your next question comes from line of bill gazelo of tyson capital your line your line is open thank you a couple of different questions 1st of all the the two tier ones the one that you want and the one that with a new program that you specifically called out would you talk about the ramp and the timing for material revenues and is that different than your comment about wait in the 1st half of next year that you made it through a bigger comment and then 2nd question is is can you talk through just the european country shutdowns that are happening once again here in the last few days and what implications if any that has for you sure my let me start with the 1st one of course and it is the the 1st half ramp that i was talking about was really around the previous sdx awards the three customers that we talked about and and really i am talking about in totality there is some different dates on all of those but we will start seeing as a combination we will start seeing material revenue round the half of next year as far as the new ones one of them be fairly quick but it is this it is a as far as seeing any revenue i think it is i i do not have a good sense of timing as to when that picks up at this point i think that they want to get started and i have some very targeted areas and then i kind of want to see how it how it works the other one is very specific and mike i do not recall the date on that i think it is 3rd quarter of next year yes right and that one is big it is a well known customer to us they have very specific plans with very specific revenue targets associated with it the current data is 3rd quarter of next year i will tell you that these things tend to slip a little bit besides that here i was talking about before was really the fiber piece as far as to shut down that concern other than yeah it it it really has not you know we have been operating in a relatively shut down environment anyways from the end user demand really no difference and we have not seen any near term changes in in in the way that they are operating where it really affects us is when you are trying to meet with customers and and really you know with the lab activity we have going on around the world right now it tends to impact that so far we have been able to maneuver around that i am not aware of any material delay because of the the quarantine situation that we are in and i i do not expect it i think especially our bigger customers even our smaller customer now i think about going on in europe have kind of developed an environment where we can talk to their counterparts in the lab work through issues in many cases get into the systems themselves remotely and operate the way we need to operate so i am not every once in a while you hear about a week delay here or there and but that is that is not that frequent and the deployment is not impacted by stay at home orders zero yeah yeah no change in that and and even in you know europe what we were seeing is as far as infrastructure in especially with the new awards we are talking about really material infrastructure builds to begin with because we are really talking about building out a footprint either replacing existing infrastructure that they have or expanding footprints in many cases there is been no change in those plans all right thank you and if i may throw in one more question latin america what what are you seeing with your important customers down there so there e in the caribbean we are actually doing well we have some strong i do not i do not want to overplay it at this point we have some activity going on in places like brazil where they are also of course honestly you know you know the spx maybe you know the spx is kind of the architecture people i go to and so there are large carriers there is not a large carrier that is not looking at a migration towards xgs ten gig and if you are going to do that you are going to do that with a virtualized system like the sdx so there is activity going on there those tend to be longer term we do have one traditional customer down there there are still ongoing negotiations with that customer but there is not material change at this point right thank you for the time okay your next question comes from line of vahadner jar of mkm partners your line is open hello sorry i was on mute i apologize if you have already addressed this but are you seeing any significant pull in of orders from your customers no no we we did at the beginning of the pandemic so if you think about kind of the end of q one we saw a material increase in order activity i think at this point in time i i would say that the order rate is reflecting what their demand is i do not see any real you we do on particular parts i i have talked a little bit about you know the fact that we are still having some supply issues most predominantly with silicon but and in those cases we may really try to nail down a forecast with them and try to get them to reach farther out but that that that is really not the norm okay that is helpful it is it is i look forward to next year with all these tier ones how should we be thinking about your customer concentration is is most of the most of them come from that is a really good question yeah so we are adding tier one customers as well so the good news is that there will be more tier ones to kind of spread the the fluctuations around within but having said that we are also adding more tier ones so you know you have got the that issue we are adding tier 3s and i and i use tier three i am really talking about alternate tiers of all different types we are having municipalities on a very fast clip i mean we usually have an internal announcement here or something that goes out and we have like we collect them here and there is always a municipality that is being added and we are adding tier three the traditional tier three tiers at a very quick clip i think i mentioned before it is thirty something odd customers a large percentage of those were these alternate type carriers so so if from that perspective and by the way i mentioned our our we had a distribution partner who was actually a top a ten customer that is not typical i do believe that that will be typical going forward because i do believe and and those are all being sold those are one of our conduits to that alternate carrier that municipal space tier three space so and and and utilities so that base is growing now when we get into this time next year it will still be kind of early in the cycle some of these wins but we get into this time next year it is really how are those tier ones comparing to the growth rate within the tier three that i have no doubt will be more diverse but we are adding tier ones that are you know at a nice clip as well so but we will have more customers which will help in that diversity and then one other thing i just want to add i i mentioned before the attach rates on our cpet and our rgs and some of our new wifi solutions is really going well which will help add in that that product diversity as well it is something we are focused on that is really helpful thanks for the color on that you know i think one last question for me is more topical the big picture view i think at t recently announced that they are going to stop selling that copper based dsl service it it seems like the executive shift towards fiber is ongoing and they should you know the probably the tier ones around the world just migrating towards fiber right can you talk a little bit about your competitors positioning in maybe like in in the fiber does it seem like a copper that you enjoyed previously or is it actually better i would love to talk about that i would love to talk about that you know one of the hangovers that we had gone to when we have had a couple of program really one big program that kind of that was copper based that that died and then which which caused us an issue but really it it was the longevity of the copper and the associated with that copper versus the fiber and i think this is the 1st quarter and i am i am getting ahead of where you are really seeing fiber eclipse copper within our revenue and so to us that is a big milestone and it really because there is a lot of work to make that happen so i am i am happy with the the shift within the company and if you look at the r d spend r d spend is predominantly fiber based and has been for some time so i am glad to be able to see the revenue kind of mimic what it is that we have been doing internally here competitively right now we are in a very good position we have we have launched new flexibility and new capabilities in there our total access 5000 platform product which has been in the market for a long period of time we have upgraded the switching capability and we are the only well i should not say we are the only one i have heard other people are working on one but we are shipping combo combo card which is the xts ten gig and two and you know standard twofive gig within the same card profile which is unique in that customer base and getting a lot of traction because people do not want to have to go out and replace infrastructure they do not have to when i talk about the sdx there is just nothing else out there it is completely desegregated it is the next generation system that people have been talking about for five or six years that is actually now out in the market we have actually shipped it to paying customers it is what has been selected by pretty much every tier one that we have won in relation to pon and we think it is there is nothing else that will touch it right now there are people that kind of try are are reacting to it but we think we have a good headway in the r d that we have put into it that is good appreciate it thank you okay thank you your next question from line of ken cevo of northland capital management your line is open good morning you answered a lot of my questions on that last one there but i will say that actually nokia made the same comment this quarter with regard to i i can believe it that is yeah regarding fiber eclipsing and copper in their access statement so that would seem to be well what comment were you talking about i was talking about the sdx i was talking about what i thought they were doing zero talking about their dis aggregated solution zero okay i see a little competitive intensity there yeah but those successes and industry wide you know trend toward copper going on and so thanks for clarifying that fiber was larger this quarter i want to follow back up on the tier three comment that that 50000000 that is a quarterly number that you gave for the size of the tier three okay so well you know that is interesting and i i said larger than fifty like i said we do not i hear you obvi okay yeah and that that would make it you know your your largest segment if you look at kind of international us tier three tier two and tier one you know by some distance actually and you are obviously seeing good growth there and you had a lot of impressive growth numbers in various segments most of which would seem to imply something on the order of kind of a i do not know thirty year over year decline among us tier ones or you know other parts of the business that are domestic based and you know i am guessing that may be a function of the you know the copper programs that you reference but you know is is that about right and what what does it take to kind of you know will will it take the the new deal coming in to kind of stabilize and make that grow or or how are you looking at that part of your business yeah so i do not think it is tier ones i think that i think it is i think in tier 2s and tier 3s on the year over year basis we have done good i think the issue that we had last year was predominantly on a cop basis was predominantly telmex and so we have a large copper based program going on with them that was 10s of 1000000s a quarter and it just completely stopped so the the hole that you are talking about in the north american market is telmex not it is not the us carrier base and that was very much a copper based vectored vso solution that they are rolling out i think i just answered your question is that yeah in part and last one for me is you know as you think about your potential international growth next year you know ob obviously should the tier 3s continue to grow you know sixty maybe they could keep up with that rate of growth i assume for planning purposes you know you model some slowing in that tier three growth rate despite you know our off ramping up in some other positive drivers just just to begin with and you know can we assume that you know from an international standpoint you know you expect international revenues to grow faster than domestic next year good good that is a really good question that i i do not have an answer for you today so it it it for that the thing about the tier 3s is not just a a let me just say off carriers because it is broader than traditional tier three carriers but the thing about these these carriers is the growth rate through the year has been increasing and i i do not see a change in next year so you know you are going to have two quarters of growth before these you know the the really that one mammoth tier one in in europe that is going to start that is going to be all of the mental and we are about to eclipse it now there are there are other activities going on there is a process going on in australia carriers like orange who we announced an award with vodafone all of these telefonica which is of course not just in europe but in brazil all of those have got processes that are in place or are where they are coming towards a decision but those will carry those are really if you think they do not get awarded until next year they are a year away from that so the real mammoth meeting for mental piece was a new customer force that that is deploying the sdx next year and it it will just be starting around the half so i could absolutely envision next year where the tier 3s actually eclipse it on a pure growth knowledge basis but i but i do not know that i do not know that for a fact you know we will have to get into the year and really see rdof will start around the turn of the 2nd half but if you know really for it to be material that is going to take some time so you know that will just be i i do not see that as this huge kind of wave of things coming in the 2nd half of next year i think it just starts and starts to ramp up from there thanks i appreciate all that color these alt carriers yeah these alt carriers are are you know if they keep the momentum they have right now then you know they are us could be stronger okay so thank you very much for joining us today i appreciate your interest and look forward to the call on our next quarter this

executive officer of vatera healthcare please go ahead tom good morning everyone we appreciate you joining us for our 3rd quarter 2020 conference call with me today is adtran cfo mike foltynowicz following my opening remarks mike will review the quarter is financial performance in detail and then we will take any questions that you may have i would like to begin by expressing our concerns and sympathy for those affected by the ongoing global pandemic that has touched our employees customers partners and suppliers the current times have changed the way we communicate and work i remain encouraged by our perseverance and the faith of such adversity with these challenges it is more critical than ever to connect people communities and businesses with each other the results for our 3rd quarter demonstrated solid execution against our plan this included broad based demand across our customer segments with regional and emergency service providers leading the way we were also making great progress with tier one fiber access project during the quarter we had 110 service provider customer and 110 distribution partner along with strong contributions from both our direct and distribution channel partners that serve the regional broadband service provider market we added 38 new service provider customers during the quarter bringing the total to 99 for the 1st three quarters of 2020 these new customers range from global tier one operators to electric cooperatives municipalities cable mso and regional broadband providers the new customer traction remains positive reinforcing my belief that we are well positioned to continue to grow our business the strength we saw during the quarter was fueled by our continued momentum with regional broadband operators who were up sixty year over year and 33 quarter over quarter we were also helped with a solid performance for our us tier two customers who were up eighteen year over year as they started to emerge from restructuring and are again investing in their network expansion in europe our revenue from emerging alternate providers is up 76 year over year and twenty quarter over quarter highlighting our growth in that region for the 3rd quarter our fiber access and aggregation business grew 34 over the previous period and increased sixty to sixty on a year over year basis we are pleased to report that our top sales category within fiberx our panalot revenue grew 31 quarter over quarter and a strong 77 year over year which we believe is significantly out pacing the growth in the general market and will continue to step up our market share position in this key segment we also saw strong revenue contribution from our us regional broadband service providers growing 37 over the previous period and 58 over the previous year with broad based growth across both direct and distribution channels from a supply chain perspective lead times remained extended on some key components and vendors but our operations team took several proactive steps to mitigate logistics and component availability challenges to meet our customers needs in our efforts to address these needs we have increased our inventory levels and incurred increased freight costs due to decreased capacity associated with higher transportation rates and expedite fees from an organizational perspective the structural changes that we have implemented over the last twelve months continue to improve our operational efficiency the company has achieved material reductions in operating expenses through control and expense management and we are ahead of our plan for the target operating model moving forward on the product side we are focusing on growing our wallet share with our service provider customers in addition to selling fibroactin otp we are growing our residential gateway business residential gateway revenue grew 22 of a quarter and a strong 64 year over year as we increased the number of ott customers also buying our rgs by seventeen year today in addition to rg attach rates we have also focused on increasing attach rates for our mosaic software subscription services as we migrate customers for our mosaic suite in our upcoming mosaic one virtual control center october twenty ninth 904 options for 16000000000 of rdof broadband subsidies there are 386 qualified bidders that represent over 700 operators whereas the connect america fund was targeted to the large price cap carriers providing a 1st right of use the rdof subsidies provide an opportunity for rural local exchange carriers and community broadband providers such as rural electric cooperatives to receive ten years of funding in europe and around the world the strategic importance of five g fiber backbone infrastructure is causing governments to carefully reconsider the security risks of their networks and implementation policies and are implementing policies to bar high risk vendors for participating in these network builds as a result adtran stands out as a safe technically advanced alternative as national operators look to limit or replace high risk vendors in their network 2020 has brought forth a number of challenges that none of us could have envisioned however we have risen to these challenges and are emerging as an even stronger and more resilient company we have achieved much thus far in 2020 with the material benefits just beginning to bear fruit and as they start to be fully recognized thank you we have much to be excited about including the growing number of new customers selecting our products and services to build out or upgrade their networks with rapid adoption of our mosaic platform and subscription services and our sdf solutions as chair one operators begin their transition to the network of the future and the promise of artoff awards and begin and being able to help regional service providers utilities and municipalities good morning everyone i am proud of our company and

to 41 one last quarter and fortysix in the 3rd quarter of 20196 in the prior quarter and 41 in the 3rd quarter of 2019 the quarter of a quarter increase in both gap and non gap gross margins were driven by increases in volume as well as favorable product and services mix lower freight related charges in the current quarter increases in both gap and non gap gross margins on a year over year basis were driven by increases in volume as well as favorable product and services mix the quarter of a quarter increase in both gap and non gap gross margins were driven by increases in volume as

reported in the prior quarter and $62700000 for quarter three of 2019 the quarter over quarter decrease was primarily related to market driven decreases in our deferred compensation expense as well as expense reductions in both r and d and sga as a result of our restructuring program initiated in 2019 and reduced travel expenses offset by increases in some restructuring related costs the year over year decreases in operating expenses for a result of lower expenses in both r and d and esgna and lower travel related expenses partially offset by market driven increases in our deferred compensation expense and an increase in contract services costs on a non gaap basis our 3rd quarter operating expenses were $49400000 compared to 52300000 in the prior quarter operating income on a gap basis for

non gap other income for the quarter was $900000 compared to other income of $5700000 in q 220 and other income of $2700000 for q 319 the decreases in both gap and non gap other income are due to the covid nineteen pandemic quarter over quarter were primarily market driven caused by changes in the valuation of our investment portfolio the decrease in gap and non gap other income on a year over year basis was primarily driven by realized foreign exchange losses offset by market driven upsides in the valuation of our investment portfolio the company is tax provision for the 3rd quarter of 2020 with $600000 of expense as compared to an expense of $1600000 in the prior quarter and an expense of $27700000 in the 3rd quarter of 2019 the current quarter tax expense was primarily due to profitability in our international operations as the deferred tax benefits generated by our domestic operations net income for quarter three of 2020 was $5500000 compared to a net income of $800000 in the prior quarter and a net loss of $46900000 net income for the 3rd quarter of 2019 was $7900000 as compared to an income of $1600000 in the prior quarter and a loss of $2800000 in quarter three of

quarter in a loss of ¢six per share in quarter three of 2019 turning to the balance sheet sheet net trade accounts receivable was $132000000 at quarter end after paying $4300000 in dividends during the quarter for the quarter we used $7000000 of cash from operations net trade accounts receivable was 169 days compared to the prior year of 156 days net inventories ended the quarter at $123000000 compared to $106100000 in q two the increase in our inventories for the quarter that just ended was in preparation for new product ramp ups and strategic inventory buffer purchases made to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity looking ahead to the next quarter the possible effects of the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic the ability of component supplies to align with our customer demand the broken ship nature of our business the timing of revenue associated with large projects the variability of order patterns into the customer base in which we sell as well as the fluctuation in currency we expect that our 4th quarter 2020 revenue will be in the range of 122000000 to $132000000 after considering the projected sales mix we expect that our 4th quarter gross margin on a non gap basis will be we also expect non gap operating expenses for the 4th quarter of 2020 will be between fifty and $51000000 and finally we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the 4th quarter of 2020 on a non gap basis will be a benefit at a mid single digit percentage rate we believe that the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2020 will be component availability a macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises the ongoing effects of the covid nineteen pandemic the variability of nixon revenue associated with project rollouts international revenue relative to our total revenue professional services activity levels in both domestic and international markets the adoption rate of our broadband access platforms potential changes in tax laws currency exchange rate movements and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels once again additional financial information thank you mike at this point we are ready to open up for any questions people may have if you would like to ask a question over the phone lines please press star one on your telephone keypad we will pause for a moment to compile the q a roster your 1st question comes from rich valera your line is open thank you good morning tom you mentioned that you sounded like you mentioned you got a new tier one in q three when you talked about your new customer just wanted to clarify is that the case and if it is can you say anything about that that wins i did actually say that in my notes but in reality we did announce it at the end of september which was for fiber extension and we did pick up another tier one customer with in the quarter where they expanded their programs with us to include a different variation on the technology that we had been previously awarded so there has been some but i did not mention any of my notes hey i am on the unnamed us tier one is there any updates you can give us on those in terms of progress and or revenue expectations initial revenue expectations yeah so one of those is the brand new customer force as you are aware and all three of them are going well all three of them are in different stages of lab work we actually have received some po is from the new customer so i am working on some initial lab work and you know some kind of software work that we are doing for them so that actually booked in and shipped in the quarter but all three of them are going well so when we expect material revenue contributions from them to really start in the 1st half towards the 1st half of next year question on aro you have talked about it being kind of a mid 21 revenue opportunity i think some of your competitors have suggested maybe it is more of a 22 222 any further clarification on your thoughts on timing is it sort of a three queue 21 or forty any thoughts on that yeah yeah and i guess here again this is the difference you know when does it start it will start slower you know you have so many participants some of them have plans completely worked out some of them do not have plans at all i have been just focusing on the bidding process so i think you will start seeing it around the half and then you will start seeing it ramp up from there i think like a lot of companies everybody is rethinking the whole p n e going forward i thank you for that mike i will see the forecast your next question comes from roderick of coldman is sacks your line is open a lot of activity in the tier three space a lot of activity in the tier three space so a lot of network upgrades we rolled out our combo card which is the other ten gig solution a good pickup on the combo card and so just a lot of activity and i think a lot of it has got to do with end user demand you know based off the environment that we are in and people understanding the importance of good connectivity pass whatever financial issues they may have had and some of them have started executing on expansion plans and i do not see that stopping and i think the other one actually is kind of woken up and getting better and that includes not just those but some of the mso is as well so i do not see a near term end in fact i see people planning further out than that and kind of figuring out how they are going to readjust to you know what may be a different work environment in a lot of areas than what they had going into this pandemic and i do not think it is all pandemic driven either i mean the the activity that is going on on the tier 2s has been part of their stated plan it just got put off the tier three is have been heating up for some period of time even prior to that i mean we had solid growth in that space last year as well and then the tier one you know really in the us we are in the cable and the subspace and we are with large carriers and with one of the large carriers here in the toco space in relation to kon and i would say the activity there i would say we have seen good activity i would not call it mid you know i am earth shattering i would say it is solid and there is more of that work is really trying to figure out what they are going to do into next year so i think a lot of that is just i think a real pickup there will probably be next year you know this time next year maybe a little bit earlier than that did that answer your question we are selling copper to fiber and some of the fiber components that we are selling specifically when you are talking about lts and stuff just have a richer mix we also have based off of international and domestic revenue mix we have you know a material difference in those gross margin profiles your next question comes from line of paul silverstein of callan your line is open tom just a clarification of 1st before my question to the response to the previous question obviously or i trust non u s lower margin in the u s as a general proposition but on the product level i apologize you just said this the margin differential it is more favorable for your fiber based or less favorable is that the distinction making in terms of the product mix influencing the gross margin profile in what is the key difference there i would say what is happening in the fiber space is we are selling the mix god it is so much higher god it is so much higher you know i do not have him listed that is that is definitely in the top three sorry we might have to really we might have to really step up our game we might have to really step up our game my question is you know in terms of your launch marketing profile you are obviously just doing a great job you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know

you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job you know you are obviously just doing a great job your guidance back to your traditional guidance in the low 40s for the december quarter has there been any change in your view about longer term are you still looking at a low 40s plus margin profile longer term with the benefit of volume with shift to lts can that be better than that in that range and you you see variability in here remember in q one we were pretty hot also so it jumps around a lot so i try to project this by looking at what we see but we are a book and ship business and what comes in there in a quarter is a little bit hard to to test but i believe that that 41 to 42 guidance is probably what the mix will turn out to be for the quarter i think the variability also is the maybe think about the potential for material international revenue upticking next year and whether or not we have exactly what tier 3s will do next year i think that here in the u s we are going to keep pace with that is it is kind of the thing that you know we just have to look and see there is no doubt that the pressure some of the pressure has been alleviated in places like europe because of the the stance on you know on some of the vendors there but you know there is still a hangover effect on all that and the stronger that that business is you will tend to see a weakness in the gross margin i know it is hard predicting the future but assuming you get the revenues you are expecting from these new tier one wins how do you plan on handling the cost overruns i am just asking what the margin profile is in total not asking on any specific customer but on the surfer ones would that be consistent with the current margin structure would it be deleted would it be accretive any sense that gets better over time how much is that pile in versus what is going on with the us market in tier three right through here alright your next question comes from line of bill dezelle of titan capital your line is open would you talk about the ramp and the timing for material revenues and is that different than your comment about late in the 1st half of next year that you made it to a bigger comment and then the 2nd question is is can you talk through just the european country shutdowns that are happening once again here in the last few days and what implications if any that has for you sure let me start with the 1st one of course is and it is the 1st half ramp that i was talking about was really around the previous sdex awards the three customers that we talked about and really i am talking about in total there are some different dates on all of those but we will start saying as a combination we will start seeing material revenue around the half of next year as far as the new ones one the other one is very specific and like i do not recall the date on that i think it is 3rd quarter of next year yes but that one is big okay it is a well known customer to us they have very specific plans with very specific revenue targets associated with it the current data is 3rd quarter of next year make sure i will tell you that these things tend to slip a little bit but so the what i was talking about before was really the fiber peats as far as the shut downs are concerned other than yeah it really has not you know we have been operating in a relatively shut down environment anyway from an end user demand and really has not affected us too much so far we have been able to maneuver around that i am not aware of any material delay because of the quarantine i do not expect it i think especially our bigger customers but even our smaller customers i think about what is going on in europe have kind of developed an environment where we can talk to their counterparts in the lab work through issues in many cases get into the systems themselves remotely and operate the way we need to operate so i am not every once while you hear about a week delay there and but that is not that frequent and the deployment is not impacted by estate home orders zero yeah yeah no change in that and even in you know europe what we were seeing as far as infrastructure in especially with the new awards we are talking about really material infrastructure builds to begin with because they are really talking about building out footprint either replacing existing infrastructure that they have or expanding in many cases there has been no change in those plans great thank you and if i may throw in one more question latin america what are you seeing with your important customers down there so there in the caribbean we are actually doing well we have some strong relationships how about you we have some activity going on in places like brazil where they are also of course honestly you know the sdx maybe you know the sdx is kind of the architecture people want to go to and so there are large carriers there is not a large carrier that is not looking at a migration towards xgs ten g and if you are going to do that you are going to do that with a virtualized system like the sdx so there is activity going on there is those tend to be we do have one traditional customer down there there are still ongoing negotiations with that customer but there is no material change at this point great thank you for the time your next question comes from line of bahadur najjar of mpm partners your line is open sorry about that i apologize if you have already addressed this but are you seeing any significant increase in order activity i would say that the order rate is reflecting what their demand is i do not see any real change we do on particular parts i talked a little bit about the fact that we are still having some supply issues most predominantly with silicon but in those cases we may really try to nail down a forecast with them and and yeah so  we are adding tier one customers as well so the good news is that that is really not the norm i think that we are going to have to spread the fluctuations around within but having said that we are also adding more tier one so you know you get that issue we are adding tier three and i use tier three we are really talking about alternate carriers of all different types we are heading municipalities on a very fast clip i mean we usually have an internal announcement here or something that goes out that is all we have a weekly update here and there is always a municipality that is being added and we are adding tier three to traditional tier three carriers at a very quick clip i think i mentioned before it is thirty something on customers large percent of those were these alternate type carriers so from that perspective in the end by the way i mentioned our distribution partner it was actually a ten customer that is not typical i do do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do

believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that i do believe that will be typical going forward because i do believe and those are all being sold those are one of our conduits to that alternate carrier that municipal space tier three space so utilities so that base is growing now when we get into this time next year it will still be kind of early in the cycle of some of these wins but we get into this time next year it is really really i have no doubt that we will be more diverse but we are adding tier ones at a nice clip as well so but we will have more customers which will help in that diversity and then one other thing i just want to add i mentioned before the attach rates on our cpu gear and our rpgs and some of our new wifi solutions is really going well which will help add that product diversity as well it is something we are focused on that is really helpful thanks for the color on that  you know i think one last question for me is more topical a big picture view i think at t recently announced that they are going to stop selling the copper based dsl service it seems like a catastrophic shift towards fibers ongoing and it should be you know with all the major tier ones around the world is this a trend that we are going to see more of can you talk a little bit about your competitive positioning and being great in the fiber market is it similar to copper that you enjoyed previously or is it actually better i love talking about this because one of the hangovers that we had gone through we have had couple of programs really one big program that was copper based that died and then which caused us an issue but really it was the longevity of copper that caused us an issue the r and d requirements associated with that copper versus the fiber and i think this is the 1st quarter and depending on how you count it where you really see fiber eclipses copper within our revenue so to us that is a big milestone and it really because there is a lot of work to make that happen we are in the company and if you look at the r and d spend the r and d spend is predominantly fiber based and has been for some time so i am proud and i am glad to be able to see the revenue kind of mimic what it is that we have been doing internally here competitively right now we are in a very good position we have launched new flexibility and new capabilities and there are total access 5000 platform product which has been in the market for a long period of time well i just wanted to call and let you know that we are the only ones in the area that have the switching capability and we are the only ones that have the capability to switch from the ten gigabit to the standard twofive gigabit within the same card profile which is unique in that customer base and getting a lot of attraction because people do not want to have to go out and replace infrastructure they do not have to when i talk about the sdx there is nothing else out there it is a next generation product we have a new system that people have been talking about for five or six years it is actually now out in the market we have actually shifted to paying customers it is what has been selected by pretty much every tier one that we have won in relation to pon and we think there is nothing else that will touch it right now there are people who are kind of reacting to it but we think we have a good headway in the r and d that we put into it that is good to hear thank you thank you your next question comes from line of tinscevo of northland capital management your line is open zero that would seem to be well what what comment were you talking about zero i was talking about the sdx i was talking about what they were doing with their disaggregated solution okay i see a little competitive intensity there but that does suggest there is an industry wide you know trend toward copper going on and so thanks for clarifying that fiber was larger this quarter i wanted to follow back up on the tier three comment you know i do not know if you know what i am talking about but i was just talking to a guy that works for the government and he said that the tier three number is around 1000000 that is a quarterly number that he gave for the size of the tier three but okay so well you know that is interesting and larger than fifty like i said we do not give that area yeah and that would make it you know your largest segment if you look at kind of international us tier three tier two and tier one you know by some distance actually and you are obviously seeing good growth there and you had a lot of impressive growth numbers in various segments i am sorry i do not know what you are talking about thirty year over year decline among us tier ones or you know other parts of the business that are domestic based and i am guessing that may be a function of the you know the copper programs that you reference but you know is that about right and what does it take to kind of stabilize and make that grow or how are you looking at that part of your business i think if i think in tier 2s and tier 3s on a year over year basis we have done good i think the issue that we had last year was predominantly on a comp basis was predominantly temex and so we had a large copper based program going on with them that was 10s of 1000000s of dollars a quarter and it just completely stopped so the the hole that you are talking about in the north american market is temex it is not the us that was very much a copper based vector vector so solution that they are running out i think i just answered your question yeah in part last one for me is you know you think about your potential international growth next year you know obviously the tier 3s continue to grow you know sixty maybe i assume that rate of growth i assume for planning purposes you know you model some slowing in that tier three growth rate despite you know our off ramping up in some other positive drivers just to begin with and you know can we assume that you know from an international standpoint you expect international revenues to grow faster than domestic next year i do not have an answer for you today so the thing about the tier 3s is not just let me just say all carriers because it is broader than traditional tier three carriers but the thing about these carriers is the growth rate through the year has been increasing and i do not see a change in next year so you know you are going to have two quarters of growth before these you know the carriers are going to have two quarters of growth before these really we have one mammoth t one in europe that is going to start that is going to be off the charts in terms of numbers of mammoths that are going to be killed in one night and when that eclipse occurs now there are there are other activities going on there is a process going on in australia carriers like orange we announced an award with rodotophone all of these telephonica which is of course not just in europe but in brazil all of those have got to get the permits to do that those that are in place or or where they are coming towards a decision but those will carry so those are really and if you think they do not get awarded until next year they are a year away from that so the real mammoth new incremental piece is a new customer force that is deploying the sdfx next year and it will just be starting around the half so i could absolutely envision next year where the tier three is actually eclipsed on a pure growth dollar basis is what i mean but i do not know that for a fact we will have to get into the year and really see ardoff will start around the turn of the 2nd half but it you know really for it to be material it is going to take some time so you know that will just be i do not see that as this huge kind of wave of things coming in the 2nd half of next year i think it just starts and starts to ramp up from there yeah these old carriers are you know they keep the momentum they have right now and the u s could be stronger okay so thank you very much for joining us today i appreciate your interest and we look forward to the call next quarter whoa whoa whoa whoa i am going to go to the park",

mention some non gap financial measures reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release financial supplement and other materials available in the investor section on our website and now i would like to turn the call over to alan schnitzer thank you abbe good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today as we shared in our pre release last week and again this morning we reported a small net loss for the quarter due to a high level of catastrophe losses and as we expected a loss in our non fixed income investment portfolio dan will have more to say about both shortly our underlying underwriting income of $572000000 pre tax is up $254000000 over the prior year quarter benefiting from solid net earn premium and a threefive point improvement in the underlying combined ratio to a strong 91four the pandemic and related economic conditions had only a modest net impact on our underwriting results as i shared in my prepared remarks last quarter there will be covid nineteen related loss activity but there will be some offsetting decline in losses due to people across the country sheltering in place in the quarter $114000000 of direct losses and $63000000 of audit premium adjustments were about offset by initial estimates of favorable loss activity most of which is in short tail lines given the continued uncertainty we have taken a cautious approach to recognizing the net impact of covid nineteen related loss activity some industry observers who speculated about the aggregate level of insured and investment losses arising out of the pandemic we do not doubt the losses will be significant but they will not be born evenly across insurers our manageable covid related insurance losses so far this year are a reflection of our disciplined approach to risk selection as well as terms and conditions and as we shared with you in some detail last quarter we manage our investment portfolio with a similar regard to balancing risk and reward last quarter i commented on the potential future impacts the pandemic might have in each of our key lines of business i will review that again with a quarter is worth of experience in personal auto we have seen a meaningful drunk off in auto frequency although that is moderating as economic activity picks up the same time we have taken into consideration the potential for some offsetting impact in terms of auto severity due to factors such as collisions occurring at higher speeds and driver distraction in workers compensation covid related claims mostly relate to healthcare workers and 1st responders but do not represent a significant part of our book of business also the frequency of those claims stabilized during the quarter which might be attributed to an improved supply of ppe and the healthcare community having the benefit of more experience with managing covid patients more broadly beyond the healthcare sector data for some of the state workers comp systems suggest that the covid related claim rate is low relative to the infection rate that is likely partly attributable to the fact that the population most seriously affected by covid nineteen skews older and is not in the workforce nonetheless in developing our loss estimates we have taken into consideration the potential for the delayed reporting of claims and additional claim activity associated with the recent spikes in infection rates as well as uncertainty related to the longer term implications of the disease as we anticipated some states have effectively expanded the scope of workers comp coverage by creating presumptions of compensability in most cases states have taken a thoughtful approach protecting workers appropriately but not unreasonably burdening the workers compensation system where states have acted to expand compensability we have adjusted our loss estimates accordingly in terms of non covid workers comp losses we have seen the lower volume of workers comp claims as workers have stayed home this will abate as people get back to the workplace in addition to taking that into account we have contemplated that severity could be adversely affected by injured workers delaying treatment due to the stay at home work environment having said all that our experience is that there is a low level of workers comp claim activity associated with economic recessions during periods of elevated unemployment workers tend to be more motivated to stay at their jobs and the workforce tends to be more seasoned in management liability as we expected we are seeing the elevated level of claim activity typically associated with stock market volatility and workforce reductions the underlying combined ratio this quarter in bond and specialty reflects that as well as other loss activity and we expect that the underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at this level or somewhat higher over the near term this is not unlike the experience we had in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago nonetheless we expect the return from this segment will continue to be healthy turning to the surety business we have been pleased to see that work is continuing on the vast majority of construction projects however the depth and duration of stress in the economy continues to be risk factors the surety business the line will also be impacted by other factors such as the financial strength in the bonded firms as i shared last quarter our high quality surety book was effectively stress tested in the 2008 financial crisis and performed well and our underwriting approach has remained disciplined since that time in that regard so far we have not seen anything that has caused us to change our surety loss estimates in terms of business interruption coverages under commercial property policies there is a fair amount of litigation challenging coverage as a reminder our commercial property insurance policies that include business interruption including as a result of civil authority require losses to be caused by direct physical damage to property from a covered cause of loss in addition our standard policy forms specifically exclude loss or damage caused by or resulting from a virus a few court decisions we have seen so far one in new york and one in michigan have both upheld the physical damage requirement in the context of covid nineteen on the legislative front efforts to retroactively expand coverage for business interruptions seem to be diminishing finally with respect to liability coverages as people shelter in place we are seeing fewer commercial auto accidents and slip and fall type claims anecdotally we are also seeing some movement by the plaintiff bar to submit claims faster but it is too soon to know how significant that benefit might be we are also encouraged by states that have adopted covid related liability protections and similar efforts that are underway in other states and at the federal level we should not let frivolous lawsuits undermine the nation is recovery nonetheless we expect the plaintiff bar to continue to be active turning to the quarter of the top line we are very pleased with our production results excluding the auto premium refunds we provided to our customers net written premiums grew by two as the impact of covid nineteen on insured exposures was more than offset by strong renewal rate change in all three segments in business insurance we achieved renewal rate change of sevenfour the highest level since 2013 and close to the record level we achieved that year excluding workers comp renewal rate change was double digits importantly retention levels remain strong in bond and specialty insurance net written premiums increased by three as our domestic management liability business achieved record renewal rate change while maintaining strong retention in personal insurance excluding the other premium refunds net written premiums increased by six driven by strong retention and new business in both agency auto and agency homeowners in our agency homeowners business renewal premium change remains strong at sevenseventy and we hit a record for new business let me take a minute to comment on the commercial rate environment before the pandemic struck there there were a number of industry wide factors putting upward pressure on prices namely increased volatility of weather related losses interest rates at historical lows and a growing recognition of higher loss trend in the liability lines all of those conditions persist and now at another quarter with a very high level of weather related losses interest rates that are likely to be lower for longer and while it has not been a significant factor for us for reinsurance market that has hardened and on top of that the pandemic and related economic fallout add a sense of incremental uncertainty making this feel like one of those times not unlike in the wake of 911 and hurricane katrina when the market recalibrates risk with that as the background we will continue to see great gains and manage other leverage of profitability to improve the outlook for returns i will close by saying that i could not be more grateful to my travelers colleagues for their grit and commitment to taking care of our customers our business partners our communities and each other also the work they have done in recent years to advance our innovation agenda has equipped us with state of the art digital tools and other capabilities that make all the difference in this environment we were well prepared and from here we are well positioned free from financial and operational distractions we will continue uninterrupted managing our business and investing for longterm success ensure we are confident in our ability to continue to succeed through these uncertain times and to benefit from the strength of our franchise as the economy recovers and with that i will turn the call over to dan thank you alan our core loss for the 2nd quarter was $50000000 compared to core income of $537000000 in the prior year quarter the change resulted primarily from a higher level of catastrophe losses and as expected lower net investment income for the quarter the net impact related to covid nineteen is included in our underlying results not as part of our cat figure and was modest more on that in a minute our 2nd quarter results include $854000000 of pre tax cat losses compared to only $367000000 in last year is 2nd quarter this quarter cats includes severe storms in several regions of the united states as well as $91000000 of losses related to civil unrest regarding our property aggregate catastrophe xol treaty for 2020 as of june 30th we have accumulated about $1400000000 of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention of $1550000000 the treaty provides aggregate coverage of $280000000 part of $500000000 of losses of both that $1550000000 retention the underlying combined ratio of 91four which excludes the impacts of cats and pyd improved by threefive points compared to 94ninety in last year is 2nd quarter the underlying loss ratio improved by more than four points and benefited from a lower level of non cat weather losses favorable frequency and personal auto from the shelter in place environment net of related premium refunds and the impact of earned pricing and excess of loss trend the expense ratio of 31 is eight tenths of a point higher than the prior year quarter and above our recent run rate this change was as expected due to the reduction in premiums associated with the pandemic is impact on the economy along with the premium refunds to our personal auto customers the net impact of covid nineteen and its related effects on the economy were modest in terms of our overall 2nd quarter underwriting our top line was resilient excluding the premium refunds and personal insurance net written premiums increased by two driven by strong renewal rate change in all three segments that more than offset lower insured exposures in terms of operating expenses results were adversely impacted by modest increases in the allowance for bad debt and the accrual for supplemental commissions those expense increases however were roughly offset by lower expenses in other categories for example travel costs were down as our employees continue to work primarily from home the economic impacts related to covid nineteen also affected our underlying losses for example losses directly related to covid nineteen totaled $114000000 primarily workers comp and business insurance and management liability losses in our bond and specialty business on the other hand we experienced significant reductions in auto claims as there were fewer cars on the road during the 2nd quarter and to a lesser degree recognized a benefit reflecting fewer traditional workers comp claims as more people work from home as you heard from alan given the uncertainty in the current environment we took a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of covid related losses we have recorded the estimated costs for all losses incurred through june 30th including incurred losses for which claims has not yet been reported all losses have been recorded at our estimate of ultimate and the majority of the covid nineteen related insurance losses we have booked in the 1st and 2nd quarters are still sitting in our ibnr reserves we have not recognized losses or benefits from covid nineteen related insured events that we anticipate will occur subsequent to the end of the quarter taking a step back on a year to date basis the impact on our results excluding that investment income from covid nineteen and its related effects is a net charge of about $50000000 pre tax turning to prior year reserve development in personal insurance both auto and property losses came in better than expected for multiple accident years in bond and specialty insurance we saw larger losses than expected in management liability resulting in prior year strengthening of $33000000 largely offsetting the favorable development in personal insurance in business insurance there was no net prior year reserve development as better than expected loss experience in workers comp and commercial property was largely offset by unfavorable results in our other casualty binds each of the movements this quarter was relatively small compared to the reserve base as you saw in our july 14th press release we expect to record subrogation benefits in our 3rd quarter pyd of approximately $400000000 pre tax related to pg e is successful emergence from bankruptcy on july 1st as a reminder 3rd quarter pyd will also include the results of our annual asbestos review after tax net investment income decreased by 54 from the prior year quarter to $251000000 somewhat better result than we had previewed in our call last quarter the decrease was driven by our non fixed income returns where results for our private equity hedge fund and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a one quarter lag accordingly the impact of the disruption in global financial markets that occurred in the latter half of the 1st quarter impacted our 2nd quarter results as the broader markets have recovered in the 2nd quarter that should at least to some extent benefit our non fixed income results in the 3rd quarter it is worth mentioning here that recoveries may not be reflected in the private equity and hedge fund results as quickly as the downturns were given continued economic uncertainty the fund managers who report their results to us may take a more measured approach not be as quick to write back up the valuations they just marked down particularly in light of what may be continued challenging prospects for the earnings and cash flows of the fund is underlying investments fixed income returns decreased by $24000000 after tax as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by the decline in interest rates and a mix change as we chose to maintain a somewhat higher level of liquidity and held more short term investments than in prior quarters for the remainder of 2020 we expect that fixed income nii will decrease by approximately 35 to $40000000 after tax per quarter compared to the corresponding periods of 201 turning to capital management operating cash flows for the quarter of $1700000000 we are again very strong all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter withholding company liquidity of slightly more than $2000000000 well above our target level recall that in april we pre funded as we normally do $500000000 of debt coming due in november with a new thirty year $500000000 debt issuance at two55 so our holding company liquidity is temporarily elevated by that amount investment yields decreased as credit spreads tightened during the 2nd quarter and accordingly our net unrealized investment gain increased from $1800000000 after tax as of march 31st to $3600000000 after tax at june 30th adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $9201 at quarter end down less than one from year end and up two year over year we returned $218000000 of capital to our shareholders this quarter via dividends we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter as we indicated in our 1st quarter earnings call our capital management strategy remains unchanged with the ongoing economic uncertainty and with hurricane season upon us it still feels to us like holding onto a little more capital is preferable to holding onto a little less until there is more clarity on the state of the economy we may buy back some shares in the coming quarters or we may continue to choose to buy none coming back to re insurance for a moment let me direct your attention to slide nineteen of the webcast presentation for a summary of our july 1st renewals the structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior year we renewed our northeast cat treaty effective july 1st substantially similar terms and pricing that was up only slightly on an exposure adjusted basis our cat bond long point re iii is now in the 3rd year of it is four year term in the annual reset for the 2020 hurricane season the attachment point was adjusted from $1790000000 to $1870000000 while the total cost of the program was flat year over year a more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage including our general cat aggregate xol treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our ten q which we filed earlier today and in our 2019 form ten k lastly let me take a minute to address thoughts on our top line going forward looking at premium volume we expect to experience the impacts of economic disruption how much of an impact we feel and for how long will depend on the extent and duration of the negative economic impacts related to the pandemic because earned premium typically lagged written premium we expect to feel the effects on an earned basis beyond the end of the year now instead last quarter we do not intend to take disruptive action expense actions in response to what may prove to be a short term impact on premium volumes accordingly in coming quarters the expense ratio will likely remain somewhat elevated compared to the corresponding periods of 2019 through the expected impact on earned premiums now i will turn the call over to greg for discussion of business insurance thanks dan let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to all my travelers colleagues as well as our agent and broker partners for continuing to provide exceptional service to our customers during these unprecedented times as for the quarter is results business insurance had a loss for the quarter of $58000000 due to lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses as both alan and dan discussed the combined ratio of 107ten included more than ten points with catastrophe impacted by both weather related losses and civil unrest the underlying combined ratio of 97 improved by zerofour points reflecting a zerotwo point improvement in each of the underlying loss ratio and expense ratio the net impact of covid nineteen and related economic conditions was modest turning to the top line net written premiums were three lower than the prior year quarter due to the impact of the economic disruption uninsured exposures thanks to excellent execution by our field organization these impacts were largely offset by strong renewal rate decreases and high retention turning to domestic production we achiev achieved strong renewal rate change of sevenforty while retention remained high at 83 the renewal rate change of sevenforty was up almost four points from the 2nd quarter of last year and more than a point from the 1st quarter of this year not withstanding the persistent downward pressure in workers compensation prices we continued to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases at all lines other than workers compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the 2nd quarter of last year we achieved positive rate on about eighty of our middle market accounts this quarter which was up from about two thirds in the 2nd quarter of last year importantly we have achieved this progress in a highly segmented manner and with retention remaining strong at these rate levels our rate change continues to exceed loss trend even after about a half a point increase to our loss trend assumption new business of $473000000 was down ten from the prior year quarter new business flow was down which we attribute largely to disruption caused by the pandemic new business was also impacted by our continued focus on disciplined risk selection underwriting and pricing these production results reflect superior execution by our field organization in a very challenging environment as for the individual businesses in select renewal rate change was up to twoten making the 6th consecutive quarter where renewal rate was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter while retention was strong at 82 the headwind for workers compensation pricing is most pronounced in the select business new business was down significantly driven by the economic disruption caused by the pandemic while the current environment is challenging we are confident that we are well positioned and investing in the right strategic capabilities to profitably grow this business over time in middle market renewal rate change was up to sevennine while retention remained strong at 86 the sevenninety was up almost fourfive points from the 2nd quarter of 2019 and onefive points for the 1st quarter of 202 new business of $255000000 was down from the prior year quarter driven by both economic disruption and our continued focus on disciplined risk selection underwriting and pricing to sum up we believe our meaningful competitive advantages including our strong distribution relationships and our talent and expertise position us well to navigate through these uncertain times and continue to serve our customers and agent and broker partners with that i will turn the call over to tom thanks greg bond and specialty delivered solid returns and growth in the quarter despite the impacts of covid nineteen and related economic conditions segment income was $72000000 a decrease of $102000000 from the prior year quarter as dan mentioned the combined ratio of 93eighty reflects unfavorable prior year reserve development in the quarter as compared to favorable pyd in the prior year quarter and a higher underlying combined ratio the underlying combined ratio of 88ten increased seven one points from the prior year quarter primarily driven by the impacts of higher loss estimates or management liability coverages about half of which was due to covid nineteen and related economic conditions the remaining half of the increase is due to a few smaller drivers such as elevated claim activity under employment practices liability coverages and ransomware losses under cyber policies turning to the top line net written premiums grew three for the quarter reflecting strong growth in our management liability and international businesses partially offset by lower surety production in our domestic management liability business we are pleased that renewal premium change increased to seveneight this march the 7th consecutive quarter where rpc is higher than the corresponding prior year core as alan noted renewable rate change was a record for the quarter while retention remained at a historically high 89 similar to business insurance rpc in the quarter was also impacted by lower insured exposures these production results demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy to pursue rate where needed while maintaining strong retention of our high quality portfolio we will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted domestic management liability new business for the quarter decreased $13000000 reflecting the disruption asso associated with covid nineteen in our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment domestic surety net premium net written premium was down $24000000 in the quarter reflecting the impact of covid nineteen which slowed public project procurement and related bond demand international bsi posted strong growth in the quarter with record rate in our uk management liability business so bonded specialty results remained resilient despite the challenges brought on by covid nineteen these results reflect the excellent work of our agents brokers and employees who have adapted to operating in new ways to continue to provide leading products and services to our customers we feel confident about our ability to navigate through this challenging environment and continue to deliver strong returns over time and now i will turn it over to michael to discuss the personal insurance thanks tom and good morning everyone personal insurance segment income for the 2nd quarter of 2020 was $10000000 down from $88000000 in the prior year quarter driven by a higher level of catastrophe losses and lower net investment income these impacts were partially offset by an improvement in the underlying underwriting gains our combined ratio for the quarter was 101three an increase of one one points and a twelve and a half point increase in catastrophe losses was largely offset by a tensix point improvement in the underlying combined ratio the underlying combined ratio benefited from lower non catastrophe weather related losses and lower automobile losses net of premium refunds the increase of twosix points on the underwriting expense ratio was primarily driven by the reduction in net earned premiums resulting from the auto premium refunds turning to the top line excluding the impact of premium refunds of $216000000 net written premiums grew six agency homeowners and other net written premiums were up an impressive thirteen and agency automobile net premiums were up three excluding premium re bonds agency automobile delivered strong results with a combined ratio of 85seventy for the quarter the loss ratio improved over twelve points while the underwriting expense ratio increased by about four points the increase in the underwriting expense ratio was primarily driven by the impact of the premium refunds i described earlier the underlying combined ratio of 84twenty improved ninesix points relative to the prior year quarter continuing to reflect improvements in frequency primarily due to fewer miles driven as a result of the pandemic data from our intellidrive auto telematics program indicates miles driven were down significantly from pre covid nineteen levels during the 2nd quarter reaching a weekly low point in a in early april and partially rebounding as the economy has started to reopen in response to our improved auto loss experience we implemented a stay at home auto premium credit program for personal automobile customers in the us the program provided a fifteen premium refund on april may and june premiums in agency homeowners and other the 2nd quarter combined ratio was 113nine ninefour points higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to higher catastrophes partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio historically the 2nd quarter is our highest catastrophe quarter this quarter we experienced significant storm activity resulting in 34 points of catastrophe losses an increase of 21 points compared to the prior year quarter where catastrophes were relatively low the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 81four down over eleven points from the prior year quarter driven primarily by lower non catastrophe weather related losses the majority of the improvement is due to elevated non cat weather in the prior year quarter non catastrophe weather related losses this quarter were also better than our assumptions turning to quarterly production our domestic agency results were solid despite the challenging environment resulting from covid nineteen and its related economic impacts our retentions remain strong quotes and new business were up versus the prior year quarter and we remain pleased with our policies enforced growth agency automobile retention with 85 and new business increased seven from the prior year quarter renewal premium change was onefifty as we continue to moderate pricing given the improved inform performance in our book over the past few years agency homeowners and other delivered another very strong quarter with retention of 87 renewal premium change of sevenseventy and a seventeen increase in new business as we continue to seek to improve returns while growing the business higher new business levels again benefited from the successful rollout of our quantum home two product now available in over forty markets during the quarter we continued to deliver new capabilities and products to our customers and distribution partners we introduced quantum home two in four new states including california in addition we launched intellidrive two which adds distracted driving monitoring to our auto telematics product and delivers significant improvements to the user experience and after reaching our goal of planting 1000000 trees for customer enrollment in paperless billing we extended our partnership with american forests to plant another 500000 trees by earth day 202 to recap personal insurance is off to a strong start in the 1st half of the year particularly in light of a challenging environment i am proud of our team is efforts to continue to work together to meet the needs of those we are privileged to serve while investing in the business for the future now i will turn the call back over to abbe thanks michael before we begin q a there is one topic that we expect might be on people is minds so we thought we would kick off q a by addressing it so before we open up the line i would like to turn the call back over to dan thanks abbe there has been some discussion by industry observers about the timing of the recognition of covid related losses so let me reiterate that our reserves reflect our best estimate of ultimate losses incurred as of the balance sheet date in applying accounting principles we would not record a reserve for a loss that has not yet occurred as of the balance sheet date using auto claims as an example at the beginning of the year we have an assumption as to the volume of claims we will see over the course of the year and what the average cost of those claims will be but when we report our 2nd quarter results including our balance sheet loss reserves as of june 30th those reserves do not include estimated amounts for auto accidents that will occur at thanksgiving or on new year is eve those would be 4th quarter events and accordingly they will be recognized in our 4th quarter results this same principle applies when we consider losses related to covid nineteen while only some losses have been reported to us so far the losses we booked in both the 1st and 2nd quarter reflect our estimates of the ultimate amounts that we will pay for all losses and related costs that have been incurred as of june 30th including those for which we have not yet received a claim in fact as i said earlier the majority of the covid related insurance losses we have booked through june 30th are still sitting in our ibnr reserves that said the pandemic is clearly not over and 10s of 1000s of new infections are being confirmed in the united states each day it is foreseeable that a healthcare worker for example who to this point has not contracted covid nineteen will become ill from covid nineteen as a result of their job duties in december but again that loss activity will be included in our 4th quarter results we similarly would not advance the recognition of any continued favorability from lower frequency in non covid workers comp claims finally i will remind you that on a year to date basis setting aside net investment income the impact on our results from covid nineteen and its related effects is a net charge of about $50000000 pre tax and with that operator we are ready to take questions thank you at this time if you would like to ask a question press star one on your telephone to withdraw your question press the pound key please wait while we compile the questions your 1st question comes from the line of michael phillips with morgan stanley please go ahead thank you good morning everybody thanks thanks for that clarification dan on that last comment that is that is helpful i guess i want to try to get arms around business business insurance and and and margins in pricing you know trying to kinda pull out the effect of covid you said covid was pretty modest in the quarter pricing was clearly very strong yet yet core margins improved forty bps or twenty bps on the well side so i guess trying to understand i i i is does that mean you know and and alan you gave lots of great commentary on on pricing does that mean that the current level pricing still is not enough to expand margins today for kinda how we think about that versus the level of conservatism that might be baked into the to the current numbers yeah michael good morning it is alan and i will i will i will start to see if i can be responsive to what is on your mind at at the current levels of you know written rate is is in excess of of lost trend so you know looking narrowly at those factors we we are on a written basis expanding margins is is that is that what you are getting at it is yeah it it is i guess you you know on business interruption you had twenty basis points of improvement so you know not as much as maybe one would expect in a level of pricing and so you know that is that is what i am trying to get my arms around yeah so you know as always there are a number of factors that are driving the underlying combined ratio in the quarter and that is true true for any business so you have got you have got weather so y year over year that was that was better and in this quarter sort of within the normal within the normal level of we would expect for that you have got the earned impact of rate that as i as i said on both the written and earned basis rate is ahead of loss trend we have had improved performances in some business you got some some impact of covid it was modest but not zero you know you have got the year over year in that sort of ongoing carry on impact of of social inflation that i will call old news what you know the what we have recognized in prior periods and that continues to roll through so you know tho those are you know we are give given the relative stability we are not going to quantify the pieces but essentially those are the pieces okay no thank you that that that is helpful thanks alan i guess did not did not see mention and i guess this is good news did not see mention of anything on the commercial auto side for for pyd and so maybe could you speak to kinda that piece and does that mean that there has been possibly some leveling off of the paid activity that has been part of the concern there michael it is it is dan yeah a as we had last quarter so we had some movements in pyd some you know some puts and takes some continued good news in com some continued pressure in the other liability lines there were small adjustments in commercial auto and the general liability lines in cmp but as i said in my remarks relatively modest compared to compared to those reserve bases okay thank you dan your next question comes from line of ryan tinney with auto research please go ahead hey thanks good morning i just wanted to get a better feel for just you know forget about the net benefit from the covid just from the direct loss of the loan or the direct impact what was the the hit that that had in business interruption on the combined ratio business interruption specifically or business insurance i am sorry i am sorry business insurance without without considering the offsetting benefits what was just the the the direct loss impact or direct hit impact on on that number yeah ryan it is dan i i do not think we are going to give the pluses and the minuses but within the within the we we told you that there was 114000000 of of directly related charges and while that included some some charges for the management liability coverages in bond and specialty the majority of what we took came through business insurance okay and then in terms of thinking about the benefits that we are seeing i think in the pre announcement you said it was mostly short tail lines so should we take that to mean i mean 1st of all outside of the short tail lines are you seeing a actual to expecteds look a little bit better in some areas in terms of frequency and is that not something and if so is that something that you are not recognizing yet you are you are being conservative and waiting to see if that continues to be the case yeah ryan dan again so we are for sure seeing some some favorable indications relative to what you would otherwise expect in in this current environment and when we look at that there was too much favorability to simply say zero is the right reaction but as alan said in his comments and as i tried to reiterate in mine i think we have been very cautious in terms of the degree to which we would recognize any good news in anything other than the short tail lines but there is some because it is it is very apparent in the data and and then just eleven more real quick i was i guess a little bit surprised exposure growth held in i think especially in select lines retention has only declined modestly you know how should we interpret that is retention is it capturing cancellations or is that modest dip you know mostly a function of you guys taking more reign i am just trying to figure out how to interpret those numbers that seem relatively modest given what is happening in the macro landscape yeah ryan let let me this is greg let me take both of those in the order that you took them num number one in terms of exposure change if you are looking that relative to middle market that is really a product mix dynamic in the select business we have the thrust of the premium is two products cmt and workers comp in the cmt product the rating on that has driven more off the property than the gl and so you know we are continuing to see pricing and inflationary pressure on the property and so there is some inflationary impact that that impacts on the cmt product and so you do not see as much of a drag on exposure on select that you do on middle market where the gl product is is more on a standalone rated basis and then the retention overall for select you know we we certainly put our our estimate of what we see in terms of you know business insolvencies bankruptcies and that is all inside the 82 number thank you your next question comes from the line of meyer shields with kbw please go ahead great thanks greg if i heard you correctly in your prepared comments you talked about a sixty basis point increase in loss trend and i was hoping you could flush that out a little sure meyer yeah we we look at loss trends every quarter in in across the full portfolio and that is obviously a headline number what we did this quarter is we looked at you know the impact of the the new economy that we see in front of us we also look at some of the social inflation or liability dynamics that dan just talked about when we roll that all up in aggregate we we we believe we have got a fifty basis points increase in our loss trend in front of us the the thing i would had to that meyer is that that is reflected in the you know underlying combined ratio we reported for the quarter as as is a a piece of that that would be catch up from the 1st quarter okay perfect that last point is exactly what i was looking for 2nd question i guess with workers compensation being the most vulnerable to did that impact rate need on the side say the question again i am i am trying to understand i know that in general workers compensation pricing has been coming down because industry experience has been good but we seem to be seeing a fairly significant exposure unit headwind and i am trying to get my arms around what that implies for indicated pricing yeah you know meyer there is a heavy regulatory component to pricing as you know and it tends to be you know a little bit backward looking and it and it sort of factors in the overall possibility of the line which is as you know has been has been very favorable over the years and and that will continue to be the case so you know clearly you know exposure will be will be one impact on profitability today which will impact pricing tomorrow but it is really hard to isolate any one and any one factor and it is impact on profitability because you know e everything goes in you have got you know you have got you start with your expiring rate and then you have got you know what whatever the rate change is and you have got exposure change you got you know loss trends things like that so it is it is definitely a factor it is hard to isolate you know what the extent of the impact is okay understood thank you very much your next question comes from the line of elyse greenspan with wells fargo please go ahead morning elyse hi good morning can you hear me no we hear you now hi sorry thank you in terms of business insurance i was hoping for the covid nineteen losses and i recognize a response from an earlier question maybe you are not giving to the loss impact in business insurance specifically by line so could you give us a sense of where you saw the majority of your covid losses thus ignoring the favorable impact in the 2nd quarter just specifically within business insurance yeah elyse so so that is what i had tried to do so we took 114000000 across the enterprise in direct in direct covid losses none of that was in personal insurance there was some component of management liability within bond and specialty insurance which tom described in going through their combined ratio but the majority of those dollars came through business insurance elyse are you asking for a breakdown by product line yeah i was hoping by product line even if not in terms of dollars you could just give us a sense of which business insurance product line saw the majority of your covid losses yeah the largest line for sure is workers comp some some property losses both domestically and internationally and then dribs and drabs i would say in other lines but those are those are the two drivers with comp by far being the largest and elyse i would point you to my prepared comments where i where i did share that you know it was a modest net impact when we looked at the offsetting on the favorable frequency on on some of those lines also okay thanks and then my 2nd question is maybe a follow up on the prior question on workers comp we have heard a you know a few folks of the industry it seems like starting to point towards the bottom of comp in terms of just the pricing and dynamics there but if i you know go back to your comments throughout the call it does not sound like you guys are you know thinking that the you know rate declines that we have seen in that business are you know close to coming to an end so if you could just help us think about workers comp in terms of the pricing dynamics there and whether you know we might hit an inflection and i am not just talking 2020 perhaps you know even into 2021 as well yeah e elyse that is a great question when you when you look at the information coming out of the some of the rating bureaus and when we look at our own you know we we would say that we are sort of at or near a bottom in the workers comp pricing okay that is helpful one last numbers question could you give us you said that they were small numbers but is there could you give us a sense of the dollars in terms of the adverse development within general liability and commercial multi peril in the quarter we are not going to do that elyse they are all pretty modest okay thank you i appreciate the color thank you your next question comes from the line of david with evercar please go ahead hi thanks good morning and dan i guess i i you know i i appreciate the comments that you made just before the q a but i guess i am just wondering if if you could give us some sense of you know how you are thinking about covid related adverse impacts throughout the rest of the year you know just looking through your portfolio of exposures and thinking how it might be affected by covid even if the losses have not occurred yet in the 1st half and you had the exposure and you think there is a possibility that there could be a loss on it just wondering to get some some thoughts there i figured i would take a shot at that david good morning it is alan let me start with that and if i miss anything i would like dan to pick it up we are not we are not going to forecast future losses our obligation under gap is to report you know the the you know incurred and and and unreported losses as of the balance sheet date and that is what we have done it is it is hard to forecast the future there is some uncertainty we do not know the trajectory of the disease we do not know you know when when we are going to have a vaccine we do not know you know what the outlook for the economy is and and frankly it is you know probably the the uncertainties for the economy that have the biggest impact on of of the pandemic on on us but i i i do think it is relevant to and it is why we pointed it out a few times that our our net losses in the 1st half of the year were our net charges were about 15000000 bucks putting aside the investment side and and and we have you know put up that net number with a with a high degree of so i i can not i can not give you a number you know i tried in my sort of line by line review to tell you some of the factors that we think about but i you know i i think you know it is it is not it is not irrelevant to that assessment to think about our experience in the 1st half of the year okay great that that is helpful appreciate that alan and then just just one more so excluding workers comp the renewal rate change so it was pretty calm you said double double digits wondering if we could get a finer point put on that and then just sort of how that compares versus the last few quarters and and and also you know sorta thinking about and i i think dan you had mentioned you know you are looking at loss trend of five now in the new updated thinking and that is i guess what i should be comparing to the sevenforty renewal rate change that you got in the quarter yeah i think that is the r it is dan i think that is the right way to think about rate versus trend and that is about that is the ballpark i think we would said previously that trend was around fourfive in vi and we are taking it up about about a half a point in the current quarter but you got to look at that in in relation to the pricing momentum as well and i think greg could correct me if i am wrong but the the pricing momentum you see in in this quarter is is a reflection of is a reflection of the strength of the market and the continued need for rate yeah the only thing i would add there to your point you know outside of comp all of our products were +and so you know we we feel great about that execution and and mostly the changes line up with where the rate need is also okay great and if if i could just sneak one more in on the the adverse development in general liability hoping to get a little bit more color in terms of what you saw in the quarter that i guess brought you to make that change because i had thought that you know most of the courts were closed during the quarter i i would think the page would be yeah nothing really accelerated during the quarter or or was it more just a view of of you know or was it more just a ongoing review that resulted in the change there yeah it is it is more the latter and remember as we are doing reserve reviews especially in long tail lines like those you are you are looking more backwards at at your data so the actual loss environment of you know may and june we are aware of it but it is not really you do not have enough time to gather all that data and fully factor it into the reserve view that you are making at that time so a little more of that is still backward looking in terms of the way things had developed say through the 1st quarter and again as dan noted again as dan noted in his remarks those were those were relatively small movements yeah great understood thank you thank you your next question comes from the line of paul newsome with piper sandler please go ahead you you have hit the big ones for me but one just quick one from an investment perspective do you have expectations that we would see increased defaults as well come through and i guess they would be mostly unrealized and is that sort of booked into the investment expectations that you gave us this quarter as well i am thinking the actual defaults that we might see from the recession yeah paul it is dan you know we gave a fair amount of detail and did a fair amount of commentary on you know the construct of the investment portfolio in in our comfort level with you know the the way we thoughtfully invested and and we have given you an update of of that investment detail again in the appendix of the webcast presentation this quarter so i i would not say more than we said i think last quarter in terms of feeling really good about the way we have managed risk on on the asset side of the balance sheet clearly we are aware of and looking and looking at and have a regular process to assess credit impairment and default rates and all of that stuff is baked into our numbers but it is really it is really not a big big impact on us given the thoughtful investment approach in the 1st place has has ratings migration had much of an impact yet if at all on the capital calculations for you guys no it has not great well thank you thanks paul your next question comes from the line of brian with uvs please go ahead yeah thanks just two quick ones here 1st one what was the impact of premium adjustments on the bi written premium this quarter the comp and cmp i am not sure i understand the question brian it is dan meaning for workers like like reevaluating like like what like is on workers comp you usually do it in the 4th quarter but were there any kind of early ones where you adjusted premium to reflect what what it is going to look like for the year yeah so so i would not say we normally do it in the 4th quarter i think what you are referring to okay we do it when the policy period has has ended there there has been some and we have been open to it there had been some more requests by customers to do some of that midterm but all of that is baked all of that is baked into our production statistics and the written premium numbers we reported for the quarter brian and yeah break out that one piece okay thanks and then the 2nd just quick question just to understand the fifty basis points of increase in trend in the bi is that inclusive of what you are seeing with respect to covid nineteen and maybe the benefits or adverse stuff you are seeing on covid nineteen or is that more related to what is going on with just general kind of tort inflation and some of the increase you saw in your gl reserves and your cmp reserves i think were we consider everything brian in in included in there and there are some puts and takes and that of the puts and takes was a half a point increase to the trend great and and just to on that following on that alan you made some comments about maybe some favorable stuff happening in the court system as far as some you know early quick settlements but in general what is your kind of take on what is going on with tort right now and could we potentially see any increase in tort inflation you know as a result of what is going on with with covid nineteen yeah i mean i think we we certainly could and and that is one of the reasons why we are such big proponents of liability reform i think it is important in terms of making sure we are protecting the nation is recovery from from the pandemic you know i i i think you you hear a lot of of rhetoric out there on that topic but you know every everything everything we see and everything we are anticipating is in is in that loss trend number great thank you thank you and we have time for one more question coming from the line of with jp morgan please go ahead hi good morning so 1st i had a question on just the commercial auto business if you could talk about what you are seeing in terms of frequency is that picking up as traffic has been increasing recently and then relatedly just your views on the rate adequacy in that line given that you have been raising prices for for awhile or do you think rates need to go up further hi this is good morning this is greg yeah we certainly have seen some favorable frequency activity as the shelter at home has taken place certainly not to the levels of personal insurance and and just as a reminder in in commercial auto it is a little unique and personal where we do have lay up credits or premium credits when there is limited use and so you know there is a slight offset as we see that frequency we have mechanisms to give that to give that back now as the economy is starting to reopen we are seeing that frequency moderate okay and on the personal auto side are you assuming or expecting additional refunds in the 3rd quarter results so we do not we do not have further refunds planned in personal auto you know i think i think like many we are looking forward at what rate adequacy over time and looking at more traditional mechanisms like rate filings to make sure that rate is in line with loss trend and loss in personal auto the refunds really were a were a mechanism to respond to acute an acute issue in the early days of the pandemic is sort of the way we are thinking about it okay and then just lastly you mentioned a majority of the covid losses were related to workers comp but you did not really mention anything about business interruption and i am assuming those losses were pretty modest but is that more because you have not seen a lot of claim submission or is it just you you have seen submissions but your view is that those claims are uninsured given the policy language yeah we we have certainly seen some submissions and and there is some you know claim activity around it and and even some litigation around it as as we have noted we have got provisions in our policies that that we think m make that coverage inapplicable and and so we do not expect many of those claims a actually to pay up it is dan eleven related comment to that e even where we do not expect it ultimately to pay the indemnity on the loss we have acknowledged in our reserve the fact that we will spend some money defending against claims that come in for for business for business interruption zero okay and and on on covid is that the line where you see the most uncertainty in terms of claims given what happens on sort of in terms of litigation activity or are there other lines where there is not a lot of clarity based on what is happened so far you know i i do not think there is a i do not think there is a lot of uncertainty around business interruption i mean i mean certainly there is some because there is some litigation and there is always uncertainty when you have litigation but you know we we have got the requirement for direct physical damage we have got two courts that have upheld that so far and and we have got a specific virus exclusion in our standard policy form so we we do not actually see a lot of uncertainty there and we do not expect you know that to be a material loss contributor for us okay thank you thank you i will now turn i will now turn the call back over to abbe for closing remarks thank you all for joining us this morning i appreciate it as always if there is any follow up please get in touch with investor relations and we are happy to answer your questions be well and have a good day thanks this concludes today is conference call you may not

investor section on our website and now i would like to turn the call over to alan schnitzer thank you avi good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today as we shared in our pre release we delivered strong results in the 2nd quarter and are well positioned to drive growth in the 2nd half of the year our ongoing focus on cost management and revenue growth has enabled us to deliver strong operating leverage resulting in a 25 increase in adjusted operating income year over year we are also pleased to report that our net income for the quarter was $1200000000 or one67 per diluted share compared to $800000000 or one05 per diluted share in the 2nd quarter of 2020 our balance sheet remains strong with a tangible book value per share of $5279 at the end of the quarter and we continue to generate significant cash flow our revenue growth in the 2nd quarter was driven by strong demand across our businesses particularly in our investment management and wealth management segments in investment management assets under management increased by thirteen year over year driven by net inflows and market appreciation in wealth management assets under management increased by sixteen year over year driven by net inflows and market appreciation we also saw strong growth in our lending and deposit businesses in summary we delivered strong results in the 2nd quarter and are well positioned to drive growth in the 2nd half of the year thank you for joining us today we reported a small net loss for the quarter due to a high level of catastrophe losses as expected and as we expected the loss in our non fixed income investment portfolio dan will have more to say about both shortly our underlying underlying income of $572000000 pre tax is up $254000000 over the prior year quarter benefiting from solid net earned premium growth and a threefive point improvement for the quarter $114000000 of direct losses and $63000000 of adjusted losses some industry observers have speculated about the aggregate level of insured and investment losses arising out of the pandemic we do not doubt the losses will be significant but they will not be borne evenly our manageable covid nineteen insurance losses so far this year are a reflection of our disciplined approach to risk selection as well as terms and conditions and as we shared with you in some detail last quarter we manage our investment portfolio with a similar regard to balancing risk and reward in personal auto we have seen a meaningful drop off in auto frequency although that is moderating as economic activity picks up the same time we have taken into consideration the potential for some offsetting impact in terms of auto severity due to factors such as collisions occurring at higher speeds and driver distraction in workers compensation covid related claims mostly relate to healthcare workers and 1st responders also the frequency of those claims stabilized during the quarter which might be attributed to an improved supply of ppe and the healthcare community having the benefit of more experience with managing covid patients more broadly beyond the healthcare sector data from some of the state workers compensation systems suggests that the covid related claim rate is low relative to the infection rate that is likely partly attributable to the fact that the population most seriously affected by covid nineteen skews older and is not the workforce nonetheless in developing our loss estimates we have taken into consideration the potential for delayed reporting of claims and additional claim activity associated with recent spikes in infection rates as well as uncertainty related to the longer term implications of the disease as we anticipated we have seen an increase in claims activity for states that have effectively expanded the scope of workers comp coverage by creating presumptions of compensability in most cases states have taken a fault based approach protecting workers appropriately but not unreasonably burdening the workers compensation system where states have adapted workers comp to expand compensability we have adjusted our loss estimates accordingly in terms of non covid workers comp losses we have seen a lower volume of workers comp claims this will abate as people get back to the workplace in addition to taking that into account we have contemplated that severity could be adversely affected by injured workers delaying treatment due to the stay at home work environment having said all that our experience is that there is a lower level of workers compensation claim activity associated with economic recessions during periods of elevated unemployment workers tend to be more susceptible to being injured and the workforce tends to be more scarce in management liability as we expected we are seeing the elevated level of claim activity typically associated with stock market volatility and workforce reductions the underlying combined ratio this quarter and bond special fee reflects that as well as other loss activity and we expect the underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at this level or somewhat higher over the near term this is not unlike the experience we had in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago nonetheless we expect the return from this segment will continue to be healthy turning to the surety business we have been pleased to see that work is continuing on the vast majority of construction projects however the depth and duration of stress in the economy continues to be risk factors of the surety business the line will also be impacted by other factors such as the financial strength of the bonded firms as i shared last quarter our high quality surety book was effectively stress tested in the 2008 financial crisis and performed well and our underlying approach has remained disciplined since that time in that regard so far we have not seen anything that has caused us to change our surety loss estimates in terms of business interruption coverages under commercial property policies there is a fair amount of litigation challenging coverage our commercial property insurance policies that include business interruption including as a result of civil authority require losses to be caused by direct physical damage to property from a covered cause of loss in addition our standard policy forms specifically exclude loss or damage caused by a virus the few court decisions we have seen so far one in new york and one in michigan have both upheld the physical damage requirement on the legislative front efforts to retroactively expand coverage for business interruptions seem to be diminishing finally with respect to liability coverages as people shelter in place we are seeing fewer commercial auto accidents and slip and fall type claims anecdotally we are also seeing some movement by the plaintiff is bar to settle claims faster but it is too soon to know how significant that is we are also encouraged by states that have adopted covid related liability protections and similar efforts that are underway in other states and at the federal level we should not let frivolous lawsuits undermine the nation is recovery nonetheless we expect the plants as far as possible to continue to be active turning to the quarter on the top line we are very pleased with our production results excluding the auto prime refunds we provided to our customers our production results are ahead of plan net written premium through by two as the impact of covid nineteen on insured exposures was more than offset by a strong renewal rate change in all three sectors in business insurance we achieved renewal rate change of sevenfour the highest level since 2013 and close to the record level we achieved that year excluding orc renewal rate change was double digits importantly retention levels remain strong in bond and specialty insurance net written premiums increased by three as our domestic management liability business achieved a record renewal rate change while maintaining strong retention in personal insurance excluding the auto premium refund net written premiums increased by six driven by strong retention and new business in both agency auto and agency homeowners in our agency homeowners business renewal premium change remains the same now we hit a record for new business and now at another quarter with a very high level of weather related losses interest rates that are likely to be lower for longer and while it has not been a significant factor for us a reinsurance market that is hardened and on top of that the pandemic and related economic fallout add a sense of incremental uncertainty making the steel like one of those times not unlike in the wake of 911 and hurricane katrina when the market recalibrates risk with that as the background we will continue to seek great games and manage other levers of profitability to improve the outlook for return i will close by saying that i could not be more grateful to my travelers colleagues for their grit and commitment to taking care of our customers our business partners our communities and each other also the work they have done in recent years to advance our innovation agenda has equipped us with state of the art digital tools and other capabilities that make all the difference in this we will well prepare and from here we are well positioned free from financial and operational distractions will continue uninterrupted managing our business and investing for long term success in short we are confident in our ability to continue to succeed through these uncertain times and to benefit from the strength of our franchise as the economy recovers and with that i will turn the call over to dan thank you alan the 2nd quarter was $50000000 compared to core income of $537000000 in the prior year quarter the change resulted primarily from a higher level of catastrophe losses and as expected lower net investment income for the quarter the net impact related to covid nineteen is included in our underlying results not as part of our cat fit here and was modest more on that in a minute our 2nd quarter results include $800000000 this is a message from the united states department of agriculture regarding cat losses as of april 24th 2020 we have accumulated about $1400000000 of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention this compares to only $367000000 in last year is 2nd quarter this quarter is cat losses include severe storms in several regions of the united states as well as $91000000 of losses related to civil unrest regarding our property aggregate catastrophe xol treaty for 2020 as of june 30th we have accumulated about $1400000000 of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention this compares to only $367000000 in last year is 2nd quarter this quarter is cat losses include severe storms in several regions of the united states as well as $91000000 of losses related to civil unrest thank you the treaty provides aggregate coverage of $280000000 or $500000000 of losses above that $1550000000 retention the underlying combined ratio improved by threefive points compared to 94nine in last year is 2nd quarter the underlying loss ratio improved by more than four points and benefited from a lower level of losses losses favorable frequency in personal auto from the shelter in place environment net of related premium refunds and the impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend the expense ratio of 31 is eight tenths of a point higher than the prior year quarter and above our recent run rate this change was as expected due to the reduction in premiums associated with the pandemic is impact on the economy along with premium refunds to our personal auto customers net impact of covid nineteen and its related effects on the economy were modest in terms of our overall 2nd quarter underwriting income our top line was resilient excluding the premium refunds and personal insurance net written premiums increased by two driven by strong renewal rate change in all three segments that more than offset lower insured exposures in terms of operating expenses results were adversely impacted by modest increases in the allowance for bad debt and the approval for supplemental commissions those expense increases however were roughly offset by lower expenses in other categories for example travel costs were down as our employees continued to work primarily from home the economic impacts related to covid nineteen also affected our underlying losses for example losses directly related to covid nineteen total $114000000 primarily workers compensation and business insurance and management liability losses in our bond and specialty business on the other hand we experienced significant reductions in auto claims as there were fewer cars on the road during the 2nd quarter and to a lesser degree recognized a benefit reflecting fewer traditional workers comp claims as more people worked from home as you heard from alan given the uncertainty in the current environment we took a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of covid related losses we have recorded the estimated costs for all losses incurred through june 30th we have incurred losses for which claims have not yet been recorded all losses have been recorded at our estimate of ultimate and the majority of the covid nineteen related insurance losses we have booked in the 1st and 2nd quarters are still sitting in our ibnr reserves we have not recognized losses or benefits from covid nineteen related insurance events that we anticipate will occur subsequent to the end of the quarter taking a step back on a year to date basis the impact on our business has been significant excluding net investment income from covid nineteen and its related effects is a net charge of about $50000000 pre tax speaking to prior year reserve development and personal insurance both auto and property losses came in better than expected for multiple accident years in bond and specialty insurance we saw larger losses than expected in management liability resulting in prior year strengthening of $33000000 largely offsetting favorable development and personal insurance in business insurance there was no net priority or reserve development as better than expected loss experience in workers compensation and commercial property was largely offset by unfavorable results in our other casualty lines each of the movements this quarter was relatively small compared to the reserve pace as you saw in our july 14th press release we expect to record subrogation benefits in our 3rd quarter p yid of approximately $400000000 pretax related to a workers compensation claim as a reminder 3rd quarter p id will also include the results of our annual asbestos review after tax net investment income decreased by 54 from the prior year quarter to $251000000 a somewhat better result than we had previewed in our call last quarter the decrease was driven by our nonfixed income returns where results were for our private equity hedge fund and real estate partnership accordingly the impact of the disruption in global financial markets that occurred in the latter half of the 1st quarter impacted our 2nd quarter results as the broader markets have recovered in the 2nd quarter that should at least to some extent benefit our non fixed income results in the 3rd quarter it is worth mentioning here that recoveries may not be reflected in the private equity and hedge fund results as quickly as the downturn given continued economic uncertainty fund managers who report their results to us may take a more measured approach and not be as quick to write back up the valuations they just marked down particularly in light of what may be continued challenging prospects for the earnings and cash flows of the funds underlying investments fixed income returns decreased by $24000000 after tax as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by the decline in interest rates as we chose to maintain a somewhat higher level of liquidity and held more short term investments than in the 1st quarter of 2020 for the remainder of 2020 we expect that fixed income nii will decrease by approximately 35 to $40000000 after tax per quarter compared to the corresponding periods of 2020 and 2019 thank you we are pleased to report that our ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of slightly more than $2000000000 well above our target level recall that in april we pre funded as we normally do $500000000 of debt coming due in november with a new thirty year $500000000 debt issuance at two55 so our holding company liquidity is temporarily elevated by that amount investment earnings decreased as credit spreads tightened accordingly our net unrealized investment gains increased from $1800000000 after tax as of march 31st to $3600000000 after tax as of june 31st adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $9201 at the quarter end down less than one from year end and up two year over year we return $218000000 of capital to our shareholders this quarter by dividend we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter as we indicated in our 1st quarter earnings call our capital management strategy remains unchanged with the ongoing economic uncertainty and with hurricane season upon us it still feels to us like holding onto a little more capital is preferable to holding onto a little less until there is more clarity on the state of the economy we may buy back some shares in the coming quarters or we may continue to choose to buy none coming back to reinsurance for a moment slide nineteen of the webcast presentation for a summary of our july 1st renewals the structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior year we renewed our northeast cat trade effective july 1st substantially similar terms and pricing that was up only slightly on an exposure adjusted basis our cat bond long point re iii is now in its 3rd year of its four year term in the annual reset for the 2020 hurricane season adjustment from $1790000000 to $1870000000 while the total cost of the program was flat year over year a more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage including our general cat aggregate xol treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our ten q which we filed earlier today and in our 2019110 k we expect to experience the impacts of economic disruption how much of an impact we feel and for how long will depend on the extent and duration of the negative economic impacts related to the pandemic because earned premium typically lives written premium we expect to feel the effects on an earned basis beyond the end of the year alan said last quarter we do not intend to take disruptive expense actions accordingly in coming quarters the expense ratio will likely remain somewhat elevated compared to the corresponding periods of 2019 through the expected impact on earned premiums now i will turn it over to greg for discussion of business insurance as for the quarters results business insurance had a loss for the quarter of $58000000 due to lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses as both alan and dan discussed the combined ratio of 107 one included more than ten points of catastrophe impacted by both weather related losses and civil unrest the underlying combined ratio of 97 improved by reflecting a zerotwo point improvement in each of the underlying loss ratio and expense ratio the net impact of covid nineteen and related economic conditions was modest turning to the top line net written premiums were three lower than the prior year quarter due to the impact of the economic disruption on insured exposures thanks to excellent execution by our field organization these impacts were largely offset by strong renewal rate increases and high retention turning to domestic production we achieved strong renewal rate change of sevenfour while retention remained high at 83 the renewal rate change of sevenfour was up almost four points from the 2nd quarter of last year and more than a point from the 1st quarter of this year notwithstanding the persistent downward pressure in workers compensation prices we continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines other than workers compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the 2nd quarter of last year we achieved positive rate on about eighty of our middle market accounts this quarter which was up from about two thirds in the 2nd quarter of last year importantly we have achieved this progress in a highly segmented manner and with retention remaining strong our rate change continues to exceed the loss trend even after about a half a point increase to our loss trend assumption new business of $473000000 was down ten from the prior quarter new business flow was down which we attribute largely to disruption caused by the pandemic new business was also impacted by our continued focus on discipline risk selection underwriting and prices as for the individual businesses in select renewal rate change was up to two one making the 6th consecutive quarter where renewal rate was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter while retention was strong at 82 the head win for workers compensation pricing is most pronounced in the select business new business was down significantly while the current environment is challenging we are confident that we are well positioned in investing in the right strategic capabilities to profitably grow this business over time in middle market renewal rate change was up to sevennine while retention remained strong at 86 the sevennine was up almost fourfive points from the 2nd quarter of 2019 and onefive points from the 1st quarter of 2019 from the 1st quarter of 2020 new business of $255000000 was down from the prior year quarter driven by both economic disruption and our continued focus on disciplined risk selection underwriting and pricing to sum up we believe our meaningful competitive advantages including our strong distribution relationships and our talent and expertise position us well to navigate through these uncertain times and continue to serve our clients with that i will turn the call over to tom thanks great bonded specialty delivered solid returns and growth in the quarter despite the impacts of covid nineteen and related economic conditions segment income was $72000000 a decrease of $102000000 from the prior year quarter as dan mentioned the combined ratio of 93three the underlying combined ratio of 88 one increased seven one points from the prior year quarter primarily driven by the impacts of higher loss estimates for management liability coverages turning to the top line net written premiums grew three for the quarter reflecting strong growth in our management liability business in our domestic management liability business we are pleased to announce the renewal premium change increase to seveneight this marks the 7th consecutive quarter where rpc is higher than the corresponding prior quarter is alan noted renewal rate change was a record for the quarter while retention remained strong our production results demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy to pursue rate where needed while maintaining strong retention of our high quality portfolio we will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted domestic management liability new business for the quarter decreased $13000000 reflecting the disruption associated with covid nineteen and our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment domestic surety net premium net written premium was down $24000000 reflecting the impact of covid nineteen which slowed public project procurement international bsi posted strong growth in the quarter with record rate in our uk management viability business bond and specialty results remain resilient despite the challenges brought on by covid nineteen these results reflect the excellent work of our agents brokers and employees who have adapted to operating in new ways to continue to provide leading results good morning everyone personal insurance segment income for the 2nd quarter of 2020 was $10000000 down from $88000000 in the prior year quarter our combined ratio for the quarter was 101three an increase of one one points as the twelvefive point increase in catastrophe losses was largely offset by a tensix point improvement in the underlying combined ratio the underlying combined ratio benefited from lower net investment income including the impact of premium refunds of $216000000 net written premiums grew six agency homeowners and other net written premiums were up an impressive thirteen an agency automobile net written premiums were up three excluding premium refunds agency automobile delivered strong results with a combined ratio of 85seven for the quarter the loss ratio improved over twelve points while the underwriting expense ratio increased by about four points the increase in the underwriting expense ratio was primarily driven by the impact of the premium refunds i described earlier improving by eight and fourtwo relative to the prior quarter continuing through reflect improvements in frequency primarily due to fewer miles driven as a result of the pandemic data from our intellidrive auto telematics program indicates miles driven were down significantly from pre covid nineteen levels during the 2nd quarter reaching a weekly low point in early april and partially rebounding as the economy has started to reopen in response to our improved auto loss experience we implemented a stay at home auto premium credit program for personal automobile customers in the us the program provided a fifteen premium refund on april may and june premiums in agency homeowners the 2nd quarter combined ratio was 11399 ninefour points higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to higher catastrophes partially offset the 2nd quarter was our highest catastrophe quarter this quarter we experienced significant storm activity resulting in 34 points of catastrophe losses an increase of 21 points compared to the prior year quarter where catastrophes were relatively low the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 81four down over eleven points from the prior year quarter driven primarily by catastrophe losses good morning this is the annual earnings call the majority of the improvement is due to elevated non cat weather in the prior quarter non catastrophe weather related losses this quarter were also better than our assumptions turning to quarterly production our domestic agency results were solid despite the challenging environment resulting from covid nineteen and its related economic impacts our retention remains strong and new business was added thank you for your time agency automobile retention was 85 and new business increased seven from the prior year quarter renewal premium change was onefive as we continue to moderate pricing given the improved performance in our book over the past few years agency home owners delivered another very strong quarter with retention of 87 and a seventeen increase in new business as we continue to seek to improve returns while growing the business higher new business levels again benefited from the successful rollout of our quantum home twozero product now available in over forty markets during the quarter we continue to deliver new capabilities and products to our customers and distribution partners we introduce quantum home twozero in four new states including california we launched encheladrive twozero which adds distracted driving monitoring to our autotelematics product and delivers significant improvements to the user experience and after reaching our goal of planting 1000000 trees for customer enrollment in paperless billing we extended our partnership with american forests to plant another 500000 trees by earth day 2021 to recap personal insurance is off to a strong start in the 1st half of the year i am proud of our team is efforts to continue to work together to meet the needs of those we are privileged to serve while investing in the business for the future now i will turn the call back over to abi thanks michael before we begin q a there is one topic that we expect might be on people is minds so we thought we would kick off q a by addressing it so before we open up the line i would like to turn the call back over to dan thanks abbie there has been some discussion by industry observers about the timing of the recognition of covid related losses so let me reiterate that our reserves reflect our best estimate of ultimate losses incurred as of the balance sheet date in applying accounting principles we would not record a reserve for a loss that has not yet occurred as of the balance sheet date using auto claims as an example at the beginning of the year we have an assumption as to what our ultimate losses will be however as the year progresses we may gather more information and adjust our estimate accordingly thank you we will see over the course of the year what the average cost of those claims will be but when we report our 2nd quarter results including our balance sheet loss reserves as of june 30th those reserves do not include estimated amounts for auto accidents that will occur at thanksgiving or on new year is eve those would be 4th quarter events accordingly they will be recognized in our 4th quarter results this same principle applies when we consider losses related to covid nineteen while only some losses have been reported to us so far the losses we booked in both the 1st and 2nd quarter reflect our estimate of the ultimate amounts that we will pay for all losses and related costs that have been incurred as of june 30th including those for which we have not yet received a claim in fact as i said earlier the majority of the covid related insurance losses we have booked through june 30th are still sitting in our ibm reserves it is anticipated that 10s of 1000s of new infections are being confirmed in the united states each day it is foreseeable that a healthcare worker for example who to this point has not contracted covid nineteen will become ill from covid nineteen as a result of their job duties in december but again that loss activity will be included in our 4th quarter results we similarly would not advance the recognition of any continued favorability from lower frequency and non emi finally i will remind you that on a year to date basis setting aside net investment income the impact on our results from covid nineteen and its related effects is a net charge of about $50000000 pretax and with that operator we are ready to take questions thank you at this time if you would like to ask a question press star one on your telephone to withdraw your question press the a button please wait while we compile the questions your 1st question comes from michael phillips but morgan stanley please go ahead thank you good morning everybody thanks and thanks for that clarification dan on that last comment that that is helpful i guess that is one of the things i am trying to get a handle on business business insurance and and margins and pricing you know trying to kind of pull out the effect of covid you said covid was pretty modest in the quarter pricing was clearly very strong yeah yeah core margins improved so i guess it is trying to understand does that mean you know and now you give lots of great commentary on from pricing does that mean that the current level of pricing still is not enough to expand margins today or kind of how do we think about that versus the level of conservatism that might be baked into the to the current numbers so at the current levels the you know written rate is is in excess of loss trend so you know looking narrowly at those factors we we are on a written basis expanding margins is that is that what you are getting at but it is yeah it is i guess you know in business interruption you had twenty basis points of improvement so you know not as much as maybe one would expect given the level of pricing and so that is that is what i am trying to get my arms around yeah so you know as always there are a number of factors that are driving the underlying combined ratio in in the quarter and that is true true for any business so you have got you have got weather so year over year that was that was better and and in this quarter sort of within the normal dirt within the normal level of variability we would expect for that you have got the earned impact of rate that as i as i said on both the written and earned basis rate is is ahead of lost trend we have had improved performances in some business you got some some impact of covid it was modest but not zero you know you have got that year over year sort of ongoing carry on impact of of social inflation that i will call old news what you know what we have recognized in prior periods and it continues to roll through so you know those those are you know we are given the relative stability we are not going to quantify the pieces but essentially those are the pieces okay no and thank you that that is helpful thanks alan i guess this is good news did he mention there was anything on the commercial autoside for for pyid and so maybe could you speak to kind of that piece and does that mean that there has been possibly some leveling off of the paid activity that has been part of the concern there michael it is it is dan yeah as we had last quarter so we had some movements in pyid some you know some puts and takes some continued good news in comp some continued pressure in the other liability lines there are ok thank you dan your next question counselor on of ryan tyniek with autoresearch please go ahead hey thanks good morning i just wanted to get a better feel for just you know forget about the net benefit just from the covid just from the direct losses alone or the direct impact what was the the hit that that had in business interruption on the combined ratio business interruption specifically or business insurance zero i am sorry business insurance without without considering the off setting benefits what was just the the direct loss impact or direct loss impact yeah ryan and i understand that we are going to give the pluses and the minuses but within the within the we we told you that there was 114000000 of directly related charges and while that included some some charges for the management liability coverages in bond and specialty the majority of what we took came through business insurance i think in the pre announcement you said it was mostly short tail lines  but so should we take that to me i mean 1st of all outside of the short tail lines are you seeing actual to expected look a little bit better in some areas in terms of frequency and is that not something and if so is that something that you are not recognizing yet you are you are being conservative and waiting to see if that continues to be the case yeah ryan dan again so we are for sure seeing some some favorable indications relative to what you would otherwise expect in this current environment and when we look at that there was too much favorability to simply say zero is the right reaction but as alan said in his comments and as i tried to reiterate in mine i think we have been very cautious in terms of the degree to which we recognize any good news in anything other than the short tail lines but there is some because it is it is very apparent and and then just eleven more real quick i was i guess a little bit surprised exposure growth held in i think especially in select lines retention has only declined modestly yeah how should we interpret that is retention is it capturing cancellations or is that modest dip you know mostly a function of you guys taking more rain i am just trying to figure out how to interpret those numbers that seem relatively modest given what is happening in the macro landscape yeah ryan let me take this is greg let me take both of those in the order that you took number one in terms of exposure change if you are looking at that relative to middle market that is really a product mix dynamic in the select business we have the thrust to the premium is two products cmt and workers comp and the cmt product the rating on that is driven more off the property than the gl and so you know we are continuing to see pricing and inflationary pressure on the property and so there is some inflationary impact that impacts on the cme product and so you do not see as much of a drag on exposure on select that you do on middle market where the gel product is is more on a standalone rated basis and then the retention overall for select you know we we certainly put our our estimate of what we see in terms of you know business insolvencies bankruptcies and that is all inside the the 82 number terry okay your next question great thanks greg if i heard you correctly in your prepared comments you talked about a fifty basis point increase in loss trend and i was hoping you could flush that out a little sure mayor and we we look at loss trend every quarter and in across the full portfolio that is obviously a headline number what we did this quarter is we looked at you know the the impact of the the new economy that we see in front of us we also look at some of the other areas that we think could be impacting us we are still in the process of analyzing that but we wanted to give you a heads up on that social inflation or liability dynamics that dan just talked about when we roll that all up in aggregate we we believe we have got a fifty basis point increase in our loss trend in front of us the thing i would add to that myers is that that is reflected in the you know underlying combined ratio we reported for the quarter as as is a  piece of that that would be catch up from the 1st quarter okay perfect that last point is exactly what i was looking for 2nd question i guess with workers compensation being the most vulnerable to exposure does that impact rate need on the expanse ratio side say the question again i am trying to understand i know that in general worker compensation pricing has been coming down because industry experience has been good but we seem to be seeing a fairly significant exposure unit headwind and i am trying to get my arms around what that implies for indicated pricing yeah you know my there is a the regulatory component to pricing as you know and it tends to be you know a little bit backward looking and it and it sort of factors in the overall profitability of the line which is as you know has been has been very favorable over the years and that will continue to be the case so you know clearly you know exposure will be will be one impact on profitability today which will impact pricing tomorrow but it is really hard to isolate anyone in any one factor in its impact on profitability because you know hey you know everything goes in you have got you know you start with your expiring rate and then you have got you know whatever the rate change is and you have got exposure change you have got you know loss trend things like that so it is definitely a factor it is hard to isolate you know what the extent of the impact is hi good morning could you hear me no we hear you now hi sorry thank you in terms of business insurance i was hoping for the covid nineteen losses and i recognize in response to an earlier question maybe you are not giving just the loss impacts in business insurance specifically by line but could you give us a sense of where you saw the majority of the losses so that is what i had tried to do so we took a 114000000 across the enterprise and direct and direct covid losses none of that was in personal insurance there was some component of management liability within bond and specialty insurance which tom described in going through their combined ratio but the majority of those dollars came through business insurance lisa you asked you for a breakdown by by product line yeah i was hoping by product line even if not in terms of dollars you could just give us a sense of which business insurance product line saw the majority of your covid losses the the largest line for sure is workers comp some some property losses both domestically and and internationally and then dribs and drabs i would say in other lines but those are those are the two drivers with comp by far being the largest at least i would point you to my prepared comments where i where i did share that you know there was a modest net impact when we looked at the offsetting of the favorable frequency on some of those lines also okay thanks and then my 2nd question is maybe a follow up on the prior question on workers comp we have heard  you know few folks in the industry it seems like starting to point towards the bottom of comp in terms of just the pricing dynamics there but if i you know go back to your comments throughout the call it does not sound like you guys are you know thinking that the you know rate declines that we have seen in that business are you know close to coming to an end so if you could just help us think about workers comp in terms of the pricing dynamics there and whether you know we might hit an inflection and i am not just talking 2020 perhaps you know even into 2020 ok that is helpful one last numbers question could you give us you said that they were small numbers but is there could you give us a sense of the dollars in terms of the adverse development within general liability and commercial multi peril in the quarter that we are not going to do that at least they are all pretty modest okay thank you i appreciate the color thank you your next question consul on of david most machete whatever car please go ahead hi good morning dan i guess i yeah i appreciate the comments that you made just before the q a but i guess i am just wondering if if you could give us a little bit more information about the car that you mentioned maybe the type of car or the brand or something like that just wanted to give you a sense of you know how you are thinking about covid related adverse impacts throughout the rest of the year just looking through your portfolio of exposures and thinking how it might be affected by covid even if the losses have not occurred yet in the 1st half and you have the exposure and you think there is a possibility that there could be a loss on it just wondering to get some some thoughts there i figured i would take a shot at that david good morning and tahl let me let me start with that this is anything i will like dan to take it up we are not we are not going to forecast your future losses our obligation under gap is to report you know the the you know incurred and and and unreported losses as of the balance sheet date and that is what we have done it is it is hard to forecast the future there is some uncertainty we do not know the trajectory of the disease we do not know you know when when we are going to have a vaccine we do not know you know what the outlook for the economy is and and frankly it is you know probably the the uncertainties for the economy i think it has had the biggest impact on of the pandemic on on us but i i do think it is relevant to why we pointed it out a few times our our net losses in the 1st half of the year were net charges were about 50000000 bucks putting aside the investment side and and we have you know put up that net number with a with a high degree of caution so i i can not i can not give you a number we you know i tried in my sort of line by line review to tell you some of the details of the financials i think you know it is not it is not irrelevant to that assessment to think about our experience in the 1st half of the year i think that is the right way to think about rate versus trend and that is about ball park i think we would said previously that trend fourfive in bi and we are taking it up about about a half a point in the current quarter but you got to look at that in in relation to the pricing momentum as well and i think brent could correct me if i am wrong but the the pricing momentum you see in in this quarter is is a reflection of is a reflection of the strength of the market and the continued need for rate ok great and if i could just sneak one more in on the the adverse development in general liability i am hoping to get a little bit more color in terms of what you saw in the quarter that i guess wanted you to to make that change because i thought that yeah most of the courts were closed i would think the page would be yeah nothing really accelerated during the quarter or was it more just a view of yeah or was it more just an ongoing review that resulted in the change there yeah so it is more of the latter and remember as we are doing reserve reviews especially in long tail lines like those you are looking more backwards at at your data so the actual loss environment of you know may and june you know we are aware of it but it is not really you do not have enough time to gather all that data and fully factor it into the reserve view that you are making at that time so a little more that is still backward looking in terms of how things have developed say through the 1st quarter hi this is with piper sandler please go ahead  you you took the big ones for me but one just quick one from an investment perspective do you have expectations that we would see increased defaults as well come through and i guess the people see it and realize and is that sort of booked into the investment expectations that you gave us as a quarter as well i am thinking the actual the actual investment the investment bank is expectations are yeah paul and stan you know we gave a fair amount of detail and did a fair amount of commentary on you know the construct of the investment portfolio and in our comfort level with you know the way we thoughtfully invested and and we have given you an update of that investment detail again in the appendix of the webcast presentation this quarter so i would not say more than we said i think last quarter feeling really good about the way we have managed risk on on the asset side of the balance sheet clearly we are aware of and looking and looking at and have a regular process to assess credit impairment and default rates and and all of that stuff is baked into our numbers but it is really it is really not a big big impact on us given the thoughtful investment approach in the 1st place has so as ratings migration had much of an impact yet if at all hi i have a couple of questions one is about the capital calculations for you guys no it has not alright so thank you zero thank you your next question console online with brian merer with uvs please go ahead yes thanks just two quick ones here 1st one what was the impact of premium adjustments on the bi written premium this quarter at comp and san pig i think you are referring to maybe we probably do it at the when the policy period has has ended and we have through up there there has been some there has been some written more requests by customers to do some of that mid term but all of that is baked all of that is baked into our production statistics and the written premium numbers we reported for the quarter and i think we can break out that one piece ok thanks and then the 2nd is a quick question just to understand the fifty basis points of increasing trend in the bi is that inclusive of what you are seeing with respect to covid nineteen and maybe the benefits or adverse stuff you are seeing on covid nineteen or is that more related to what is going on with just general kind of tort inflation and some of the increase you saw in your gll reserves and your ccm reserves i think we consider everything brian and included in there and there are some puts and takes the net of the puts and takes was a half a point increase to the trend right and just on that following on that allen you made some comments about maybe some favorable stuff having to do with the court system as far as some you know early quick settlements but in general the overall trend seems to be up i think you should kind of take on what is going on with tort right now could we potentially see an increase in tort inflation you know as a result of what is going on with covid nineteen yeah i mean i think we we certainly could and that is one of the reasons why we are such big proponents of liability reform i think it is important in terms of making sure we are protecting the nation is recovery from from the pandemic you know i i think you hear a lot of of rhetoric out there on that topic but you know everything everything we see and everything we are anticipating is is in that lost trendum great thank you thank you and we have time for one more question coming from the line of jamie baller with jp morgan please go ahead hi good morning so 1st i had a question on just the commercial auto business if you could talk about what you are seeing in terms of frequency is that picking up as traffic has been increasing recently hi this is greg yeah we certainly have seen some favorable frequency activity as the shelter at home has taken place certainly not to the levels of of personal insurance and just as a reminder in commercial auto it is a little unique we do have layup credits or you know premium credits when there is limited use and so you know there is a slight offset as we see that frequency we have mechanisms to give that to give that back that was the economy is starting to reopen we are seeing that frequency moderate you know i think like many we are looking forward at what rate equities are over time and looking at more traditional mechanisms like rate filings to make sure that rates are in line with loss trend and loss cost and personal autos that the refunds really were a mechanism to respond to an acute an acute issue in the early days of the pandemic that is sort of the way we are thinking about it and then just lastly you mentioned the majority of the covid losses were related to workers comp you did not really mention anything about business interruption and i am assuming those losses were pretty modest but is that more because you have not seen a lot of claims submission or is it just your view you have seen submissions but your view is that those claims are uninsured given the policy language yeah we have certainly seen some submissions and and there is some claim activity around it and and even some litigation around it as as we have noted we have got provisions in our policies that that we think make that coverage inapplicable and so we we do not expect many of those claims actually to pay out it stands one more one related comment to that even where we do not expect ultimately to pay the indemnity on the loss we have acknowledged in our reserves the fact that we will spend some money defending against claims that come in for for business for business interruption i think in terms of claims given what happens in terms of litigation activity or are there other lines where there is not a lot of clarity based on what is happened so far you know i i do not think there is a lot of uncertainty around business interruption i mean certainly there is some because there is some litigation and there is always uncertainty when you have litigation but you know we have we have got the requirement for direct physical damage we have got two courts that have upheld that so far and and we have got a specific virus exclusion in our standard policy forms so we i do not actually see a lot of uncertainty there and we do not expect you know that to be a material loss contributor for us thank you thank you i will now turn the call back over to addie for closing remarks thank you all for joining us this morning appreciate it as always if there is any follow up please get in touch with investor relations and we are happy to answer your questions be well and have a good day this concludes this conference call and now

securities and exchange commission for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward looking statements i will now turn the call over to vince thank you raffi and good afternoon everyone i hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy and we certainly appreciate you joining our call today on today is call we will describe the progress we have made toward achieving our strategic objectives of one advancing the use of dsuvia throughout the department of defense two expanding our business in large customer channels through partnerships three dedicating our internal sales team to the hospital and ambulatory surgery center settings and four in licensing or acquiring additional products objectives one and two allow for near term growth without a significant acelrx commercial investment while objectives three and four will take a bit more time but are expected to have a significant return we have made solid progress both in the 2nd quarter and more recently towards achieving these strategic objectives and building our foundation for growth despite the impacts from the covid nineteen pandemic this progress is highlighted by our successful milestone c approval in april that opens the door for purchases from the us army as well as our recent distribution and promotion agreement with zimmer biomet for dsuvia for the management of acute pain in adults during dental and oral surgeries now as mentioned on our last call in two q we received milestone c approval with the us army for dsuvia is placement in all of the us army is sets kits and outfits or sko is associated with future deployments this approval was the high case and our internal projections with preliminary expectations and initial stocking orders from the us army sko is alone will approximately $30000000 over the next three years we expect to know more about initial year orders for army sko is in the 3rd quarter as the department of defense is going through its budgeting process for its fiscal year that begins on october 1st in addition the department of defense publicly communicated a notice of intent to contract for up to 12200 boxes or 122000 dsuvia single dose applicators which we will expect to be ordered in the 3rd quarter of this year after the request for proposal is issued and closed now this is in addition to any sko purchases which we expect will begin in the 4th quarter of this year we also anticipate dsuvia to be approved on the joint deployment formulary or jdf in the 3rd quarter this approval will be another significant milestone as it expands access to dsuvia throughout the other branches of the military and while the us army represents approximately sixty of the expected deployment opportunity there is still a sizable market from the other military branches upon jdf approval the jtf approval also expands the opportunity for purchases throughout the network of military treatment facilities several of which have already adopted dsuvia on formulary are using it in various treatment settings the opportunity is one strong pillar that will support dsuvia sales growth which is attained with a small infrastructure of just a few account managers and is therefore a profitable avenue for growth similarly we announced our exclusive promotion and distribution partnership with zimmer biomet for dsuvia and the dental and oral surgery space outside the hospital setting this partnership allows us to access the large dental and oral surgery market of an estimated 7500000 annual procedures importantly without additional investments in our commercial infrastructure zimmer biomet dental division is a leader in the dental implant space and has over 250 sales representatives with established relationships who regularly visit dental and oral surgery customers which should accelerate dsuvia is introduction something we could not have done or obtained without an entrenched partner importantly the covid restrictions in oral surgery offices have largely been lifted allowing access for sales representatives so we are very excited about the prospects of this strategic partnership as zimmer biomet who believes dsuvia will provide them with a differentiated offering from which dental and oral surgeons will greatly benefit the training of the zimmer biomet dental sales representatives is currently being organized it will take time to cover the entire sales force but we expect some initial benefits from this agreement in the 4th quarter of this year and we anticipate sales to pick up primarily in q one 2021 as this is the 2nd part of our strategic pillar that supports profitable revenue growth from a large specialized market with a minimal acelrx investment looking forward we see similar opportunities where customers and large specialty markets outside the hospital and asc is can be educated on the benefits of dsuvia through companies that already have a presence in those spaces examples of such opportunities are plastic surgery procedures fertility procedures and ambulance and other emergency medical services and unlike many hospital products such as anti infective or critical care products dsuvia provides a different value proposition and that it can be broadly used across many different medically supervised settings successful partnerships in these specialty market opportunities will strengthen the 2nd pillar and support the dsuvia sales growth with minimal acelrx investment our existing account managers remain focused on delivering long term value from hospital and ambulatory surgery customers these customer segments often take longer to penetrate through the lengthy review periods and complexities in pmt scheduling we were slowed by covid in the 2nd quarter as access to hospitals and asc is was restricted by states and institutions each of which managed access differently but recently access has improved versus the march to june timeframe and while restrictions still exist we are seeing some recovery highlighted by july being our largest month of demand by end users to date during this time we have also had some exciting hospital system wins which we expect will provide some benefit in the 4th quarter as they begin to place orders after they incorporate dsuvia into their protocols and medical information systems one of these wins was a recent expansion to all hospitals within a system after initially being approved at just one location and with use limited to general surgery after reviewing data from the initial trial use of dsuvia which illustrated both patient and economic benefits the pmt committee reconvened and approved dsuvia for formula system wide including its associated asc is with expanded use to all settings within the hospital including the trauma service this is a perfect example of how we see dsuvia being adopted we continually hear from our physician customers about the benefits they observe in their patients with dsuvia and importantly gathering the real world data is key to demonstrating these advantages to other healthcare systems in fact we are excited that data providing evidence of these benefits will be published soon including one manuscript that was recently accepted for publication in a peer reviewed anesthesia journal the economic benefits of distributed to the hospital and the reduction in use of intravenous opioids and other medications will be evident from these upcoming publications we expect this data to have a favorable impact commercially as healthcare providers will finally have relevant real world data to illustrate why dsuvia should be used over some current standards of care as we have said before the acceptance of dsuvia on the formula is an eventual adoption into protocols is a process but based on the real world results from healthcare practitioners using dsuvia who remain confident dsuvia will become a key treatment for the management of acute pain in medically supervised settings again changing a standard of care takes time but we believe health care profe professionals are just now beginning to realize the benefits i will now hand over the call to raffi to take you through the financials thank you vince we continue to remain prudent with our cash as we launch dsuvia we ended the 2nd quarter with $43700000 in cash and short term investments which represents a change of $9000000 from the las 1st quarter of 2020 our net cash outflow for the quarter was driven mainly by our $7300000 of cash operating expenses for combined r d and sg a expenses excluding stock based compensation or $8400000 including stock comp the operating expenses in the quarter included a net benefit of $500000 for the from the receipt of a breakup fee from the touch of phase acquisition net of expenses incurred related to the transaction in the quarter this compared to $11200000 of cash operating expenses in the 2nd quarter of 2019 or $12500000 including stock based compensation decrease in operating expenses in the 2nd quarter of 2020 was primarily due to a reduction of $1900000 in dsuvia related commercialization expenses and a $1700000 reduction in personnel costs we continue to focus on investing in the areas that will have the most positive impact on the launch and remain prudent in our overall cash spending revenues for the 2nd quarter of 2020 were $2900000 compared to $900000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 approximately $2600000 of the revenue recognized in the 2nd quarter of 2020 was attributable to the recognition of previously deferred revenues related to our collaboration agreement with our high volume packaging line that is expected to be installed and operational at our contract manufacturer early next year has been delayed due to travel restrictions from covid we hope these restrictions will be eased later this year paving the way for final acceptance of the equipment which will significantly reduce our cost of production once commercial production is running on this line to meet the timing of volume demands from the dod as well as commercial customers we are evaluating alternatives to accelerate final acceptance tests from the equipment manufacturer looking forward to the rest of the year we are expecting an initial order from the dod as indicated in their notice of intent to contracts which will be converted to an rfp for dsuvia in addition an initial stocking order for army sets kits and outfits is expected in the 4th quarter we have reduced our 2020 quarterly cash operating expenses which are now expected to range from eight to $9000000 excluding stock based compensation or nine to $10000000 including stock based compensation for the rest of the year finally we remain in discussions with our potential out licensing partner for dzuveo in europe and hope to have more to report here in the coming months we are also in discussions with potential us collaboration partners around marketing and distributing dsuvia to other specialty markets such as plastic surgery or fertility services in the us in addition we remain in active discussions on in licensing and acquiring assets that are complimentary to our existing portfolio with the potential to add significant value to the business finally we are still evaluating the timing of our zalviso nda resubmission which we delayed pending further guidance from the fda regarding a potential new opioid product approval framework we hope to have more details on these opportunities in the near future with that let me turn the call back over to vince thanks raffi so to summarize we have successfully built two foundational pillars for further profitable growth with the dod and with the zimmer biomet dental partnership leveraging this success while continuing our push into the hostile and asc markets as we are able to demonstrate the economic and healthcare benefits of dsuvia with real world data that will generate long term value for our shareholders as you previously heard the early feedback from the healthcare practitioners dosing dsuvia is positive we look forward to the publications about the data showcasing dsuvia and the perioperative setting i would now like to open the line up for any questions you might have operator thank you and we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star and then one on your touch tone phone if you are using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star and then two at this time we will pause for a moment to assemble our roster our 1st question today will come from brandon folks of cantor fitzgerald please go ahead hi thanks for seeing my questions and congratulations on all progress in the quarter just three from me today firstly could you just elaborate on the market opportunity for the zimmer is deal i think it was about 7000000000 procedures how many of those procedure procedures do you think are suitable for dsuvia and then currently where are you seeing use in dsuvia and any new areas during the quarter placing orders or seeing use of the product and then lastly sorry i am i am going to ask the question even i know you sort of insinuated that you will update us down the line but with the recent opioid approval does this change your thinking on zalviso or what can you say at this stage thank you so i am going to have pam answer those questions the 1st one is the zimmer biomet opportunity just in general we said about 7500000 procedures eligible for dsuvia but pam can maybe give examples of what those procedures are sure yeah so 3rd molar extractions otherwise known as wisdom teeth extractions dental implants you know bone grafting there there is a number of dental and oral surgery procedures that are commonly performed by oral surgeons and dentists that us use iv opioids and we are really looking to replace iv opioids in that market br brandon so so answering directly your question is all of those 7500000 procedures are addressable dsuvia procedures it is not all dental and oral procedures that is the estimate of what dsuvia can be addressing in the 2nd part of that question brandon if if i recall was where is dsuvia currently dsuvia currently being used again i will defer to pam as she has been working with various specialists around the country su sure dsuvia is being used in ambulatory surgery settings it is being used in procedural suites adjacent to per physicians offices it is being used in emergency rooms so we are seeing a lot of dsuvia use in short term settings also in some interesting medically supervised settings such as fertility clinics which often have to do painful procedures and currently use iv opioids in that setting they are finding dsuvia to be very nice non invasive alternative we also are seeing oral surgery typically as well as in ent procedures so again medically supervised settings covers a wide swath of medical specialties and and we are happy that they have seen the benefits of dsuvia in each of those different areas pam can you also comment briefly on how you are seeing dsuvia used in the short term settings in particular for the same day surgeries and the timing of the dose and why yeah the majority of folks using dsuvia now are giving it a preoperative of about fifteen to twenty minutes prior to incision as they know it takes fifteen minutes to reach that sort of therapeutic concentration and ninety to 95 of the time they are using just a single dose we know from our pk as well as our clinical trials that we get about three to four hours of analgesia with a single dose and in those settings that is really all they need so it is it is looking like a a a very nice replacement for the iv injectable clear of liquid opioids with just a single dose and i reiterate beyond what pam said we are spending our time as a company with our resources in the short term or the same day surgery settings within the hospital asc is what pam mentioned before regarding oral surgery dental surgery use there is plastic surgery use there is fertility clinic use those other uses really help reinforce our strategy because they are large on the diffused and not centralized our strategy to partner with others to penetrate those markets exactly as we did with zimmer biomet that was component two of your question brandon i think component three was zalviso and pam you can comment on that one as well as we are continuing to study the regulatory parameters yeah i think it is still early we have not really had a definitive framework from the fda yet on their evaluation of new opioid products it is unclear whether you know all the was approved under an old framework and sort of grandfathered in and so we are really waiting for more clarity from the fda and specifically the dap division on on a specified framework to you know sort of evaluate new opioid submissions think the good news in that approval is that they are clearly seeing and recognize the importance of opioids in these medically supervised settings and that continues to give us comfort moving forward brandon i hope that answered the three components of your question it does do you mind if i sneak one more and i apologize you just triggered something else just in terms of the feedback you have received from physicians using the product is the onset of action and duration of effects being reported in practice similar to what we saw in the clinical trials and then that is it from me how promise thank you absolutely the the onset of action is very consistent again the sublingual route of administration avoids the 1st pass effect that you meaning it does not go to the stomach and then have to be absorbed and and metabolized by the liver which makes it very erratic onset aside oral opioid medications do not really work quickly or that consistently so from a sublingual onset standpoint it is very consistent and the duration of action is interesting it is actually a little bit longer than you know our clinical trial we did not have a lot of multimodal analgesia we are going up against placebo you try to keep those studies quite clean so in the real world setting you know we have had reports that the duration of analgesia it can even last beyond the three to four hours and has a very nice offset tail meaning that it provides a very comfortable level of analgesia through each discharge with just that single dose yeah i think the general feedback beyond what pam said is that it is actually delivering on the messages we have communicated that onset the duration and as doctors have mastered their art with it bringing it forward in the short term surgeries and procedures has been the absolute key bringing your forward meaning when they dose it and their time to pk to the acute pain to really maximize the product and it is really aligned to use one dose which i think has been the largest surprise to all of them and and and if i could add i think one of the most remarkable things we hear about is a lack of side effects you you know i mean the in the pack using importance time to discharge is sort of a composite measure you have to have your adverse events under control and you also have to have your pain under control to be discharged so the thing that i love about you know sort of time to pack your discharge is it really is a way to look at both and safety at the same time as well as you know making sure safety you are patients including your elderly patients do not have any cognitive impairment and that is a huge part so one of the things we are hearing back in spades from the customers is that that preoperative dose is carrying them through the operation through the pacu many times additional medications are not required at all and they are able to discharge them more quickly because they do not have the side effects from the typical iv injectable opioids that they are often seeing brandon very helpful hope that helps thank you very much thank you our next question today will come from michael higgins of ladenburg thalmann please go ahead my questions have been asked thanks thank you our next question today will come from evan of credit suisse please go ahead hey guys thank you so much for taking my questions a follow up on the zimmer biomet deal what feedback have you gotten from dentists regarding using the product in office are they comfortable storing it in kind of all the necessary infrastructure that they would have to have by having the opioids in stock you know i know that they do use various drugs in the office but just adding another one and then kind of you had mentioned business development any thoughts as to what you are looking for in terms of a target product profile or even more broadly speaking you know what type of patient population how should we be thinking about that thank you so much sure well oral surgeons so we have never marketed to them we sort of received a number of inbound queries when it 1st was approved because they saw the obvious benefits they we are only brand certifying and supplying it to oral surgeons and iv sedation dentists so that means they already have approval and already have the locked see to storage and all the necessary oxygen and medication to treat respiratory depression due to opioids so these are very savvy surgeons who already know how to use iv opioids and they certainly see the advantage of a rapid onset and extended duration sublingual tablet that avoids them having to stop their procedure and redose their iv opioids which they typically have to do multiple times throughout a procedure so they clearly see the benefit and that is again why you know zimmer saw the benefit as well they know these surgeries very well and they know the benefits that dsuvia can use yeah evan just to just to reiterate why why go with zimmer and and we mentioned that these other specialty markets they are large markets but we do not have a large enough salesforce to penetrate like these partners have aa as well as the relationships that that they have built up compared to what we have so we want to focus on the hospital ambulatory surgery center markets with the partners that are already in these we are calling them specialty markets or their specialty for us but not for others but with partners that are already in that space with established relationships with large sales forces and that leads into i think the 2nd component of your question evan which was target product profile as we look at business development opportunities moving forward so for us the biggest key is efficiency meaning or the call patterns within these medically supervised settings where we currently deploy your resources we want to keep them focused where they currently are so whether it is the hospital or the asc or the anesthesiologists in the office suites etc we want to continue to target those the actual therapeutic area is less relevant for us it is more of where they are located for use of these products account overlap is critical and will be opportunistic on a moving forward one of the common themes through all that other than the efficiency is going to be something that is very late term or already on the market we are not looking for long term r d projects okay great thank you so much guys i appreciate the call thank you ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i would like to turn the conference back over vince angotti for any closing remarks thank you operator and thank you all for joining us today and for your continued support of acelrx we feel we are very well positioned for future growth and we look very much forward to sharing more developments as they occur so please be safe and we look forward to giving you updates as they happen thanks the conference has now concluded and we thank you for attending today is presentation you may now disconnect your lines",

reports filed with the securities and exchange commission for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward looking statements i will now turn the call over to vincenzo thank you raffie and good afternoon everyone i hope you and your families are well i hope you have a good day thank you on today is call we will describe the progress we have made toward achieving our strategic objectives of one advancing the use of das throughout the department of defense two expanding our business in large customer channels through partnerships and three dedicating our internal sales team to the hospital and ambulatory surgery center settings in licensing or acquiring additional products objectives one and two allow for near term growth without a significant excelerex commercial investment while objectives three and four will take a bit more time but are expected to have a significant return we have made solid progress both in the 2nd quarter and more recently towards achieving these strategic objectives and building our foundation for growth despite the impacts from the covid nineteen this progress is highlighted by our successful milestone c approval in april that opens the door for purchases from the us army as well as our recent distribution and promotion agreement with zimmer biomet for the management of acute pain in adults during dental and oral surgeries for decisive placement in all of the us army sets kits and outfits or skos associated with future deployments this approval was the high case in our internal projections with preliminary expectations that initial stocking orders from the us army skos alone will approximate $30000000 over the next three years we expect to know more about initial year orders for army skos in the 3rd quarter as the department of defense is going through its budgeting process for its fiscal year that begins on october 1st in addition the department of defense publicly communicated a notice of intent to contract for up to 12200 boxes or 122000 disseminated single dose applicators which we will expect to be ordered in the 3rd quarter of this year after the request for proposal is issued and closed i want to add to any sko purchases which we expect will begin in the 4th quarter of this year we also anticipate the suavi to be approved on the joint deployment formulare or jdf in the 3rd quarter this approval will be another significant milestone as it expands access to the suavi throughout the other branches of the military and while the us army represents approximately sixty of all purchases we also anticipate purchases from other branches of the military there are still a sizable market from the other military branches upon jdf approval the jdf approval also expands the opportunity for purchases throughout the network of military treatment facilities several of which have already adopted the suvia on formula and are using it in various treatment settings the dood opportunity is one strong pillar that will support the suvia sales growth which is attained with a small similarly we announced our exclusive promotion and distribution partnership with zimmer biomet for desuvia in the dental and oral surgery space outside the hospital setting this partnership allows us to access the large dental and oral surgery market of an estimated 7500000 annual procedures importantly without additional investments zimmer biomet dental division is a leader in the dental implant space and has over 200 sales representatives with established relationships who regularly visit dental and oral surgery customers which should accelerate the previous introduction something we could not have done or attained without an entrenched partner importantly the covid restrictions in oral surgery offices have largely been lifted allowing for access good morning ladies and gentlemen i am excited about the prospects of this strategic partnership as is zimmer biomet who believes this will provide them with a differentiated offering from which dental and oral surgeons will greatly benefit the training of the zimmer biomet dental sales representative is currently being organized it will take time to cover the entire sales force but we expect some initial benefits from this agreement in the 4th quarter of this year and we anticipate sales to pick up primarily in q as this is the 2nd part of our strategic pillar that supports profitable revenue growth from a large specialized market with minimal exceleris investment looking forward we see similar opportunities where customers in large specialty markets outside the hospital ascs can be educated on the benefits of desova through companies that already have a presence in those spaces examples of such opportunities are plastic the distribution of fertility procedures ambulance and other emergency medical services and unlike many hospital products such as antibiotics or critical care products distributor provides a different value proposition and that it can be broadly used across many different medically supervised settings successful partnerships and these specialty market opportunities will strengthen the 2nd pillar and support the cvsa sales growth with minimal accelerex investment our existing account managers remain focused on delivering long term value from hospital and ambulatory surgery customers these customer segments often take longer to penetrate due to lengthy review periods and complexities in pnt scheduling we were slowed by covid in the 2nd quarter as access to hospitals and aes was restricted by states and institutions each of which managed access differently but recently access has improved during this time we have also had some exciting hospital system wins which we expect will provide some benefit in the 4th quarter as they begin to place orders after they incorporate the sovient into their protocols and medical information systems one of these wins was a recent expansion to all hospitals after initially being approved at just one location and with use limited to general surgery after reviewing data from the initial trial use of the da vinci which illustrated both patient and economic benefits the pnt committee reconvened and approved the da vinci for formulary system wide including its associated aess with expanded use to all settings within the hospital including the trauma service there is a perfect example of how we see da vinci being adopted we continually hear from our physician customers about the benefits they observe in their patients with desubia and importantly gathering the real world data is key to demonstrating these advantages to other healthcare systems in fact we are excited that data providing evidence of these benefits will be published soon including one manuscript that was recently accepted for publication in a peer reviewed anesthesia journal the economic benefits of desubia to the hospital and the reduction in use of intravenous opioids and other medications will be we expect this data to have a favorable impact commercially our healthcare providers will finally find it relevant real world data to illustrate why dicevo should be used over some current standards of care as we have said before the acceptance of dicevo on the formulas is an eventual adoption into protocols is this process but based on the real world results from some healthcare practitioners using dicevo we remain confident dicevo will become a key treatment for i am going to talk about acute pain in medically supervised settings again changing the standard of care takes time but we believe healthcare professionals are just now beginning to realize the benefits i will now hand the call over to doctor raffi to take you through the financials thank you vence we continue to remain prudent with our cash as we launch decasixia we ended the 2nd quarter with $43700000 in cash and short term investments which represents a change of $9000000 from the last quarter thank you for your time our net cash outflow for the quarter was driven mainly by our $7300000 of cash operating expenses or combined r and d and s g and a expenses excluding stock based compensation or $8400000 including stock comp the operating expenses in the quarter included a net benefit of $500000 for from the receipt of a breakup fee from the tetraphase acquisition this compared to $11200000 of cash operating expenses in the 2nd quarter of 2019 or $12500000 including stock based compensation decrease in operating expenses in the 2nd quarter of 2020 was primarily due to a reduction of $1900000 in desouza related commercialization expenses and a $1700000 reduction in research and development expenses we continue to focus on investing in the areas that will have the most positive impact on the launch and remain prudent in our overall cash spending revenues for the 2nd quarter of 2020 were $2900000 compared to $900000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 approximately $2600000 of the revenue recognized in the 2nd quarter was from the sale of real estate wastributable to the recognition of previously deferred revenues related to our collaboration agreement with grunenthal our high volume packaging line that is expected to be installed and operational at our contract manufacturer early next year has been delayed due to travel restrictions from covid we hope these restrictions will be eased later this year paving the way for final acceptance of the equipment to reduce our cost of production once commercial production is running on this line to meet the timing of volume demands from the dod as well as commercial customers we are evaluating alternatives to accelerate final acceptance tests from the equipment manufacturer looking forward to the rest of the year we are expecting an initial order from the dod as indicated in their notice of intent to contract which will be processed through our procurement system in addition an initial stocking order for army sets and outfits is expected in the 4th quarter we have reduced our 2020 quarterly cash operating expenses which are now expected to range from eight to $9000000 excluding stock based compensation or $10000000 including stock based compensation for the rest of the year finally we have converted to an rfp for the dsv we are also in discussions with potential us collaboration partners around marketing and distributing disuvio to other specialty markets such as plastic surgery or fertility services in the us in addition we remain in active discussions on in licensing and acquiring assets that that we think will be accretive to the company we are still evaluating the timing of our xalvivso nda resubmission which we delayed pending further guidance from the fda regarding a potential new opioid product approval framework we hope to have more details on these opportunities in the near future with that let me turn the call back over to vince to summarize we have successfully built two foundational pillars for further profitable growth with the dod and with the zimmer biomet dental partnership leveraging this success while continuing our push into the hospital and asc markets as we are able to demonstrate the economic and healthcare benefits of desunova with real world data will generate long term value for our shareholders as you previously heard the early feedback from the healthcare practitioners dosing desunova is +and we look forward to providing more updates in the future i would like to introduce you to the data showcasing the decubitus and the perioperative setting i would now like to open the line up for any questions you might have operator thank you and we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star and then one on your touch tone phone if you are using a speaker phone please pick up your hand set before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star and then two at this time good morning assemblywoman rossiter our 1st question today will come from brandon folks of canister fitzgerald please go ahead hi thanks for my questions and congratulations on all the progress in the quarter just three for me today could you just elaborate on the market opportunity for the zoom deal and i think you mentioned total of 7000000 procedures thank you those procedures procedures do you think are suitable for desuvia and then currently where are you seeing use in desuvia and any new areas during the quarter placing orders or seeing use of the product and then lastly sorry and i am i am going to ask the question even and a sort of insinuating that you will update us down the line but with the recent opioid approval does this change your thinking on desuvia or what can you stay at this stage thank you so i am going to have pam answer those questions the 1st one is the zimmer biomet opportunity just in general we said about 7500000 procedures eligible for distribution but pam maybe you can give examples of what those procedures are like sure yes so 3rd molar extractions otherwise known as wisdom teeth extractions dental implants you know bone grafting there is there is a number of dental and oral surgery procedures that are commonly performed by oral surgeons and dentists that you use iv opioids and we are really looking to replace iv opioids in that market and brandon so so answering directly your question is all of those 7500000 procedures are addressable to suavea procedures it is not all dental and oral procedures that is the estimate of what suavea can be addressing and the 2nd component of that question brandon is is where is dissova currently dissova currently being used again i will defer to pamela she has been worked with various specialists around the country sure dissova is being used in ambulatory surgery settings it is being used in procedural suites adjacent to physicians offices it is being used in emergency rooms so we are seeing a lot of dissova use in short term settings also and some interesting  medically supervised settings such as fertility clinics which often have to do painful procedures and currently use ibuprofen in that setting they are finding desuvia to be a very nice non invasive alternative we also are seeing oral surgery typically as well as some ent procedures so again medically supervised settings covers a wide swatch of medical specialties and and we are happy that they have seen the benefits of desuvia in each of those different areas pam can you explain a little bit more about desuvia and what it does also comment briefly on how you are seeing desubox used in the short term settings in particular for the same day surgeries and the timing of the dose and why as well as our clinical trials that we get about three to four hours of analgesia with a single dose and in those settings that is really all they need so it is it is looking like a very nice replacement for the ibuprofen injectable clear liquid opioids with just a single dose there is plastic surgery use there is fertility clinic use those other uses really help reinforce our strategy because they are large they are diffused they are not centralized our strategy to partner with others to penetrate those markets exactly as we did with zimmer biomet that was component two of your question brain i think component three was zalviso and pam you can comment on that one as well we are continuing to study the regulatory parameters yeah i think it is still early we have not really had a definitive framework from the fda yet on their evaluation of new opioid products it is unclear whether you know all the serine was approved under an old framework and sort of grandfathered in and so we are really waiting for more clarity from the fda and specifically the dapp division on  on a specified framework to you know sort of evaluate new opioid submissions i think we are clearly seeing and recognizing the importance of opioids in these medically supervised settings and that continues to give us comfort moving forward bryan i hope that answered the three components of your question it does do you have any other questions similar to what we saw in the clinical trials and their method for me promise thank you absolutely the the onset of action is very consistent again the sublingual route of administration avoids the 1st pass effect that you meaning it does not go to the stomach and then they have to be absorbed and metabolized by the liver which makes it very erratic onset that is why oral opioid medications do not really work  quickly or that consistently so from a sublingual onset standpoint it is very consistent and the duration of action is interesting it s actually a little bit longer than our you know our clinical trial we did not have a lot of multimodal analgesia when you re going up against placebo you try to keep those studies quite clean so in the real world setting you know we ve had reports that the duration of analgesia can even last beyond the three to four hours and it has a very nice offset tail meaning that it provides a very comfortable male of anesthesia through to discharge with just that single dose yeah i think the general feedback beyond what pam said is that it is absolutely delivering on the messages we have communicated that onset the duration and as doctors have mastered their art with it bringing it forward in the short term surgeries and procedures has been the absolute key bringing it forward meaning when they dose it and they are timing the pka to the acute pain to really maximize the product really allowing to use one dose which i think has been the largest surprise to all of them and and and if i could add i think one of the most remarkable things we hear about is the lack of side effects you know i mean the in the pacu the important time to discharge is sort of a composite measure you have to have your adverse events under control and you also have to have your pain under control to be discharged so the the thing that i love about you know sort of a time to pacu discharge is it really the way to look at both safety and efficacy at the same time as well as you know making sure when i say safety your patients including your elderly patients do not have any cognitive impairment and that is a huge part so one of the things we are hearing back in spades from the customers is that that preoperative dose is carrying them through the operation so through the pacu many times additional medications are not required at all and they are able to discharge them more quickly because they do not have the side effects from the typical lytic injectable opioids that they are often seeing brandon very helpful i hope that helps thank you our next question today will come from michael higgins of leidenberg thalmann please go ahead my questions have been asked today we will come from evan seagerman of credit suisse please go ahead i have a few thoughts as to what you are looking for in terms of a target product profile or even more broadly speaking you know what type of patient population how should we be thinking about that thank you so much sure well we are relaying the oral surgeon so we have never marketed it to them but we sort of received a number of inbound queries when it 1st was approved cause they saw the obvious benefits they we are only rem certifying and supplying and iv sedation dentist so that means they already have approval and already have the locked c two storage and all the necessary oxygen and medications to treat respiratory depression due to opioids so these are very savvy surgeons who already know how to use iv opioids and they certainly see the advantage of a rapid onset and extended duration sublingual tablet that avoids them having to stop their procedure and zimmer saw the benefit as well they know these surgeries very well and they know the benefit that it has that it can use markets but we do not have a large enough sales force to penetrate like these partners have as well as the relationships that that they have built up compared to what we have so we want to focus on the hospital ambulatory surgery center markets with the partners that are already in these we are calling them specialty markets there are specialty for us but not for for others but with partners that are already in that space with established relationships and with large sales forces and that leads into i think the 2nd component of your question evan which was target product profile as we look at business development opportunities moving forward so for us the biggest key is efficiency meaning or is the call patterns within these medically supervised settings where we currently deploy all resources we want to keep them focused where they currently are so whether it is the hospital or the afc or the anesthesiologists in the office suites et cetera we want to continue to target those the actual therapeutic area is less relevant for us it is more of where they are located for use of these products account overlap is critical and we will be opportunistic on a moving forward one of the common themes through all that other than the efficiency is going to be something that is very late term or already on the market we are not looking for long term r and d projects ok great thank you so much guys appreciate the caller thank you ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i would like to turn the

participants will be in listen only mode and the conference is being recorded the presentation will be followed by a q a session you can register for questions at any time by pressing star and one on your telephone for operator assistance please press star and zero the conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast at this time it is my pleasure to hand over to doctor detlef trefzger ceo of kuehne nagel please go ahead sir thank you sandra good morning good day good afternoon and good evening to all of you and welcome to the analyst conference on the semi annual half year 2020 results of kuehne nagel international ag our cfo markus blanka and i welcome you from sunny switzerland we published our half year results and the respective slide deck earlier today and as always let us get started on slide three over the 1st year over the 1st half of the year the kuehne nagel group successfully managed to deliver excellent service for customers in the face of an unprecedented challenges posed by the covid nineteen pandemic this started with a very abrupt halt to chinese exports in february followed by lock downs in march and a deliberate pace of day to day recovery thanks to our dedicated colleagues at a seamless transition of approximately 45000 staff to home office in a matter of days our customers faced no degradation of service quality despite extraordinary volatility and demand for essential goods this culminated in substantial market share gains across all transactional business units from a financial perspective the group is performance in quarter two is a testament to our flexible asset light business model and our efforts to optimally variabilize a meaningful portion of our short term fixed cost and looking at those four key figures that are in front of you you will see that the net turnover decreased by sevenfive heavily impacted by an fx effect of fiveninety versus previous year gross profit went down by nineten and the ebit by eighteen down to chf 419000000 in the 1st half of 202 earnings per share landed at chf two58 per share please follow me on the next slide slide four with a couple of details on the group and the business units group earnings for the period of the 1st six months were at chf 309000000 and we generated a strong free cash flow of chf 383000000 looking at the four business units that start with sea logistics we have seen an ebit of chf 167000000 which were 28 below previous year as a result of a shifting cargo mec mix less sme volumes and a positive reefer and pharma development also the demand for rail solution especially at china started to pick up strongly as of june last quarter air logistics an ebit of chf 181000000 has been achieved which is four higher than previous year based on a high demand for crisis goods but also a demand for special solutions such as sea and air volumes which more than tripled in quarter two 202 road logistics ended the 1st semester with an ebit of chf 26000000 all networks were maintained and europe now is slowly recovering while the americas are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic and contract logistics ended the 1st semester with an ebit of chf 45000000 21 below previous year seeing a high demand of essential goods and answering the gross profit decline with strict cost management almost matching the gross profit development on slide six we will discuss briefly the volume development in sea logistics and air logistics please let me start with sea logistics 1st we have a pronounced effort in sea logistics especially on maintaining our own networks in sea logistics especially on maintaining our own network capacity which yielded in significant market share gains across all segments but especially in pharma and reefer and the e commerce segment the cargo mix i mentioned that before showed a significantly lower sme volume and this is a higher yielding as we have mentioned in some of our previous calls the market demand is continuously recovering over the course of quarter two but it is still below previous year let may give you some hints on how market how zero sorry how our volume developed months by months in quarter two we saw april was a fifteen fifteen volume decrease but gaining market share ended our volumes in may by only minus twelve and the june volumes already showed a minus eight volume decrease so gradually we see volumes picking up again but still lower than previous year in total we shipped 217000 teu less in our networks which resulted into elevenseventy reduction in quarter two and a nineten reduction in volumes for the 1st semester 2020 for sea logistics air logistics saw a significantly lower demand for dry cargo and perishables and both are lower yielding as you know a strong demand for essential goods which were higher yielding and mainly produced or operated in a charter or or via charter business because the recovery of belly is not expected to see or show significant effects before quarter four is here the soaring demand for sea and air solutions and also a monthly development that was rather stable by 23 to minus twenty april to june in total the 1st semester a reduction in volume of minus fifteenfive how does this translate now into the unit performance of the business units and please follow me on slide 71st sea logistics mentioned this already two times now for the 3rd time cargo mix with lower sme volumes volume gains in pharma e commerce and reefer and a stable margin development per unit in constant currency on the next slide slide eight you see the details of the development the gross profit mix is the driver of the unit profitability and with an fx effect or a currency effect of six minus six on the unit basis you have or you see a constant development or constant margin per teu per teu in quarter two this year all cost measures were intact and including the tailwind from its fx or from currency we saw a reduction in the cost level per unit as well the ebit per teu is well below our normal ebit per teu but this includes also headwind from currency of six so in total we are at the lower end of the range that we usually pursue the eighty to 100 swiss francs teu ebit per teu but it is eca recovering and we also see some seasonal effects kicking in we are focusing especially in sea logistics on excellent customer service and we have one significant business which already related or resulted in less volume reductions than one might have expected from the market development and quarter two has been stronger and improving months by months with regards to both volume margin and profitab unit profitability slide nine air logistics the general cargo volume declined significantly i will comment on this on the next slide and the demand for higher yielding crisis goods has soared the market demand has been much weaker in quarter two as anticipated we have to say the regular dry cargoes or the general cargo the normal cargo that we transport especially in the belly capacity has been down by minus forty to minus fifty and this has been offset by crisis volumes essential goods but not only crisis volumes essential goods but not only ppe but also packaged foods foo packaged food as well as e commerce volumes went into into that segment perishables were down in april and may but the recovery started already in june and we also see hard cargo or general cargo coming saint back step by step as of june this year we had a spike in charter business while belly was not existing which led to unit figures that are skewed by a different way of producing air logistics and our unit yield as you can see is clearly above our normal range of seventy to chf 85 per 100 kilo per ton sorry no per 100 kilo for for the normal volumes transported in our earning books the unit ebit is also above normal despite higher currency headwinds and this marks a fifty increase in quarter two versus previous quarter due to the beneficial volume mix the cost consciousness also in this business unit as well as the 1st airlock efficiencies that we have seen kicking in into that segment slide eleven a short overview on road logistics europe is slowly recovering while the volumes in america stay at a low and very low level at the moment this is true bo for both intermodal as well as truck brokerage we have seen slide twelve now we have seen a faster massive deterioration of volumes in europe at the start of quarter two and i think we mentioned that when we when we had our quarter one analyst call with you and the order of the the order of magnitude has been higher than fifty volume reductions but that was true for 23 weeks only and we see a steady volume recovery step by step especially in domestic transports in europe at the moment us followed with a sharp volume decline end of april and especially intermodal more or less collapsed and we see a steady recovery in june since june in europe and a stabiliza stabilization on a low level in the us at the moment international and cross border which is a higher yielding business those transports are still lagging but also here we see volumes coming back all our networks have been maintained and we are ready to deal with the cargo kicking in and in some markets i will not say the geography we have even had to reject certain volumes because our networks were filled again in june that is true for domestic transports we saw a very strong growth in bookings on our digital road platform called etrucknow and we have been able to roll this out even in a in a virtual environment over the last couple of months in many asian countries and we see the volume soaring in on that platform at the moment while ebit was 42 below previous year we generated a positive ebit of chf 26000000 and in our best case scenario we would not have expected a a positive quarter two in road logistics given the character of our networks so we are very proud of what has been achieved here conque countering volume reductions with cost measures slide thirteen contract logistics and as i say contract logistics showed high resilience and it showed two faces the ugly face if i may say so was industries that clearly were downtrading automotive and industrial to name two and we had complete shutdowns by customers and sometimes by governments in those industries for 2346 up to eight weeks and some of the volumes have not recovered even to a sizable level again than prior to the crisis and there was a couple of nice faces that we saw or up trading industries the pharma and healthcare industry up trading industries the pharma and healthcare industry the industry for essential goods which is packaged food and food and and consumables and also e commerce and here the volumes were well above seasonal peaks and we had extra shifts that we had to introduce especially on the weekends to cope with the soaring and spiking demand ninety or up to 85 to ninety of our sites remained open throughout the whole crisis and currently we only have twelve sites that are still closed out of more than 600 sites globally so we see a clear confirmation that fifty of our solution portfolio is related to essential goods and this demand has never stopped or has never been reduced some details on the contract logistics business unit on slide fourteen the implementation of the covid nineteen sops our operating procedures across all operation were introduced but they also added a lot of cost and a lot of efficiencies while we were doing everything to protect our staff we lost clearly efficiencies cleaning disinfection between shifts no overlap of shifts anymore segregation of workflow between shifts led to a lower productivity and higher cost obviously but the excellent the excellent cost management that contract logistics introduced immediately while the crisis becoming one so as of february clearly showed progress and we were excluding the pressure from the exchange rate we were able to counter the top line revenue pressure with cost measures almost entirely and and there is a for for such a huge business unit employing so many people that is a a huge effort and a great result so the high portion in our solution portfolio of essential goods short high resilience and the lease that is largely backed by contracts with customers back to back so we have more than fifty of our sites are so called dedicated sites so we were not exposed to to an over proportionate lease without any activity in too many sites nevertheless we we saw a development end of quarter one and early quarter two but if you look into the figures the overall performance including the fx effect it is only eleventhree lower net turn over and in ebit almost on the level of previous year quarter two and having said so i am happy to hand over to my colleague markus to lead you to through the key financial figures thank you very much detlef welcome to all participants also from my side a very special 2nd quarter indeed a time that was characterized by unusual business pattern i think we had quite some opposite focus on or business management focus on in the business units airfreight can be can be described by just make it happen at times where our customers as much as on the carrier side i think a lot of creativity was being required to make things happen on the other side as detlef mentioned in contract logistics clear focus on on cost containment and cost management so a lot of times we have been confronted with the fact that traditional kpis key performance indicators had been not extremely helpful we needed to look differently at the business because it was a very special situation but and i want to lead you on to page number sixteen i think the result ultimately was a quite good one and when you look at the magnitude of impact with such a unusual business can happen is when they look at the gross profit development from the se from the 1st and to 2nd quarter to compared to last year we have actually lost in the 2nd quarter chf 265000000 gross profit compared to last year that is threefive times more than in the 1st quarter however on an ebitda level we actually have been at the same even better level the than compared to to the 1st quarter so we only if you like still a big number but this quarter so we only if you like still a big number but only have a reduction in ebitda of chf 30000000 out of a gross profit reduction of 26 so there is quite a lot of the cost contained and the cost management in between that i think you can you can appreciate was was quite a piece of hard work to to get that done going further down in the p l of course on an ebitda level yes we are around eighteen behind last year on a half year basis so 900000090 of which and that is not an excuse just the fact of around 20000000 are coming out of out of foreign currency exchange so chf 70000000 from an operational perspective redu reduction versus last year so in relative terms i believe the 2nd quarter and that is also very apparent was even better than the 1st quarter page number seventeen let us talk about air and seafreight in that context the etouch project and the automation initiatives behind that we have presented the potential of the etouch initiatives in in commercial terms at our full year 2019 presentation so what you see here is merely an update where we stand it is not the new assessment of values it is just an update on progress and i think you can appreciate we have set the baseline in many areas in airfreight and our operating system airlog is is fully rolled out in 2019 which is a prerequisite for many of the etouch initiatives not all of them but many of those and you can see despite the fact that q two has been a challenging environment to put through projects but we have continued to drive etouch initiatives and we made pretty good progress at least in one of the five core areas the one that is customer booking and order entry i think the message here is yes do not extend expect any miracles right now in a current situation with still over a good three months people are working partially from home partially just what i said trying to keep up service in an in an excellent manner but some of these projects have a slight delay the message that i want to give you here is etouch is on track page number eighteen balance sheet i am only going to talk about 34 components of course some of them housekeeping 1st one trade receivables biggest item on the balance sheet threetwo 3300000000 by the end of june 2020 compared to 3600000000 not surprisingly again here we we see a position where business volume has reduced slightly and you know it is a function basically of rates and and volume and of course a currency impact also on that on that position that is reducing the overall demand secondly and arguably more important cash and cash equivalents i think our balance sheet is strong with a with a gross cash position here of nearly 1200000000 translated into net cash of around 760000000 which compares to roughly 900000000 respectively 480000000 by the end of the 1st quarter 202 so simple terms a very good development in cash generation in light i think of the decision and you have read it in the in the news today in light of the decision to propose the distribution of a dividend to the shareholders of for swiss franc we have calculated a pro forma net cash position at that point in time and that would still be positive with 280000000 just as a housekeeping topic here you are aware that we have a revolving credit facility available to us which is entirely undrawn so nothing has been used so far in the extent or at the frame of 750000000 coming back to the next item on the balance sheet asset held for sale also here information purposes this is the value that we have or or that is the scope of the business that we have signed a contract of divestments with the xpo you can see a very transparent asset held for sale you can see a very transparent asset held for sale 400000000 liabilities associated with these assets held for sale thirty so the net asset value of that business to be carved out is around 100000000 equity ratio i am sure you have already calculated that yourself from december 23six an increase to 25nine so i think the solidity of the balance sheet is also in these rough times and unusual times a benefit nevertheless balance sheet is one thing cash is cash is king so main topic cash going swiftly to page number one operational cash flow you can see that here in the 1st half 2020 at around 804000000 similar level than last year with with around 800 872000000 however when we go down a little bit and look at the total cash and cash equivalent situation we have an increase on the cash balance of around 666000000 be reminded at that point in time that included last year a dividend payments to the amount of 720000000 so comparatively at similar level free cash flow generation really what we are looking at very resilient the free cash flow generation also in the 2nd quarter so i am talking 2nd quarter not half year in the 2nd quarter of 227000000 which compares to 223000000 so let us talk about crisis or a non crisis free cash flow generation has been at the very same level as as as last year excluding some of the disposals and this gives you a bit of an idea on how much extraordinary components are in there excluding the disposals the underlying free cash flow for the 2nd quarter was still 22 so the the the the swing that we talked to you to disposals is a very negligible i think 6000000 out of the free cash flow for everybody who runs some of the models i think you can see here from the investing activities the cross capex the run rates or the capex that we spend into the business is currently aiming at around 200000000 on an annual basis which is which is significantly lower than we had it seen over the last couple of years some of the some of the drivers of course is the contract logistics disposal of the of the of part of the uk business at the same time we are also very diligently working on the usage of long term leases according to ifrs sixteen rather than outright purchases looking at the pattern in time so the the trajectory of the free cash flow i think when you look at the curves under page nineteen on the right side there is no reason to believe that that should look differently at least in the in the 3rd quarter than it was last year again be reminded in the 4th quarter we had some extraordinary impact in 201 so we should expect a more even development into the 4th quarter also for 202 going to page number twenty and i only touched the accounts receivable quickly on the balance sheet when i when i talked about the balance sheet here you see trade receivables have decreased over a year over year by around 400000000 reasons that i mentioned already trade payables are around 260000000 so our net working capital is down around 146000000 what is more important our kpis and dsos and dpos we were able to keep especially on the dso sides days of sales outstanding a number around 54 five so we have a deviation of zerofour days many questions coming along our away obviously in is there pressure from customers on extended payment terms yes there is very clear yes there is but i think we will see more pressure coming into 3rd and 4th quarter we are we are holding up quite well i think service is one of the one of the important arguments to to maintain the dsos at the same time i think our focus moves towards the risk profile behind the counterparties i do expect i do expect going forward for the next two to three quarters an increase in the risk two to three quarters an increase in the risk profile on counterparty risks so nothing bad happened so far i want to underline that it is it is no no big defaults or anything like that but i would expect that the pressure is also here getting higher until the end of the year and maybe into the 1st half year 202 return on capital employed page number two page number 21 you see that little inflection point that we had here from sixty up to 66 six and i think that was a that was a good sign so now we see a little bit the the the the covid nineteen effects that had that pushes down to 62 again very clear and i just wrote it for for for clarity just decided the sudden decrease of the profitability that we have seen also on the p l on a very similar asset base is obviously mathematically leading to a bit of a bit of an a compression on this one however from a target perspective we maintain our financial our financial targets with around seventy return on capital employed that should be possible the good news and at the same time i think the expected also from some of you news is on the next page page number two dividend proposal just to put also some clarity around conversations we had over the last years you know that we never had a formal written dividend policy as it is all decision making power remains with the board of directors and the general assembly that having said the actual payout ratio in the recent years was always consistent with also our verbal communication to a distribution of around 75 of the net profit after tax clearly now the bod is proposal is based on on the assessment of the market conditions and also the group is performance and likely ongoing performance and as you can see here the proposal to the annual or the the extraordinary general meeting on september two will be to pay out a dividend of chf four financial targets and the last slide from from my presentation i think you see on the left side the group financial targets conversion rate eleven to sixteen i think everybody is clear one of the main drivers etouch return on capital employed i just spoke about it i think when we come back to regular profitability based on our asset base seventy is is in reach working capital intensity i want to talk about that 1st working capital intensity currently at threenine and you might have noticed i have intentionally widened a little bit the corridor from top end fourfifty to five for a simple reason because i believe that is anticipating a reflection of pressure on counterparty risk and potential dsos for the next four quarters tax rate tax rate i think very important to look at this one it is a housekeeping topic for you also to update on your models we expect a group effective tax rate of around 24 to 26 up from around 24 to 25 as per our latest communication this is just reflecting the current shift in the business and geographic mix so just that you are not surprised on your models right side the four business units you see the 1st line our our actual performance in volumes but underneath the the part that everybody was really waiting for that is the update on the market expectations for 2020 and the outlook and as you can imagine i think we are in line with many of our peers we are not giving any you know the i think the performance that the group has shown so far gives us a certain confidence in our ability also to manage through what we believe is going to still be a volatile and highly uncer we believe is going to still be a volatile and highly uncertain market also for the rest of the year and as the market outlook remains extremely uncertain to us as well we offer again no explicit financial guidance for the group nor volume guidance until the end of the year very sorry for that but at the current stage you will have to or we will all have to live with guess working and a bit of color of what we said on our past performance with that little lack of outlook i will hand over to detlef and thank you markus and the lack of outlook maybe marks the whole year because in the pandemic we have to fly on site that is the saying we have as far as we can look ahead we initiate measures and activities and the rest is agility adaptivity to a situation that you can not really predict on slide 24 i want to make a couple of remarks logistics is and will stay people is business even in a more and more digital environment and we have embarked on this route our roadmap 2022 which started in 2018 and we are in the middle of that roadmap roadmap deployment plans customer technology and people and we believe that the covid nineteen pandemic in the last six months has clearly shown that we have embarked on the right strategy we stayed fully operational throughout the crisis and continue serving our customers with our high quality services throughout the world and i would heartily like to thank our colleagues for their commitment and passion and to our customers for their trust and loyalty thank you without you the 1st semester would have looked differently and that is the energy and passion of the best logistics team in our industry and having said so i would like to hand over back to sandra to open q a we will now begin the question and answer session anyone who wishes to ask a question may press star and one on their touch tone telephone you will hear a tone to confirm that you have entered a queue if you wish to remove yourself from the question queue you may press star and two participants are requested to use only handsets while asking a question anyone who has a question may press star and one at this time the 1st question comes from daniel roeska from sanford bernstein please go ahead gents good afternoon thanks for taking the question three if i may could you elaborate what is enabling the market share game especially during a crisis like this one in your view and kind of who is losing it and then how much of that market share gain will you be able to retain kind of as things move more back to normal you also talked a little bit about your cost reduction efforts and in today is report you showed about 87000 employees down from about 98 last year at the same point now how much of that decreased kinda le let us call it a rough 10000 employees is driven by the temporary furlough programs and how much due to actual sustainable reductions that then will benefit you kind of as you ramp back up and tying this also to etouch back at the financial year logs you talked about 20000000 annualized savings so far any indication on how this has progressed in the past six months and you know do you expect that the automation will enable you to keep staff numbers lower as volumes go back up or how are you thinking about kind of really driving etouch through the business thanks thanks danny let me answer those questions let me start with the latter one because we have alluded to that a couple of times it is not about staff reduction etouch is enabling us to do more business and to drive business segments or growth in business segments with a traditionally lower margin but with the high conversion rate still very attractive to us and that is etouch market share gains we have mentioned that we were able to gain market share because we changed the whole organization into addressing actively customers after easter so we were engaged with all existing customers and potential customers target customers as we call them and we had interaction virtually with all of them couple of times throughout the week and months and we want business we want business without having met the customer physically and we were winning business because we were operational and many of our mid sized and smaller competitors who are not operat of our mid sized and smaller competitors who are not operational they struggled to keep operations up and running so that also would allude to answering your question who lost the lower part of the pyramid is the one that is under highest pressure technology connectivity and also functionability of operating systems is a big challenge for many of them and especially in a unprecedented situation that we all went through worldwide over the last 34 or five months that proved to be a big risk and a big problem because you could not overcome any of those deficiencies by just calling someone or going somewhere you had to prove your systems and technology are working how much can we retain i would say we we we convince our customers by quality we do not convince by price we are a quality surpri supplier and the customers that have made the experience over the last six months or in the past in general they stay with us we have a lot of customers that we retain because of our high quality service and that is part of our roadmap 2022 strategy customer excellence it is at the center of all the topics we do we do not want to win transactional business just for the sake of winning it for and operating it for twelve or three months we want customers to stay with us and see how much of our solution portfolio can generate benefits for them cost reduction efforts i think we have made a lot of efforts with all the programs that are in place but not only we have optimized our workforce we have reduced capacity where required but we shifted capacity to those operations sometimes in the same city or even the same warehouse where demand spiked so there is no rule we have only a few temporary labor i think it is 2000 a bit more than 2000 temp labor less than we had a year ago and this is driven by the effect that we see much higher demand still in some of the essential goods segments especially pharma healthcare and e commerce and this is from our point of view sustainable volume this will stay so in in different words daniel i would say we made a organic growth experience compressed in five months maybe or four months that we usually would have gone through and our customers in a period of eighteen months and i would say that is to a large extent sticky and stays and will not be reversed right thanks the next question comes from sathish sivakumar from citigroup please go ahead yes thank you good afternoon detlef and markus thanks for taking my questions i have three questions firstly could you please elaborate on volume trends through the quarter from smes which markets are actually seeing weakness versus the relative strength secondly in 2019 on your sg a expense was around chf 445000000 so could you please update on the current run rate on sg a finally what has been your workforce return rate from remote working across the markets can you repeat the last question please i i did not get it in terms like in terms of yeah workforce returning back to office what has been your return rate so far across key markets okay so volume trends which markets saw as you know the whole pandemic started mid of january already in in asia and usually this is not an sme market or we are we we have a much higher portion of of blue chip customers there but in europe it is mainly the sme customers that dropped out of business very fast and the recovery is starting or has started now in june i would say so the 1st sign of a recovery of sme customers has been seen in june in europe and partly in in other markets but mainly in europe and this this will take time it will not come overnight at the moment the pandemic is is hitting the americas and we see that we are have still volumes that are down and not recovering but here i would say it has bottomed out so we are more positive today than we were three months ago when we discussed the quarter one results i would say despite regional and local setbacks this pa regional and local setbacks the pandemic is not over but we have all managed and understood how to handle it and governments have initiated enough protective health measures in order to secure the people and make them continue consuming the sge run rate it has a lot of components and it starts with travel for example i do not expect travel to come back this year to say this clearly intercontinent nental travel i would not expect to see any of the flights intercontinental risk kuehne nagel stuff on it before september if at all and and then we have made such a positive experience on winning new customers and and and such a positive experience with winning customers and so on online and virtual only that you could say every 2nd trip can be spared in general moving forward and then we have a currency effect here as well there is a a currency effect in sge because we translate everything into into hard currency swiss franc and and that has an effect in itself as well i hope that answers your questions okay yeah the next question comes from david kerstens from jefferies please go ahead thank you good afternoon gentlemen three questions please from my side 1st on on sea logistics it turns out that the volume development is is better than expected as the quarter progressed i was wondering did you see a notab noticeable impact from a shift from from air to seafreight due to the lack of capacity in in airfreight then secondly in in air logistics you you benefited from i think in constant currency a 34 high yield and now with the airfreight market starting to normalize again would you expect that that airfreight yield also normalizes back to the range that you indicated in your presentation of seventy to chf 85 per per 100 kilogram or do you expect to be able to continue to to do to do better than this range and then finally on on road logistics i think the organic revenue was down twenty in the 2nd quarter but that is a mix of of europe and and north america can you provide some color on how weak north america really was and with a decrease of twenty does it still imply that you gained market share in the 2nd quarter because of things some of your peers refer to the market down only fifteen in the 2nd quarter thanks very much sure david so let me answer your questions sea logistics yes we had a better volume development than expected but any shift from air to sea is insignificant for sea sorry for saying so yeah one freighter has 100 has 100 kilos and 100 tons and we are talking about i do not know 68 containers so it is a different business model you can not compare it but what we saw is and that is a good combination i mentioned it is the air sea combination yeah so yeah you go into dubai via sea and then you go into final distribution even to south america via air and this combination this solution is in in light of the lacking supply side of freighter capacity especially in china got a lot of tailwind and i mentioned that our volumes here spiked more than three times the normal volume that we see so this combination showed a certain progress air logistics i think i mentioned that during the presentation we expect especially in the 2nd semester that higher yield was a very special or was was a result of a very special supply and demand situation in quarter two and that the normalized yield of seventy to chf 85 per 100 kilo will come in or will kick in again gradually not overnight and not on a on a fingertip but gradually road logistics i think our comps are we we have so many different figures in the market and not being able to predict even what has happened or described really what has happened is i think what we have to all all of us have to be very careful with let let me describe a a situation that we experienced in europe and then i come to the us europe we have volume reductions of fifty sixty within weeks this happened in the 1st 123 weeks in april but then this bottomed out and the recovery gradually started already as of may so the figure you see is an average figure as of may so the figure you see is an average figure of a volume development that had a lot of slumps and spikes and a lot of of shifts over the last week at the moment i or we all believe that the volumes are gradually coming back and they stay it is not a one time shot and in the us i think we are still on a very low level but as i mentioned it has bottomed out so long story short it was a disaster and it is recovering okay great thank you very much you are welcome the next question comes from sam bland from jpmorgan please go ahead afternoon can i ask i think three questions please the 1st one is on the seafreight conversion rate that is held up pretty well but i guess there was not very much you know there was not any benefit from etouch in that segment so just be interested in you know did you do any sort of cost savings programs in seafreight or what what helped the conversion rate in the quarter 2nd question is on i think there was 57000000 of employee government support in the quarter could you just talk about roughly which which divisions that came in was it mostly in contract logistics and could you see that support be withdrawn before the market recovered back up to normal rates so there is basically a lag and and your your profitability is impacted by that and the last question will just be an update on on m a plans obviously you paid the dividend it should be read into that that any m a ambitions are a bit a bit less in the short run or or you still got plenty of time now to look at that thank you okay sam by the way guys you can also ask less than three question it is not a standard routine that you have to ask three questions only as as as assorted to you so see we have cost savings in place and there is no etouch yet because as mentioned many times the prerequisite is the fully deployed new transport management system called sealog as a basis for running sea logist etouch activities in sea logistics the government programs that you allude to eighty 85 is related to contract logistics but people were out of work so as volumes are coming back also in the normal operation people are in employment and we pay them so that is not the point we avoided to lay off people which is beneficial for our staff and also for for the government related to this so the business the operational run rate of contract logistics has been extremely strong although restructuring measures showed the desired effects and we will see in the 2nd semester when things are cleaning up more and more especially in the quarter four figures how strong contract logistics will will phoenix like come back out of all the restructuring activities and your question related to m a ambition i am a bit surprised because our proposal dividend proposal has not changed to the one that we made prior to covid nineteen so when we posted our annual results 2019 there was a dividend proposal of chf four per share and cautious as we are we postponed a decision on this and did not decide on a dividend given the unsecurity and predictability of the pandemic and now as we see that cash flow is strong and we weathered the situation strongly we are we are in a situation that the board of directors decided to propose for the gener to propose the same dividend again for the general assembly our m a ambition ambition our m a strategy has not changed at all but physical beatings in asia are restricted at the moment so whatever we do is based on video calls okay understood thank you you are welcome the next question comes from mark mcvicar from barclays please go ahead hello mark mark hello hello you were shocked why i said less than three questions mark yeah no please go ahead but based on on that i want to get off to two questions you will be pleased to hear okay we very good just just for variety really so just just to come back on on the airfreight and capacity question could you give us a sense for how much of your airfreight in q two went in freighters rather than belly hold and and do you see that changing significantly in certainly in q three and maybe even into q four because my sense is that you know the airlines are bringing back q four because my sense is that you know the airlines are bringing back capacity but much more of it is short and medium haul rather than the long haul stuff which is typically what you use exactly so whatever belly comes back at the moment it is short and medium haul and that does not help us i mean usually that is not where we where we transact the majority of our business yeah so i would expect in the 2nd semester sixty to seventy of all volume to be transported with freighters main deck capacity yeah and belly will not recover too soon i would say it will take maybe two years that we see a significant network activity which allows for belly using belly capacity again yeah yeah and i and i and i supposed that and and that is that is not yeah go ahead sorry the the the sixty to seventy that you think is going to go in phases in the 2nd half when compared to what ninety 95 in q two because there was so little belly capacity around yeah i i i am not sure so this this is no so the no no mark i am i am not sure end of this year we will have sixty to seventy of the belly capacity that should be back zero okay but we will still rely we will still rely on freighter capacity to a major major extent and that will gradually transform or or change throughout quarter three and quarter four so we are talking end of the year while that is at the mo at the moment i think it is ninety if i am not mistaken or quarter early quarter two middle of quarter two the majority almost all is freighter capacity so we have a lot of belly still in north america or the americas which can be used and we use partially belly capacity for perishables out of african countries yeah so so when you talk about the gp normalizing or coming back towards the the longer term range that is much more than mix because i guess the like for like gp from using a freighter is not going to be different in august than it was in april particularly right absolutely yeah yeah it is the mix clearly yeah okay and and the the the 2nd question a straightforward one could you just remind us where you stand on sort of credit insurance on the on on debt just how much you use it thanks mark that i also got a question once so very good yey no credit insurance a very interesting topic right now and without disclosing too much details you know that we work with the the two main credit issuers on a global basis there are a lot of conversations going on right now i do not want to say that insurers have all the similar patterns of obviously when a when a business goes well there is a lot of insurance coverage available when business goes not so well it goes down very quickly but we are we are having a good partnership with them and and we try to manage as much coverage as possible as i said in my presentation until now no significant defaults or fall outs or bankruptcies or anything like that however there is you know the horizon is a bit darker than what it usually looks like so there is a lot of caution as going forward how much we pay you can see that of the of the annual report we pay every year around 3500000 to 4000000 on insurance premium i think that is given our sales ledger of more than 3000000000 a reasonable number when you assume that around seventy of that is being covered yeah and and but but broadly as you go into the 2nd half your level of cover is unchanged yeah our level of cover is on a total number probably unchanged when you look into some of the industries it may vary like aerospace industry might actually be reduced a little bit some industries will be increased but overall the rates profile is shifting within the industries but overall remains very stable okay lovely thank you both very much yeah you are welcome the next question comes from glynn neil from credit suisse please go ahead hello so nei neil from credit suisse hi if i can ask 1st the another question of markus if  if that works to give you another opportunity markus if  to give you another opportunity yeah thanks neil much appreciated yeah my pleasure and and then i will have one for detlef too if i may  keep keep it to two so so the 1st one markus you have obviously spent some time talking about working capital and increasing risk to some of your sme customers just wondering as it pertains to seafreight and the negative mix effect on gp per teu as you plan beyond 2020 do you plan for a smaller proportion of smes relative to normal or how do you think about that and as it relates to gp per teu over the medium term and then the 2nd question and i guess it could be for either of you just following on from the airlog comments on how it is evolving and obviously sealog is to come how relevant is this to your m a ambitions that you obviously outlined to an extent of the full year i guess on one hand optimization of those two tmss might be ideal before any major transaction but is that the way you think about it or or is that something that will ultimately take care of itself if you find the right deal in advance okay maybe neil i will take the latter question if you if you do not mind 1st of all we concentrate on our own business and optimizing our own business based on airlog and followed by sealog and the etouch ability of that business make etouch happen and and we make progress here we are in in airlog logistics as we as we have pronounced m a is independent of this this needs cultural fit we are looking for access to certain asian customers a solutioning that is not yet part of our own solutioning maybe so there are a lot of other criteria and yes it would be much easier to transfer a acquisition directly on sealog to to name this then on our current legacy system but if that would be needed we can do so as well i mean we have proven that this is not a big exercise for us so that is not a criteria that would influence our m a approach or delay any m a it is more getting acquainted to those ha i mean targets and also building up a basis of trust and that needs physical personal meetings and you can not do this via via via video calls we also we always said when we announced this because there were rumors in the market we always said it is a two years exercise it does not happen overnight but we make progress we never stopped we did not change approach so from that point of view i am quite confident that eventually we will be able to announce the right or the right acquisitions so neil then on the 1st question i i think it is interesting angle that you come from on the working capital and the risk profile to the sme i i think we see now the smes volumes coming down in the diff in the 2nd quarter just for a simple reason because most of the businesses have been due to the curfews have been have been just shut that does not mean they reopen again so i think what we are looking at in seafreight is that temporarily there is going to be a a shift in mix away from the sme but i think ultimately it is it is even going to be a bigger portion you know we have an extremely whe when you look at the at the market share it is a very small market share we cover right now so it is it is an absolute attractive and we are totally committed as you know in our customer base to the sme customer the this is this is our backbone of our operation right there is still a a massive potential to grow in a in in the in a very profitable market in the sme so how the margin is going to look like i i think also here there is a time that we need to look at for the normalization but there there is no systemic structural reason why the margin for sme should have should should be lower than it has been in the past so i think rightfully so our our backbone sme customer base we will even get a bigger portion of that and the profitability is going to be run exactly if not above the level that we had until now understood many thanks both of you the next question comes from frans hoyer from handelsbanken please go ahead thank you very much good afternoon also a question regarding the mix shift in sea towards sme could you could you try and describe how much of a shift in the mix you saw and what was the effect on the yield that you saw in the sea business i think those details we will not disclose but the majority of the smb sme business has not been the majority of the smb sme business has not been able to sustain their operations their business models throughout the pandemic at least for 46 weeks and that has caused the reduction so but we see them gradually coming back but as markus said before some of them do not come back at all because their basis their their their financial savviness is not given yeah and sme is everything be careful now it is it is also very niche products that has not seen an increase in demand at the moment yeah whether you have hand painted tiles that are produced in northern italy and the demand is coming back now in denmark for example it is a rather questionable front and and that is maybe how you should think about it but eventually that will come back and our business is and we are strong in sme business our business is skewed towards smes so that gives you a bit of a flavor it it is a result of the pandemic and not of a how should i say conscious mix decision no i understand okay and the 2nd question final question is around the m a market and whether the troub i mean you mentioned that you are winning market gaining market shares and those that are losing it are typically the small or mid sized competitors that are having difficulties on the technology front connectivity and so on and and you also talk about the credit risks escalating so there might be an an uptick in the m a opportunities that you see maybe you can talk about that yeah we monitor the market for many years and we are we are active in the market and as you know but not everything that looks shiny is of interest for us and and that maybe we we to fulfill our strategic targets and to continue our growth paths that we have embarked on many years ago we do not need m a what we we have defined targets what we want to achieve with an m a approach and if we find targets that are fulfilling those requirements we will be acti we will become active and if not we do not so and for us the market has not significantly changed at the moment and we never looked at we always looked at targets also in the past that were successful in their with their business model in their geography geography or in their solutioning we are not looking for a restructuring case that is not our business now okay understood thank you very much thank you thanks frans the next question comes from christian obst from baader bank please go ahead yes hello i have some small technical questions one is concerning the decision concerning capex or long term leases so we have seen an increase in depreciation of right of depreciation of right of use assets from 237 to 200 fif 54000000 in the 2nd quarter this year and so what is the the the trigger for a decision going for capex or for long term leases and how is the current market for long term leases developing also what is the main trigger for any decision in either way 2nd one is you are talking and of course there is dso pressure are you currently supporting some of your customers so for longer payment terms or something like that to keep them into your network and the last one is can you give us a guidance for any kind of income from disposals in the 2nd half thank you well christian right of use assets i i i think your question has two answers the 1st one is what is the decision making reasons to it and the 2nd one is what is the increase in the 2nd quarter there are there are two different there are two different reasons to that the maybe the more technical 1st you know that we have the asset held for sale related to the disposal of the business in the uk which also includes right of use assets and as per the ifrs standards you have to stop depreciations at the point of signing and then keep that frozen if you like until the point of closing that is the that is the simple reason why you have the variances in the 2nd quarter and continue to have until closing has been has been executed so that is the technical part then the the question around what makes us deciding into one or the other brand what makes us deciding into one or the other pays main main and most important piece to it is is that because we talk most of it of locations right of of contract logistics facilities right so what is the what is the perspective of that contract logistics facility is that a facility that is an operational optimal position then then obviously we want to keep our flexibility most of the time back to back with customers where we say we have a five or i do not know a ten years customer contract you know i am just making an example and we match that with our lease commitments it is flexibility that is that is that is driving our asset life business model right so if you ask us you know then each answer is going to be the more flexible the better we only make investment decisions where lo where locations do not provide the required quality of facility i give you one example a few years back we were investing into a pharma hub in singapore because there was no such pharma space available right so with a couple of ups and downs you know right now it it it it became a very a very good decision you know at the in the in the current circumstances to have that space available so but this is really the exception where there is a good reason why to invest our own money in in in all the other cases a lease agreement back to back with the customer will be preferable dso 2nd question dso we never sell on payment terms we do not this is irrespectively of any pressure demand or anything like that we sell because we have a very good service we are fully operational we are competitive in the market we are not we are not selling on terms okay that is clear and the last one i did not write down the last one can you income from disposals yeah zero income from disposals in the 1st half no in the 2nd half 02nd half in the 2nd half it it will be we have a 2nd we have all the effe a 2nd real estate portfolio is out for sale i do not expect material impact on the p l out of that so it is going to be less than 10000000 okay thank you very much thank you the next question comes from muneeba kayani from bank of america please go ahead hi okay is it possible for you to quantify the benefit from your perishables in air gp into teu as well as the impact on volumes from lower perishables and so as that normalizes how we should be thinking about it in in three q and and the 2nd half of the year and then secondly what have you seen from the digital forwarders during the covid crisis and have you seen a higher or lower presence from them during the crisis okay let me let me answer your question okay okay the the the latter question i do not know what digital forwarders are but i would believe our digital solutions got a lot of pickup during the crisis we have not seen many of our competitors in general being active or aggressive in the market i would say a handful have been the rest somehow disappeared and i am not exaggerating so i will not name any and i will not give any comments on on single forwarders the quantification of the benefits from perishables 1st of all perishable is a a low low margin business and we had less perishables 13rd less approximately volume 13rd less perishables in the 1st semester that led to the cargo mix to a higher yield independent on whether charter was available or required or the rates spiked or not we believe that this perishable volume comes back gradually in the 2nd semester and there is thus the mix would reinstate with a lower yield so the seventy to 85 swiss francs per 100 kilo will become a reality also all because of the cargo mix it was 13rd of our total volume being being perishable i hope that helps i hope that helps thank you you are welcome the last question comes from sebastian vogel from ubs please go ahead hello i got two questions the 1st one would be on a contract logistics you mentioned there your cost expenses came down quite a fair bit i was wondering if you can add more granularity how the different cost items i e personal costs and the other one sg a have contributed to this development in the 2nd quarter and the other question i have if i calculated correctly your conversion ratio in particular in asia was quite high in the 2nd quarter is that mainly a function of the transport mode exposure of that region so sebastian 1st of all we do not look at conversion rates per region because it depends on the terms our customers apply on where to you know invoice and and pay transport bills so it is skewed be careful we have a we have a profit sharing models or that is within or internally between regions so that will not really help conversion rate for sure is influenced by the performance of the different business units and yes in quarter two airfreight or air logistics has been extremely successful the and the question on contract logistics and cost development the majority of the cost is people colleagues and the 2nd cost factor is lease i gave an answer on the lease already because fifty or a bit more of our contracts are all back to back dedicated with single customer so the fixed cost coverage is usually part of our contracts so that is not an exposure and the rest is capacity and we breezed with the volume very well yes we did not have a mass layoff and we stated so many times it is not necessary because from the beginning of the pandemic we said this would be an a situation that would that is limited by time you know it would not end up in a in a permanent situation and that is exactly what we see many of the operations are back i mentioned that only twelve operations out of more than 600 contract logistics sites are still locked down and eleven out of them are in one country because some infrastructures have not opened yet and the rest is fully operational or has started to become operational again maybe not a three shift operation or weekend shifts but if you look into china and china is maybe a we can learn from china or asia because they went through this pandemic very early and and gradually we have full employment in our operations in china we have additional shifts introduced in our line feeding automotive production line services spare parts services and we see increasing and strong demand for a lot of goods out of china and therefore we see that a lot of our customers start picking up in volume again is is this vtwo or whatever let us forget it but it is not as fast as we thought but the slump was not as severe as we anticipated before but so i hope that helps to answer your question it is personal cost is the main factor and we are almost in full employment again in contract logistics that means we have gross profit related to that activity and the rest is lease cost and our idle capacity has not changed significantly we are below three in idle capacity that is a a leading indicator in our industry perfect thank you sebastian gentlemen that was the last question thank you sandra ladies and gentlemen logistics is people business and we are proud of our people they have managed this crisis extremely well and we are honored by our customers their loyalty and their business that they awarded to us during the last especially last quarter we will see how we progress over the next quarter quarter three and we are looking forward to talking to you again middle of october and in the meantime stay healthy do not travel too much do not forget to use masks because we need you as end consumers like 1000000s and tri 1000000000s of others because end consumers drive our business model and we want to see a strong quarter three when we talk next thank you very much and talk to you again soon have a nice summer bye bye and talk to you again soon have a nice summer bye bye ladies and gentlemen the

detlef dressler ceo of kuna nugal please go ahead sir thank you sandra good morning good day good afternoon and good evening to all of you and welcome to the analyst conference on the semi annual half year 2020 results of kuna nugal international ag our cfo marcus blanka and i welcome you from sunny switzerland we published our half year results and the reason why we are here today is to share our results with you and to answer any questions you may have over the 1st year or over the 1st half of the year the cuna and naggl groups successfully managed to deliver excellent service for customers in the face of an unprecedented challenge posed by the covid nineteen pandemic this started with the very abrupt halt to chinese exports in february followed by lockdowns in march and a deliberate pace of day to day recovery thanks to our dedicated colleagues and a seamless transition of approximately 45000 staff to home office in a matter of days our customers faced no degradation of service quality despite extraordinary volatility and demand for essential goods this culminated in substantial market share gains across all transactional business units financial perspective the group is performance in quarter two is a testament to our flexible asset light business model and our efforts to optimally variabilize a meaningful portion of our short term fixed costs and looking at those four key figures that are in front of you you will see that the net turnover decreased by sevenfive heavily impacted by an ethics effect or fivenine versus previous year gross profit and the ebit by eighteen down to 419000000 swiss francs in the 1st half of 2020 earnings per share landed at two58 swiss francs per share please follow me on the next slide slide four with a couple of details on the group and the business units group earnings for the period of the 1st six months were chf 409000000 a decrease of nineteen one compared to the same period last year the ebit margin was eleventhree down from thirteensix in the 1st half of 2019 sales per share were chf three45 down from chf fourthirteen in the 1st half of 2019 we were at 309000000 swiss francs and we generated a strong free cash flow of 383000000 swiss francs looking at the four business units that start with c logistics we have seen an ebit of 167000000 swiss francs which were 28 below previous year as a result of a shift in cargo mix less sme volumes and positive reffer and pharma development also the demand for rail solution especially at china started to pick up strongly as of june last quarter air logistics an ebit of 181000000 swiss francs has been achieved which is four higher than previous year based on a high demand for crisis goods but also a demand for special solutions such as sea and air volumes which more than tripled and road logistics ended the 1st semester with an ebit of 26000000 swiss francs all networks were maintained and europe now is slowly recovering while the americas are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic and contract logistics ended the 1st semester with an ebit of 45000000 swiss francs 21 below previous year seeing high demand of essential goods and answering the gross profit decline with strict cost management almost matching the gross profit development on slide six we will discuss briefly the volume development in ce logistics and air logistics please let me start with ce logistics 1st we have a pronounced effort in ce logistics especially on maintaining our own networks in sea logistics especially on maintaining our own network capacity which yielded in significant market share gains across all segments but especially in pharma and refer and the ecommerce segment the cargo mix i mentioned before showed significantly lower sme volume and this is a higher yielding as we have mentioned in some of our previous calls the market demand it s continuously recovering over the course of quarter two but it s still below previous year let me give you some hints on how market zero how sorry how our volume developed month by month in quarter two we saw april was a fifteen fifteen volume decrease but gaining market share ended our volumes in may by only twelve and the june volumes already showed a eight so gradually we see volumes picking up again but still lower than previous year in total we shipped 217000 tus less in our networks which resulted into an elevenseven reduction in quarter two and and nine one reduction in volumes for the 1st semester 2020 for sea logistics air logistics saw a significantly lower demand for dry cargo and perishables and both are lower yielding as you know a strong demand for essential goods which were higher yielding and mainly produced or operated in a charter via charter business because the recovery of belly is not expected to see or show significant effects before quarter for this here the soaring demand for c and e solutions and also a monthly development that was rather stable by 23 to twenty april to june in total the 1st semester a reduction in volume of fifteenfive how does this translate now into the unit performance of the business units and please i will give you on slide 71st sea logistics mentioned this already two times now for the 3rd time cargo mixes lower sme volumes volume gains in pharma e commerce and reefer and a stable margin development per unit in constant currency on the next slide slide eight you see the details of the development the gross profit makes us the driver of the unit profitability and with an fx effect or a currency effect six +six on the unit basis you have or you see a constant development or constant margin per toy per tu in quarter two this year all cost measures were intact and including the tailwind from fx or from currency we saw a reduction in the cost  level per unit as well ebit per tu is well below our normal ebit per tu but this includes also headwind from currency of six so in total we are at the lower end of the range that we usually pursue the eighty to 100 swiss francs t u ebit per tu but it is recovering and we also see some seasonal effects kicking in we are full so we are saying especially in supply chain logistics on excellent customer service and we have one significant business which already related or resulted in less volume reductions than one might have expected from the market development and quartet two has been stronger and improving month by month with regard to both volume margin and unit profitability air logistics the general cargo volume declined significantly i will comment on this on the next slide and the demand for higher yielding crisis goods has soared the market demand has been much weaker in quarter two as anticipated we have to say the regular dry cargo so the general cargo the normal  cargo that we transport especially in the valley capacity has been down by forty to fifty and this has been offset by crisis volumes essential goods but not only crisis volumes essential goods but not only ppe  but also packaged food  packaged food as well as ecommerce volumes went into into that segment parachutes were down in april and may but a recovery started already in june and we also see hard we had a spike in charter business while belly was not existing which led to unit figures that are skewed by a different way of producing air logistics and our unit yield as you can see is clearly above our normal range of seventy to 85 swiss francs per 100 kilos sorry i am sorry no i mean i am sorry no 200 people  for for the normal volumes transported in our networks the unit ebit is also above normal despite higher currency headwinds and this marks a fifty increase in quarter two versus previous quarter due to the beneficial volume mix the cost consciousness also in this business unit as well as the 1st europe is slowly recovering while the volumes in america stay at a low and very low level at the moment this is true both for both intermodal as well as truck brokerage we have seen slide twelve now we have seen a faster and massive deteriorate i think we mentioned that when we when we had our quarter one analyst call with you and the order of the the order of magnitude has been higher than fifty volume reductions but that was true for two or three weeks only and we see a steady volume recovery step by step especially in domestic transports in europe at the moment uss i followed with a sharp volume decline end of april and especially intermodal more or less collapsed and we see a steady recovery in june since june in europe and a stabilization stabilization on a low level in the us at the moment international and cross border which is the higher yielding business those transports are still lagging but also here we see volumes coming back in all our networks have been maintained and we are ready to deal with the cargo kicking in and in some markets i will not say the geography we have even had to reject certain volumes because our networks were filled again in june that is true for domestic transport we saw a very strong growth in bookings on our digital road platform called etrucknow and we have been able to roll this out even in a virtual environment over the last couple of months in many asian countries and we see the volume soaring and on that platform at the moment while ebix was 42 below previous year we generated a positive ebix of 26000000 swiss francs and in our own this is the case scenario we would not have expected a positive quarter two in road logistics given the character of our networks so we are very proud of what has been achieved here  countering volume reductions with cost measures slide thirteen contract logistics and i have to say contract logistics showed high resilience and it showed two phases the ugly phase if i may say so was industries that clearly were downtrending automotive and industrial to name two and we had complete shutdowns by customers and sometimes by governments in those industries for 2346 up to eight weeks and some of the volumes have not recovered even to a sizable level again then prior to the crisis and there was a couple of nice phases that we saw or up trading industries the pharma and heads can industry up trading industries the pharma and heads can industry the industry for essential goods which is packaged food and food and consumables and also ecommerce and here the volumes were well above seasonal peaks and we had extra shifts that we had to introduce especially on the weekends to cope with the soaring and spiking demand ninety or up to 85 to ninety of our sites remained open throughout the whole crisis and currently we only have twelve sites that are still closed out of more than 600 sites globally so we see a clear confirmation that fifty of our solution portfolio is related to essential goods and this demand has never stopped or has never been reduced some details on the contract logistics business unit on slide fourteen the implementation of the covid nineteen soops our operating procedures across all operations were introduced but they also added a lot of cost and a lot of efficiencies while we were doing everything to protect our staff we lost clearly efficiencies cleaning disinfection between shifts no overlap of shifts anymore segregation of work flow between shifts led to a lower productivity and higher costs obviously but the excellent the excellent cost management that contract logistics introduced immediately with the crisis becoming one so as of february clearly showed progress and we we were excluding the pressure from the exchange rate we were able to counter the top line revenue pressure with cost measures almost entirely and and that is a four for such a huge business unit employing so many people that is a huge effort and a great result so the high portion in our solution portfolio of essential goods so we have more than fifty of our sites are so called dedicated sites so we were not exposed to to an over proportioned lease without any activity in too many sites nevertheless we we saw a development end of quarter one and early quarter two but if you look into the figures the all performance including the fx effects is only eleventhree lower net turnover and in ebit almost on the level of previous year quarter to and having said so i am happy to hand over to my colleague marcus to lead you through the key financial figures thank you very much ned less welcome to all participants also from my side a very special 2nd quarter indeed a time that was characterized by unusual business pattern i think we had quite some opposite focus on business management focus on in the business units air freight can be can be described by just make it happen times where customers is much as on the carrier side i think a lot of creativity was being required to make things happen on the other side as dedleff mentioned in contract logistics clear focus on on cost containment and cost management so a lot of times we have been confronted with the fact that traditional kpi is key performance indicators had been not extremely helpful we needed to look differently at the business because it was a very special situation but and i want to lead you on the page number sixteen i think the result ultimately was a quite good one and when you look at the magnitude of impact what such a unusual business can happen is when you look at the gross profit development from the set from the 1st and the 2nd quarter to compared to last year we have actually lost in the 2nd quarter 265000000 gross profit compared to last year that is twofive times more than in the 1st quarter however on an avgda level we actually have been at the same even better level than than compared to to the 1st quarter so we only if you like still a big number but the quarter so we only if you like still a big number but only had a reduction in avgda of 30000000 out of a cross profit reduction of 265 so there is quite a lot of the going further down in the p n l of course on an ebt level yes we are  around eighteen behind last year on a half year basis so 900000090 of which and that is not an excuse just the fact of around 20000000 and we are coming out of out of foreign currency exchange so 70000000 from an operational perspective  reduction versus last year so in relative terms i believe the 2nd quarter and that is also very apparent was even better than the 1st quarter on page number seventeen let us talk about air and sea freight in that context the etech project automation initiatives behind that we have presented the potential of the ehealth initiatives in in commercial terms and our full year 2019 presentation so what you see here is merely an update where we stand it s not a new assessment of values it s just an update on progress and i think you can appreciate we have set the baseline in many areas in ehealth our operating system airlock is is fully rolled out in 2019 which is a prerequisite for many of the etouch initiatives not all of them but many of those and you can see despite the fact that q two had been a challenging environment to put through projects but we have continued to drive etouch initiatives and we made pretty good progress at least in one  so the five core areas the one that is customer booking and order entry and i think the message here is yes do not expect expect any miracles right now in the current situation with still over a good three months people are working partially from home partially just what i said trying to keep up service in an in an excellent manner but some of these projects have a slight delay the message that i want to give you here is detouch is on track page number eighteen balance sheet i am only going to talk about 34 components of course some of them housekeeping 1st one trade receivables is biggest item on the balance sheets three23three 1000000000 by the end of june 2020 compared to 3600000000 not surprisingly again here would be  position where business volume has reduced slightly and you know it s a function basically of rates and and volume and of course a currency impact also on that on that position that is reducing the overall amount secondly and arguably more important cash and cash equivalents i think our balance sheet is strong with  with a gross cash position here of nearly 1200000000 translated into net cash of around 760000000 which compares to roughly 900000000 respectively 418000000 by the end of the 1st quarter 2020 so simple terms a very good development in cash generation in light of i think of the decision and you have read it in the in the news today in light of the decision to propose the distribution of dividend to the shareholders of four we have calibrated a performer net cash position at that point in time and that would still be positive with 218000000 just as a housekeeping topic here you are aware that we have a revolving credit facility available to us which is entirely undrawn so nothing has been used so far in the extent or at the frame of 750000000 coming back to the next item on the balance sheet is asset held for sale also here information purposes this is the value that we have or that is the scope of the business that we have signed a contract of divestment with the xpo you can see here a very transparent asset held for sale so you can see here a very transparent asset held for sale 400000000 liabilities associated with these asset held for sale 300 so the best asset value of that business to be carved out is around 100000000 equity ratio i am sure you have already calculated that yourself from december 23six an increase to 25nine so i think the solidity of the balance sheet is also in these rough times and unusual times a benefit  nevertheless balance sheet is one thing cash is cash is king so main topic cash going swiftly to page number nineteen operational cash flow you can see that here in the 1st half 2020 at around 804000000 similar level than last year with with around 872080000 and however when we go down a little bit and look at the total cash and cash equivalent situation we have an increase on the cash balance around 666000000 be reminded at that point in time and that included last year is dividend payments to the amount of 728000000 so comparably at similar level free cash flow generation really what we are looking at very resilient  free cash flow generation also in the 2nd quarter so i am talking 2nd quarter not half year in the 2nd quarter of 227000000 compared to 223000000 so let us talk about crisis or non crisis free cash flow generation has been at the very same level as as as last year excluding some of the disposals and this gives you a bit of an idea on how much extraordinary components are in there excluding the disposals the underlying free cash flow for the 2nd quarter was still 221 so the the the swing that we have for everybody who runs some of the models i think you can see here from the investing activities the cross capex the run rates or the capex that we spend into the business is currently aiming at around 200000000 on an annual basis which is which is significantly lower than our initial expectations where then we had it seen over the last couple of years and some of the some of the drivers of course is the contract logistics disposal of the of the of part of the uk business at the same time we are also very diligently working on the usage of long term leases according to our strategy rather than outright purchase looking at the pattern in time so the the trajectory of the free cash flow so i think when you look at the curves on the page nineteen on the right side there is no reason to believe that that should look differently at least in the in the 3rd quarter than it was last year again be reminded in the 4th quarter we had some extraordinary impact in 2019 so we should expect a more even development into the default quarter also for 2020 going to page number twenty and i only touch the accounts receivable quickly on the balance sheet and when when i talked about the balance sheet here you see trade receivables have decreased over year over year by around 400000000 the reasons that are mentioned already trade payables by around 260000000 so our net worth in capital is down around 146000000 and what is more important our kpi is on dso is and dpos we were able keep especially on the ds all sides days of sales outstanding a number around 54 or 55 so we have a deviation of zerofour days many questions coming along our way obviously is there pressure from customers on extended payment terms yes there is very clear yes there is but i think we will see more pressure coming in the 3rd and 4th quarter we are we are holding i think quite well i think service is one of the one of the important arguments to to maintain the desos at the same time i think our focus moves towards the risk profile behind the counter parties i do expect i do expect going forward for the next two to three quarters and an increase in the risk profile on countertparty risks so nothing bad happened so far i want to underline that it is  no no big and defaults or anything like that but i would expect that the pressure is also here and getting higher until the end of the year and maybe into the 1st half of the year 2021 regenerative capital employed page number 21 page number 21 you see that little inflection point that we had here  from sixty up to 6667 and i think that was  that was a good sign so now we see a little bit like the the covid nineteen effect that it that pushes down to 62 again  very clear and i just wrote it for for clarity just decided the the sudden decrease of  the profitability that we have seen also on the pnr on a very similar asset however from a target perspective we maintain our financial our financial targets with around seventy regional and captured employee that should be possible the good news and at the same time i think the expected also from some of you news is on the next page page number 22 dividend proposal just to put also some clarity around conversations we had over the last years you know that we never had a formal written dividend policy as it is all decision making power remains with the board of directors and the general assembly and that having said the actual payout ratio in the recent years was always considered with also our verbal communication to a distribution of around 75 of the net profit after tax and clearly now the boe is proposal is based on on the assessment of the market conditions and also the groups performance and likely ongoing performance and as you can see here financial targets and the last slide from  from  my presentation i think you will see on the left side the group financial targets conversion rate eleven to sixteen i think everybody is clear one of the main drivers etouch return on capit and floyd i just spoke about it i think when we come back to regular profitability based on our asset base seventy is is in reach working capital intensity i want to talk about that 1st working capital intensity currently at threenine and you might have noticed i have intentionally widened a little bit the corridor from top end fourfive to five  for a simple reason because i believe that is anticipating a reflection of pressure on counterpart party risk and potential dsos for the next four quarters tax rate tax rate i think very important to look at this one it is a housekeeping topic for you also to update on your models we expect a group  effective tax rate of around 24 to 26 up from around 24 to 25 as per our latest communication this is just reflecting the current shift in the business and geographic mix so just that you are not surprised on your models and right side before business units you see the 1st line our our actual performance in volumes but underneath the the part everybody was really waiting for that is the update on the market expectations for 2020 and the outlook and as you can imagine i think we are in line with many of our peers we are not giving any you know the i think the performance that the group has shown so far gives us a certain confidence in our ability also to manage through what we believe is going to still be volatile and highly uncertain life is going to still be volatile and highly uncertain market also for the rest of the year and as the market outlook remains extremely uncertain to us as well we offer again no explicit financial guidance for the group nor volume guidance until the end of the year very sorry for that but at the current stage you will have to or we will all have to live with guest working and a bit of fact color of what we said on our past performance with that little lack of outlook i will hand over to dentif and thank you marcus and the lack of outlook may be marks the whole year because in the pandemic we have to fly on site that is the saying we have as far as we can look ahead we initiate measures and activities and the rest is agility adaptability to a situation that you can not really predict on slide 24 i want to make a couple of remarks logistics is and will stay people is business even in a more and more digital environment and we have embarked on this route our roadmap 2022 which started in 2018 and we are in the middle of that roadmap roadmap deployment blends customer technology and people and we believe that the covid nineteen pandemic in the last six months has clearly shown that we have embarked on the right strategy we stayed fully operational throughout the crisis and continues serving our customers with our high quality services throughout the world and i would heartily like to thank our colleagues for their commitment and passion and to our customers for their trust and loyalty thank you without you the 1st semester would have looked differently and that is the energy and passion of the best logistics team in our industry and having said so i would like to hand over back to sandra to open the queueing session anyone who wishes to ask a question may press star one on the touch tone telephone you will hear a tone to confirm that you have entered the queue if you wish to remove yourself from the queue you may press star one again participants are requested to use only hands while asking a question anyone was a question may press star and one at this time the 1st question comes from daniel ruschka from sanford burnham prebys medical school please go ahead good afternoon thanks for taking the question three times many could you elaborate what is enabling the market share gain especially during a crisis like this one in your view and kind of who is losing it and then how much of that market share gain will you be able to retain kind of as things move more back to normal you also talked a little bit about your cost reduction efforts and in today is report you showed about 87000 employees down from about 98 last year at the same point now how much has that decreased because let us call it a rough 10000 employees is driven by the temporary furlough programs and how much due to actual sustainable reductions that then will benefit you kind of as you ramp back up and tying this also to etouch back at the financial year results you talked about 20000000 annualized savings so far any indication on how this has progressed in the past six months and you know do you expect that the automation will enable you to keep staff numbers lower as volumes go back up or how are you thinking about kind of really driving etouch through the business thanks thanks danny let me answer let me start with the letter one because we have alluded to that a couple of times it is not about staff reduction etouch is enabling us to do more business and to drive business segments or growth in business segments with a traditionally lower margin but with the high conversion rate still very attractive to us that is etouch market share gains we have mentioned that we were able to gain market share because we changed the whole organization into addressing actively customers after easter so we were engaged with all existing customers and potential customers target customers as we call them and we had interaction virtually with all of them couple of times throughout the week and months and we won business we won business without having met the customer physically and we were winning business because we were operational and many of our mid sized and smaller competitors were not operating of our mid sized and smaller competitors were not operating they struggled to keep operations up and running so that also would allude to answering your question who lost the lower part of the pyramid is the one that is under highest pressure technology connectivity and also functionality of operating systems is a big challenge so many of them and especially in a unprecedented situation that we all went through worldwide over the last 34 or five months that proved to be a big risk and a big problem because you could not overcome any of those deficiencies by just calling someone or going somewhere you had to prove your systems and technology are working how much can we retain i would say we we convince our customers by quality we do not convince by price yeah a quality supplier and the customers that have made the experience over the last six months or in the past in general they stay with us we have a lot of customers that we retain because of our high quality service and that is part of our roadmap 222 strategy customer excellence is at the center of all the topics we do we do not want to win transactional business just for the sake of winning it for and operating it for twelve or three months we want customers to stay with us and see how much of our solution portfolio can generate benefits for them cost reduction efforts i think we have made a lot of efforts with all the programs that are in place but not only we have optimized our workforce we have reduced capacity where required but we shift the capacity to those operations sometimes and this is the story the same city or even the same warehouse where demand spiked so there is no rule we have only a few temporary labor i think it is 2000 a bit more than 2010 labor less than we had a year ago and this is driven by the effect that we see much higher demand still in some of the essential goods segments especially pharma healthcare and ecommerce and this from our point of view sustainable growth this will stay so in  in different words daniel i would say we made a organic growth experience compressed in five months maybe or four months that we usually would have gone through in our customers in a period of eighteen months and i would say that is to a large extent sticky and stays and will not be reversed the next question comes from sarti sivakumar from citygroup please go ahead  yeah thank you good afternoon that is great and thanks for taking my questions i have three questions firstly could you please elaborate on volume trends through the quarter from smes which markets are actually seeing weakness versus the relative strength secondly in 2019 on your sdna expense was around $445000000 so so could you please update on the current run rate on sgn finally what has been your workforce return rate from remote working across t markets can you repeat the last question please i did not get that in terms of workforce returning back to office what has been your return rate so for across t markets trends which markets so as you know the whole pandemic started mid of january already in in asia and usually this is not an mse market or we are we have a much higher portion of of blue chip customers there but in europe it is mainly the mse customers that dropped out of business very fast and the recovery is starting or i started now in june i would say so the 1st sign of a recovery of mse customers has been seen in june in europe and partly in in other markets but mainly in europe and this this will take time it will not come overnight at the moment the pandemic is is hitting the americas and we see that we have still volumes that are down and not recovering but here i would say it has bottomed out so we are more positive today than we were three weeks ago months ago when we discussed the quarter one results i would say despite regional and local setbacks despite regional and local setbacks the pandemic is not over but we have all managed and understood how to handle it and governments have initiated enough protective health measures in order to secure the people and make them continue the sg e run rate has a lot of components and it starts with travel for example i do not expect travel to come back this year to say this clearly international travel i would not expect to see any of the flights international with screen and air stuff on it before september if at all and and then we have made such a positive experience on it new customers and and and such a positive experience with winning customers and so on  online and virtual only that you could say every 2nd trip can be spared in general moving forward and then we have a currency effect here as well there is a currency effect in sg because we translate everything into into hard currencies with franc and and that has an effect in itself as well i hope that answers your questions the next question comes from david kersten from jeffries please go ahead thank you good afternoon gentlemen three questions please from my side 1st on sea logistics it turns out that the volume development is better than expected as the quarter progressed i was wondering did you see a noticeable impact from a shift from air to sea freight due to the lack of capacity in air freight then secondly in in air logistics you you benefited from i think in constant currency a 34 higher yield and now with the air freight market starting to normalize again would you expect that air freight yield also normalizes back to the range that you indicated in your presentation of seventy to 85 swiss francs per per 100 kilograms or do you expect to be able to continue to to do to do better than that range only on on road logistics i think the organic revenue was down twenty in the 2nd quarter but that is a mix of of europe and and north america ok it provides some color on how weak north america really was and with a decrease of twenty does that still imply that you gained market share in the 2nd quarter because i think some of your peers refer to the market down only fifteen in the 2nd quarter thanks very much sure david but let me answer your questions sea logistics yes we had a better volume development than expected but any shift from air to sea is insignificant for sea sorry for saying so yeah one freighter has a 100 has 100 kilos and 100 tons and we are talking about i do not know 68 containers so it is a different business model you can not compare it but what we saw is and that is a good combination and i mentioned that is the air sea combination yeah so yeah you go into dubai via sea and then you go into final distribution even to south america via air and this combination this solution is in in light of the lacking supply side of freighter capacity especially in china got a lot of tailwind and i mentioned that our volumes here spiked more than three times the normal volume that we see so this combination showed a certain progress air logistics i think i mentioned that during the presentation we expect especially in the 2nd semester that the higher yield was a very special or was was a result of a very special supply and demand situation in quarter two and that the normalized yield of seventeen to 85 swiss francs per 100 kilo will come in or will kick in again gradually not overnight and not on  on a fingertip but gradually road logistics i think our coms are we we have so many different figures in the market and not being able to predict even what has happened or describe  really what has happened is i think what we have to all all of us have to be very careful this let let me describe a situation that we experience in europe and then i come to the us europe we have volume reductions of 5060 and within weeks this happened in the 1st one to three weeks in april but then this bottomed out and the recovery gradually started already as of may so the figure you see is an ever figure as of may so the figure you see is an ever figure of a volume development that had a lot of slumps and spikes and a lot of of shifts over the last weeks at the moment i or we all believe that the volumes are gradually increasing ok great thank you very much you are welcome the next question comes from sam blenden from jpmorgan please go ahead our afternoon could i ask i think three questions please 1st one is on the  sea freight conversion rate that is held up pretty well but i guess there was not very much you know there was not any bear from etouch in that segment so just be interested in yeah did you do any specific cost savings programs in sea freight or what what helped the  conversion rate in the quarter 2nd question is on i think there was 57000000 of employee government support in the quarter could you just talk about roughly which which divisions i came in was it mostly in contract logistics could you see that support be withdrawn before the market recovers back up to normal rates so that there is basically a lag and and your your profitability is impacted by that and the last question just be an update on on mna funds obviously you pay the dividend she will be reading into that that any mna ambitions are a bit a bit less in the short run or or you still got plenty of fire power to look at that thank you three question it is not a standard routine that you have to ask three questions only as  as a as a short hint to you so see we have cost savings in place and there is no etouch yet because as mentioned many times the prerequisite is the fully deployed new transport management system called celog as a basis for running etouch activities in celogistics the government program that you allude to 8085 is related to contract logistics but people were out of work so as volumes are coming back also in the normal operation people are unemployed and we pay them so that is not the point we avoided to lay off people which is beneficial for our staff and also for for the governments related to this so the business the operational run rate of contract logistics has been extremely strong all the restructuring measure we will see in the 2nd semester when things are cleaning up more and more especially in the quarter four figures how strong contract logistics will will phoenix lie come back out of all the restructuring activities and your question related to him and his ambition i am a bit surprised because our proposal dividend proposal has not changed to the one that we made prior to covid nineteen when we posted our annual results 2019 there was a dividend proposal of forced risk factors per share and cautious as we are we postponed a decision on this and did not decide on a dividend given the uncertainty unpredictability of the pandemic and now as we see that cash flow is strong and we weather the situation strongly we are we are in a situation that the board of directors decided to propose for the to propose the same dividend again for the general assembly our and mna ambition and ambition our mna strategy has not changed at all but physical beatings in asia are restricted at the moment so whatever we do is based on video calls i think i understand thank you you are welcome hello mark mark hello you were shocked why i said less than three questions mark yeah no i am but b i am only going to ask two questions you will be pleased to hear just for variety really so just to come back on on the airfare and capacity question could you give us a sense for how much of your air freight in q two went in freighters rather than bellyhold and and do you see that changing significantly in certainly in q three and maybe even into q four because my sense is that yeah the airlines are bringing back capacity but much more of it is short and medium haul rather than the long haul stuff which is typically what you do exactly so whatever belly comes back at the moment at short and medium hall and that does not help us i mean usually that is not where we where we and transact the majority of our business yeah so i would expect in the 2nd semester sixty to seventy of our volume to be transported with freighters main deck capacity yeah and i would say it will take maybe two years that we see a significant network activity which allows for bally using bally capacity again yeah i do not know what that is that is all yeah go ahead sorry the the sixty to seventy that you think is going to go in phrases in the 2nd half would compared to what 9095 in q two because there was so much yeah i am not sure so this this is no no  mark i am i am not sure end of this year we will have sixty to seventy of the belly capacity that should be back but we will still rely we will still rely on our capacity to meet the demand so we are talking end of the year whereas at the moment at the moment i think it is ninety if i am not mistaken or quarter early quarter two middle of quarter two the majority almost all is freighter capacity so we have a lot of valley still in north america or the americas which is yeah so when you talk about the gp normalizing or coming back towards the longer term range that is much more the mix because i guess the like for like gp from using a freighter is not going to be different in august than it was in april right ok and the 2nd question straight to the point could you remind us where you stand on credit insurance on death as how much you use it thanks mark that i also get a question once in a while so away no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no on a global basis a lot of conversations going on right now and i do not want to say that insurers have all the similar patterns of obviously when the when the business goes well there is a lot of insurance coverage available when business goes not so well it goes down very quickly but we are we are having a good partnership with them and and we try to manage as much coverage as possible as i said in my presentation until now no significant changes so defaults or fallouts or bankruptcies or anything like that however there is you know the horizon is a bit darker than what it usually looks like so there is a lot of caution is going forward and how much we pay you can see that of the of the annual report we pay every year around threefive to 4000000 on insurance premium i think that is given our sales ledger of more than 3000000000 a reasonable number when you are  yeah around seventy of that is being covered yeah and and but but broadly as you go into the 2nd half your level of cover is unchanged yeah our level of cover is on a total number probably unchanged when you look into some of the industries it may vary like aerospace industry might actually be reduced a little bit some industries will be increased but overall the risk profile is shifting overall remains very stable zero hello so neil from credit suisse and if i can ask 1st of all another question of marcus if  that works i will give you another opportunity marcus if  that works i will give you another opportunity thank you neil much appreciated my pleasure and then i will have one for death left too if i may keep keep it to two so so the 1st one marcus you obviously spent some time talking about working capital and increasing risk to some of your sme customers just wondering as it pertains to c freight and the negative mix effect on gp per toy as you plan beyond 2020 do you plan for a smaller proportion of smes relative to normal or how do you think about and as it relates to gpt three over the medium term and then the 2nd question and i guess it could be for either of you just following on from the air log comments on how it is evolving and obviously clog is to come how relevant is this to your mna ambitions that you obviously outlined to an extent at the full year i guess on one hand optimization of those two tms might be ideal before any major transaction but is that the way you think maybe neil take the letter question if you if you do not mind 1st of all we concentrate on our own business and optimizing our own business based on airlog and followed by celog and the ecutability of that business make ecut happen and and we make progress here we are in in airlog logistics as we as we have pronounced mna is independent of this this needs cultural fit we are looking for access to certain asian customers a solution that is not yet part of our own solutioning maybe so there are a lot of other criteria and yes it would be much easier to transfer a acquisition directly on celog to to name this then on our current legacy system but if that would be needed we can do so as well i mean we have proven this is not a big exercise for us and so that is not a criteria that would influence our mna approach or delay any mna it is more getting acquainted into those separate  targets and also building up a basis of trust and that needs physical personal meetings and you can not do this via via via video calls we also we always said when we announced this because there were rumors in the market we always said it is a two year exercise it does not happen overnight and then but we made progress we never stopped we did not change approach so from that point of view i am quite confident that eventually we will be able to announce the right or the right acquisitions so neil then on the 1st question i think it is an interesting angle that you come from when you come from the working capital and the risk profile to the smes i think we see now that smes volumes are coming down in the 2nd quarter just for a simple reason because most of the businesses have been and curfews have been have been just shut that does not mean they reopen again so i think what we are looking at in sierra fred is that temporarily there is going to be a a shift in mix away from the sna and me but i think ultimately is is even going to be a bigger portion and we can have an extremely when when you look at the  the market share it is a very small market share we cover right now so it is it is an absolute attractive and we are totally committed as you know in our customer base yes sme customer this is this is our backbone of our operation right  there is still a massive potential to grow in  in the in the in the very profitable market in the sme so how the margin is going to look like i think also here there is a time that we need to look at for the normalization but there there is no systemic structural reason why the margin for sme should have a  so i think  rightfully so our our backbone sme customer base we will even get a bigger portion of that and the profitability is going to be run exactly if not above the birthday level that we had until now thank you very much for your questions also a question regarding  the mix shift in c towards sme could you could you try and describe how much of a shift in the mix you saw and what was the effect on the yield that you saw in the c business and and sme is everything be careful and it s  it s also very niche product that has not seen an increase in demand at the moment yeah whether you have hand painted tiles that are produced in northern italy and the demand is coming back now in denmark for example is  rather questionable front and and that is maybe how you should think about it but eventually that will come back and our business is is and we are strong in s and m e business our business is stood towards s and m e so that gives you a bit of a flavor it is it is the result of the pandemic and not of a conscious mixed decision so i understand okay and the 2nd question final question is around the mna market and whether the top i mean you mentioned that you are winning markets gaining market shares and those that are losing it are typically the smaller mid size competitors that are having difficulties on the technology front connectivity and so on and and you also talk about credit risk escalating so there might be an an uptick in the mna opportunities that you see maybe you can talk about that yeah we monitor the market for many years and we are active in the market as you know but not everything that looks shiny is of interest for us and and that may be we we to fulfill our strategic targets and to continue our  gross path that we have embarked on many years ago  we do not need and mnat what we we have defined targets what we want to achieve with an mnat approach and if we find targets that are fulfilling those requirements we will be active we will become active and if not we do not so and for us the market has not significantly changed at the moment and we never looked at we always looked at also in the past that were successful in their business model in their geography geography or in their solutioning and we are not looking for a restructuring case that is not our business okay understood thank you very much thank you and next question comes from christian oeps from brotherbank please go ahead yes hello i have some more technical questions so one is concerning the decision concerning the criteria for the process of the divestment thank you so long term leases so we have seen an increase and depreciation of right of depreciation of right of used assets from 237 to 254 a 1000000 in the 2nd quarter this year and so what is the the trigger for a decision going for cpex or for long term leases and how is the current market for long term leases developing what is the main trigger for any decision in either way 2nd one is you are talking and of course there is dsl pressure and are you currently supporting some of your customers so for longer payment terms or something like that to keep them into your network and the last one is giving you guys a guidance for any kind of income from disposals in the 2nd half thank you i think your question has so two answers the 1st one is what is the decision making reasons to it and the 2nd one is what is the increase in the 2nd quarter there are there are two different there are two different reasons so that  the maybe the more technical 1st you know that we have the asset held for sale related to the disposal of the business in the uk which also includes right of use assets and as per the ias standards you have to stop depreciation at the point of signing and then keep that frozen if you like until the point of closing that is the that is the simple reason why you have the variances in the 2nd quarter and continue to have until closing has been has been executed so that is the technical part then the the question around and what what makes us deciding into one or the other parent what makes us deciding into one or the other piece main main and most important piece to it is is that because we talk most of it of locations right of of contract logistics facilities right so what is the what is the perspective of that contract logistics facility is that a facility that is an operational optimal position then then obviously we will i want to keep our flexibility most of the time back to back with customers where we say we have a five or ten year customer contract you know i am just making an example and we match that with our lease commitment it is flexibility that is that is that is driving our asset light business model right so if you ask us you know then each answer is going to be the more flexible the better we only make investment to so with a couple of ups and downs you know right now it it it became a very a very good decision you know at the in the in the current circumstances to have that space available so but this is really the exception where there is a good what are the reasons why to invest our own money in in in all the other cases  a lease agreement back to back with the customer will be preferable dso 2nd question dso we never sell on payment terms we do not this is regardless of any pressure demand or anything like that we sell because we have a very good service we are fully operational we are competitive in the market we are not we are not selling on terms ok that is clear and the last one i did not write down the last one can you make it long term and income from disposals zero income from disposals in the 1st half no in the 2nd half zero in the 2nd half i will be we have a 2nd term we have a 2nd real estate portfolio is out for sale i do not expect material impact on the pnl out of that so it is going to be less than 10000000 okay thank you very much thank you the next question comes from someone named neena beakyani from bank of america please go ahead well as the impact on volume from lower perishes or so as that normalizes how we should be thinking about it in terms of in three q and the 2nd half of the year and then secondly what have you seen from the digital forwarders during the covid crisis and have you seen a higher or lower presence from them during the crisis let me let me answer your question like the the latter question i do not know what digital forwarders are  but i would believe our digital solutions got a lot of pick up during the crisis we have not seen many of our competitors in general being active or aggressive in the market i would say a handful have been the rest somehow disappeared and i am not exaggerating so i will not name any and i will not give any comments on on single forwarders the quantification of the benefits from perishables 1st of all perishables a low low margin  business and we had less perishables  13rd less approximately volume 13rd less perishables in the 1st semester that led to the cargo mix to a higher yield independent or whether charter was available or required or the rate spiked or not we believed that this perishable volume comes back gradually in the 2nd semester and thus the mix would re instate with a lower yield so the seventy to 85 swiss francs per 100 kilos will become a reality also all because of the cargo mix with 13rd of our total i hope that helps i hope that helps the last question comes from sebastian fogle from ubs please go ahead hello i got two questions the 1st one will be on our contract logistics you mentioned there your costs or your expenses came down quite a fair bit i was wondering i was wondering we do not look at conversion rates per region because it depends on the region our customers apply on where to you know invoice and and pay transport bills so it is skewd be careful we have a we have a profit sharing model so that is within or internally between regions so that will not really help conversion rate for sure is influenced by the performance of the different business units and yes in quarter two air freight or air logistics has been extremely successful the the majority of the cost is people colleagues and the 2nd cost factor is lease i gave an answer on the lease already because fifty or a bit more of our contracts are all back to back we dedicated it with single customers so the fixed cost coverage is usually part of our contracts so that is not an exposure and the rest is capacity and we we so east with the volume very well yes we did not have a mass layoff and we stated so many times it is not necessary because from the beginning of the pandemic we said this would be in a situation that would that is limited by time it would not end up in  in a permanent situation and that is exactly what we see many of the operations are back i mentioned that only twelve operations out of more than 600 contracts were excised still locked down and eleven and out of them are in one country because some infrastructures have not opened yet and the rest is fully operational or has started to become operational again maybe not as three shift operation or weekend shifts but if you look into china and china is maybe a we can learn from china or asia because they went through this pandemic very early and and gradually we have full employment in our  operations in china we have additional shifts introduced in our line feeding automotive production line services spare parts services and we see an increasing and strong demand for a lot of goods out of china and therefore we see that a lot of our customers start picking up in volume again is this v t w zero or whatever letter forget it but it is not as fast as we thought but the slump was not as severe as we anticipated before us but so i hope that helps to answer your question it is personal cost is the main factor and we are almost in full employment again in contract logistics that means we have a gross profit related to that activity and the rest is lease cost and our idle capacity has not changed significantly we are below three in idle capacity that is a leading indicator in our industry thank you sebestian gentlemen that was the last question thank you zandra ladies and gentlemen logistics is people business and we are proud of our people they have managed this crisis extremely well and we are honored by our customers their loyalty and their business that they awarded to us during the last especially last quarter we will see how we progress over the next quarter quarter three and we are looking forward to talking to you again middle of october and in the meantime stay healthy do not travel too much do not forget to use masks because we need you as end consumers like 1000000s and 1000000000s of others because and consumers drive our business model and we want to see a strong quarter three when we talk next thank you very much and talk to you again soon have a nice summer bye but and talk to you again soon have a nice summer bye but ladies and gentlemen the conference is now over thank you for choosing coral school and thank you for participating in the conference you may now disconnect your lines",

opening of bell the opening bell and they are available on our website www enagas es mister antonio llarden chairman of enagas will host the presentation and we expect this conference to last around 25 minutes and then we will open a q a session during which we will try as always to answer any questions as well as possible thank you for your attention and now i will hand the floor to the president mister antonio llarden good morning ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for joining us today i am accompanied at this conference by chief executive officer marcelino oreja secretary general rafael piqueras cfo borja garcia alarcon and the investor relations team by his manager mister antonio velazquez gaztelu and cesar garcia del rio we are holding this meeting with masks so i do apologize for you since you cannot hear us correctly but i hope you can hear us and follow us correctly we held the general shareholders meeting barely a month ago review the most relevant issues on the progress of the company and during which we explained how we are facing the situation stemming from the covid nineteen pandemic the conclusions are clear we have resisted well in the 1st phase of the pandemic and the results that we are presenting today reflect this resilience as we are in the equator of the year let me briefly remind you the objectives for the year i will also make a summary of the projects over the company in the field of decarbonization and our commitment to the energy transition and finally i will do an overview of our dividend policy as we have been telling you since the beginning of the pandemic our priorities have been and continue to be to protect the safety health and well being of our professionals and their families and to continue to provide with full normality the supply of natural gas which is an essential service for security the security of our country during these troubled months enagas has resisted well very well and this resistance has been possible because among all the things we have implemented a rigorous contingency plan even before the declaration of the state of emergency as i was i also explained back in time when we did the results of a presentation of the 1st quarter this plan has been it has been very efficient and thanks to its implementation the gas system is operating with full normality i will not dwell on the security measures that we have implemented in for people because i already explained them at the general shareholders meeting and also in the previous presentation of results of the 1st quarter but i do want to stress that we are still applying the maximum prudence and prevention with a very detailed follow up to minimize risks of contagion among our professionals at the infrastructure level let me that the spanish gas system has worked and continues to work normally despite the adverse conditions without incidents neither rely neither labor related technical operational with 100 percent availability 24 hours a day every day in the 1st half of the year the production of the regas plants has increased by seventeen compared to the 1st six months of last year 2019 also in spain we have unloaded a total of 126 lng ships that is an increase of twelvefive with regard to the same period of the previous year for this month of july for the total of the month of the month up to 31st december we are expecting 24 21 unloads the contracted capacity of natural gas storage is or also at a historical record nearly 12000 kilometers of gas pipelines and compression stations have operated at full technical and commercial capacity and availability also our international subsidiaries have worked and continue to work to guarantee the services and the energy supply in the countries in which gas operations are carried out and all of them have also implemented their respective contingency plans of which further details will be provided in the presentation this resistant has been shown in the results obtained in the 1st six months of this year which are in line with what we expected and are even slightly better than our expectations let me comment rapidly the figures that are more important we have obtained profit after tax of €236300000 which is an increase of ninefour compared to the 1st six months of 2019 mainly this is is this is a consequence of the nonrecurring financial profit amounting €18400000 and that is due to the exchange rate difference generated by the purchase of dollars for the acquisition of the phase two of tallgrass which i already mentioned in q one i i do apologize because with the mask and the glasses i cannot it is difficult for me to speak and to continue the result of our affiliates amounted to €76200000 the nega the negative impact of the covid effects on the regulated business totaled €6400000 in the rcs we also have a high liquidity position and we do maintain a solid financial structure without significant maturity debts debts maturity until 22 and with more than eighty of our debt at fixed rate let me remind you that our rating agencies standard poor is and fitch confirmed back in time the rating of enagas at bbb with a stable perspective that is in line with other similar companies and european tsos as explained in the presentation of q one the company has intensified the control plan and savings in financial and operating expenses avoiding everything that is not essential in order to maintain business continuity active essential for the activity and employment i do apologize but i have to take off my glasses or the mask because i cannot read the current situation for 2020 means that we have to be very cautious very cautious if in future projections in the 2nd quarter taking into account the situation of uncertainty generated by covid nineteen and in line with international recommendation of the regulator european securities and markets authority enagas has carried out an impairment test on its main investments that in accordance with ias 36 this analysis was validated by an independent expert which is duff and phelps the conclusion of this analysis redo reviewed also by our auditor is that it is not necessary to make any correction to the value of this investment in enagas in enagas balance sheet the results of this analysis allows us to consider that we do can maintain the objectives and commitments established for this year 2020 estimating the net profit at €440000000 we also maintain our commitment to our shareholders remuneration with an increase in the dividend of five with respect to what was paid in 2019 and i will pause on this pol on this point later regarding the changes in demand and for natural gas i am going to focus on the conventional aspect because it is the most representative of the performance of industry and consumption you know that demand for gas for electricity generation depends on other factors really such as the availability of renewable energy water gas et cetera in any case you can access permanent detail information on these fluctuations in gas demand on the company is website t to know the evolution of the demand conventional demand as i said in april at the strictest moment of confinement stood at approximately 76 compared to the same period last year nineteen 2019 since then a progressive recovery has occurred and today we are already around 92 if we compare it with the same period in 2019 we hope that this recovery in demand will be consolidated slowly progressively in the 2nd semester because this will be a good reflection of the fact that the industrial fabric of our country is also recovering in terms of international affiliates tall grass in these half yearly results and taking into account that the crisis caused by covid nineteen is having a global impact we have incorporated as you see detailed information on our main affiliates especially the north american company tallgrass energy allow me to remind you you are aware of that that on 17th of april we ceased to extend our investment in the company obtaining thirtytwo of the shareholding so in this presentation and i am not going to repeat everything you have extensive information on the performance of the north american energy market in these last few months like price performance demand data current situation and future projects in the case of tap the project is progressing as planned and this has already been 96four implemented it is expected to commence during the last quarter of this year yesterday a very concrete technical piece of news of tap is that the last welding of the last pipe was occurred was was carried out in the pipeline that is linked in italy to the high pressure grade of snam so that is a good news actually with respect to the south peru gas pipeline i update this situation the arbitration proceeding commenced in icsid is following the normal course on july nineteen the peruvian state filed its defense and currently our international legal advisers are working on the next steps to follow according to this arbitration calendar as you know in relation to peru on july fifteen ten days ago one week ago a new prime minister was appointed in peru mister pedro cateriano and several ministers were replaced including the ministry of energy and mines at enagas we maintain our willingness to reach an amicable agreement with the peruvian state in order to end the arbitration procedure after reviewing the main topics of the semester and i am will discuss on our commitment on de carbonation de carbonization i am sorry the european commission has presented the communication hydrogen strategy for climate neutral europe two weeks ago which includes investment of between €188000 and €400000 in renewable hydrogen production capacity until 2050 the spanish government is working on the same line to have hydrogen road maps and biogas and storage strategy in the 2nd semester of last year last week the ecologic transition ministry and demographic challenge ministry launched the decarbonization strategy at the long term at enagas we have are actively participating i am sorry in proposing specific measures and prior public consultation of these roadmaps promoted as i was saying by the ministry of ecological transition and demographics challenge presided over by vice president teresa ribera in the case of european level together with tsos coming from nine member states we presented on july seventeen a report in brussels called european hydrogen backbone plan to develop as specific hydrogen transport infrastructure in europe according to this report which is a fast reflection report on these matters existing gas infrastructures can be adopted to transport hydrogen at an affordable cost without any kind of relevant technical problems as for specific projects in the field of hydrogen as we said in the 1st quarter we are working on the green crane project with other companies especially snam which aims at developing a hydrogen corridor from southern europe to the north which was presented in brussels as a candidate for a project of common european interest it includes a series of initiatives that will be later studied that will allow countries of southern europe to be positioned as benchmarks in the generation of green hydrogen these project will allow us to decarbonize more sectors to strengthen the european energy system and to position spain as a gateway for hydrogen in europe with existing storage and transport infrastructure that have already been built in a digit in addition to hydrogen we are working on other specific projects to contribute to decarbonization promoting the use of lng as fuel under specific circumstances in this area a few weeks ago the european union has announced that it will support enagas in the development of sixteen lng vehicle support points biogas and hydrogen within the econet project also a few days ago the european union granted the full amount of the subsidy requested for two specific supply lng to ships projects bunkering in barcelona and algeciras in the south in southern spain i mentioned these specific projects because they demonstrate according to us the support of the european union for the role of lng but also other gases and renewable gases in the decarbonization of transport sub sectors especially maritime transport in this presentation you can see the acknowledgement to the company in the field of sustainability and i would like to highlight once again the commitment of each and every enagas professional to sustainability in its broadest sense i am not going to repeat the figures that we provide you with the results presentation in february but enagas has a plan to reduce co two emissions with the milestones in 2030 2040 that will culminate in 5020 with the neutralization of carbon zero carbon so we continue with this plan obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pause before one of our priorities which is our commitment to shareholder remuneration i remind you that these times many companies were not able to face their commitments and meet their commitment i remind you that at the general shareholders meeting held on june thirty the payment of a complimentary dividend plan was approved for 2019 of ¢96 per share which became effective on july nine and w which is in line with our annual dividend commitment in 2019 of onesixty per share as i have mentioned the result of stress test and the impairment test performed by the company in this climate of great uncertainty enable us to reaffirm with the information we have now our dividend commitment for 2020 of one68 per share which would present an increase of five and to maintain our announced dividend policy for 2020 2026 to conclude once again in a context in which uncertainty is the only certainty the company is clear about its priorities we have resisted these agitated 1st few months and the results that were presented today are a reflection of this with the data that we have today we believe that we can maintain all of our commitments for 2020 and we will continue to work on new future projects thank you for your attention if you have questions now please feel free to ask the team we will endeavor to answer to them as fully as we can thank you very much thank you mister president ladies and gentlemen if you want to ask a question please dial dash one on your phone to cancel push dash tip 1st question javier suarez of coming from mediobanca mister suarez you have the floor good morning everyone three questions 1st on hydrogen the government has presented its strategy into 2050 and it seems clear that hydrogen should have a relevant role in the effort to decarbonize economy by 2050 the question for you is do you believe that this new strategy at european and spanish level for hydrogen is a substantial change for the profile of the company is it is it a game changer for enagas should enagas change its business plan as a consequence of this opportunity and deregulating and government and entities and investors should they see enagas with different eyes as a consequence of these facts that it would be a network to transport a commodity that is going to immediately reduce e emissions 2nd question tallgrass in the united states do you see any negative impact as a consequence of the difficulties or the possible difficulties of gas and oil off takers in the united states can you give us some idea of what you see operationally because these have been very difficult months for these companies and the 3rd question is could you give us an estimate on the gas consumption in spain for 2020 as a whole thank you thank you very much mister javier suarez from mediobanca 1st question yes we start with our opinion we do consider that the transition energy transition process that all the european countries and the eu as such have on the table will not be done if we do not contribute in a twofold with renewable gases something that until now has almost no weight hydrogen biogas et cetera and even decarbonization process in sub sectors where it will be difficult to electrify lng there plays a role and i was saying a twofold because the other contribution is that we are seeing that the storage and transport infrastructures for gas in europe are very good to maintain the role of gas in the transition process not everybody considers is going to be key but also in order to serve as the basis for this hydrogen development and for renewable gases projects we are convinced about that and in the 1st documents issued by the european commission they state that they do believe that that the tsos will play a relevant role in this field and the contacts that we are having with the ministry of ecological transition allow us to think that once we see all the public opinion processes are over and public consultation are over we will play a major role there and furthermore we do want to play that role so for the time being as you have seen we are developing some minor specific projects and most of them we can call them proof of concept projects that is possible to produce transport hydrogen and decarbonize and honestly i do believe that our tso role and not only ours but other the role of other countries in the coming years will change slightly from being only limited to these transport and storage of natural gas tsos in europe or at least the ones with this aim in mind will do all this and also we will compliment that role with amongst other actors and everything that has to do with hydrogen development right now and i can not and no one can tell you specific figures and timelines this is not going to be any immediate process this is going to take time in the coming 23 or four years this will develop and we will start to have well i have already told you we have already a few projects and some with the support from the ea eu but they are small projects so i think that in the coming 234 years as i was saying we will see how a general map of activity in this field w will be outlined and also we will also see a calendar and then we will have to adapt of course to the instructions issued by the government and the commission or the parliament but i can clearly tell you that enagas is willing to collaborate we have been thinking about this since quite some time we are already working on it so i conclude and i apologize for such a long answer i do believe that our role as a tso as the the role of other tsos will change in a positive sense in the coming years probably having new tasks to undertake 2nd question i have got the cf cfo he is wearing glasses reading glasses and his mask and he has got the same problem he is taking out he is taking out his mask and he will answer thank you president thank you all good morning javier let me answer four relevant points that are included in the presentation that the president has stressed in his presentation 1st we see a recovery of oil and gas prices and recovery in the production in the relevant basins for the oil and gas transport in tallgrass 2nd transported volumes according to july figures and the perspectives of the company for august and september we see that the transport will be in line with the volumes transported pre covid three as it has been explained in the presentation and it is very important we have finished the construction of the cheyenne connector and the cheyenne hub and this is a fundamental piece for getting the west to east section from rocky and therefore meeting the objectives of the budget maybe as a 4th point before going to the figures let me confirm that tall grass is an asset that has to behave with limited sensitivity to the current situation of the u s market that as you know has been under much stress so with the information available as of today the free cash flow for tallgrass for the year end taking into account the $170000000 and having invested in the cheyenne connector and in cheyenne hub gives us a net debt debt ratio four one the payment of the dividend €114000000 is a ratio of net debt to ebitda ratio of around fourfive foursix this is compatible with the liquidity position of the company which is higher than $1000000000 and as the company has no relevant maturities until 2022 and that is fully aligned with the long term model with the capex investment included as we have explained in other occasions capex that becomes ebitda at a multiple of six times ebitda and that net debt ratio is the one i was telling you it is important to stress that with information we have now we have no changes whatsoever in the dividends announced for 2020 26 neither in the yield of the investment communicated to the market and as a summary of the description of the business of the company this is fully in line with the long term model we have said when we acquired tallgrass and when we shared this information with the market thank you borja and let answer the 3rd question by javier suarez consumption as we have said with regards to industrial consumption the consumption that we call for of the conventional market we touched bottom april 76 of the demand compared to last year i have given you the figure of right now 92 but if we could see the evolution of the 26 27 days of july of this year the demand conventional demand would be at 93 therefore from now until the year end we do think that these conventional demand might little by little this will not be on a sudden basis but it will evolve towards full normality but being cautious as we want to be we have done all our forecasts in budget et cetera with the idea of having a decrease of the total demand in all lines of ten for the year a decrease of ten in order to be more conservative but of course we do see that the conventional demand in almost all the sectors except for one services but in the other twelve sectors in which we divide commercially speaking this demand they are at a v shape of recovery which is quite clear and the average would be at 92 93 so today we are much more optimistic than a few months ago when we presented the 1st quarter we were suffering the full impact of the decrease in the demand and we did not we were not even certain that we would reach rock bottom we have reached that bottom and we are not our figures of the demand that i dare to say that are quite normal because i think that last year was an exceptional year with regards to gas demand and therefore comparing to last year is very strict if we can put it this way so we are optimistic with being cautious as i always say because we are living a context of a great uncertainty but i do believe that gas demand industrial gas demand and all its by products tankers et cetera et cetera is going is behaving well and even tankers right now tankers are above the consumption of last year though it is weight in the total load of the industrial demand is small well i think we have replied to all the all the three questions that mister suarez asked spanish thank you next question comes from alberto gandolfi from goldman sachs mister gandolfi you have the floor good morning c coming from goldman sachs it was a little bit cut off so three quick questions at tallgrass could you elaborate on the gains ebitda net benefits for the 1st half of the year and probably you can explain the word what was the evolution compared to last year the 2nd question is there are many items and the affiliates that move around so could you please explain the difference of 76000000 for the 1st half but the bigger contribution of tallgrass for the 2nd part the situation would be improved and hydrogen again i am sorry to repeat that but we still do not know when we will be benefiting from these investments but the european strategy clearly states that their strategy is up until 2024 and then another strategy for after 2024 so would it be reasonable to assume that by 2024 from now to 2024 we will be we will have more visibility on this topic are we going to invest more in hydrogen as a regulated asset in spain would it be possible for us to think that this would contribute to increase dividends after 2024 thank you very much thank you mister gandolfi i think the 21st questions will be answered by mister borja garcia alarcon and i will respond to your 3rd question borja you have the floor thank you good morning alberto the contribution for equivalence for the entire years before the purchase base allocation a guidance of €186000000 that could be divided into two parts of that year 74000000 for the 1st part and 110 for the 2nd half of the year we need to indicate that the contribution of tallgrass is different so the contribution for the 1st semester is €3800000 2nd €53400000 so the difference between these two from a business point of view is explained because the difference between the contribution of net income of tallgrass for the 1st half and the difference with the 2nd semester because the sec the 1st semester before the apb was $22000000 for the 2nd will be €555000000 this is due to the recruding of rex as foreseen once cheyenne connector was implemented secondly the debts in terms of that there is no difference but there is an important adjustment produced as a result of transferring u s gaap by tallgrass accounts to irfs irfs which is the real estate tax is paid in january and then u s gaap is done throughout the year so for the 1st half the impact was negative due to the $3100000 difference and the 2nd half the impact is going to be positive $16200000 which which is explained by the fact of changing the results and moving from threeeight to 53four so just to explain a little bit more about the ebitda alberto was asking about this we have an expected ebitda of $800000000 a bdi of $300000000 financial expenses expenses of one $181000000 and this accounts for $65000000 multiplied by exchange rates is $250000000 that i said at the beginning that was that were necessary to build up all this thank you about borja alberto in terms of the 3rd question we think that we have to say things orderly from now to the end of the year we will have that roadmap of renewable gas and hydrogen this is what the ecological ecology transition ministry set to us in terms of the european union p plans i do not dare giving you dates but between 21 22 there is important paper launched by the commission will have been discussed touched about by stakeholders the european parliament et cetera so we will have probably a bigger roadmap many tsos as i said before are working at the european hydrogen backbone plan and we are working together for that i think by the end of this year and up until the end of 2022 the roadmaps will be clear i believe at the same time all the tsos are thinking to come up with a concrete project which will not have a high investment economic impact but these are a proof of project concept purchase that will allow us to generate hydrogen practically or renewable gas how they are transported who are end users et cetera this is important all the hydrogen roadmap should be in the framework of the energy transition plan which means that changes cannot happen upstream and the midstream without having clear in mind who are the end users it is meaningless for us to say i am going to generate hydrogen at a specific and who is going to consume this well i do not know obviously this is what the european union and each country is trying to do meaning having things orderly implemented meaning we will be part of the chain but someone has to be at the end of the chain saying i need and i want this hydrogen for consumption so between 2020 2022 23 and probably 23 we will be able to implement concrete projects with end users that are interested in that and companies like enagas are really into that providing you with figures as i was saying at the beginning is impossible for us to do now i hope that by the end of the year because the roadmap will be prepared we will have a calendar and the volume of projects and mind but in europe i think we will have to wait until 2022 at least so we can have a concrete working plan think about what happened in spain when in spain when the gas energy plan was produced this planning was discussed between twenty the year 2020 and 2001 i am sorry in 2002 the 1st concrete document of strategic plan was produced in spain at that time for gas and that plan was started to be implemented practically in 2005 2006 enagas came up with a 1st strategic plan for the total development of this help plan in march 2007 so between the approval in 2002 and the practical implementation five years elapsed in this specific case because authorizations were required approval were required was required et cetera in the case of hydrogen things are going to be quicker probably but this kind of infrastructure requires a deadline which is more or less long for its implementation if some years ago if you would ask me if we would have a paper from the european union from now to 2050 and saying will we have a hydrogen roadmap in the next month if you would have asked me this two years ago i would have said i do not know now i can tell you yes it is hard though to tell you when the project calendar will be created especially the rules of the game to know who wants hydrogen the speed of each country it is not likely for all the countries to do the same time the same thing at the same time we will have to see i do not want to elaborate on on this because i know there are more questions so thank you mister gandolfi for your question spanish thank you next question will be done by jose ruiz from barclays you have the floor good morning from barclay is three questions 1st could you clarify impact of 12300000 positive in the gasoducto sur where do they come from in 2nd quarter secondly after hearing you about tallgrass there is a plan for cost reduction missing i think but i understand that is a project for growth i just wanted to for you to confirm this point if you could of course and thirdly and getting back to hydrogen i wanted to know if within that roadmap there is an initiative of have you heard of any initiative on the side of the spanish government to create a hub it is something which is quite in fashion and portugal the netherlands and the u k have already presented their initiatives thank you spanish thank you very much jose javier ruiz the 1st two the questions will be replied by borja borja garcia alarcon you have the floor thank you president jose javier gsp two impacts 1st a nonrecurring expense in 2019 as a consequence of the delay that we introduced in the accounts waiting for the resolution of the arbitration to be issued in 2022 instead of 2021 that represents the next an expense this year we do not have that effect but we have a positive effect because we get closer to 2022 date that we have not changed so the addition to those two impacts are the €12000000 that appear in the p l and as for tg the efforts in in operational expenses and efficiency are the ones that are in the budget described in the previous figures i have provided thank you borja as far as hydrogen is concerned yes we have presented in two different lines always with the support of the government we have already explained it explained it in the green crane and even with snam and other companies we are talking about a possible hub for the south of europe connected on the side of enagas but also on snam is side with the north of africa so that is a possible hub is perfectly outlined there that could be useful of course when the roadmap in spain is over we will see the possibility for our country from different stances together with portugal of course will be part of this hub and at the same time let us not forget that it is very possible for the 1st steps to use hydrogen in the different countries within the energy transition plan most of them will have initial project that will be internal p per country it is what i was saying before we might have a place with someone or with we have which will be the final user users of this hydrogen and then there are countries companies such as ours and other companies that are willing to collaborate in these projects so the idea of moving between countries will take place that is for sure we are just doing our analysis but i am almost fully convinced that the 1st projects will be of if we can put it this way of a national nature per country in very specific points locations and knowing that there is an end user or end users that are there already willing to immediately receive that hydrogen or that renewable gas and i think jose javier we have been able to cover your questions thank you there are more questions yes let us move now to the questions in english this question will come from harry wyburd of bank of america please go ahead your line is open hi m morning everyone it is harry wyburd from from bank of america and so 33 questions from me please so firstly just focusing on the domestic business you mentioned this a pretty small 6400000 impact in the 1st half i wondered if you could let us know what you think the full year impact of volume decline will be on regulated revenues on the domestic business and then if i remember correctly i think under the new regulation the rcs in future years out to 2026 was actually based on the rcs this year if i have understood correctly so i wondered could you confirm that that understanding is correct and would that mean if the rcs was lower this year that that would have a a knock on effects on future years as well or have i misunderstood something there and then the 2nd question just on on your affiliates overall i just wondered if you could remind us how what percentage of your affiliate income is in us dollars i believe most of it is dollarized obviously the the dollar is weakened somewhat over there were the last few weeks so i am just interested to get a reminder of how much is in dollars and and then thirdly i am afraid it is a it is an obligatory hydrogen question but a a specific one i think in the in the hydrogen backbone report you and the your tso colleagues quantified the total capex spend at at a midpoint of about €40000000000 up to 2040 if i remember correctly if if i just eyeball the map that you published in the in the slides today i think is on slide 26 it looks like you are roughly somewhere around a 3rd of the of the size of the network just by very approximate guess do you think that is a fair guess at what your share of the 40000000000 spend would be many thanks okay thank you sir for your question the 21st question the cfo will give you a detailed answer thank you mister president concerning rcs the merged impact is expected at $22000000 and net $17000000 and for 21 26 according to your question the net impact in the p l account at the bottom line is €9000000 on average per annum and concerning the contribution of affiliates for the equivalent ninety 25 is in dollars because we are talking about quintero tsp tallgrass tgp altamira and they are all dollarized as you mentioned so the percentage of the contribution of dollars to the p l account is quite high thank you borja and to conclude with the hydrogen question in our backbone plan document investment figures are given twenty or 60000000000 for in for for the entirety of europe the document we are talking about now is a 1st reflection is a draft it is not an investment detailed plan but from a technic from a technical point of view we should bear in mind that in europe as a whole and in spain the infra the gas infrastructure network is perfectly feasible for it to transport hydrogen with some nuances regulatory technical questions must be sorted out in terms of the blending so the percentage of hydrogen can be used in one grid m mixed with lng this is the 1st phase the different countries historically have different technical standards some strictly technical questions are related to some part of the grid where hydrogens will be used and in this at this point technical measures should be taken for compressor stations for example an investment is necessary we need to see if sections of the network will transport only hydrogen or or they transport a blended more investments probably are necessary for reaching a consumption point or a generation point but this level of detail has not being included in the plans that have been discussed nor have them be they have been included in the national road maps we have a general overview of how renewable gas will be used the 2nd point is a calendar with some obligations that countries impose themselves and the 3rd step is to see what does what are the specific projects that will be developed or implemented within the road map this is where we are now at now the investment figures given by the european union have a broad margin because they reach 2050 so as you can see it is not easy for us to give a final figure now and by heart i can tell you the european union is talking about 1000000 tons of hydrogen in 2050 we will have to see whether or not this figure is expected or is higher or lower and we need to see what each country is going to do but this will be will have to be included in the energy road map chosen by the european union the european union have to at least reach an agreement with generators transporters and end consumers of hydrogen or renewable gas without which transition will never happen very likely like i said before this will come out initially from projects we are now p promoting now with other companies and all the stakeholders come together taste stakeholders come together so it is a specific project in a specific region with the specific calendars in my presentation i mentioned some of them or a few of them and in the near future governments will set annual calendars for projects we could elaborate on that but i know there are more questions let us go to the next question now thank you sir for your question our next question will come from james brand from deutsche bank please go ahead alright good morning thanks for taking my questions i i had a couple of questions on tallgrass and then a follow up on hydrogen so on tallgrass you gave quite clear guidance for this year which i think assuming i heard the numbers correctly came came down to 56 to 57000000 of pre ppa net income i was wondering whether you could give some expectations for the next year just so we can get a feel for how some of those positives that are coming through in h two might look in in a more normal year and then the 2nd question is i i was wondering what you felt the biggest risk was on on tallgrass in in the slides you had some volume expectations for the main basins that that you are in that looked broadly that volumes had come down a bit but overall woods would recover a little bit and particularly in a in a couple of the basins and you would start to see some some growth again is what is the main risk that oil prices stay low and and and that growth just does not come through and you see contracting pressure and i was within that is there a particular point of oil prices that would be that would start to make you a bit more concerned if they stayed at forty or maybe they have to drop more but appreciate those a few sub questions within that but just an idea of what you think the biggest risks are for tallgrass and then the follow up and hydrogen i mean i appreciate the last answer around uncertainties around the cost and potentially maybe not having to spend that much on on the network to enable it for hydrogen is is the biggest investment then if it does come through adding new parts to the pipeline network to connect top renewable clusters if that is direct the direction that we that we go through is that is that the biggest investment opportunity of hydrogen if you actually have to start to extend the network some context on that would be of interest thank you well spanish well thank you i think that cfo will answer the whole of the questions that you have raised with quite some detail thank you president the contribution of tallgrass yes to the point of the combination between ppa 2020 will be €56000000 as we said before that will stabilize and even grow in the future at around €100000000 before ppa and after ppa that figure will be around 60000000 with regards to long term risks for tallgrass in the model the highest risk well not risk the mile the biggest milestone is meeting the capex objectives to build ebitdas that we expect for 2024 25 and 26 in this sense maybe the current situation shows that there are projects that compete that will not evolve so we have got good opportunities within the company for now we do not have anything specific but there are good forecasts but on the other side that is the main risk for the future yes as borja was saying the investment and development plan for tallgrass we have when we follow is good but the negative circumstances of the north american market in the world market have represented a small competitive advantage that which is the one that the ceo and borja were talking about we were talking about together because there are new p possible p projects new projects that will compete well they have disappeared because of the market situation and that provides a clear advantage to the actors that are suddenly installed to just tallgrass actors that have got as you very well know an important part of their contracts that are insured so tallgrass is selling that line they have foreseen to make the most in the future of of the new opportunities that may appear with minor investments that will not be starting from scratch investments because that entails more projects of permits et cetera but they will use a very widespread network and that which is already present in the united states they will use that and with not big investments they will be able to enter into new markets so in that sense of course there is always a risk in telling these kinds of projects but we do believe that the development of the activity for tallgrass with the figures we have as interesting and we do rely on that leg i do not know if we have got more questions i am told that there are no more questions zero yes yes yes sorry i do apologize there are more questions so let us give the floor to the next questions thank you our next question comes from olivier van doosselaere from exane please go ahead your line is open yes good morning and and thank you very much for taking for taking our questions i just have two on my side 1st one is going to be on on the guidance do you still stick to the 440000000 to four year on year growth but really you have done nine in h one maybe with some one offs that might not have been expected at the start of the year and for h two you expect actually a big step up from the contribution from tallgrass so i wonder if you could indicate whether or not you would agree that the guidance seems to be particularly cautious for for this year and then the 2nd one apologies because this is probably your your 10th question on on hydrogen but it it looks like by 2030 the biggest 1st part of demand will actually just be the blending of hydrogen in the transport and the natural gas mix i think the documents are talking a potential ten to to twenty of of hydrogen being mixed in the in the total blend snam for example i think has already mentioned that for them there is probably around 13rd of their network that would actually need upgrade to be able to cope with with the chemical and physical implications of that level of hydrogen in the network have you looked at the state of your network and can you give us a feel in terms of the possible need for for replacements or upgrading of your network that might be necessary for you to be able to handle such a level of hydrogen and then could you also tell us if we see some accelerated replacements of your bike in order for hydrogen to be able to fuel through your network and better if that should be actually booked on your side as as as as capex or or will that actually be expensed as as opex under your current regulation okay mister van doosselaere thank you for your question 1st question about the guidance the cfo will give you detailed information or precise information borja thank you president olivier we keep the guidance 440000000 the behavior was a little better than expected but the facing the entire devolution of the market the forecast for the year is 440 and we are trusting enough in this and there is in terms of the 2nd question the chief executive officer is going go to dwell on them marcelino you have the floor yeah we have to understand that the current network apart from the the pipeline accepts twenty ten twenty of hydrogen we need to understand that and to generate twenty of hydrogen or natural gas that is consumed in spain now as an hydrogen a great deal of investments will be necessary for the generation of this hydrogen we are far from being real now and we need to implement this in our unit and we are implementing studying that and if we think about 2035 2040 having 100 percent hydrogen network we will have some of the gas the pipelines that exist today but new will have to be thought about and implemented the necessary improvement for the network or the pipeline to cope with the twenty of hydrogen we are far from this being true thank you very much spanish let us move on to the last question our last question will come from antonella bianchessi from citi please go ahead yes hello just most of my questions have been answered but i just wanted to come back on hydrogen you said something that i found extremely interesting that you will start your investments and when there will be an off taker for your hydrogen potential so i wonder can you give us an idea of the timing i mean i think that the message is that the international interconnection which are not fully regulated will have to be contracted before you will commit on investment then you think this would be a possibility spanish thank you antonella let me reply there are different elements that are under the same umbrella 1st the investment in our networks i am talking about enagas but you can think about of any other tso in europe so investments will be done in will depend fully on the instructions that we may receive from the regulators for example it is already been said that the use or more or less hydrogen blended with la natural gas was it something that can be done since the beginning well that dep depend on the technical specifications and norms that are quite simple this is not complex but it will be the regulators the ones that will say yes i want that in spain or in that france or that in italy we have a higher percentage of hydrogen within the natural gas for a certain amount of time there technically speaking we perfectly know what is the investments that we have to do and very probably they will be investments that will be regulated by the regulator this as a general response then the use of hydrogen specifically for specific projects not so much to have a general blend in a in the grid depends on if there are off takers companies clients that want to use this hydrogen and that they can get this hydrogen to generate electricity such as fuel for their equipments or whatever these projects will have to stem from these road maps we are talking about in order to give you an example we have got a specific project to generate transport and use hydrogen in the balearic islands and that is a specific project in which the ultimate off taker will be a a a company transporting passengers and that is a clear example that that does not need specific regulation but using in the spanish grid or the french or the italian grid part of of hydrogen as blended with natural gas to among other things to reduce the co two emissions that will require from a technical regulations where we are involved of course the ministry is involved and the ministry has asked our opinion about what are the technical measures that we will have will have to be implemented in this calendar to be used renewable gases that is work in process under process under progress but as of july we do not have more details as i was replying to a similar question before i think that by the end of this year and the end of 2021 or 2022 i think that this map this technical regulatory map will be fully finished in europe and in parallel we will see specific projects appearing and thank you antonella there are no more questions i have i am told so apart from the minor problems of the mask and the reading glasses i think that we have been able to reply to your questions we do want to thank you for the interest on the company and the the relation investors relations team if you need more information will give you detailed information if you require it from them thank you spanish so with those this conference on the 1st semester 2020 results of enagas thank you",
            "prediction": "good morning ladies and gentlemen be very welcome to the results presentation of enagas for the 1st semester of 2020 the results were released this morning before the opening bell and they are available on our website www wwwnegas es mister antonio arden chairman of enagas will host the presentation and we expect this conference good morning ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for joining us today i am accompanied at this conference by chief executive officer officer matilda nereca secretary general we are holding this meeting with masks so i do apologize you cannot hear us correctly but i hope you can hear us and follow us correctly we held the general shareholders meeting barely a month ago review the most relevant information and we explained how we are facing the situation stemming from the covid nineteen pandemic the conclusions are clear we have resisted well in the 1st phase of the pandemic and the results that we are presenting today reflect this resilience as we are in the equator of the year let me briefly remind you the objectives for the year as we have been telling you since the beginning of the pandemic our priorities have been and continue to be to protect the safety health and well being of our professionals and their families and to continue to provide during these troubled months gas has resisted very well and this resistance has been possible because among other things we have implemented a rigorous contingency plan even before the declaration of the state of emergency as i was also explaining back in time when we did the results this plan has been very efficient and thanks to its implementation the gas system is operating with full normality i will not dwell on the security measures that we have implemented in for people because i already explained them at the general shareholders meeting and also in the previous presentation of results of the 1st quarter but i do want to stress that we are still applying the maximum prudence let me say that the spanish gas system has worked and continues to work normally despite the adverse conditions without incidents neither labor related technical operational with 100 availability 24 hours a day everyday in the 1st half of the year the production of the regas plants has increased by seventeen compared to the 1st six months of last year 2019 also in spain we have unloaded a total of 125 lng ships that is an increase of twelvefive with regard to the same period of the previous year for this month of july we are expecting 21 a total of 21 loads the contracted capacity of natural gas storage is also at a historical record nearly 12000 kilometers of gas pipelines and compression stations have operated at full technical and commercial capacity and availability this resistance has been shown in the results obtained in the 1st six months of this year let me comment rapidly the figures that are more important we have obtained profit after tax of €233600000 which is an increase of ninefour compared to the 1st six months of 2019 mainly this is a consequence of the non recurring financial profit the results of our affiliates amounted to €18400000 that is due to the exchange rate difference generated by the purchase of dollars for the acquisition of phase two of toll grass which i already mentioned in q one i do apologize because with the mask and the glasses it is difficult for me to speak and to continue the results of our affiliates amounted to €18400000 that is due to the exchange rate difference generated by the purchase of dollars for the acquisition of phase two of toll grass which i already mentioned in q one i do apologize because with the mask and the glasses it is difficult for me to speak and to continue i have a regulated business that totals €6400000 in the rcs we also have a high liquidity position and we do maintain a solid financial structure without significant maturity debts debts above 22 at a fixed rate let me remind you that our rating agencies standard poor is and fitch confirm back in time the rating of enagas at triple b plus with a stable perspective that is inline with other similar companies and european tsos as explained in the presentation of q one the company has intensified the control plan and saved in financial and operating expenses i am sorry i have to take off my glasses or the mask because i cannot read the current situation for 2020 means that we have to be very cautious very cautious in future projections taking into account the situation of uncertainty generated by covid nineteen and in line with international recommendation of the regulator european securities and markets authority eigas has carried out an impairment test on its main investments that in accordance with ias 36 this analysis has validated by an independent expert which is duff and phelps the conclusion of this analysis reviewed also by our auditor is that it is not necessary to make any correction to the value of this investment in enagas balance sheet the results of this analysis allow us to consider that we do maintain the objectives and commitments established for this year 2020 estimating the net profit at €440000000 regarding the changes in demand for natural gas i am going to focus on the conventional aspect because it is the most representative of the performance of industry and consumption you know the demand for gas for electricity generation in any case you can access permanent detailed information on these fluctuations in gas demand on the company is website to know the evolution of the demand conventional demand as i said in april at the strictest moment of confinement stood at approximately 76 we are already around 92 if we compare it with the same period in 2019 we hope that this recovery in demand will be consolidated slowly progressively in the 2nd semester because this will be a good reflection of the overall economic recovery in terms of international affiliates tall grass and these have yearly results and taking into account that the crisis caused by covid nineteen is having a global impact we have incorporated as you see detailed information on our main affiliates especially the north american company tall grass energy let me remind you that you are aware that that has been incorporated we cease to extend our investment in the company obtaining threetwo of the shareholder is holding so in this presentation i am not going to repeat everything i have extensive information on the performance of the north american energy markets in these last few months such as price performance demand data current situation and future projects in the case of tap the project is progressing and it has already been 96four implemented it is expected to be implemented during the last water of this year yeah yesterday a very concrete technical piece of news of tap is that the last welding of the last pipe was carried out in the pipeline that is linked in italy to the high pressure great of course so that is a good news actually with respect to the south peru gas pipeline i update the situation the arbitration proceedings commenced in icsd is following the normal course on july 19th the peruvian state filed its defense and currently our international legal advisors are working on the next steps to follow according to this arbitration calendar as you know in relation to peru on july 15th ten days ago one week ago a new prime minister was appointed in peru mister pedro castillo and several ministers were replaced including the ministry of energy and mines at any rate we maintain our willingness to reach an amicable agreement with the peruvian state in order to reach an agreement after reviewing the main topics of the semester i will discuss our commitment on decarbonization decarbonization i am sorry the european commission has presented the communication a hydrogen strategy for climate neutral europe two weeks ago which includes investments of between €180000000 and €400000000 in renewable hydrogen production until 2050 the spanish government is working on the same line to have hydrogen road mats and biogas and storage strategy in the 2nd semester of last year last week the ecologic transition ministry and demographic challenge ministry launched at the long term strategy we have actively participated in proposing specific measures in prior public consultation as i was saying in promoting it as it was said by the ministry of ecological transition and demographic challenge presided over by vice president salem we presented on july seventeen a report in brussels called the european hydrogen backbone plan to develop a specific hydrogen transport infrastructure in europe according to this report which is a 1st reflection report on this matters existing gas infrastructures can be adapted to transport hydrogen at an affordable cost without any additional cost as for specific projects in the field of hydrogen as we said in the 1st quarter we are working on the green hydrogen project with other companies especially snam which aims at developing a hydrogen corridor from southern europe to the north which was presented in brussels as a candidate for a project of common european interests a series of initiatives that will be later studied that will allow countries of southern europe to be positioned as benchmarks in the generation of green hydrogen these projects will allow us to decarbonize more sectors to strengthen the european energy system and to position spain as a gateway for hydrogen in europe with existing storage and transport infrastructures that have already been built in addition to hydrogen we are working on other specific projects to contribute to decarbonization promoting the use of l ng as fuel under specific circumstances in this area a few weeks ago the european union has announced that it will support the development of sixteen l ng vehicle support points by gas and hydrogen within the aeco net within the european union also a few days ago the european union granted the full amount of the subsidy requested for two specific supply lng to ships projects bunkering in barcelona and algeciras in the south in southern spain i mention these specific projects because they demonstrate according to us the support of the european union for the role of lng but also other gases renewable gases in the decarbonization of transport sectors especially maritime transport in this presentation you can see the acknowledgement to the company in the field of sustainability and i would like to highlight once again the commitment of each and every enagas professional to sustainability in its broadest sense i am not going to repeat the figures that we have been talking about we will provide you with the results presentation in february but enagas has a plan to reduce co two emissions with milestones in 2030 2040 that will culminate in 2050 with the neutral emission of carbon zero carbon so we continue with this plan obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pass before one of our priorities i remind you that at the general shareholder meeting held on june 30th the payment of a complementary dividend was approved for 2019 the result of the stress test and the impairment test performed by the company in this climate of great uncertainty enable us to reaffirm with the information we now have our dividend commitment for 2019 which is onesix per share to conclude once again in a context in which uncertainty is the only certainty the company is clear about its priorities we have resisted these agitated 1st few months and the results that we present today are a reflection of this with the data that we have today we believe that we can maintain all of our commitments for 2020 and we will continue to work on new future projects thank you for your attention if you have questions please feel free to ask the team will endeavor to answer to them as fully as we can thank you very much ladies and gentlemen if you want to ask a question please dial one on your phone to cancel or push two to ask a question 1st question have you ever been to mediamabank have you missed that mister suarez you have the floor the government has presented a strategy until 2015 it seems clear that hydrogen should have a relevant role in the effort to decarbonize the economy by 2050 the question for you is do you believe that this new strategy at european and spanish level for hydrogen is a substantial change for the profile of the company is it a game changer for enagas my question is how will the company is business plan be affected by this opportunity and the regulating and governing entities and investors should they see any gas with different eyes as a consequence of this fact that it would be a network to transport a commodity that is going to majorly reduce emissions 2nd question toluene in the united states do you see any negative impact as a consequence of this fact that it would be a network to transport a commodity that is going to majorly reduce emissions or the possible difficulties of gas on take in the united states could you give us some idea of what you see operationally because these have been very difficult months for these companies and the 3rd question is could you give us an estimate on the gas consumption in spain for 2020 as a whole thank you for your travel hello thank you very much mister javier suarez from mediobanca 1st question yes we start with our opinion we do consider that the energy transition process that all the european countries and the us such have on the table will not be done if we do not contribute in a two fold with renewable gases something that until now had almost no weight hydrogen bio gas et cetera and even decarbonization process in sub sectors where it will be difficult to electrify lg plays a role and i was saying a two fold because the other contribution is that we are seeing that storage and transport infrastructure is also evolving europe are very good to maintain the role of gas in the transition process that everybody considers is going to be key but also in order to serve as the basis for these hydrogen development and for renewable gases projects we are convinced about that and in the 1st documents issued by the european commission they state that they do believe that the tsos will play a relevant role in this field and the contacts that we are having with the ministry of ecological transition allow us to think that once we see all the public opinion processes are over and public consultation are over we will play a major role there and furthermore we do want to play that role so for the time being as you have seen we are developing some minor specific projects in most of them we can i am sorry i have a lot of background noise i am speaking in front of a group of people the proof of concept project that is possible to produce transport a hydrogen and decarbonize and honestly i do believe that our tso role and not only ours but the role of other countries in the coming years will change slightly from being only limited to this transport and storage of natural gas tsos in europe so the ones with this aim in mind will do all this and also we will compliment that role with amongst all the actors in everything that has to do with hydrogen development right now and i can not and no one can tell you specific figures and timelines this is not going to be an immediate process this is going to take time and then coming 23 or four years this will develop and we will start to have half i have already told you we have already a few projects and some with the support of the eu but they are small projects so i think that in the coming 234 years as i was saying we will see how a general map of activities in this field will be outlined and also we will see a calendar and then we will also see two more projects of course i will of course follow the instructions issued by the government and the commission or the parliament but i can clearly tell you that anegada is willing to collaborate we have been thinking about this since quite some time we are already working on it so i conclude and i apologize for such a long answer i do believe that our role as a tso as the role of other tsos is to ensure the security of the grid and to maintain the quality of the electricity supply and will change in a positive sense in the coming years i am probably going to have new tasks to undertake 2nd question i have got the cf and cf and he is wearing glasses reading glasses and he has got the same problem he is taking out his mask and he will answer thank you president good morning javier let me answer four relevant points that are included in the presentation that the president has stressed in his presentation 1st we see a recovery of oil and gas prices and recovery in the production in the relevant basins for the oil and gas transport in tollesgrove 2nd transported volumes according to july figures and the perspective we see that the transport will be in line with the volumes transported pre covid three as it has been explained in the presentation it is very important we have finished the construction of the chavez connector and the chavez hub and this is a fundamental piece for re getting the west to east section from rocky and therefore meeting let me confirm that toll glass is an asset that has behaved with limited sensitivity to the current situation of the us market that has been under much stress so with the information available to us today the free cash flow for toll glass for the year end is $117000000 and having invested in cheniere connector and other projects it gives us a net debt ratio of four one times the payment of the estimated €114000000 is a ratio of net debt to equity ratio of around four54 times this is compatible with the liquidity position of the company which is higher than $1000000000 and as the company has no relevant maturities until 2022 as we have explained in other occasions kapex becomes a beta at a multiple of six times a beta that data ratio is the one i was telling you it is important to stress that with the information we have now we have no changes whatsoever in the dividends announced for 2020 2026 next the yield of the investment communicated to the market and as a summary of the description of the business of the company this is fully thank you borge and let me answer the 3rd question by javier suarez consumption as we have said with regard to industrial consumption the consumption that we call for of the conventional market we touched bottom april 76 of the amendments compared to last year i have given you the figure of right now 92 but if we could see the evolution of the 2627 days of july of this year the conventional demand would be at 93 therefore from now until the year end we do think that these conventional demands might little by little this will not be on a sudden basis but it will evolve towards but being cautious as we want to be we have done all our forecasts in budget et cetera with the idea of having a decrease of the total demand all lines of ten for the year a decrease of ten in order to be more conservative but of course we do see that the conventional demand in almost all sectors has set for one services but in the other twelve sectors it is set for one in which we divide commercially speaking this demand they are at a v shape of recovery which is quite clear and the average would be at 9299 so today we are much more optimistic that a few months ago when we presented the 1st quarter we were suffering the full impact of the decrease in the demand and we are now at a v shape of recovery we have reached that bottom and we are not our figures of the demand that i dare to say are quite normal because i think that last year was an exceptional year with regard to gas demand and therefore comparing to last year is very strict if we can put it this way so we are optimistic with being cautious as i always say because we are living a context of great uncertainty but i do believe industrial gas demand all its byproducts tankers etc is behaving well and even tankers right now tankers are above the consumption of last year although its weight in the total of industrial demand is small well i think we have replied to all the three questions that mister swetesh asked hello mister dolfi from goldman sachs good morning coming from goldman sachs i was a little bit cut off so i have three quick questions at you could you elaborate on the gains a bit net benefits for the 1st half of the year and probably you can explain what was the evolution compared to last year the 2nd question is there are many items and the affiliates that move around so could you please explain the difference of 76000000 for the 1st half but the bigger contribution of telgrass for the 2nd part the situation would be improved hydrogen again i am sorry to repeat we will be benefiting from these investments but the european strategy clearly states that the strategy is up until 2024 and then another strategy for after 2024 so would it be reasonable to assume that by 2024 from now to 2024 we will have more visibility on this topic are we going to invest more in hydrogen as a regulator would it be possible for us to think that this would contribute to increased dividends after 2024 thank you very much with an unyielding spirit we stand together good morning mister borges garcia alcanon i will respond to your 3rd question borges you have the floor thank you good morning everyone the contribution for equivalence for the entire year is 2000 pesos for the purchase space allocation guidance of €186000000 that could be divided into two parts of the year €74000000 for the 1st part and 110 for the 2nd half of the year we need to indicate that the contribution of twelve cross is different so the contribution for the 1st semester is €3800000 2nd €53400000 the difference between these two from a business point of view is explained because the difference between the contribution of net income to total grants for the 1st half and the difference with the 2nd semester is because the 1st semester before the aepb was $22000000 for the 2nd will be €5000000 this is due to the re thirdly the matter of wrecks as foreseen once the jin connector was implemented secondly the debts in terms of that there is no difference but this an important adjustment produced as a result of transferring us gappa toll accounts to irfs irfs which is the real estate tax is paid in january so the new budget is done throughout the year so for the 1st half the impact was negative due to the $3100000 a difference and the 2nd half the impact is going to be $16200000 which which is explained by the fact of changing the results and moving from threeeight to 53four so just to explain a little bit more about the ebitda alberto was asking about this we have an expected ebitda of $800000000 a bdi of $300000000 financial expenses of $181000000 and this accounts for $65000000 and the exchange rate is $250000000 that i said at the beginning that were necessary to build up all this thank you mister bortolo in terms of the 3rd question we think that we have to say things orderly from now on to the end of the year we will have the roadmap of renewable gas and hydrogen this is what we have to say in terms of the european union per plant i do not dare giving you dates but between 21 22 this important paper launched by the commission will have been discussed by stakeholders the european parliament etc so we will have probably a bigger plant many tsos as i said before are working at the european hydrogen backbone plan and we are working together for that i think by the end of this year and up until the end of 2022 the road map will be clear i believe at the same time all the tsos are thinking to come up with concrete projects which will not have high costs investment economic impact but these are proof of concept projects that will allow us to generate hydrogen practically or renewable gas how they are transported who are end users etc this is important all the hydrogen roadmap should be in the framework of the energy transition plan which means that changes cannot happen upstream the midstream with that having clear in mind who are the end users it is meaningless for us to say i am going to generate hydrogen at a specific and who is going to consume this well i do not know obviously this is what the european union and each country is trying to do meaning having things orderly implemented meaning we will be part of the chain but someone has to be at the end of the chain saying i need i want this hydrogen for consumption so between 2020 2023 and probably 2033 we will be able to implement concrete projects with end users that are interested in that and companies like enagas are really into that providing you with figures as i was saying at the beginning is impossible for us to do now by the end of the year because the roadmap will be prepared we will have a calendar and a volume of projects in mind but in europe i think we will have to wait until 2022 at least so we can have a concrete working plan think about what happened in spain when in spain the gas energy plan was produced this planning was discussed between 2000 and 2002 and 2001 i am sorry in 2002 the 1st concrete document our strategic plan was produced in spain at that time for gas and that plan started to be implemented practically in 2005 and 2006 enagas came up with the 1st strategic plan for the total development of this so help plan in march 2007 so between the approval in 2002 and the practical implementation five years elapsed in this specific case because authorizations were required approval was required etc in the case of hydrogen things are going to be quicker probably but this kind of infrastructure requires a deadline which is more or less long for its implementation if some years ago if you would have asked me if we would have a paper from the european union from now to 2050 and saying will we have a hydrogen roadmap in the next month if you would have asked me this two years ago i would have said i do not know now i can tell you yes it is hard though to please let me know when the project calendar will be created especially the rules of the game to know who wants hydrogen the speed of each country it is not likely for all the countries to do the same time the same thing at the same time we will have to see i do not want to elaborate on this because another more question so thank you mister gontfroid for your question next question will be done by jose luis from barcelona good morning louis havy from berkeley three questions 1st could you clarify the impact of 12300000 positive in the gas station to sue where do they come from in the 2nd quarter 2nd after hearing you about the case i would like to ask a question thank you and i think there is a plan for cost reduction missing i think but i understand that is a project for growth i just wanted to for you to confirm this point if you could of course and thirdly i wanted to know if within that roadmap there is an initiative have you heard of any initiative on the site to create a hub it is something which is quite in fashion and portugal the netherlands and the uk have already presented their initiatives thank you gracias muchas gracias jose joseph ruz 1st two questions will be replied hola a todos por favor me permite tomar el microfono gracias presidente jose javier gsp dos impactos primero y no recurrentes en 2019 como consecuencia de la demora en introducir los estados financieros esperando la resolucion de la arbitraje para ser emitidos en 2022 en lugar de 2021 representan una gasto este ano no tenemos ese efecto and as for hydrogen is concerned yes we have presented in two different lines we have already explained it in the green cranes and even with snam and other companies we are talking about a possible hub for the south of europe connected on the side of enagas but also on snam is side with north of africa so that a possible hub is perfectly outlined there that could be useful in spain is over we will see the possibility for our country from different stances together with portugal of course will be part of this hub and at the same time let us not forget that it is very possible for the 1st steps to use hydrogen in the different countries within the european energy transition plan most of them will have initial projects so the idea of moving between countries will take place that is for sure we are just doing our analysis but we are willing to collaborate in these projects so the idea of moving between countries will take place that is for sure we are just doing our analysis but we are willing to collaborate in these projects i am almost fully convinced that the 1st projects will be of a national nature per country in very specific points locations knowing that there is an end user or end users that are there already willing to immediately receive that hydrogen or that renewable gas and i think it is important to emphasize that we have been able to cover your questions thank you if there are more questions yes let us move now to the  questions in english this question will come from harry webley of bank of america please go ahead your line is open hi everyone it is harry webley from bank of america so three questions from me please so 1st of all focusing on the domestic business you mentioned a pretty small 6400000 impact in the 1st half i wondered if you could let us know what you think the full year impacts of volume decline will be on regulated revenues in the domestic business and then if i remember correctly i think under the new regulation the rcs in future years out to 2026 was actually based on the rcs this year if so far i have understood correctly so i wondered if you could confirm that that understanding is correct and would that mean if the rcs is yes is the rcs is well i wanted to follow up on the previous question about the revenue this year and how that would have a knock on effect on future years as well or have i misunderstood something there and then the 2nd question just on your affiliates overall i just wanted to remind us what percentage of your affiliate income is in us dollars i believe most of it is dollarized obviously the dollar weakened somewhat over the last few weeks so just interested to get a reminder of how much is in dollars and then thirdly i wanted to ask is there any other information you could provide on the growth of your affiliate program over the past year i am afraid it is an obligatory hydrogen question but a specific one i think in the in the hydrogen backbone report you and your tso colleagues quantified the total kappex spend at a midpoint of about €40000000000 up to 2040 if i remember correctly if i just eyeball the map that you published in the in the slides today it looks like you are roughly somewhere around a 3rd of the size of the network just by very approximate guess do you think that is a fair guess at what your share of the $40000000000 spend would be any thanks and he started talking to the cat ok thank you sir for your question the cfo will give you a detailled answer thank you mister president concerning cs the brute impact is expected at $22000000 and net $17000000 and for 2126 according to your question the net impact in the pnl at the bottom line is €9000000 on average per year and concerning the contribution of affiliates for the equivalent ninety 25 is in dollars because we are talking about kinetro tsp tallgrass tgp al tamida and they are all dollarized as you mentioned so the percentage of the contribution of dollars to pnl is and to conclude with the hydrogen question in our backboned plan document investment figures are given for 2022 or 60000000000 for the entire europe the document we are talking about now is a 1st reflection it is not an investment detail plan but from a technical point of view we should bear in mind that this is a backboned plan document in spain the gas infrastructure network is perfectly feasible for transporting hydrogen with some nuances regulatory technical questions must be sorted out in terms of blending so the percentage of hydrogen can be used in one grid mixed with lng this is the 1st phase historically different countries have different technical questions some strictly technical questions are related to some part of the grid where hydrogen will be used and in this point technical measures should be taken for compressor stations for example and investment is necessary we need to see if sections of the network will transport only hydrogen or they transport a blended mixture more investments probably are necessary for reaching a consumption point or a generation point but this level of detail is not being included in the plans that are being discussed nor have they been included in the national roadmaps we have a general overview of how renewable gas will be used the 2nd point is a calendar with the 3rd step is to see what does what are the specific approaches that will be developed or implemented within the roadmap this is where we are now the investment figures given by the european union have a broad margin because they reach 2050 so as you can see it is not easy for us to and by heart i can tell you the european union is talking about 1000000 tons of hydrogen in 2050 we will have to see whether or not this figure is respected or is higher or lower and we need to see what each country is going to do but this will be will have to be included in the energy roadmap chosen by the european union the european union has to without an agreement with generators transporters and consumers of hydrogen or renewable gas transition will never happen very likely like i said before this will come out initially from projects we are now promoting with other companies and all the stakeholders come together we have a project in a specific region with a specific calendar in my presentation i mentioned some of them or a few of them and in the near future governments will set annual calendars for projects we could elaborate on that but i know there are more questions let us  go to the next question now thank you sir for your question our next question will come from james brand of deutsche bank please hi good morning thanks for taking my questions i had a couple of questions on toll grass and then follow up on hygiene so on toll grass you gave quite clear guidance for this year which i think is assuming i heard the numbers correctly came down to 56 to 57000000 of pre ppa net income i am just wondering whether you could give some expectations for the next year just so i can get a feel for it some of those positives that are coming through in h two might look in a more normal year and then the 2nd question is i was wondering what you felt the biggest risk was on on tallgrass in in the slides you had some volume expectations for the main basins that you are in that looked broadly that volumes had come down a bit but overall would would recover a little bit   particularly in a couple of basins and you would start to see some some growth again it is what it is the main risk that oil prices stay low and and that growth just does not come through and you see contracting pressure and yeah within that is there a particular point of oil prices that would be it would start to make you a bit more concerned if they stay at forty or maybe they have to drop more but appreciate there was a few sub questions within that but just  an idea of what you think you think is the biggest investment then if it does come through adding new parts to the pipeline network to connect our renewable clusters of that direction that we we go through is that the biggest investment good afternoon thank you for the opportunity to extend the network and some context on that would be of interest thank you well thank you i think that is it see you and i would like to answer the whole of the questions that you have raised with quite some detail thank you president the contribution of tallgrass yes to putting into the convergence between ppa 2020 will be €56000000 as we said before that will stabilize and even grow in the future at around €100000000 before ppa and after ppa that figure will be around €60000000 with regard to the investment in the new research vessel i think that the commission is aware that the development of the research vessel is an important priority for the european union we have been working on this for a number of years now and i think that the commission is committed to making sure that we have a research vessel that is capable of carrying out the research that we need to carry out in the marine environment i think the long term risk for tall grass in the model is the highest risk well not risk my biggest milestone is meeting the cpex objectives to build a bit of a dozer that we expect for 224 25 and 26 but on the other side that is the main risk for the future yes as bocha was saying the investment and development plan for togara as we have and we follow is good but the negative circumstances of the north american market and the world market have represented a small part well they have disappeared because of the market situation and that provides a clear advantage to the actors that are suddenly installed such as tall grass actors that have got as you very well know an important part of their contracts that are insured so tallgrass is following that line they have foreseen to make the most in the future of the new opportunities that may appear with minor investments that will not be starting from scratch investments because that entails more permits etcetera but they will use a very widespread network which is already in place with the figures we have is interesting and we do rely on that leg i do not know we have got more questions i am told that there is no more questions yes yes sorry i do apologize there are more questions so let us give the floor to the next questions thank you our next question comes from olivia van dussele from exane bnp paribas please go ahead your line is open that would be the nine in h one maybe with some one of that might not have been expected at the start of the year and for h two you expect actually a big step up from the contribution from targa so i wonder if you could indicate whether or not you would agree that the guidance seems to be particularly cautious for for this year and then the 2nd one apology is because this is probably your 10th question on on hydrogen but it it looks like by 2030 the biggest 1st part of demand will actually just be the blending of hydrogen i think documents are talking at that potential ten to twenty of hydrogen being mixed in the in the total blends snam for example i think i have already mentioned that for them there is probably around 13rd of their network that would actually need upgrades to be able to cope with with the chemical and physical implications of that level of hydrogen in the network and have you looked at the state of the state of the pipeline and can you give us a feel in terms of the possible needs for for replacements or upgrading of your network that might be necessary for you to be able to handle such a level of hydrogen and could you also tell us if we see some accelerated replacements of your pipes in order for hydrogen to be able to fuel through your network better if that should be actually booked on your side as a case ex or will that actually be expensed as an opaque under your current regulation so it is like the thing is that you can not really change the way you feel about something okay minister van der salee thank you for your question 1st question about the guidance the cvo will give you detailed information thank you president oliveira we keep the guidance 440000000 the behavior was a little better than expected but facing the unsolved evolution of the market the forecast for the years 440 is that we are just enough in this el senor presidente esta bien estoy hablando en el foro energetico maasseno tienes el microfono hemos de entender que el sistema actual aparte del gasoducto 接受百分之二十的氢气 tenemos que entender eso para generar el twenty de hidrogeno zero gas natural que se consume en espana ahora como hidrogeno un gran numero de inversiones sera necesario para la generacion de esta energia muchas gracias we are far from being real now and we need to implement this in our units and we are implementing studying that and if we think about 2035 2040 having a 100 hydrogen network we will have some of the pipelines that exist today but new will have to be thought about and implemented we are having a necessary improvement for the network or the pipeline to cope with the twenty of hydrogen we are far from this being true thank you very much let us move on to the last question our last question will come from antonella bnjc from city please go ahead you said something that i found extremely interesting that you will start your investments only and when there will be enough take for your androgen potential so i wonder can you give us an idea of the timing i mean i think that the message is that international and interconnection which are not fully regulated will have to be contracted before you will connect on investments then you think this so would be a possibility muchas gracias let me reply there are different elements that are under the same umbrella 1st the investments in our networks i am talking about enagas but you can think about any other tso in europe so investments will be done will depend fully on the instructions that we may receive from the regulators for example but the use or more or less hydrogen blended with l a natural gas which is something that can be done since the beginning well that debate depends on the technical specifications and norms that are quite simple this is not complex but it will be the regulators the ones that will say yes i want that in spain or in that in france or that in italy we have a higher percentage of hydrogen within the natural gas so technically speaking we perfectly know what investments that we have to do and very probably they will be regulated by the regulator this and as a general response the use of hydrogen specifically for specific projects not so much to have a general blend in the grid depends on if there are off takers companies and that they can get this hydrogen to generate electricity such as fuel for their equipment or whatever these projects will have to stem from these roadmaps we are talking about in order to give you an example we have got a specific project to generate transport and use hydrogen in the baleric islands in this project the ultimate off taker will be a company transporting passengers and that is a clear example that does not need specific regulation using in the spanish grid or the french or the italian grid part of hydrogen as blended with natural gas to among other things reduce the co two emissions the letter that we received from the technical regulations will require from us as the member states technical regulations where we are involved of course the ministry is involved and the ministry has asked our opinion about what are the technical measures that we will have to implement in this calendar to be used renewable gases work is in progress but as of july we do not have more details as i was replying to a similar question before i think that by the end of this year and the end of 2021 or 2022 i think that this map this technical regulatory map will be fully finished in europe in imperial we will see specific projects appearing thank you antonella there are no more questions i have told you so apart from the minor problems of the mask and the reading glasses i think that we have been able to reply to your questions we do want to thank you for the interest in the company and the investor relations team if you need more information we will give you detailed information if you require it from them thank you thank you very much",

continue to be safe and healthy firstly let me start by thanking our entire zagg team across the globe i am extremely proud to see how our teams reacted through the quarter and never lost sight of serving our consumers and partners with quality product that protect and enhance our devices over the course of the 3rd quarter it was pleasing to see our results improve significantly compared to the 2nd quarter and exceed our expectations we are encouraged by our recent performance given the challenges we continue to face from the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy our work over the past several months which has included reducing expenses adapting our operations to the current retail environment and aggressively managing inventories has put the company in a much stronger financial position and provided the business with good momentum as we head into our busiest selling season looking at our 3rd quarter in more detail as we discussed on our q two call in august we saw a significant sequential uptake in sell through in june for both our protection and power up categories as several of our larger customers reopened their doors and resumed more normalized store operations with some sell through weeks even exceeding last year is levels this trend continued into july and consistently improved throughout august and september while our online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced early in the pandemic when most of the brick and mortar was closed it was still up nicely from a year ago and expanding this channel continues to be a priority for us with respect to our overall performance q three revenue coming at $115000000 compared to 137000000 in the year ago period a decrease of 21 this represents a nice improvement from the 28 year over year decrease in revenue we reported in the 2nd quarter despite the roughly 32000000 drop in revenue compared with the 3rd quarter last year combined with some gross margin headwinds from higher freight expenses we delivered adjusted ebitda of $15000000 thanks to cost saving measures we enacted early in the pandemic taylor will go through in greater detail in the balance sheet but i wanted to g share a few highlights despite significant market pressure from covid nineteen our account receivable dsos improved compared to last year inventory dec decline compared to where we ended q two we generated positive operating cash flow and we continue to reduce our quarter in net debt balance on a year over year and sequential basis by taking quick decisive action back in april and more recently working closely with our retail partners on their store reopening efforts we have been able to successfully navigate through incredibly challenging market conditions ensuring the financial viability of the company and positioned ourselves to exit this difficult period as a stronger more nimble organization i will now provide some additional color to our categories starting with protection we continue to build on our overall digital wellness strategy for a few years now our hero screen protector has been visionguard a product that reduced exposure to high energy visible blue light that can have damaging effects without changing the screen colors or the peak resolution we have now sold over 10000000 units with this technology in additional all invisibleshield screen protectors produced this year and beyond now also include antimicrobial technology this includes our entire line up for the new iphone twelve which is now available in stores earlier this year we introduced our newest product geared towards our digital awareness strategy a uv uv phone sanitizer which works with all mobile devices and kills up to 99nine of staph and e coli surface bacteria our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retails and our consumers and has led to increasing sell through and greater shelf fa space with many of our accounts we have expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to protect cases with good success starting with the samsung galaxy s twenty launch earlier this year and right through to the recent iphone twelve launch all gear four protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology the combination of this enhancement benefiting gear four is differentiated d thirty impact technology is driving excitement amongst consumers especially as awareness of the brand and products grow from our efforts to expand distribution with the new iphone twelve gear four is now available and growing across all of our carrier partners this expanded distribution accelerated the momentum in gear four brand and i am exciting to see it continue to grow through 2021 in our power category mophie launched many exciting new products during q three including the introduction of a new line of wireless charging solutions these innovations are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple devices in one central location in addition last month we launched a new mophie juice pack connect this new product represents an evolution of our popular juice pack allowing users to easily charge their phone on demand using a detachable battery featured as not device specific and is used with or without the consumer is normal phone case our halo brand continues to perform well on qvc which has been a productive partnership and channel particularly give the number of consumers spending more time at home q four is a busy time for our brands with qvc and with a number of airings planned during the holiday period looking ahead with the majority or our us partner doors now open and weekly sales will continue to improve combined with solid director consumer trends we feel optimistic about our for the remainder of the year while there is still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact shopping behavior this holiday season including the effect on several countries in europe that have recently implemented lockdowns we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on demand regardless of which channel our consumer chooses to engage with the brands we are currently planning 4th quarter revenue to increase on 3rd quarter levels and continue improving on the year over year declines we have experienced the past two quarters even as we are facing tough comparison to last year is record q four sales i am confident in the longterm course we have set for the company our reference around antimicrobial uv sanitization and blue light protection are driven by our belief that consumers will increasingly look for solutions that will enhance their digital awareness we also believe another consumer priority will be increased productivity and comfort from home we will continue our focus on enhancing technology in our lives to accomplish these growing needs while is remains difficult to know when conditions will fully normalize and what impact covid nineteen will have on the global economy and our industry i am confident that we have taken the right steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company this includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin product and categories and simplify our core lines of business as a more nimble company zagg can better service retail partners and core consumers capitalize on the tailwinds from the multiyear rollout five g with the margin benefits from our brand and consolidation and generate increased value for our shareholders i will now hand the call over to taylor thanks chris since many details of our quarterly financial performance are included in the supplemental financial information issued earlier today i would just like to take a few minutes to add some additional comments on our 3rd quarter financial performance q three net sales decreased year over year by approximately 21 to $115000000 after exiting a very difficult 2nd quarter we saw good momentum throughout the 3rd quarter as retail outlets continued to reopen and allow a more normal in store shopping experience that being said the residual effects of covid nineteen combined with the delay of the launch of the new apple devices which push some which pushed some orders into q four made it a difficult year over year compare overall we are pleased with the momentum and sell through improvements we saw in retail which enabled us to increase sales by almost fifty on a consecutive quarter basis from $77000000 to 115000000 q three gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased year over year to 33 there were a number of pits and takes that impacted gross profit during the quarter including a benefit from net lower duty rates and expected duty refunds which i will discuss in more detail in a 2nd this benefit was offset by higher expedited airfreight and increased airfreight rates along with the sale of excess inventory of margins that were lower than our historically averages on the subjects of duty refunds in early august we received an exclusion notice that duties paid on certain products imported from china starting in late 2018 may be subject to refund we worked closely with our customs broker to begin submitting refund documentation to us customs this work is ongoing and given the vo the volume of imports from china since late 2018 will continue throughout the 4th quarter based on the work completed to date we recorded a refund receivable at quarter end of approximately $5400000 for duties paid that we expect to be refunded the income statement impacted this receivable offset by the balance sheet reduction from duties previously capitalized in inventory and then sold in q three 2020 was a net income statement benefit of $1700000 or approximately 140 basis points to gross profit margin during the quarter as i mentioned there is still quite a bit of work to do left during the 4th quarter to complete our remaining refund submissions and i will provide an update on any additional refund upside on our next call q three operating expenses decreased 29 or approximately $12000000 compared to last year the decrease was due primarily to the various cost cutting measures we implemented as a result of the expected covid nine covid nineteen impacts on demand over the last several months we have made the conscious decision to bring some individuals back from furlough to support 4th quarter product launches and customer care but we continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult time q three adjusted ebitda was $15000000 versus 21000000 in the prior year period the decline versus last year is linked to decreased sales and a reduction in overall gross profit margin for the reasons i mentioned these items were offset by the decreases in operating expenses that i just discussed turning to the balance sheet compared to a year ago accounts receivable decreased 33 to $91000000 due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period however or dsos improved significantly from 87 days to 73 days the quality of our receivables remains very good inventory was 80000000 compared to $94000000s at the end of the 1st quarter a reduction of approximately $14000000 during the 3rd quarter we took the conservative approach to inventory as we closely monitored retail sell through customer forecasts and customer inventory levels to ensure we did not overextend on inventory purchasing as a result we did incur some incremental expedited airfreight charges due to increased demand at the end of the 3rd quarter as retail sell through improved at this point we will continue to closely monitor the factors that influence our purchasing forecast but we will continue to plan conservatively due to the continued uncertainties related to the covid nineteen pandemic despite the continued headwinds from covid nineteen during the quarter we generated 3rd quarter operating cash flow of approximately $9000000 compared to 11000000 in cash from operations during the prior year period net debt which is consolidated debt less cash decreased to 81000000 compared to 97000000 in q three last year and 85000000 at the end of the 1st quarter of 2020 as we discussed in our last call during april we amended our credit facility to increase the total amount available under the line of credit from 125000000 to $145000000 this expansion combined with the loan received under the cares act the q two restructuring and cost cutting initiatives we have undertaken gives us confidence that we will successfully navigate the headwinds that covid nineteen has put on the business the capital allocation focus throughout the remainder of 2020 will remain on funding working capital needs and continuing to service our line of credit as we look to the 4th quarter of 2020 we definitely have better visibility now than we did when we last spoke in august however covid nineteen continues to create uncertainty around worldwide retail demand given this market uncertainty we will not be providing annual guidance at this time however given our current view of customer orders and positive retail sell through trends we expect strong sequential net sales and adjusted ebitda growth over the 3rd quarter we expect 2020 year gross margins to pr to improve during the 4th quarter though as i mentioned we will see some pressure over the next qua next few quarters compared to historical averages of mid 30s as we sell through our excess inventory we expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high 20s to low $30000000 for the 4th quarter no different than from any other companies covid nineteen has been extremely disruptive to our business however with the steps we have taken to restructure the business reduce fixed costs and ensure adequate liquidity i am confident the likes of this period impacted by covid nineteen as a much stronger company than when we entered with that we will now open up the call the call for questions thank you ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press star then the number one key on your touch tone telephone again that is star then the number one key on your touch tone telephone your 1st question comes from the line of elliot alper from d a davidson your line is open great thank you so thanks for the info on just the sequential sales in the 4th quarter i guess could you talk about any trends quarter dates specifically and specifically geographic sales mix are you seeing any material changes with sales in geographies that have less restrictions compared to those that have more yeah just a just couple of notes you know w w with the apple launch happening a little bit later than we had experienced previously there there was you know maybe $5000000 of of sales that shifted from q three into q four which will obviously benefit kind of the the sequential the sequential look at revenue overall though we are seeing really good sell through of of the phones it seems to be doing very successful market and and obviously we are benefiting that benefiting from that so q four is starting off really really well in terms of geos and you know no material change in geo expansion you know chris mentioned or or geo mix you know chris mentioned on his in his prepared remarks that we we are definitely seeing some headwinds at least in terms of shutdowns in some of our international locations however you know the wireless dealers in those locations you know have been deemed as essential and so those have remained open and so kind of remains to be seen as to how it is going to impact demand but i i think overall we are we are definitely seeing some strong signs that that we are kind of getting back to a more normal you know q four experience though though obviously covid remains you know a bit of a a bit of a cloud over everything okay great and then aside from apple launch shifting to the 4th quarter can you talk about the holiday season and kind of what may be different this year versus historically and kind of any implications that may have on the december quarter yeah the one thing that we we we are starting to see is obviously the black friday seems to be more some retailers are taking a strategy with just spreading it all over a number of days over a over the month so that is something that is going to be different i think we are still going to see a pretty strong online attachment from both com and obviously through amazon so but we are we are very i would say optimistic about the sell through the early sell through on all screen protection and cases are quite strong and that is given that we still have a number of other devices to take to market actually this week so overall i think we have some good runway for the the holiday season okay great thank you thank you yeah thanks elliot and once again in order to ask a question please press start then the number one on your touch tone telephone so your next question comes from the line of matt b from titan capital management your line is open great thank you i was hoping you could put a number on the expediting shipping cost that you that you incurred in the 3rd quarter just to to give us some better idea how m how significant those were yeah it was you know between two and $3000000 and you know as i mentioned in in my prepared remarks you know we we we really it w it was a bit of a balancing act with inventory where we were trying to run it down and you know and just sell through picked up at the end you know we did have to move quickly and unfortunately resulted in some some expedited airfreight charges same for the 4th quarter are you expecting that to to reoccur or is it have you caught up and you feel like you are in a better place now yeah it is a it is a great question you know i i think we are still probably chasing a little bit of demand you know the the one thing that is also kind of impacted us no different than any other company that is importing from overseas is just generally freight rates have increased kind of globally and so that is that is also impacted it but i i i think there is probably going to be a little bit of that you know s a as i mentioned it is a bit of a balancing act we we definitely wanted to be careful you know given the pandemic and and how much inventory we were planning and you know fortunately or unfortunately we have seen some some upsides which is great but we have had to chase those and so i think we are probably still chasing a little bit which w will impact some of our q four q four sales and and and then also obviously the spend on freight great also wanted to ask you know if i could really quickly about the tariff situation and now with the biden predi presidency i know you have been moving some production out of china does that change your your view on on moving production out of china or how are you thinking about this this new regime yeah i think matt it does not our strategy ultimately we are looking to diversify across our cm base and and make sure that we are setting the company up for continued business so we we are still following the strategy and you know we have had a very good quarter where we have now successfully have piloted both screen protection and wireless power outside of china so it gives us that ability to be able to shift our our supply chain when needed zero obviously china is still a big part of our our strategy but what i like is w we are not just looking at it from a tariff perspective now we are really looking at it from a business continuity perspective great thank you both thanks matt thanks matt thank you once again in order to ask a question please press star then the number one on your touch tone telephone gentlemen i am sure there are no further question at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to mister chris ahern for any closing remarks thank you i thank everybody for joining our q three earnings report we look forward to updating you again on q four have a great evening everyone and stay safe ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference

by thanking our entire zag team across the globe i am extremely proud to see how our teams react to this i am pleased to report that our company has been serving our consumers and partners with quality products that protect and enhance our devices over the course of the 3rd quarter it was pleasing to see our results improve significantly compared to the 2nd quarter and exceed our expectations we are encouraged by our recent performance given the challenges we continue to face from the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy our work over the past several months which has included reducing expenses adapting our operations to the current retail environment has resulted in improved financial performance we will continue to focus on improving our operations and delivering value to our stakeholders thank you i would like to express my gratitude to the management of accountants at xyz company for putting the company in a much stronger financial position and providing the business with good momentum as we head into our busiest selling season looking at our 3rd quarter in more detail as we discussed on our q two call in august we saw a significant sequential uptick in sales through june for both our protection and power categories as several of our larger customers reopened their doors and resumed more normalized store operations with some sales through weeks even exceeding last year is levels this trend continued into july while our online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced earlier in the pandemic when much of the brick and mortar was closed it was still up nicely from a year ago and expanding this channel continues to be a priority for us we respect to overall performance q three revenue came in at $150000000 compared to $147000000 in the year ago period a decrease of 21 this represents a nice improvement from the 28 year over year decrease we reported this in our earnings call despite the roughly $32000000 drop in revenue compared to the 3rd quarter last year combined with some gross margin headwinds from higher freight expenses we delivered adjusted ebitda of $15000000 thanks to cost saving measures we enacted earlier in the pandemic taylor will go through in greater detail on the balance sheet but i wanted to share a few highlights despite significant market pressure from covid nineteen our accounts receivable is improved compared to last year our ebitda is improved compared to last year and our dso is improved compared to last year thanks for listening we generated positive operating cash flow and continue to reduce our net debt balance on a year over year and sequential basis by taking quick decisive action back in april and more recently working closely with our retail partners under still reopening efforts we have been able to successfully navigate through incredibly challenging market conditions ensuring the financial viability of the company and positioning ourselves to exit this difficult period as a stronger more resilient organization i now provide some additional color to our categories starting with protection we continue to build in our overall digital wellness strategy for a few years now our hero screen protector has been vision guard a product that reduces exposure to high energy visible blue light that can have damaging effects without changing the screen colors or the peak resolution we have now saved over 10000000 units with this technology in addition all invisible shield screen protectors produced this year and beyond now also include antimicrobial technology this includes our entire line up earlier this year we introduced our newest product here towards our digital way strategy a uv phone sanitizer which works with all mobile devices and kills up to 99nine of staffy coi surface bacteria our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retailers and our consumers and has led to increasing shelf space with many of our accounts we have expanded this strategy beyond screen protection starting with the samsung galaxy s twenty launch earlier this year and right through to the recent iphone twelve launch all gear four protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology the combination of this disinfectant benefit and gear four is differentiated dco impact technology is driving excitement amongst consumers especially as awareness of the brand and products grow from our efforts to expand distribution this expanded distribution accelerates the momentum of our peer four brand and i am excited to see it continue to grow through 2021 in our park category we launched many exciting new products to in q three including the introduction of a new line of wireless charging solutions these innovations are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple devices in one central location in addition last month we launched the new murphy juice pack connect this new product represents an evolution of our popular juice pack we are pleased to inform you that our detachable battery feature is not device specific and is used with or without the consumer is normal phone case our hero zero brien continues to perform well on qvc which has been a productive partnership and channel particularly given the number of consumers spending more time at home q four is a busy time for our brands with qvc and hsn with a number of airing planned during the holiday period looking ahead with the majority of our us partner doors now open and weekly sales increasing we are optimistic about the future we feel optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of the year while there is still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact shopping behavior this holiday season including the effect on several countries in europe that have recently implemented lockdowns we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on demand regardless of which channel our consumer chooses to engage with the brands we are currently planning a 4th quarter review and an increase in 3rd quarter levels and continue improving on year over year declines i am confident the long term course we have set for the company our efforts around antimicrobial uv sanitization and blue light protection are driven by our belief that consumers will increasingly look for solutions that will enhance their digital wellness we also believe another consumer priority will be increased productivity and comfort from home we will continue our focus on enhancing technology in our lives to meet these growing needs as we fully normalize and understand the impact of covid nineteen on the global economy and our industry i am confident that we have taken the right steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company this includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin products and categories and simplify our core lines of business as a more nimble company we can better serve our retail partners and core consumers capitalize on the tailwinds from the multiyear roll out of fiveg with the margin benefits from our branding consolidation and generate increased revenue thank you thanks chris since many details of our quarterly financial performance were included in the supplementary financial information issued earlier today i would just like to take a few minutes to add some additional comments on our 3rd quarter financial performance q three net sales decreased by approximately 21 to $150000000 after exiting a very difficult 2nd quarter we saw good momentum throughout the 3rd quarter as retail outlets continued to open that being said the residual effects of covid nineteen combined with the delay of the launch of the new apple devices which pushed some orders into q four made it a difficult year over year compare overall we are pleased with the momentum and sales improvements we saw retail which enabled us to increase sales by almost fifty on a consecutive quarter basis from $77000000 to $115000000 q three gross profit is a percentage of net sales decreased year over year there were a number of puts and takes that impacted our gross profit during the quarter including a benefit from net lower duty rates and expected duty refunds which i will discuss in more detail in a 2nd this benefit was offset by higher expedited air freight rates and increased air freight rates along with the sale of excess inventory margins that were lower than our historical averages on the subject of duty refunds in early august we received an exclusion notice that duties paid on certain products imported from china are being refunded we work closely with our customs broker to begin submitting refund documentation to us customs this work is ongoing and given the volume of imports from china since late 2018 we will continue throughout the 4th quarter based on the work completed to date we recorded a refund receivable at the quarter end of approximately $5400000 for duties paid that we expect to be refunded the income statement impact of this receivable offset by the balance sheet reduction from duties previously capitalized and inventoried and then sold in q 322 was a net income statement benefit of $1700000 or approximately 140 basis points to gross profit margin during the quarter as i mentioned there is still quite a bit of work left to do during the 4th quarter to complete our remaining refund submissions and we will provide an update on any additional refund upside on our next call q three operating expenses decreased 29 or approximately $12000000 compared to last year the decrease was due primarily to the various cost cutting measures that we implemented as a result of the expected covid nineteen impacts on demand over the last several months we have made the conscious decision to bring some individuals back from furlough to support 4th quarter product launches and customer care but we continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult time q three adjusted ebitda was $15000000 versus 21000000 in the prior year period that decline in overall gross profit margin for reasons i mentioned earlier these items were offset by the decreases in operating expenses that i just discussed turning to the balance sheet compared to a year ago accounts receivable decreased 33 to $91000000 due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period however our dso improved significantly from 87 days to 73 days the quality of our receivables remains very good inventory was $80000000 compared to $94000000 at the end of the 1st quarter a reduction of approximately $14000000 during the 3rd quarter we expect to continue to see improvements in our operating results as we continue to execute our cost reduction initiatives as we closely monitor retail sell through customer forecasts and customer inventory levels to ensure we did not overextend on inventory purchasing as a result we did incur some incremental expedited air freight charges due to increased demand at the end of the 3rd quarter as retail sell through improved at this point we will continue to closely monitor the factors that influence our purchasing forecasts but we will continue to apply a conservative approach due to the continued uncertainties related to the covid nineteen pandemic as we discussed on the last call during april we amended our credit facility to increase the total amount available under the line of credit from $100000000 to $150000000 this expansion combined with the loan received under the cares act the q two restructuring and cost cutting initiatives we have undertaken gives us confidence that we will successfully navigate the headwinds that covid nineteen has put on the business the capital allocation focus throughout the remainder of 2020 will remain on funding working capital needs and continuing to service our line of credit as we look to the 4th quarter of 2020 we definitely have a better visibility now than we did when we last spoke in august given this market uncertainty we will not be providing annual guidance at this time however given our current view of customer orders and positive retail sell through trends we expect strong sequential net sales and adjusted ebitda growth over the 3rd quarter we expect 2020 year to date growth to improve during the 4th quarter though as i mentioned we will see some pressure over the next few quarters compared to historical averages of mid 30s as we sell through our excess we expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high 20s to low $30000000 for the 4th quarter no different than any other company covid nineteen has been extremely disruptive to our business however with the steps we have taken to restructure the business reduce fixed costs and ensure adequate liquidity i am confident that the impact of covid nineteen is a much stronger company than when we entered with that we will now open up the call for questions thank you ladies and gentlemen please press start in the number one key on your touch tone telephone again that is started in the number one key on your touch tone telephone your 1st question comes from the line of elliott alper from d a davidson your lines are open great thank you so thanks for the info on just the sequential sales in the 4th quarter i guess could you talk about any trends in the 4th quarter dates specifically and specifically geographic sales mix are you seeing any material changes yeah just a couple of notes you know with the apple launch happening a little bit later than we had experienced previously there there was you know maybe $5000000 of of sales that shifted from q three into q four which will obviously benefit kind of the the sequential the sequential look at revenue overall though we are seeing really good sell through of of the phones it seems like we have had very successful market and obviously we are benefiting from that so q four starting off really really well in terms of geos you know no material change in geos expansion you know chris mentioned or or geomix you know chris mentioned on his in his prepared remarks that we are definitely seeing some headwinds at least in terms of shut downs in some of our international locations however you know the wireless dealers in those locations you know have been deemed as essential and so those have remained open ok great and then aside from the apple launch shifting into the 4th quarter can you talk about the holiday season and kind of what may be different this year versus historically thank you i mean any implications that that may have on the december quarter yeah but one thing that we will we are still very optimistic about the sell through i would say optimistic about the sell through i think we are still going to see a pretty strong online attachment from boatside dot com obviously through amazon so but we are very i would say optimistic about the sell through optimistic about the sell through our screen protection in cases are quite strong and that is given that we still have a number of other devices to take the market actually this week so overall i think we have some good runway for the holiday season okay great thank you thank you and once again in order to ask a question please press one on your touch tone telephone hi this is matt from titan capital management your line is open great thank you i was hoping you could put the number on the expedited shipping costs that you incurred in the 3rd quarter just to give it some better idea how the housing numbers were well at the end you know we did have to move quickly and unfortunately resulted in some some expedited air freight charges and for the 4th quarter are you expecting that to to reoccur or have you caught up and you feel like you are in a better place now just generally freight rates have increased kind of globally and so that is that is also impacted it but i think there is probably going to be a little bit of that you know as i mentioned it is a bit of a balancing act actually we definitely wanted to be careful you know given the pandemic and in how much inventory we were planning and you know fortunately or unfortunately we have seen some some upsides which is great but we have had to chase those and so i think we are probably still chasing a little bit which will impact some of our  q four q four sales and and then also obviously the spend also wanted to ask if i could really quickly about the tariff situation now with biden presidency i know you have been moving some production out of china does that change your view on moving production out of china or how are you thinking about this new regime yeah i think that mati does not change our strategy ultimately we are looking to diversify across our cm base so we are still following the strategy you know we have had a very good quarter where we have now successfully have piloted both screen protection and wireless power outside of china so it gives us that ability to be able to shift our our supply chain when needed obviously china is still a big part of our our strategy but what i like is we are not just looking at it from a tariff perspective now we are really looking at it from a business continuity perspective thank you both thanks my hhp i am showing no for the question at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to mister kris herring for any closing remarks thank you and thank everybody for  joining our q three earnings report we look forward to updating you again on q four have a great evening everyone and stay safe ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference call thank you all for joining

on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key to allow for as many questions as possible we ask that you each keep to one question and one follow up our 1st question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays please proceed with your question great thanks so much good morning everybody good morning andrew good morning hi you know i am curious for the for the past several years michelle the majority if not all of the companies you know organic sales growth has come really from pricing as opposed to volume or consumption growth and much of this is obviously due to the success of the company is new pricing model and the associated volume elasticity that that comes with it i guess that said as you look forward into 21 and beyond i am curious if there is a sort of focus internally on maybe regaining some better balance between the two drivers and if so you know would you expect to see some of that maybe develop more fully next year thanks so much yep andrew absolutely i think we have shared before that you know we do view pricing as an important part of our growth algorithm but we are very focused and would like to drive to greater balance between price and volume you know we have good visibility into q four and 2021 and we do expect volume trends to improve part of that will be us lapping some of our pricing plasticity from last year and also a continuation of some of the strong share gains that we have seen to date that will carry into the 1st part of next year i think you can definitely count on seeing volume being a more important part of the algorithm next year and we feel good that the calendar programming we have the innovation the media is really going to help to drive some of that great great thanks very much thank you thank you our next question comes from line of ken goldman with jp morgan please proceed with your questions hi thank you along the same lines of 2021 if i can michelle you you pulled back a little bit on advertising this quarter it has been a little up and down this year for for understandable reasons i am just curious what your thoughts are in general on what the company is plan is for advertising marketing in general as you get into what hopefully will be a more normal year in 202 sure so we definitely believe in investing in our brands that is a critical piece of our growth model on the business so clearly as we mentioned to you we had pulled back on some spend in areas where we just thought given the pandemic it did not make sense for example in refreshments where we knew consumer usage was down significantly but as we looked at 2021 and as we have started to you know see the momentum that we are seeing and some of the recoveries you know we definitely plan on taking our investment levels to where we would like them to be and more in line with where they have been historically so you will see us really leaning into to drive the consumer and to leverage some of the behaviors that we are seeing thank you and then for a follow up you you did not do any share repurchases this quarter i think that is the 1st time in two years and that was the last time was right before you bought pirate is booty i want to ask if the lack of repo is an indication of a pending deal of course but i am curious how you would describe the current environment for potential transactions i guess particularly our targets may be more willing to sell because they can do so off a higher sales number than usual or are they more hesitant because they i guess kind of want to ride this demand wave as long as they can steve do you want to take that one yeah i would be happy to so 1st just on the share repurchase i will just echo what you said do not read anything into that i would say for this year we have taken a little bit more cautious approach to liquidity in general you know going back to the beginning of the year and the covid phase just taking a little bit more cautious approach we will be revisiting that as we look at next year and i would say in general our capital allocation priorities have not changed with respect to m a specifically it is probably more the latter i think people are are still the ones that are the most interesting are riding the wave and they still have valuation expectations that look like they did pre covid if not higher but i would say we are continuing to have an active funnel continue to look at a number of opportunities and we will continue to update the the market as appropriate great thank you both thank you our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse please proceed with your question hi thank you i i think the the the recovery expected in 2021 in international and other is you know you you have a two headwind this year in 202 but can you give us a little bit of color as to the condition of your business in mexico and india and china is is it easy to assume that things can go back to normal or has the pandemic im impaired your commercial capabilities at all or the retailers desire to merchandise confectionary products i in those markets yeah so 1st of all i would start by saying certainly there is a lot of uncertainty and volatility with the pandemic we all know that we are seeing the ups and downs of you know occasional increases of spikes in markets around the globe that that said i would say that we were pleasantly surprised by our performance in international our team did a great job executing in this very challenging environment and i think that you know we have seen while each market is a little different and the use of the category is a little bit different consumers are really looking during this time for brands they trust and we have done a great job over the past couple of years building the the hershey equity so we were pleased with the rebound that we saw in many of our markets i think i mentioned in india our business was now up six versus it had been down we gained market share across almost every market on our core chocolate category so i ha i would not say that we believe our ability to drive the business has been impaired in any market on a permanent basis you know just as we are pivoting in the u s i think we have pivoted to where the opportunities are in international and we feel good about the the recovery and you know plan to continue to deliver against that thanks can i can i dive a little bit deeper into mexico are there any packaging requirements that the government is making on our nutritional values or a any concerns about about the category how that might impact the category yeah absolutely so the government did put in place front of pack labeling changes in mexico and that new packaging is now in the market and we are beginning to monitor the trends we believe consumers know our category as a treat they know it has sugar and so we expect that we will see less impact from that than perhaps other categories will but we will of course keep a close eye on that and i would say mexi mexico has been one of the harder hit developing markets relative to covid so we feel good about the progress we are seeing but it is a little slower than some of the other markets okay very good thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of david palmer with evercore isi please proceed with your question thanks good morning a question on your share gains and in the u s and particularly in chocolate you you really in in your prepared remarks you touched on this how adaptive you were by market by channel in each state in ter in terms of s mores some of that it is related or might be related to supply chain could you talk about that part of it and and i think the the reason i am asking is because if there is a supply chain breakdown or lack of adaptability by a competitor maybe that will represent share gains that they can reverse somewhat in 21 and i have a follow up yeah absolutely so i would say i believe our share gains are a testament to both our strong brands our consumer understanding our programming as well as to the supply chain execution and execution at retail both of which tend to be you know core advantages for us as a company so i think we are seeing our categories and our brands are definitely resonating with consumers and as you mentioned we really pivoted with the consumer so very early on we tried to understand how consumer behavior was changing and we have talked to all of you before about the fact that our category splits a 3rd a 3rd a 3rd take home instant consumable and seasonal and as we saw consumer shifts to more at home behaviors we very early on shifted the focus in our portfolio to really dial up s mores twizzlers for movie nights you know our baking product activities and then within the seasons even with halloween we made that decision to lean in and drive and build a halloween season versus back away from it and and everything related to that relative to let us set the season early so we can get consumers in in pre trick or treat you know let us make sure we are smart about the portfolio that is out there and not overly index to seasonal skus et cetera and then we worked really hard on messaging to message consumers safe ways to celebrate the holiday we dialed up ecommerce as consumer shifted to ecommerce and because we had invested in capabilities in that we were able to do that and then i think a lot of the strong investments we have made in other capabilities over the years helped us during this time to execute well and some of those go beyond supply chain so you know we have made investments in better understanding consumer trends we have made investments in our ability to forecast at a much more granular level we have made media investments to target better and certainly we have invested in our plants all along the way which really enabled us to pivot quickly to safety protocols and really really be able to continue to execute and then we made the decision to keep our retail sales teams at retail so as i think about you know think about that share gain i would say clearly we would expect to to continue to see share gains clearly through the spring of two we would expect that they would moderate after that though we are certainly expecting to to hold on to share and we will continue to drive our outstanding programming and and also continue to execute supply chain with excellence that is helpful thank you and then just on any sort of one times from this year that that we should be thinking about from a model perspective i am thinking about covid related friction costs this year but also you might add back some sg a in parts and and other so any one time type comparisons that we should think about thanks yeah i think we talked about in the prepare prepared remarks on the top line we had about a two point impact so you can right away say there is a drop through that two points into profitability but then if you take a look at the net of costs for covid so protective equipment and employee incentives that we had earlier in the year and you net them against the dme optimization the media optimization that we did as well as the t e savings it was a net slight positive on those two pieces and so that we would expect to mostly go away we will have some lingering costs next year probably less one off in any quarter related to covid ppe and so forth that continue but net it was just a slight positive outside of the two point drag on the top line thank you thank you our next question comes from line of chris growe with stifel please proceed with your question hi good morning good morning hi i had a question for you if i if i look back at halloween i am cu curious if you split the season apart and you had given some information on last quarter sort of the early season part and that trick or treat season part kind of how each piece performed if you can give it a little color on that we have some information from iri but i am curious if you have better information than we have and then i am i am also curious as i think about that early part if that is more indicative of what you expect for the holiday season as we move into christmas and that kind of time where you do not have a trick or treat event could that early season if you start that that season early in particular in stores be more like what we saw in the early part of halloween if that makes sense yup so clearly we saw that within the season the early part of the season performed more strongly and the later part that is more trick or treat focused performed a little bit softer now we had anticipated that so overall the season performed exactly in line with our expectations as we look at the total season we were quite pleased that our sales were actually up versus a year ago as was our sell through up versus a year ago so during a time of the global pandemic i think it speaks to the resiliency of the category and the consumer is desire to really hold onto and continue to celebrate the traditions and fun occasions like this in their family lives as we look at holiday holiday is has some different consumer dynamics than halloween and so we believe it will behave a little differently i do not think we are going to have some of the pressure that we anticipated we would have coming into halloween the category should be quite strong consumers use the product in you know in different ways it is much more about family occasions we are not as big in gifting some of the areas of the category that might be a little bit more hard hit so we expect solid results given that skew to at home consumption okay thank you and then just to follow on to that did did are you shipping in shipping in holiday products early and would that have been an incremental benefit do we see some of that in the 3rd quarter more than we would have seen historically yeah we did just like we did with halloween started shipping in holiday a bit early so you do get some pickup in the 3rd quarter for that that will take away a little bit from the 4th quarter you know maybe on the order of fifty basis points okay great and we offered that to drive the consumer behavior early as well just as we did with halloween you know as halloween was still on the floor holiday was also out there so that co consumers could also you know gravitate to the holiday pretty quickly a strong halloween yes strong halloween sell through really helps us because it helps us get that fast start to holiday because it clears the space to be able to put holiday on the floor okay thanks so much for the color there absolutely thank you our next question comes from line of jason english with goldman sachs please proceed with your question hey good morning folks congratulations on a on a good quarter as well thank you i want to pick up on the back of chris is questions and and tease out try to tease out a little bit more of the outlook on holidays going forward the halloween early part selling was phenomenally stronger much better than i think any of us expected it i think a big part of that is due to the merchandising programs that retailers had it seems like they started bigger and earlier than they usually do has has that easily influenced how they are going to approach other seasons going forward so say said more directly you expect retailers to provide more more merchandising support behind the category into the holiday into easter than the otherwise would coming out of the the success they saw on halloween so we have always had pretty strong merchandising support at every season and one thing we always think about with seasons is when we get it on the floor because we know that consumers will buy that holiday or seasonal product whether it is easter or wherever early for in home consumption if you get it out there it is kind of sparks the trigger of you know fun moments earlier so i do not know that i could say specifically that we can anticipate that retailers are going to merchandise it even more than they ever have i do think that they will be focused on making sure that they definitely get it out early to capture the early part of the season since that is the piece that you know is a bit more stable there were a few retailers you know as you can imagine with the uncertainty of halloween and the fact that all these decisions about what to do with halloween really had to be made in early may when things were quite uncertain and schools were closed and bars and restaurants and all of that so there are a few retailers who had pulled back on halloween and based on the results of the season this year they will likely have more confidence going forward which should help to make for an even stronger halloween next year and probably also build confidence for the other seasons like easter that that makes a lot of sense and then one more question on the i am sticking with follow ons to chris is question which i thought was solid the the the the early part of the season versus the latter part of the season the early part of season was exceptionally robust and you said late part was a bit softer but in somewhere in your remarks i think you said all in total holiday so both pre early part and late part finished down mid single digits for the category i think mathematically to get the category down mid single digits we are going to have to see some pretty pretty sharp declines coming through the the retail sales data in the next couple of weeks as we as we capture that late part of the season i am thinking about it right am i interpreting your comments correctly yes yep you are interpreting them correctly so category was down mid single digits overall as much as our business was actually up and we will see some of those decline okay thank you very much and jason it is melissa one other thing sure to just keep in mind there is a little bit of a timing impact from the nielsen and iri data given that the season was on a saturday versus a thursday and based on retail recording days so you will probably even see it down even more and you will have to wait till kind of mid november so you see some of the those last couple of days being reported so some of it when you see will be just the timing shift because of the day of the week and some of it will certainly be the the declines in integrity at the end understood thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of david driscoll with dd research please proceed with your question great thank you good morning and congratulations on a great execution in the quarter thanks david i had 22 questions the 1st one just two relatively small ones on the other expense commentary i think through the through the year to date period other expense is is only a small number but your full year projection 100 to $110000000 on that means it is a very massive number in the 4th quarter if am i doing the math right is that is that correct on how the the pattern lays out for other expense and then related just another follow up on your volumes e expected in the 4th quarter i think in your prepared comments you said north american organic growth similar to 3rd quarter but pricing only like a half point so that would mean volume is something like five percentage points positive in the 4th quarter am i doing those two pieces right any color you can give on those two comments yeah i would be happy to so on the tax side and other expense you are exactly right we will have a large other expense in the 4th quarter now that is consistent with what we have been saying even in the early guidance earlier in the year and then along with that a lower tax rate in the 4th quarter to do the math on the tax rate you also have to solve for a lower tax rate so that is how the those two lines will play out and yes on the volume up in the 4th quarter you are thinking about it the right way we do have some inventory replenishments that will happen in the 4th quarter we saw that in the 3rd we will see some more of that or that continue into the 4th we are also lapping some elasticity after the price increase last year and then this continued strong sheer gains those three things are part of driving that 4th quarter volume michele like a bigger picture question hershey took pricing in most of the portfolio outside of seasonal candies in 2018 and then in 201 given the negative impact to halloween for the entire category would you agree that now is probably not the time for seasonal price increase actions maybe this gets delayed to 2022 or sometime later until we get a normal consumer environment essentially i am just asking you to assess your your ability to pass through cost increases through pricing actions it is a weird environment and i do not know how it is altered that calculus thank you yep so obviously i can not speak to any specifics about our specific any upcoming specific pricing actions what i can say is you know there has been no change to our pricing strategy of smaller more frequent increases and that does not necessarily mean we are going to have the same amount of pricing every year or that we would always announce pricing at the same time you know we did for example actually have a small price increase this past year on our food service business in the 3rd quarter so you know if we look zero over time we have been able to price at various times and various economic conditions so what is important to us is we do think pricing is an important part of our algorithm but as we have talked about before we really want to grow through balanced growth across levers distribution velocity innovation price et cetera so you know we know that that that is certainly the one piece of the portfolio that we we have not yet priced and i think it is fair to say that you know given that we have not announced a price increase at this moment in time the magnitude of pricing in 21 would be less than we have seen in prior years at least at this point you know we have been pleased that we have seen conversion be pretty good this year even in a very difficult economic environment and i think that continues to demonstrate what we have seen over the years which is the category is very resilient our brands are strong we continue to invest into our brands and that does allow us for an even greater amount of pricing power really helpful thank you so much thank you our next question comes from the line of steve powers with deutsche bank please proceed with your question yes hey thanks good morning i i guess building somewhat on earlier questions i would love a little bit more color around just your general mindset heading into 21 as you work through your planning process you clearly there there are parts of your business that have been under pressure this year international movie theaters vending specialty et cetera and hopefully all those set up for at least directional recovery in the year ahead but at the same time you have been gaining a lot of share you have had great success in at home categories like baking and with initiatives like s mores all of which is fantastic momentum but you know again could set up for difficult year over year comparisons so as you size it all together i guess is there a way to to frame your thinking at a summary level to what degree those various puts and takes sort of just net each other out in your mind or are you approaching 21 planning thinking we have got you know either a net easier or a net harder setup versus what you know eleven might consider typical thanks yeah so we are pleased with the momentums that we are seeing and i would say you know your call outs in what you shared about some of the ups and downs on the business i think are very accurate you know we believe we are seeing that our category and our brands really resonate with consumers and especially at a time like this where they are looking for some of those moments of goodness moments of happiness we are really pleased with how we have been able to pivot with the consumer and also pivot with our capabilities to be able to execute within this environment and we feel good about that mo momentum and our ability to continue pivoting so you know this year obviously it was consumer shifted to take home and so we dialed up s mores and we dialed up twizzlers and we dialed up baking and we you know leaned in to create the season to make sure that we could capture that opportunity you know giving consumers new ways to participate in halloween that frankly we believe those things like candy slides and candy graveyards and all the creative things people did will probably become a part of their ongoing traditions and they have just evolved you know as i mentioned we were able to dial in and accelerate ecommerce and i th i think as we look to next year we are prepared if the consumer pivots yet again to be able to pivot with them i think we have built and we have demonstrated ability to execute well during this environment and also to pivot from an executional perspective whether it is at retail or in our manufacturing facilities so we are very focused on that you know we have captured as well some you know cultural positive effects i think capabilities we have built in terms of operating in this environment that you know perhaps allow us to make decisions more quickly and you know we think that is an enabler for us going forward so so we feel we feel good about the as we look to the future thanks for that michele i do not know if you want to take this one or steve but i just as a follow up sort of unrelated just any any comments you might have on on just current levels of promotion the promotional environment and what you expect to see there over the balance of four q and into 21 thanks yeah we do not see any significant change relative to promotional activity we did not really see it this year we did not execute anything significantly differently and nor do we expect to see anything in the future okay perfect appreciate it thank you our next question comes from line of nik modi with rbc please proceed with your question yeah good morning everyone so michele i was hoping you could provide some context on the partnership with google that you used during the halloween period and you know do you believe this capability can be leveraged for this holiday season but also kind of in your everyday business as you kind of look forward you know we are continuing to to leverage different types of data and analytics and insights more and more across the business and you know we continue to really try and stay on top of tracking consumer sentiment and leveraging data and analytics to tailor copy to tailor messaging to tailor media so more and more we are operating at a more sophisticated level relative to using multiple data sources and also using that to reach consumers at the right places with the right message at the right time and i i guess what i am trying to get at is you know is this kind of new way of of kind of targeting consumers like the return that you see from what you have done like can you just give us any kind of understanding because one thing i am noticing across the entire cpg landscape is companies are spending more money but they are spending more money on the same message and in fact you know new consumers are being recruited you know usage occasions are changing and so it really requires a change in how you talk to those consumers and so i find this you know google partnership you know incredibly compelling for you guys so i am just trying to get better context on how it is changing the return profile of your spend if you can provide any context on that so we have a continuous focus on optimizing media and the returns on our media we always have we have had strong media roi forever and our challenge is how do we keep making them better and then we continuously optimize based on that so right now you know it is it is a big spend area for us so it is an area we are very focused on elevating and it is about you know making sure right now i would say some of the biggest opportunity is that opportunity of even more precise targeting and then once you have that target the ability to alter the message so and then we alter our media mix accordingly and i would say we we see you know significant movement in that mix on a year to year basis as we get better at that i think we have raised you know some of the opportunities of how we have gone just very deep relative to specific seasons whether it is s mores by zip code or whether it is specific you know holidays and looking at sell through at a store level basis to be able to dial up media on a zip code level basis so you will you will continue to see more of that frankly that is just becoming a way of of how we operate now great and last question just from an innovation standpoint can you just provide any context on kind of what is remaining in terms of innovation this year and how things are going to work in 2021 if there is any clarity you can provide on on on the launch timing yup so we feel very good about our innovation some of the innovations that we are excited about that are you know new to the market include the reese is pretzel product a reese is cup with pretzels in it we have had a a range of kit kat flavors we know on a global basis a big p part of the kit kat portfolio are flavors they tend to do quite well we are on a very small level watching snack cakes under our research trademark which you know delivers that reese experience in a slightly different type of product form and we feel good on that versus basis some of the early test results and we will have more coming some items on our take home side of our business that will not get announced till early next year which is typically the time we announce those things just given reset windows no major change in our innovation strategy we think it is working very well for us we think it is right sized and we think it is delivering much more sustainable results great i will pass it on thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of michael lavery with piper sandler please proceed with your question thank you good morning good morning good morning you have talked about the the increase in ecommerce sales even if it it might have decelerated a little bit but it is it is up very strongly you have said in the past that baskets and dollar ring are higher online is that still holding true with the growth that you are seeing now and on the margin side you have you have mentioned that there is a small gap but that it that you were narrowing it and and the scale would help that is is that coming along the way that you would have expected how does that look now yeah i mean we have generally seen larger basket sizes in general across most channels this year as people are you know doing fewer trips and you know more quantity per trip so i think that has been somewhat of just an underlying dynamic given the the pandemic impact in the marketplace for us on our ecommerce business we have seen very significant growth across the board but particularly in click and collect where people actually go and and pick up their their groceries and also in the local delivery models as well versus kind of national deliver the margins that we have are similar to what we see in bricks and mortar okay great that is that is helpful in those two areas e excuse me in those two areas where we have you know similar products obviously that we sell in bricks and mortar steve right right anything you want to add yeah i would say is that you know we have said in the past that overall ecommerce margins are a little bit dilutive and it is there as michele just said in click and collect and local delivery very similar not much impact and that is probably two thirds of our ecommerce business the piece that is more dilutive is the ship to home and in particular cold ship and that is an area where we continue to work with our customers and look at our overall investment with those customers and joint business planning to drive efficiencies over time so that those margins align okay thanks and i i just want to follow up on s mores i thought that that your that your data analysis and insight there to to to push that the way that you did was was interesting as you are seeing you know cases rise again now are you replicating that are you seeing similar results i is there a a s mores search we should expect and and would it be right to assume that those hershey is milk chocolate bars are probably some of the highest margin ones that you have we have really expanded s mores from at one point it was a very focused time of year to really capturing some orders as a year round opportunity especially if you especially if you think about how different weather is across the entire country there are lots of opportunities to continue to expand that so we are very focused on that you know we are also very focused on the upcoming baking season where we know that consumers will be spending time at home it is already a natural baking season and so we will be looking to really optimize what we are able to drive you know leveraging insights around that season as well okay great thanks a lot thank you our next question comes from the line of bryan spillane with bank of america please proceed with your question hi guys good morning everyone so so just just eleven question for me and i think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks about some co you know inflation and cost of goods sold so maybe steve could you just give us a kind of a lay of the land right now in terms of you know what commodity costs and and just cost to goods inflation looks like currently you know in the context of things like freight costs are going up you have had some competitors talk about cocoa prices going up so just trying to get an understanding of you know directionally where where inflation is headed right now sure yeah for us i would say overall it has been relatively stable so on the commodity side relatively stable you know you saw big movements in in commodities across q two and q three and of course we have talked in the past we mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program and i would say today they are fairly stable there are increases in freight costs there too our teams do a great job of a longer term contracting which helps mitigate some of that increase so that has not been a real material impact for us we have seen some increased warehousing costs and part of that volume and flow through along with the share gains and and the volume increases that we have seen so we called that out in the prepared remarks but in total at least sitting at this point you know would say overall cogs is fairly stable and we will get more guidance on 2021 when we get into the 4th quarter call but but i guess we can infer from that at least from where we sit today that you know that stable is is something that looks like it kind of carries into next year unless something changes yeah i think that is fair you know next year as we get the you are going to have the 2020 and 2021 crops crops of cocoa start to bear the lid so you know there is that to consider and then there is other things obviously on the gross margin side we as michele said you know we will have a little bit more volume driven than price driven mix driving gross margin next year we will have our continuing productivity goals and again a lot more on that to come when we talk on the 4th quarter call all right thanks steve that is that is very helpful have a happy thanksgiving everyone thank you thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of john baumgartner with wells fargo please proceed with your question good morning thanks for the question good morning good morning michele i like to follow up on the reese is snack cake you know you mentioned that it is small right now but you know hershey went down this path about fifteen years ago and it did not really translate into anything material so i am curious what the data tells you in terms of changes the landscape now does this maybe mark a new phase over the snack section evolution and i guess where do you think it slots in i mean does it compete against the twinkies the cookies just you know where is the target market you know any any big picture thoughts would be appreciated yeah absolutely so you know i think we have approached this in a very thoughtful and measured way which was not a mass launch where we just threw it out there and tried to make it as big as we possibly could at one point in time but we did a very targeted end market launch for an extended period of time so that we could really learn about the proposition we spent a lot of time in terms of developing the product to make sure that we really understood some of the drivers of liking in this snack cake area and we also really thought about you know where how where and how we wanted to to play and launch so this for example is very c store focused it is you know a a single serve type of item so we are keeping it as a as a focused launch it is definitely bringing the great chocolate and peanut butter taste profile that we have on reese is to the snack cake market so yes it is you know playing in that snake snack cake area versus other snack cake brands we know that we had participated in this category for many years through licensing and we learned through that that our brands could participate and extend to the category we also know that morning snacking has been a growing trend and our confection items skew more to afternoon and evening so this is a chance for us to participate in some of that growth because that is where these snack cakes get utilized so again we are going to be very focused rollout we will put it in locations where we think we can garner incremental space and where we think there is a strong consumer fit and starting at c store and looking at other select areas and then if it continues to perform perform well we will expand but we will watch it closely and take a measured approach great thanks michele sure thank you our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein please proceed with your question good morning everyone good morning hi alexia hi buck can we just talk about the the c store channel specifically it is obviously been under pressure because of the pandemic but i imagine that there has been some sequential improvement in there could you maybe just give us some numbers about how that channel is is recovering absolutely so as you said we have continued to see strength in food and mass and dollar as consumers eat more at home the c store class did see a bit of recovery in the 3rd quarter so we saw the business grow in the low low single digits in the 3rd quarter which is definitely an improvement versus those early pandemic trends it did then slow a little bit as summer ended and those summer road trips decreased with kids going back to school our business has tracked pretty much in line with the channel and significantly ahead of the category so we have share gains of about 120 basis points in q three in that channel so i am seeing some some rebounds and some recovery versus versus where it was in the past as people are out and about a little bit more than they were great and and then as a follow up follow up actually on bryan spillane is question about freight costs i remember back in 2018 as freight costs spiked back then that is quite a bit of a headwind for you it seems as though it is not so much of a problem this time around are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of cogs freight actually represents and how much about is already contracted out and what you have learned since 2018 to make the situation this time around a bit more manageable thank you sure so yeah freight cost right now we do not see as a a material impact if it continues to rise it will have a bigger a bigger impact right now again because we are contracted and our teams do a great job of managing those contracts it is not having as material impact you know it is roughly ten of of cogs overall and so it is not immaterial but right now not seeing enough movement there given the contracting to really drive a material impact on overall cogs great thank you very much i will pass it on thank you our next question comes from the line of jonathan feeney with consumer edge please proceed with your question good morning thanks very much and and thanks for a great halloween personally and professionally you know the leanest of my financial ambitions has been to give out full sized candy bars which i was again able to execute so thank you two quick ones i noticed in the data your pricing in north america is you know +nineteen on the takeaway +33 is what you reported is that just the math or is there some you know shrinking or different mix within retailer margins that was my 1st question and secondly historically when you look at your today is velocity is generally tomorrow is distribution and your velocity has been fantastic this is a weird year a lot of people is velocity is fantastic but do you anticipate gaining shelf space and that every day place you know you you will look at the steel baking items you look at these take home items like this is phenomenally better velocity forget about just the total sales that you are seeing there you anticipate significant share gains perhaps structural ones i am talking share of shelf here as retailers do resets for holiday and full going forward thank you sure so two parts to your question the 1st one is around price and some of the discrepancy and yes there is a mix impact honestly it might be best if melissa goes and takes you through a deep dive on that because there is some complexity associated with it but the p l is is definitely accurate as it relates to velocity yeah good velocity i like your phrase today is loss of the smartest distribution i do think that is very accurate as we look at the seasons you asked about holiday you know we certainly have been able to garner incremental distribution incremental sk use throughout the year both in terms of every day and seasons because we have been able to deliver and the items that we then put on shelf not only could we supply them but then they moved so we do feel good about that you know we will continue to take a very disciplined approach and be very careful that we do not over skew so we really have to look at the the productivity of every skew and as long as it is good we will be there but yes we have been able to gain some distribution and and going forward i anticipate that we will continue to be able to perhaps even through the 1st part of next year thanks very much and i will follow up with melissa very good our next question comes from the line of ken dasla with bmo please proceed with your question hey good morning everyone good morning again i just have one quick question everything has been asked and answered you make a reference in the in the prepared remarks about pirate is booty is tracking ahead of your strategic plans can you talk about what are the key learnings that you have developed through your years as a ceo that has really helped you kind of make this a better acquisition and you know implement it you know what are your key learnings and what do you take forward to future learnings to future acquisitions well so i think a lot of learnings along the way i guess i would start with you know there is a business model for brands that that we as a company are best with and that is you know branded items where you know brand matters where the business has significant scale you know probably close to that $100000000 mark and it needs to be a business that has a high gross margin because that is what that is what our business model is we are a branded company we invest a lot in marketing and we have high margins that enable us to kind of invest in grow invest in growth and we that is that is our model that is what that is what we need so i think that was one of the biggest learnings was to help us select the asset i think secondly really understanding the strength of the brand and really being able to do the right deep dive on which kpis we think predict the ability for a brand to scale and then i would say you know really trying to scale the business well and i would say hey we have learned lessons the whole way along the way as you know in the past we bought some businesses over to small we bought some businesses that you know had lower margins and we had some that we perhaps did not execute on the scaling as well and i think we have had a very focused ex effort on the scaling as well and we have gotten much better at that relative to supply chain relative to the talent that we need when we buy a company like this where we want to keep the entrepreneurial spirit we want to keep people who know the brand and the business but we also have to be focused on the point that we are also at a point where we want to scale the business so i mean i go back to the scale the branded nature the high margin are probably the biggest ones and then picking the right underlying kpis that that say it is a sustainable business cause if we can do that we can make it home great i really appreciate it thanks stay well thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i will turn the floor back to ms poole for any

questions as possible we ask that you each keep to one question and one follow up our 1st question comes from the line of andrew lazzaro with barkley please proceed with your question great thanks so much good morning everybody good morning andrew hi you know i am curious for the for the past several years michelle the majority if not all of the companies you know organic sales growth has come really from pricing as opposed to volume or consumption growth is that accurate i think this is obviously due to the success of the company is new pricing model and the associated volume elasticity that that comes with it i guess that said as you look forward into the 21st and beyond i am curious if there is a sort of focus internally on maybe regaining some better balance between the two drivers and if so you know would you expect to see some of that maybe develop more fully next year thanks so much but we are very focused and would like to drive to greater balance between price and volume now we have good visibility into q four and 2021 and we do expect volume trends to improve part of that will be us lapsing some of our pricing elasticity from last year and also a continuation of some of the strong share gains that we have seen to date that will carry into the 1st part of next year i think you can definitely count on seeing volume being a more important part of the algorithm next year and we feel good that the calendar of programming we have the innovation the media is really going to help to drive some of that great great thanks very much thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of ken goldman would j p morgan please proceed with your question hi thank you along the same lines of 2021 if i michelle you you pull back a little bit on advertising this quarter it has been a little up and down this year for for understandable reasons i am just curious what your thoughts are in general on what the company is plan is for advertising marketing in general as you get into what hopefully will be a more normal year in 2021 sure so we definitely believe in investing in our brands that is a critical piece of our growth model on the business so clearly as we mentioned to you we had pulled back on some spend in areas where we just thought given the pandemic it did not make sense for example in refreshments where we knew consumer usage was down significantly but as we looked at 2021 and as we have started to you know see the momentum that we are seeing and some of the recoveries yeah we definitely plan on taking our investment levels to where we would like them to be and more and more inline where they have been historically so you will see us really gleaming in to to drive the consumer and to leverage some of the behaviors that we are seeing thank you and then for a follow up you you did not do any share repurchases this quarter i think that is the 1st time in two years and that was the last time was right before you bought pirates booty i will not ask if the lack of repo is an indication of a pending deal of course but i am curious how you would describe the current environment for potential transactions i guess particularly our targets may be more willing to sell because they can do so off a higher sales number than usual or they are more hesitant because they i guess kind of want to ride this demand wave as long as they can steve do you want to take that one yeah i will be happy to so 1st just on the share repurchase i will just echo what you said do not read anything into that i would say for this year we have taken a little bit more cautious approach to liquidity in general you know going back to the beginning of the year and the covid i am just taking a little bit more cautious approach we will be revisiting that as we look at next year and i would say in general our capital allocation priorities have not changed with respect to m and a specifically it is probably more in the latter i think people are still the ones that are the most interesting are riding the wave and they still have valuation expectations that look like they did pre covid if not higher but i would say we are continuing to have an active funnel continue to look at a number of opportunities and our next question comes from line of robert moscow with credit suisse please proceed with your question hi thank you i think the the recovery expected in 2022 in international and and other is you know you have a two headwind this year but can you give us a little bit of color as to the condition of your business in mexico india and china is it easy to assume that things can go back to normal or has the pandemic impaired your commercial capabilities at all or the retailers desire to merchandise confectionary products in those markets yes so 1st of all like by saying certainly there is a lot of uncertainty and volatility with the pandemic we all know that we are seeing the ups and downs of you know occasional increases of spikes in markets around the globe that that said i would say that we were pleasantly surprised by our performance in international our team did a great job executing in this very challenging environment and i think that you know we have seen while each market is a little different and the use of the categories a little bit so we were pleased with the rebound that we saw in many of our markets i think i mentioned in india our business was now up six versus it had been down we gained market share across almost every market on our core chocolate category so i had i would not say that we believe our ability to drive the business forward has been negatively impacted business has been impaired in any market on a permanent basis you know just as we are pivoting in the u s i think we have pivoted to where the opportunities are are in international and we feel good about the the recovery and you know plan to continue to deliver against that thanks can i can i dive a little bit deeper into mexico are there any packaging  requirements that the the government is making on nutritional values or any concerns about  about the category how that might impact the category yeah absolutely so the government did put in place front of pack labeling changes in mexico and that new packaging is now on the market and we are beginning to monitor the trends we believe consumers know our categories a treat they know it has sugar and so we expect that we will see less impact from that then perhaps other categories will but we will of course keep a close eye on that and i would say mexico mexico has been one of the harder hit yeah developing markets relative to covid so we feel good about the progress we are seeing but it is a little slower than some of the other markets very good thank you thank you our next question comes from line of david palmert with evercore isi please proceed with your question thanks so good morning  a question on your share gains and in the u s and particularly in chocolate you you really and in your prepared remarks you touched on this how adaptive you were by market by channel by need state and in terms of sours some that s related or might be related to supply chain could you talk about that part of it and and i think the the reason i m asking is because if there is a supply chain breakdown or lack of adaptability by a competitor maybe that will represent share gains that they can reverse somewhat in 21 and have a follow up as a company so i think we are seeing our categories and our brands are definitely resonating with consumers and as you mentioned we really pivoted with the consumer so very early early on we tried to understand how consumer behavior was changing and we have talked to all of you before about the fact that our category splits a 3rd a 3rd a 3rd take home instant consumable and seasonal and as we saw consumers shift to more at home behaviors we very early on shifted the focus we put our portfolio to really dial up some more toys for movie nights you know our baking product activities and then within the seasons even with halloween we made that decision to lean in and drive and build a halloween season versus back away from it and and everything related to that relative to let us set the season early so we can get consumers in in pre trick or treat you know let us make sure we are smart about the portfolio that is out there we ve overly indexed to seasonal cues et cetera and then we worked really hard on messaging to message consumers safe ways to celebrate the holiday we dialed up ecommerce as consumers shifted to ecommerce and because we had invested in capabilities in that we were able to do that and then i think a lot of the strong investments we have made in other capabilities over the years helped us during this time to execute well and some of those go beyond supply so you know we have made investments in better understanding consumer trends we have made investments in our ability to forecast at a much more granular level we have made media investments to target better and certainly we have invested in our plants all along the way which really enabled us to pivot quickly to safety protocols and really be able to continue to execute and then we made the decision to keep our retail sales team at retail so as i think about you know think about that share gain i would say clearly we would expect to to continue to see share gains clearly through the spring of 21 we would expect that they would moderate after that though we are certainly expecting to to hold on to share and we will continue to to drive our outstanding programming and and also continue to to execute supply chain with excellence that is helpful thank you and then just on any sort of one time from this year that that we should be thinking about from a model perspective i am thinking about covid related friction costs this year but also you might add back some sgna and parts and others so any one time type comparisons that we should think about thanks yeah i think we talked about it in the repaired repaired remarks on the top line we had about a two point impact so you can right away say there is a drop through that two point impact into profitability but then if you take a look at the net of costs for covid so protective equipment and employee incentives that we had earlier in the year and you net them against the dme optimization the bd optimization that we did as well as the t and e savings i think there was a net slight positive on those two pieces and so that we would expect to mostly go away we will have some lingering costs next year probably less one off in any quarter related to covid ppn and so forth that continue but net it was just a slight positive outside of the two point drag on the top line thank you our next question comes from line of chris grove with steelfab please proceed with your question hi good morning good morning hi i had a question for you if i if i looked back at halloween i am curious if you split the season apart and you had given some information on the last quarter sort of the early season part and that trick or treat season part kind of how each piece performed if you can give it a little color around that we have some information from iri i am curious if you have better information than we have and then i am also curious as i think about that early part if that is more indicative of what you expect for the holiday season as we move into christmas and that kind of time where you do not have a trigger treat event can that early season if you start that that season early in particular in stores be more like what we saw in the early part of halloween if that makes sense and the later part that is more trick or treat focused performed a little bit softer now we had anticipated that so overall the season performed exactly in line with our expectations as we look at the total season we were quite pleased that our sales were actually up versus year ago as was our self through up versus year ago so during a time of the global pandemic i think it speaks to the resiliency of the category and the consumer is desire to as we look at holiday holiday has some different consumer dynamics than halloween and so we believe it will behave a little differently i do not think we are going to have some of the pressure that we anticipated we would have coming into halloween the category should be quite strong consumers use the product in you know in different ways it is much more about family occasions we are not as big in gifting some of the areas of the category that might be a little bit more hard hit so we expect solid results given that skew to at home consumption ok thank you and now i am just a follow up to that are you shipping in shipping in holiday product early and would that have been an incremental benefit do we see some of that in the 3rd quarter more than we would have seen historically yeah we did just like we did with halloween started shipping in holiday a bit early so you do get some pick up in the 3rd quarter for that that will take away a little bit from the 4th quarter yeah maybe on the order you have fifty basis points and we offered that to drive the consumer behavior early as well just as we did with halloween you know as halloween was still on the floor holiday was also out there so that consumers could also you know gravitate to the holiday pretty quickly  strong symbol of yes strong halloween sale really helps us because it helps us get that fast start to holidays because it clears the space to be able to put holiday on the floor okay thanks so much for the call there absolutely thank you our next question comes from line of jason english with goldman sachs please proceed with your question hey good morning folks congratulations on a good quarter thank you all as well i want to take up on the docu series question and and tease out try to tease out a little bit more of the outlook on holidays going forward the the holiday early part selling was phenomenal and much better i think than expected i think a big part of that is due to the merchandising programs that retailers had it seems like they started bigger and earlier than they usually do has has that you think influenced how they are going to approach other seasons going forward so said said more directly you expect retailers to provide more more merchandise support behind the category into how so they are into easter than they otherwise would coming out of the success they saw in halloween  trigger of you know fun moments earlier so i do not know that i could say specifically that we can anticipate that retailers are going to merchandise it even more than they ever have i do think that they will be focused on making sure that they definitely get it out early to capture the early part of the season since that is the piece that you know is a bit more stable there were a few retailers you know as you can imagine with the uncertainty of halloween and the fact that all these decisions about what to do with halloween really had to be made in early may when things were quite uncertain and schools were closed and bars and restaurants and all of that so there were a few retailers who had pulled back on halloween and based on the results of the season this year they will likely have more confidence going forward which should help to make it for an even stronger halloween next year and probably also build confidence for the other seasons black easter that makes a lot of sense and then one more question on the i am sticking with follow on to chris is questions which i thought was solid the the the early part of the season versus the latter part of the season the the early part of the season was exceptionally robust and you said late part was a bit softer but in somewhere in your remarks i think you said all in total holiday so both early part and late part finished down mid single digits for the i think mathematically to get the category down mid single digits we are going to have to see some pretty pretty sharp declines coming through the the retail sales data in the next couple of weeks as we as we capture that late part of the season am i thinking about it right am i interpreting your comments correctly yes yes you are interpreting them correctly so category was down mid single digits overall as much as our business was actually up and we will see some of those declines one other thing to keep in mind there is a little bit of a timing impact from the neilson and iri data given that the season was on a saturday versus a thursday and based on retailer reporting days so you will probably even see it down even more and you will have to wait till kind of mid november till you see some of those last couple days being reported so some of it when you see will be just the timing shift because of the day of the week the week and some of it will certainly be the the declines and in trick or treat at the end understood thank you thank you our next question comes from line of david driscoll with dd research please proceed with your question great thank you good morning and congratulations on great execution in the quarter thanks david i had the so two questions the 1st one just the two relatively small ones on the other expense commentary i think through the through the year to date period other expense is is only a really small number but your full year projected revenue is 100 to $110000000 on that means it is a fairly massive number in the 4th quarter am i doing the math right is that is that correct on how the the pattern lays out for other expense and then related just another follow up on your volumes expected in the 4th quarter i think in your prepared comments you said north american organic growth similar to 3rd quarter but pricing only like a half point so that would mean volume is something like five percentage points positive in the 4th quarter doing those two pieces right any color you can give on those two comments yeah be happy to do so so on the tax side and other expense you are exactly right we will have a large other expense in the 4th quarter now that is consistent with what we have been saying even in the early guidance earlier in the year and then along with that a lower tax rate in the 4th quarter to do the math on the tax rate you also have to solve for a lower tax rate so that is how those two lines will play out and yes on the volume up in the 4th quarter you are thinking about it the right way we do have some indication of that what will happen in the 4th quarter we saw that in the 3rd we will see some more of that or that continue into the 4th we are also lapping some elasticity after the price increase last year and then this continued strong share gains those three things are part of driving that 4th quarter volume halloween for the entire category would you agree that now is probably not the time for seasonal price increase actions maybe this gets delayed to 2022 or some time later until we get a normal consumer environment essentially i am just asking you to assess your your ability to pass through cost increases through pricing actions it is a weird environment and i do not know how it is altered that calculus thank you yep so obviously i can not speak to any specifics so you know if we look  over time our pricing strategy has been smaller more frequent increases and that does not necessarily mean we are going to have the same amount of pricing every year or that we would always announce pricing at the same time yeah we did for example actually have a small price increase this past year on our food service business in the 3rd quarter so you know if we look  over time our pricing strategy has been smaller more frequent increases and that does not necessarily mean we are going to have the same amount of pricing every year or that we would always announce pricing at the same time yeah we did for example actually have a small price increase this past year on our food service business in the 3rd quarter time we have been able to price at various times at various economic conditions so what is important to us is we do think pricing is an important part of our algorithm but as we have talked about before we really want to grow through balanced growth across levers distribution velocity innovation price etcetera so you know we know that that that is certainly the one piece of the portfolio that we we we have not yet priced and i think it is fair to say that you know given that we have not announced a price increase at this moment in time the magnitude of pricing in 21 would be less than we have seen in prior years at least at this point yeah we have been pleased that we have seen conversion be pretty good this year even in a very difficult economic environment and i think that continues to demonstrate what we have seen over the years which is the category is very resilient our brands are strong we continue to invest into our brands and that does allow us for an even greater amount of pricing power really helpful thank you so much thank you our next question comes from the line of steve powers with deutsche bank please proceed with your question yes hey thanks good morning i guess building somewhat on earlier questions i would love a little bit more color around your general mindset heading into 21 as you work through your planning process clearly there there are parts of your business that have been under pressure this year international movie theaters vending specialty etc and hopefully all those set up for at least directional recovery in the year ahead but the same time you have been gaining a lot of share you have had great success in at home categories like baking and with initiatives like smores all of which is fantastic momentum but you know again could set up for difficult year over year comparisons so as you size it all together is there a way to frame your thinking at a summary level to what degree those various puts and takes sort of just net each other out in your mind or are you approaching 21 planning thinking we have got you know either a net easier or a net harder set up versus what you know eleven might consider typical thanks yeah so we are pleased with the momentum that we are seeing and i would say you know your call outs in what you shared about some of the ups and downs on the business i think are very helpful yeah we believe we are seeing that our category and our brands really resonate with consumers and especially at a time like this where they are looking for some of those moments of goodness moments of happiness we are really pleased with how we have been able to pivot with the consumer and also pivot with our capabilities to be able to execute within this environment and we feel good about that momentum and our ability to continue pivoting so so this year obviously it was consumer shifted to take home and so we dialed up some mowers and we dialed up twizzlers and we dialed up baking and we you know leaned in to create the season to make sure that we could capture that opportunity you know giving consumers new ways to participate in halloween that frankly we believe those things like candy slides and candy graveyards and all the creative things people did will probably become a part of their ongoing traditions and they have just evolved you know as i mentioned we were able to dial in and accelerate e commerce and i think as we look to next year we are prepared if the consumer pivots yet again to be able to pivot with them i think we have built and we have demonstrated an ability to execute well during this environment and also to pivot from an executional perspective whether it is at retail or in our manufacturing facilities so we are very focused on that you know we have captured as well some you know cultural positive effects i think capabilities we have built in terms kind of operating in this environment that you know perhaps allow us to make decisions more quickly and you know we think that is an enabler for us going forward so so we feel we feel good about the as we look to the future thanks for that michelle i do not know if you want to take this one or or steve but i just as a follow up sort of unrelated just any any comments you might have on on just current levels of promotion the promotional environment what you expect to see there of the balance of four q and into 21 thanks yeah we do not see any significant change relative to promotional activity we did not really see it this year we did not execute anything significantly differently and nor do we expect to see anything in the future okay perfect appreciate it so michelle i was hoping you could provide some context on the partnership with google that you used during the holiday period and you know do you believe this capability can be leveraged for this holiday season but also kind of in your everyday business as you kind of look forward really try and stay on top of tracking consumer sentiment and leveraging data and analytics to tailor copy to tailor messaging to tailor media so more and more we are operating at a more sophisticated level relative to using multiple data sources and also using that to reach consumers at the right places with the right message at the right time and i guess what i m trying to get at is you know is this kind of new way of of kind of targeting consumers like the return that you see from what you ve done like can you just give us any kind of understanding because one thing i am noticing across the entire cpg landscape is companies are spending more money but they are spending more money on the same message and in fact you know new consumers are being recruited you know usage occasions are changing and so it really requires a change in how you talk to those consumers and so i find this you know google partnership you know incredibly compelling for you guys so i am just trying to get better context on how it is changing the return profile of your spend you can provide any context on that so we have a continuous focus on optimizing media and the returns on our media we always have we have had strong media  rois forever and our challenge is how do we keep making them better and then we continuously optimize based on that so right now you know it is it is a big spend area for us so it is an area we are very focused on elevating and it is about yeah making sure right now i would say of the biggest opportunity is that opportunity of even more precise targeting and then once you have that target the ability to alter the message so and then we alter our media mix accordingly and i would say we we see you know significant movement in that mix on a year to year basis as we get better at that think we have raised you know some of the opportunities of how we have gone just very deep relative to specific seasons whether it is some more is by zip code or whether it is it s specific you know holidays and looking at sell through at a store level basis to be able to dial up media on a zip code level basis so you will you will continue to see more of that frankly that is just becoming a way of of how we operate now great and last question just from an innovation standpoint can you just provide any context on kind of what is remaining in terms of innovation this year and how things are going to work in 2021 if there is any clarity you can provide on on the launch timing yep so we feel very good about our innovation some of the innovations that we are excited about that are you know new to the market include the reef prezel products a reef cup with presels in it we have had a  range of kitkat flavors we know on a global basis a big part of the kitkat portfolio are flavors they tend to do quite well we are on a very small level launching snack cakes under our research trademark which you know delivers that research experience in a slightly different type of product form and we feel good on that versus bases some of the early test results and we will have more coming some items on our take home side of our business that will not get announced until early next year which is typically the time we announce those things just given reset windows no major change in our innovation strategy we think it is working very well for us we think it is right sized and we think it is delivering much more sustainable results great i will pass it on thank you our next question comes from michael lavery with piper sandler please proceed with your question thank you good morning you have talked about the the increase in ecommerce sales even if it it might have decelerated a little bit but it is it is up very strongly you have said in the past that baskets and and dollar ring or are higher online is that still holding true with the growth that you are seeing now and on the margins side you have you have mentioned that there is a small gap but that it that you were narrowing it and and that scale would help that is is that coming along the way that you would have expected how does that look now yeah i mean we have generally seen larger basket sizes in general across most channels this year as people are you know doing fewer trips and you know more quantity per trip so i think that has been somewhat of just an underlying dynamic given the the pandemic impact in the marketplace for us on our ecommerce business we have seen very significant growth across the board but particularly in click and collect where people actually and and pick up their their groceries and also in the local delivery models as well versus kind of national delivery the margins that we have are similar to what we see in bricks and mortar okay great that is that is all those two areas excuse me and those two areas where we have you know similar products obviously that we sell in bricks and mortar steve anything else you want to add yeah i would say is that you know we have said in the past that overall e commerce margins are a little bit dilutive and it is there as michelle just said in click and collect and local delivery very similar not much impact and that is probably two thirds of our e commerce business the piece that is more dilutive is the ship to home and in particular cold ship and that is an area where we continue to work with our customers and look at our overall investment with those customers and joint business planning to drive efficiencies over time so that those margins align okay thanks and i just want to follow up on some more as i thought that  your your data analysis and and insight there to to push that the way that you did was was interesting as you are seeing you know cases rise again now are you replicating that are you seeing similar results is there a   sours surge we should expect and and it would be right to assume that those hershey milk chocolate bars are probably some of the highest margin ones that you have so we have really we expanded some more from at one point it was a very focused time of year to really capturing some more as a year round opportunity especially if you especially if you think about how different weather is across the entire country there are lots of opportunities to continue to expand that so we are very focused on that you know we are also very focused on the upcoming baking season where we know that consumers will be spending time at home it is already a natural baking season and so we will be looking to really optimize what we are able to drive you know leveraging insights around that season as well some you know inflation and cost of goods sold so maybe steve could you just give us a kind of  lay of the land right now in terms of you know what commodity costs and and just cost of goods inflation looks like currently you know in the context of seems like freight costs are going up you have had some competitors talk about cocoa prices going up so just trying to get a understanding of you know directionally where where inflation is headed right now overall it has been relatively stable so on the commodity side relatively stable you know you saw big movements in commodities across q two and q three and of course we have talked in the past we mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program and i would say today they are fairly stable there are increases in freight costs there too our teams do a great job of longer term contracting which helps mitigate some of that increase so that has not been a real material impact for us we have seen some increase in warehousing costs so part of that is volume and flow through along with the share gains and and the volume increases that we have seen so we call that out in the prepared remarks but in total at least sitting at this point you know i would say overall cogs is fairly stable and we will get more guidance on 2221 when we get into the 4th quarter call but but i guess we can infer from that at least from where we sit today that you know that it is stable is is something that looks like it kind of carries into next year unless something changes i think that is fair you know next year as we get the you are going to have the 2020 and 2021 crop crops of cocoa start to bear the lid so you know there is that to consider and then there is other things obviously on the gross margin side as michelle said you know we will have a little bit more volume driven than price driven mix driving gross margin next year we will have our continuing productivity goals and again a lot more on that to come when we talk on the 4th quarter call all right thanks steve that is that is very helpful have a happy thanksgiving everyone good morning thank you for the question good morning michelle i like to follow up on the the reese is snack cake you mentioned that it is small right now but you know hershey went down this path about fifteen years ago and it did not really translate into anything material so i am curious what the data tells you in terms of changes to the landscape now does this maybe mark a new phase of the snack cake section evolution and i guess where do you think it slots in i mean does it compete against the twinkies the cookies just you know where is the target market you know any any big picture thoughts would be appreciated so that we could really learn about the proposition we spent a lot of time in terms of developing the product to make sure that we really understood some of the drivers of liking in this snack cake area and we also really thought about you know where how and how we wanted to to play and launch so this for example is very sears store focused it is you know a a single so we are keeping it as  as a focused launch it is definitely bringing the great chocolate peanut butter taste profile that we have on reeses to the snack cake market so yes it is you know playing in that snack cake snack cake area versus other snack cake brands we know that we had participated in this category for many years through licensing and we learned through that that our brands could participate and extend to the category we also know that morning snacking has been a growing trend and our confection items skew more to afternoon and evening so this is a chance for us to participate in some of that growth because that is where these snack takes get utilized so again we are going to have a very focused rollout and we will put it in locations where we think we can garner incremental space and where we think there is a strong consumer fit and starting at c we are looking at other select areas and then if it continues to perform well we will expand but we will watch it closely and take a measured approach great thanks michelle sure thank you our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein please proceed with your question good morning everyone hi alexia hi there can i just talk about the the c store channel specifically it s obviously been under pressure because of the pandemic but i imagine that there has been some sequential improvement in there could you maybe just give us some numbers about how that channel is is recovering absolutely so as you said we ve continued to see strength in food and mass and dollar as consumers eat more at home the c store class did see a bit of recovery in the 3rd quarter so we saw the business grow in the low low single digits in the 3rd quarter which is definitely an improvement versus those early pandemic trends it did then slow a little bit as summer ended and those summer road trips decreased with kids going back to school our business has tracked pretty much in line with the channel and significantly ahead of the category so we have share gains of about 120 basis points in q three in that channel so i think some some rebounds and some recovery versus versus where it was in the past as people are out about a little bit more than they were great and and then as a follow up follow up actually on brian is question about freight costs i remember back in 2018 as freight costs spiked back then that is quite a bit of a headwind for you it seems as though it is not so much of a problem this time around are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of cogs freight actually represents and how much that is already contracted out and what you have learned since 2018 to make the situation this time around a bit more manageable thank you sure so yeah freight cost right now we do not see as a  material impact if it continues to rise it will have a bigger bigger impact right now again because we are contracted and our teams do a great job of managing those contracts it is not having as material of an impact it is roughly ten of of cogs overall and so it is not immaterial but right now not seeing enough movement there given the contracting to really drive a material impact back down on overall cogs yeah personally personally and professionally the the zen of my financial ambitions has been to give out full size candy bars which i was again able to execute so thank you 22 quick ones i noticed in the data your pricing in north america is yeah +nineteen on the takeaway +33 is what you reported is that just the math or is there some you know shrinking or different mix within retailer margins there is my 1st question and secondly historically when you look at today is velocity is generally tomorrow is distribution and your velocity has been fantastic this is a weird year a lot of people is velocity is fantastic but do you anticipate gaining shelf space in that everyday place you know you you you will look at these you know baking items you look at these take home items like this is phenomenal better velocity forget about just the total sales that you are seeing there you anticipate significant share gains perhaps structural ones i m talking share of shelf here as retailers do resets for holiday and for going forward thank you sure so two parts to your question the 1st was around price and some of the discrepancy and yes there is a mixed impact honestly it might be best if melissa goes and takes you through a  deep dive on that because there s some complexity associated with it but p and l is is definitely accurate as it relates to velocity yeah good velocity i like your phrase today is velocity tomorrow is distribution i do think that is very accurate as we look at the seasons you asked about holiday you know we certainly have been able to garner incremental distribution incremental sku is throughout the year both in terms of everyday and seasons because we have been able to deliver and the items that we then put on shelf not only could we supply them but then they moved so we do feel good about that you know we will continue to take a very disciplined approach and be very careful that we do not overskew so we really have to look at the the productivity of every skew and as long as it is good we will be there but yes we have been able to to gain some distribution and and going forward i anticipate that we will and i think we can have to be able to perhaps even through the 1st part of next year you talk about what are the key learnings that you have developed you know through your years as a ceo that has really helped you kind of make this a better acquisition and you know implemented what are your key learnings and and what do you take forward to future learnings or the future acquisitions that that we as a company are best with and that is you know branded items where you know brand matters where the business has significant scale you know probably close to that $100000000 mark and it needs to be a business that has a high gross margin because that is what that is what our business model is we are a branded company we invest a lot in marketing and we have high margins that enable us to kind of invest and grow invest and grow and we that is that is our our that is what that is what we need so i think that was one of the biggest learnings was to help us select the asset i think secondly really understanding the strengths of the brand and really being able to do the right deep dives on which kpis we think predict the ability for a brand to scale and then i would say you know really trying to scale the business and i would say hey we have learned lessons the whole way along the way as you know in the past we bought some businesses that were too small we bought some businesses that you know had lower margins and we had some that we perhaps did not execute on the scaling as well and i think we have had a very focused effort on the scaling as well and we have gotten much better at that relative to supply chain relative to the talent that we need when we buy a company like this where we want to keep the entrepreneurial spirit we want to keep people who know the brand and the business but we also have to be focused on the point that we are also at a point where we want to scale the business so i mean like i go back to the scale the branded nature the high margin or probably the biggest ones and then picking the right underlying kpis that that say it is a sustainable business because if we can do that we can make it happen great i really appreciate it thanks stay well thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i will be  available after the call to answer any additional questions you may have have a great day",

continuing commitment dedication and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and healthy by maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging time i cannot be more proud of our team what they have continued to come together to support one another our customers and consumers safety is a condition at pilgrim is and our team members responded admirably to the unprecedent conditions supplying products to our customers we are continuously adapting our global operations to the changing channel demand while adjusting our operations to be able to maintain the operations at all our plants and minimize any significant disruption due to labor and health issues we remain diligent in implementing precautionary practice steps to better safeguard the wellness and health of each team member while fulfilling our official duty as a food producer to consumers in every region where we operate we incurred direct covid nineteen mitigation costs of roughly 27000000 for the quarter and close to 77000000 year to date the direct costs are related to the extra cleaning of our production and common areas the extra pp and e including masks and face shields that we are providing to all all of our team members and installation of physical barriers in our production areas we also installed dual technology uv and bipolar ionization in every point to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses we are offering free livehealth online services that allow for virtual doctor visits at no costs and above all cdc guidelines we remove vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks these figures includes indirect costs there are more there are a lot of indirect costs they are more difficult to precisely quantify such as overall disruptions to our operations less optimal mix and production efficiencies that are not included in these numbers also we are supporting our communities with our home strong initiative it is an example of how we value the important role we play in the communities where our team members live and work we understand the responsibility that comes with being a major employer in rural communities and we work hard to contribute to the well being of those communities by not only providing gainful employment opportunities but also participate in in voluntaries donation and sponsorship opportunities this quarter we accrued $50000000 in sg a for this initiative turning to the specifics of our business despite continuing volatility in challenging market environments in q three and added operating costs we have continued to generate a superior relative performance to the competition and has remained resilient to market fluctuations this is a reflection of our portfolio approach including the strategy on well diversified products broad geographical footprints and the relentless focus on key customers for the full quarter operating performance both in the us and mexico significantly improved sequentially and europe also continue to increase despite the challenges due to covid nineteen in q three we saw market conditions continue to recover across all of our global operations with the us and particularly mexico experiencing the strong rebound in performance relative to weak conditions during the 1st half of the year we are pleased with the results especially when taking into account all the disruptions less than optimal product mix and added operating costs when compared to the environment in 201 despite continued challenge in global market conditions due to covid nineteen our consolidated results have also remained well balanced and the results of our revision to become the best and most respected company creating the opportunity for a better future for our team members to support our vision we are continuing to implement our strategy of developing a unique portfolio diverse complementary business models continue to relentlessly pursue operational excellence becoming a more valued partner with key customers and creating an envi environment for safe people safe products and healthy additives while market conditions in all our global operations are continuing to improve during the quarter food service demand globally still has not reached prior levels and the environments are still quite challenging some sectors where we operate disruptions from covid nineteen have continued to present a significant challenge on each individual country is demand for protein consumption as well as for the flow of global trades and generates volatility far beyond normal seasonal factors we will maintain our strategy while continuing to improve the portfolio to better respond to individual market dynamics and generate a relative increase in performance over our peers we believe this approach will give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to long run and then minimize the full peaks and troughs of the commodity sectors during the 3rd quarter in the us we have continued to see demand recovering at our fresh operations including from some sectors within food food service with more states gradually losing travel and movement restrictions qsr volume has been specially strong and demand from our customers has been outperforming the industry similar to last quarter commodity large bird deboning was also again the most challenged during q three operationally however we continue to improve our re relative performance versus the industry across all business units we are continuing to adapt to the shipping channel demand by increasing our volume mix to key customer retailers in addition a large portion of our food service customers are also within the qsr segments which has further dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models our portfolio of differentiated products along with our key customer model are giving us better insulation against the volatility we are also much better positioned to adjust products and channel mix given our presence across all birds sizes from small to large within the small bird and case ready segments market supply and demand was again very well balanced during q three demand from retailers especially from our key customers are strong support in improving performance of our case ready business our market leadership in this category and more differentiated product portfolio have continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive advantage versus the industry while we are committed to our key customer strategy has been reflected in the consistency for our past results the value of this approach have never been more relevant to our growth than during the current times of great uncertainties and challenges to further support the growth of key customers we are doubling our case ready capacity at our plant in minnesota by increasing the number of heads process at the plant while also raising the mix of more stable margin case ready products with this addition we also expect to increase by twenty of production of our differentiated higher attributes just bare brand products it is also supported our conversion of one plant from the commoditized large bird deboning to a key customer qsr in the small bird segment the strong relationships we have to key customers are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase since this customer rely on us to satisfy their need for growth in addition many of our key customers maintain a leadership position in their respective categories as a result we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition beyond rising peer growth our key customer strategy also promotes trust enhances long term relationships and strengthen our margin structure in the us prepared foods business revenue declined 23 on 26 less volume year over year a large part of this decrease seventy of the volume was driven by schools remaining close partially offset by strengthening the retail demand on the other hand our margin from sales has improved 29 driven by more favorable price and mix we continue to simplify our portfolio to improve efficiencies and shift resources towards branded growth in the retail channel our pilgrim is brand sales grew 52 and our just bare brand gaining new distribution resulting in dollar share growth in the retail channel turning to cold storage data at the end of august broiler inventory was up two from the close of q two but down one from the previous year last quarter inventories were up ten compared to last year this is not surprising considering the mix simplification due to ongoing labor constraints seen during q three and overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result of covid nineteen and so markets reopened and the pipelines are empty we are seeing some increasing leg quarter sales during october and a reduction in inventories and upward movement in prices us poultry exports including pork were up fourseventy year over year throughout august broiler meat alone was up three in contrast through q three our exports have increased by fourteen year over year outpacing the market china continues to be a significant growth driver and we believe the impact of asf in southeast asia and now germany can provide further support to export demand as we approach the one year anniversary of china reopening to us poultry producers are presented with a vastly different market landscape than a year ago china has solidified itself as one of the largest exporter destinations for poultry 2nd only to mexico china is presence as a significant buyer keeps diversification of our export portfolio a high priority we have added 95 new direct clients in 2020 and have also continued to diversify our products and destination mix the use of non traditional export items are up thirty year over year which strengthens the cut out margin we enter q four with optimism as we continue to place commodity items efficiently leverage business overall portfolio diversity and prioritize exceptional customer service to meet the needs of our key customers around the world after a very challenging 1st half in 2020 our mexican operations deliver great results in q three and we record in one of the strongest q three in the company is history despite the unfavorable mix impacted and added operation costs re relative to the same period last year more normalized economic activities and improved supply demand balance in the market are increased share of non commodity products and our very good operational performance all contribute to the results although overall demand is improving we remain agile and are continuing to adapt our facilities by shifting production to those channels that are experienced better relative demand prepared foods in mexico experienced some challenges especially in the value categories due to less traffic on retail combined with a contraction in the qsr volume but we begin to see some signs of improvements towards the end of the quarter and we believe that positive trends can be sustained into q four we remain committed in long term growth and demand prospects in mexico we have continued to invest in our del dia and premium pilgrim is brand both in fresh and in prepared as well as seeing key more market share in the modern channel which will bring more stable margins to our operations our european chicken operations delivered an ebit in q three that was thirteen sequentially above q two with both volumes and revenue seven and eighteen higher respectively supported by our exposure to retail and the continued recovering food service and qsr demand in particular relative to q three of 2019 ebit was still higher two despite eight lower volume and five lower revenue easing of covid nineteen restrictions due to reduction of uk government incentive directs towards food service as well as a consistent improvement in food service demand within continental europe have all contribute to a better sequentially improve performance versus the prior quarter we still have not yet reached prior levels even during this challenging time we continue to be relentless in investing in innovation we are delivering labor and new improvements driving better efficiencies managing our cost base and offsetting cost increases to lean manufacturing techniques and capital investments around automation and process flow without sacrificing the health and wellbeing of our team members which remains a priority we are committed to delivering the safest work environment possible improving the quality of our products while achieving our sustainability agenda and bird welfare targets our relative performance to the industry measure as the results of the last twelve months continues to show us improving and outpacing the average on the competition in europe for the next quarter we expect further improvements coming from the food service and qsr segments as the segments adapt to the situation in each country and we remain vigilant and prepared to react and adapt in case market conditions change the performance of our newly acquired european pork operations have continued to improve we did that on an upward momentum we have now been profitable on an ebitda basis for the last six quarters in a row with margins also increasing on a consistent basis the improvement in performance was driven by robust demand at retail partially offset by reduction in food service continued strength in pork exports specially to china as well as the implementation of operational improvements and capture of synergies exports to china remain strong and were up to 100 in q three also exports to china have doubled as a percentage of our total pork sales and we expect demand from china to continue driving and strengthen the overall overall exports in the near future all of our e european fresh port facilities are approved to export from china so we are well positioned to benefit from those opportunities we also continue to evolve in our strategy and it will significantly increase our volumes with a new key customer in the next quarters integration of the assets is on track to expectations over the next few years we expect to generate an ebitda impro improvements to achieve a level that is competitive with leading companies with similar portfolio we have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired european assets through some recent wins to increase our retail exposure and strengthen our partnership with key customers we are optimistic about building upon our operation improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint extract best in class operational excellence capitalize export opport opportunities optimize the portfolio channels segments and products as well as strengthening our growth business with key customers to drive innovation in value added in higher margin areas we have a great team in europe dedicated to generating the best possible relative results by focusing on factors within our control while ensuring and protecting the safety and health of our team members our prices have been rising since august driven higher by a combination of stronger than expected export demand and smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the us usda is projecting new crop ending stocks at 2170000000 bushels versus 1990000000 last year which includes a 550000000 bushels increase in export demand the current corn crop is projected at 14700000000 bushels the highest in four years and over 1000000000 bushels larger than last year although corn prices have risen from the lows we saw in august prices are very similar to where they were this time last year so the new prices have also been rising since august driven higher by larger than expected export demand primarily to china us is projecting the current soybean crop of 4300000000 bushels and zero over 700000000 from last year despite the large increase in production usda is projecting new crop ending stocks at 290000000 bushels the lowest level in four years the uncertainty over the size of the chinese import program is causing increasing uncertainty and volatility in the united states market globally with prices in europe has also risen recently despite the larger than expected russian wheat crop and projected increase supply in other major wheat exporters like australia a slow start to the planting season in russia and larger than expected export demand out of the us are contributing to the rise prices in the wheat market on the chicken production according to the usda q three was down half of a percent relative to q three 2019 as increased lightweight did not affect headcount reductions the industry continues to maintain a larger layer flock with current levels fourforty above last year in line with the trends observed in q one industry the industry has also managed to reduce the average age of laying hens promoting a younger more efficient breeds this has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to manage supply of eggs in the short term while enabling growth in the long term as the demand environment improves overall the trend has shown a slowing of full replacement growth which is in line with expectations given that most of the public placement increases in 2019 and early 202 we are expected to be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period from q two to q three covid nineteen related restrictions have slowly been rolled back with many businesses and restaurants opening under modified environments to protect worker and consumer health throughout this process consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal and has continued to modify their shopping and spending habits in response to the new normal environment this new consumer environment favors the retail channel as many consumers are still required to work from home and choosing to limit exposure to potentially more crowded areas as a result retail demand for chicken like that all proteins have remained supported throughout the quarter while food service demands to trail below years ago level this channel has proven highly adaptable and continues to improve each month from the low points in april led by the qsr segments entering q four the usda expect prediction to be flat for the quarter on a year over year basis before entering 2021 in which the usda expects oil production to grow zeroninety versus 202 high unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute to a food macro environment and the fallout effects of covid nineteen will affect the channels differently we expect the restriction of restaurant capacities social distancing guidelines consumer concern for individual health and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations to continue favor favoring the increased frequency frequency of at home meals since chicken continues to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins retail demand is likely to remain above year ago levels when we expect overall food service demand to remain more volatile and remain below year ago levels at least in the near term qsr is ability to adapt quickly to the new environment in a positive sign for the chicken industry moving from late 2020 to 202 our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions while minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions while we are already well balanced in terms of our bird size exposure we will remain diligent in seeking opportunities to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers while optimizing our existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets our key customer approach is strategic and creates the basis for further accelerate growth in important categories by promoting more customized high quality innovative products to give us a clear long term sustainable competitive advantage while further improving the resilience to market situation with that let us turn to two additional details to our financials our sg a in the 3rd quarter was higher versus a year ago as we improve the efficiencies of our expenses but increased support for expanding the just bare brand nationally and the investment for our new prepared foods products both in the us and mexico as well as the inclusion of the new assets in europe also included in the reported sg a is our $50000000 contribution to the hometown strong initiative and the doj agreement we will continue to prioritize our capital spending plan this year to optimize our product mix that is aimed at improving our ability to supply innovative less commoditized products and strengthening partnerships with key customers even during these uncertainty times while we continue continue to evaluate all capex projects and defer those within non essential we will reiterate our commitment to investing on strong return on capital employed projects that will improve our operational efficiencies and tailor customer needs to further solidify competitive advantage for peers our balance sheets continued to be robust given our relentless emphasis on cash flows from operating activities focus on management of working capital and disciplined investment in high return projects our liquidity position remains very strong in more than $1300000000 in total cash and availability we have no short term immediate cash requirements with our bonds maturing in 2025 and 2027 and our term loan maturing in 202 during the quarter our net debt was 1900000000 the lowest since 2016 and a leverage ratio for twofive times less twelve months ebitda our leverage remains at a manageable level and we expect to continue to produce positive cash flows this year increasing our financial capability to pursue strategic actions we expect 2020 interest expense of around 130 to $140000000 we have a strong balance sheet in a leverage that is within our targets which are supportive for us to act on great opportunities during these uncertain times we remain focused on exercise in great care ensuring that we create shareholder value by optimizing our capital structure while preserving the flexibility to pursue a growth strategy and we will continue to consider and evaluate all relevant capital allocation strategies that will match the pursuit of our growth strategy and continue to review each prospect accordingly to our value creating standards operator this concludes our prepared remarks please open the call for questions thank you we will now begin the question and answer session in the interest of allowing equal access we request that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue for any follow up to ask a question you may press star and one on your touch tone phone if you are using the speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to minimize background noise to withdraw your question please press star center at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster the 1st question is from benjamin theurer with barclays please go ahead hi and good morning fabio this is antonio hernandez in behalf of of ben theurer my question is regarding covid nineteen how is your current level of absenteeism at at glance how has that evolved in recent weeks considering the continuously high number of cases in in the us and also if you can provide a some of of a kind of our own rate of of protective measures related to covid nineteen during the quarter and and what do you see going forward thanks yeah thank you and good morning 1st as we face this global coronavirus pandemic we have been guided by three principles 1st an uncompromised commitment to the safety of our team members 2nd recognizing and embracing our responsibility to provide quality food for the country and of course in endeavoring to provide continuing employment opportunities and benefits to our team members during a time of unprecedented economic uphill so the direct costs that we are are related to the extra cleaning and in our production in common areas we also provided the pp and e including the masks and face shields to all of our team members and we install physical barriers in our production area and of course we are maintaining social distancing whenever wherever areas we can we did more than 10000 barriers within the 1st thirty days of the the pandemic and then we continue to upgrade those barriers we also installed that dual technology uv and bipolar ionization in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses as i mentioned we are offering free livehealth online services for all of our team members that allow for virtual doctor visits at zero costs and above all cdc guidelines we removed the vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks and that is creating some challenges to operations because by removing those people we have less people at our plants yeah it the situation is very fluid it varies from plant to plant but over the last months we have increased our staffing to close to the levels that we were before covid so we are already running a much better mix that we were during the q two and we are seeing a very good increase in our absenteeism levels as people are more familiar with what we are doing as we are gaining the trust of the entire communities people are less reluctant to return to work and with that we have been improving our ability to execute the optimal mix of course we are also working with our key customers to simplify our mix to create a more optimal footprint and with the frequent communication with the with them we are ensuring that our team members we expect to return to the optimal operation in this quarter on your results the next question is from ken zaslow with bank of montreal please go ahead hey good morning everyone good morning ken just two questions what is as you mix as you change your mix what is go what was the mix between big small and medium say last year and then what do you think it is going to be now and then what do you think it is going to be in about a year from now as you adjust your your product mixes yeah can we unroll balance between small birds tray pack and large bird deboning what we are doing is as the as the demand has been shifting to more retail we have been shifting shifting our operations also with the growth of qsr we have also adapted those conditions what we are doing for 2021 is to 1st move that plant from big bird deboning to small bird deboning which will increase our our presence in that segment we are also doubling the capacity in our minnesota plant to comply and comply or support the growth of our key customers and adjust their brand which has doubled the sales in the online channel over this quarter looking into overall portfolio we move from 46 of our total sales in retail to around 51 just in 2020 with small changes in our operation for next year expect two increase in that portfolio to the retail and one to two increase in the small bird with those two conversions great my my next question is can you talk about the sustainability of the mexican margins i i you know particularly i i did see that there was a a little bit of a fx benefit how do you think about the mexican operation i think you did say that it is going to it is still continuing the momentum into the 4th quarter then how do you think about it for 2000 21 how how do we frame it in our minds yeah sure ken and we have been talking about mexico over the last few years that they are very volatile quarter over quarter but they are more stable if you think a longer period of time or within a year what happened in the 1st quarter or in the 1st semester in mexico was a complete imbalance during supply and demand so the industry increased supply during the 1st semester and at the same time demand because of the covid nineteen really create a a challenging environment as you remember in mexico there was no support from the government with the covid nineteen like we have in us in europe there is no governmental stimulus or unemployment benefits which created a sharp slowdown and recession in the region which really affected the the the demand both in the food service and retail while within us we saw an increase in retail compensating at least partially the shutdown in food service that did not happen in in mexico and that is why the supply and demand was completely out of balance as the industry adapted their supply for the q three and we at pilgrim is adapted to that situation as well we reduce our costs and we also cut production the supply and demand improves a lot and we saw the rebound in the food service and demand in q three and now we have very stable prices during this time in mexico we expect this to continue during q four q four has always been a stronger quarter for mexico with the festivities we do not know at which point that will be reduced because of the the covid restrictions we have seen some increase in cases in mexico so there could be some more restrictions in in the q four but given the supply and demand situation that we are right now the results are are sustainable now for q one we expect the industry to increase production to equate supply and demand and the return to more normal levels mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again but we expect to be very stable year over year of course our strategy is supportive of the growth to increase the higher margin differentiated products as well we saw a little bit of impact in the prepared foods especially on the more affordable products during q one but we continue to invest and highly differentiated the pilgrim is products continue to sell really well longer term despite the volatility mexico is a growing economy and as the population increase their disposable income it leads to a significant growth in protein consumption great i really appreciate the answer thank you ken the next question is from ben bienvenu with stephens inc please go ahead hey good morning hi ben i want to ask you you touched on in your opening comments with asf in china and and germany i want to ask on germany more specifically i would think that is a nice boon for the tool of business just curious on what you are seeing in that business both as it relates to the impact on the domestic market and then an uptick in potential demand from that market as well and how you think you are positioned to capture that benefit yeah thank you ben and the operations in europe are more focused on the retail so we produce most of our products in uk for the retail uk market and because of the high welfare we command a premium in that region the big competition as you as you refer is on the food service sector have imported products from poland and germany mainly and spain on the port side as the germans have this issues with their production and because of the ban in china it actually increases the sales in the uk market it also creates the opportunity for our uk products to be sold into china so what we saw is that on the what we call 5th quarter products a a significant increase in pricing but on the normal products like loins and and others we see the prices more stable because it is a a a zero sum game at the end of the day so it increases the opportunity to china so that was welcome i think our sales like we mentioned have doubled during q three and we are seeing some some very stable pricing but it also includes the competition in the food service segments in uk okay great my 2nd question is related to grain and apologies if i missed this in your opening comment i did hear your overview of the market could you talk about how you are positioned relative to the markets you know are you more hand to mouth at the moment do you have any basis secured any color you could offer there on how your positioned you know through the balance of 4th quarter and into next year would be helpful hey ben this is joe thank you for the question zero obviously we have seen prices of corn and soybean now increase in the last few months it has been it has been the result of a few factors for corn we have seen a reduction from the supply side with usda reporting 6000000 fewer planted acres than they originally estimated back in march we also saw our final stocks for 2019 end up being 200000000 bushels less than was expected when the final accounting was done on the current crop we actually for the acres that are planted see pretty good yields of uptrend on yields so it is not an issue on the supply side in terms of us production but on the demand side we have also seen much bigger export demand primarily driven by china still the usda is projecting a carrier out carryout of around 2100000000 bushels and that includes a thirty increase in export demand from last year so even if export demand ends up higher than what the usda is projecting corn stock should still be in line with previous years on soybeans usda is projecting a 290000000 bushel carryout which would be the lowest carryout in five years this projection though includes a 31 increase in export demand driven by china in addition to increase exports in argentina which is one of the world is largest sold seed exporting countries is in the midst of a historic economic crisis which is causing farmers near to hold back available supplies from the market adding more pressure to the us to meet this demand we believe the market is likely to feel anxious about us soybean supplies until there is a resolution to this currency situation in argentina or in south south american supplies can be available to meet this demand in terms of our position we have always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive to the market conditions and the risk we see and we feel very comfortable with where we are in corn and soy we do recognize the risks of soybean supplies in the us and our positions reflect that okay awesome thanks and that is all thank you again as a reminder if you have a question please press star then one the next question is from michael pekin with cleveland research please go ahead yeah hi good morning i just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of you know the move i guess you know into retail and you know some of that big bird product is that being chopped up and put into trays and you know how is that impacting you know some of the margins on the commodity business yes mike there is a lot of products on the big birds especially during promotional season seasonality during the summer that from the big birds end up being put in the tray to be sold in the retailers we continue to do that i think the the challenge to the industry is that we need to have a label available and the facilities available to do more of that and that is why the industry has not increased more production to the tray pack as we as as we want or as the demand continues to grow it is also because of that we are increasing the capacity in our minnesota plant so as of today yes we are buying big bird meat and we continue to put it on on a tray especially during saturdays and i i think the whole industry is doing that okay great and then my 2nd question is you know just looking at the you you mentioned that your absentee rates are starting to go down and you are starting to get back to your normal mix in terms of some of deboned dark meat do you are you starting to return that you know historical levels and what could that mean for the leg quarter prices which is seeing you know the most pressure cannot help or is it you know the fact that china is taking more pork can that help with leg quarters that are do i have a leg quarter prices moved if there is more deboned dark meat potentially being produced and you know it seems like you know the at the very least trying to take in more us pork yes you are right mike because of the absenteeism and also the food service industry in us the industry produce three more leg quarters in july and august than the same period last year despite a lower total production that put a lot of pressure in the leg quarter pricing and as we are seeing more the reopening of the food service and as we are seeing the absenteeism and the staffing of our clients increasing for us and for the whole industry we are seeing more deboning we are already at levels comparable to last year in terms of deboning which will reduce the pressure in the leg quarters of course china has been also more active in the leg quarter market over the the last month and we are seeing that in the leg quarter inventory that was up on a on a sequential basis up to august but we are seeing a reduction and also the inventories today is down nine compared to the peak q one average that we have so those two factors can contribute to the reduction in the leg quarter production which is a commodity item as as i mentioned and the china interest i think we saw over the last weeks although not today the increase in the oil prices and the reduction in in the in the dollar which increase the availability of dollars from the developing countries which also increases the demand for leg quarters so what could help on the leg quarters going forward it is both on supply and demand and supply is exactly what you said the last leg quarters because of the improvement in labor efficiencies and the more sales in the domestic market on the food service and on demand because of low prices and because of more stable income in the in the developing economies the next question is from peter galbo with bank of america please go ahead hey guys good morning thanks for taking the question you know fabio just as as i am thinking about it you know the the the small bird and retail channels obviously have been tremendously profitable for for you guys during you know this time period with and and you know with the plant conversion coming but you you know with with commodity big bird remaining you know in a cut off you have your remaining under such pressure just at at what point does it make sense to start talking about converting another plant whether that is to retail or or to small bird because it just it just seems like that big bird portion is is not going to improve without more capacity either being converted or or taken out of the market you know in in in some capacity sure thank you peter i think the decision to convert the plant is a more long term decision and we always make those decisions combined with our key customer strategy as we see the demand of this key customers growing we take action in our portfolio so and and that makes a lot of sense for us to do that conversion right now from that from that operation from big bird to small bird to support this growth i think a again you need to look into a more broader long term perspective we continue to expect the food service sector to rebound if you look at the food service sector today the full service restaurants are now thirteen year over year and that is impacting the big bird deboning for sure while the qsr is around nine as we go through a more normal operations as we see maybe the development of vaccines we do not know when that is going to happen or we see more openings of the restaurants we expect the food service restaurants especially on the food service to regain some market share that they are not operating today so i i think it is a long term decision and it is also a very difficult decision to move from big bird to a smaller because we have the growers and we have the feed mills it is all built to that specific bird our our plants in the united states are really customized to that specific segment so any conversion it really requires significant capital and requires some significant significant changes in the overall supply chain both starting from the growers your feed mills and your field operations so it is a it is a high capital investment that it needs to be supported in for the long run so that is why we do not see a lot of conversions in our industry of course if this situation continued for for a longer period of time you can see some conversions i think also it is important to know that some other players do not have the key customer relationships that we have and moving from the big bird to the small bird or to the case ready require a customer and a key customer to support and since they do not have those relationships it is harder for them to do some conversions all right now that that is that is helpful and and then maybe just to follow up you know given where the balance sheet is now some something you talked about your prepared remarks you know how should we think about m a potential maybe from a geographic perspective or does it make sense to get bigger in in pork and in europe and you know going into 2021 just just any help there and then and then maybe you can also comment on any updates on your cfo search thanks very much sure in terms of strategy i think our strategy continues to same and our growth strategy continues in fact as as i mentioned have a very strong balance sheet we look into increasing our prepared foods operation and our branded operation to to create a more balanced portfolio and we are also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more value from operational efficiencies we are seeing targets both in the us and outside us geographical diversification and to growth in europe and we will evaluate all alternatives to our value creation standards in terms of the cfo we are in in the process of of finding another c cfo we already engage recruiting firms and we should have some some news in the near future great thanks very much guys the next question is from adam samuelson with goldman sachs co please go ahead yeah thank you good morning everyone good morning adam all right so so maybe 1st just a clarification and a little more detail the expansion of the minnesota plants for for case ready and and the conversion of the texas plants small bird from big bird what is the net impact on your production volume and what is the capital costs of those projects yeah in terms of total volume i think we should be just a little bit up we expect to be to grow in line with the usda expectations and the industry for 2021 which is a little bit lower than one yes as we h have more birds in minnesota but we have also reduced the weights in our operation on the big bird that we are transforming to a small bird so we expect to be for 2021 in line with with those two in terms of investments it is not a very significant to our total capex as the conversion of the small bird plant it is it is not a it is it is a simple conversion of course that qsr requires some dsi which is portioning equipment and some marination equipment and we are going to invest in automation in that plant as well today there is a manual deboning operation and we are going to invest in the automate auto automated deboning so the investment is close to twenty to $25000000 in that operation and in the in the case of the case ready operation is close to $70000000 so overall it is a total of $100000000 that we got to invest in those two conversions okay that is that is helpful and the the the follow up was i just want to make sure i heard something right in the prepared remarks you talked about the prepared food business in the us declining 26 i think is what i heard and maybe hoping to just could you expand on that that is a business that i think had more challenges over the years and just is do we is it really just a question of return to school and and food service traffic or how do we think about that business or margin profile moving forward yeah that is exactly it we in our prepared food business we have a strong brand which is the pierce brand that is mainly a food service brand we also are very strong in the school with our gold gold kist brand both those segments are the ones that are most most affected by the the covid nineteen the non commercial food service that includes schools are now 66 at q two and now they are down 43 we are seeing some school reopens which could help but it is the segment that is still down forty on what we call the commercial food service which is a street business where our pierce brand is a is a leading brand in wings and in chunks we saw that in q two they end up 36 lower than the prior year but they are rebounding and then today they are close to four lower than the same period last last year so the food service business has been recovering and with that our pierce brand has recovered in our volumes but school system is still close to twenty lower than the prior year and that is why we are investing in more retail branded business as we mentioned our pilgrim is brand has increased more than thirty and we have been very successful in spending the just bare brand from the fresh category which has been very successful on on the online segment and also on the on the higher attributes segment in our key customers to the prepared food segment all right great that is that is helpful i will pass it on thank you thank you adam the next question comes from carla casella with jp morgan please go ahead hi my question is regarding your leverage the three times target how comfortable or or how high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional m a and are you seeing any more m a opportunities just given the volatility in worldwide protein market yeah thank you carla we we set these targets of two to three times because it is the it is the best capital structure that can protect and reduce our interest payments while not creating any any any problem for our for our bonds and for our our leverage the two to three times is in normal operations of course during some acquisitions if we have a a great plan on how to reduce that back we can go further i do not think there is a number that it is specific on on where we go i think it is more about what is the plan to deleverage and of course the plan to deleverage could include the issue of stock and that is why pilgrim is as a public traded company has that opportunity to use the stock as a currency not to increase the leverage to points where we do not think it is prudent in the case of a significant acquisition that will be transformational for the company in terms of okay and just one last one now in terms s sorry in terms of m a yes we are seeing more targets of course the the whole situation about traveling has created some challenges in terms of seeing and visiting assets but we are seeing some targets that are still very interesting to us and could create a lot of value for our shareholders okay great and then just in the event that jbs is able to list the us business would that cause any need for a change in your structure yeah we do not believe so i think jbs has said many times that they they continue to support pilgrim is to be a public traded company and and just as i mentioned it is a great way for us to keep our growth we can use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important and transformational event for pilgrim is okay thank you once again if you have a question please press star and one on your phone gentlemen there are no more questions registered at this time i would like to turn the conference

commitment dedication and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and healthy by maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging time i could not be more proud of our team as they have continued to come together to support one another our customers and consumers face is a condition of service and our team members responded admirably to the precedent conditions so point products to our customers so are continuously adapting our global operations to the change in channel demand while we are adjusting our operations to be able to maintain the operations at all our plants and minimize any significant disruption due to labor and health issues we remain diligent in implementing precautionary proactive steps to better safeguard the wellness and help of each team member while fulfilling our essential duty as a food producer to consumers in every region where we operate we include direct covid nineteen mitigation costs of roughly 27000000 for the quarter and close to 77000000 year to date the direct costs are related to the extra cleaning of our production and common areas the extra ppe including masks and face shields that we are providing to all all of our key members and installation of physical barriers in our production areas we also install dual technology uv in bipolar ionization in every point to future we are offering free lighthealth online services that allow for virtual doctor visits and no cost and above all cdc guidelines we remove vulnerable key members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks these figures include indirect costs there are more there are a lot of indirect costs there are more difficult to precisely quantify such as overall disruptions to operations less optimal make ups introduction and efficiencies that are not included in these numbers also we are supporting our communities with our home strong initiative it is an example of how we value the important role we are playing in the communities where our team members live and work we understand the responsibility that comes with being a major employer in rural communities and we work hard to contribute to the well being of those communities by not only providing gainful employment opportunities but also participating in volunteer activities donation and sponsorship opportunities this quarter we include $50000000 in scna for this initiative according to the specifics of our business despite continuing volatility and challenging market environments in q three and added operating costs we have continued to generate a superior relative performance to the competition and have remained resilient to market fluctuations this is our reflection of our portfolio approach including our strategy on well diversified products broad geographical footprints and the relentless focus on key customers for the full quarter operating performance both in the us and mexico significantly improved sequentially and europe also continued to improve despite the challenge due to covid nineteen in q three we saw market conditions continue to recover across all of our global operations with the us and particularly mexico experiencing the strongest rebound in performance relative to weak conditions during the 1st half of the year we are pleased with the results especially when taking into account all the disruptions less than optimal product mix and added operating costs when compared to the environment in 2019 despite continued challenges in global market conditions due to covid nineteen our consolidated results have also remained well balanced and the result of our vision to become the best and most respected company creating the opportunity of a better future for our key members to support our vision we are continuing to implement our strategy of developing a unique portfolio diverse complemented by our commitment to sustainability we will continue to relentlessly pursue operational excellence becoming a more valuable partner with key customers and creating an environment for safe people safe products and healthy attitudes while market conditions in all are global operations are still improving during the quarter food service demand globally still has not reached prior levels and the environments are still quite challenging in some sectors where we operate disruptions from covid nineteen have continued to persist we will maintain our strategy but continue to improve the portfolio to better respond to individual market dynamics and generate a relatively increasing performance over our peers we believe this approach will give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to long run and minimize the full pits and troughs during the 3rd quarter in the us we will continue to see demand recovering at our fresh operations including from some sectors within foodservice with more states gradually losing travel and movement restrictions qsr volume has been especially strong and demand from our customers has been outperforming the industry similar to last quarter commodity large dogs were also again the most challenged during q three operations however we continue to improve our relative performance versus the industry across all business units we are continuing to adapt to the shipping channel demand by increasing our volume mix to key customer retailers in addition a large portion of our food service customers are also within the qsr segment which has further dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models our portfolio of differentiated products along with our key customer model are giving us better insulation against the volatility we are also much better positioned to adjust products and channel mix given our presence across all board sizes from small to large within the small board and case ready segments market supply and demand was again very well balanced during q three demand from retailers especially from our key customers was strong supporting the improvement in performance of our case ready business our market leadership in these categories and more differentiated product portfolio have continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive position we are doubling our case ready capacity at our plant in minnesota by increasing the number of heads processed at the plant while also raising the mix of more stable margin case ready products with this addition we also expect to increase by twenty our production of our differentiated higher attribute just bear brand products it is also supported by our conversion of one plant from the commoditized large bird deboning to a key customer key visor in the small bird segment the strong relationships we have with the key customers are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase since these customers rely on us to satisfy their need for growth in addition many of our as a result we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition beyond driving pure growth our key customer strategy also promotes trust enhances long term relationships and strengthens or margin structure in the us prepared foods business revenue declined 23 on 26 less volume year over year a large part of this decrease seventy of the volume was due to the pandemic by schools remaining closed partially offset by strength in the retail demand on the other hand our margin from sales have improved 29 driven by more favorable price and mix we continue to simplify our portfolio to improve efficiencies and shift resources towards branded growth in the retail channel our pilgrim is brand sales grew 52 and our just bare brand gained a new distribution resulting in dollar share growth in the retail channel at the end of august bryant inventory was up two from the close of q two but down one from the previous year lakeport inventories were up ten compared to last year this is not surprising considering the mid simplification due to ongoing labor constraints seen during q three and overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result of covid nineteen as some markets reopen and pipelines are empty we are seeing some increasing demand sales during october and a reduction in inventories and upward movement in prices us export to exports including pork were up fourseven year over year throughout august broiler meat alone was up three in contrast through q three our exports have increased by fourteen year over year outpacing the market china continues to be a significant growth driver and we believe the impact of asf and southeast asia as we approach the one year anniversary of china re opening to us poultry producers are presented with a vastly different market landscape than a year ago china has solidified itself as one of the largest export destinations for poultry 2nd only to mexico china presents as a significant buyer keeping diversification of our export portfolio a high priority we have added 95 new direct points and have also continued to diversify our product and destination mix sales of non traditional export items are up thirty here over here which strengthens the cut out margin we enter 24 with optimum as we continue to place commodity items efficiently leverage buildings overall portfolio diversity and prioritize exceptional customer service to meet the needs of our key customers around the world after a very challenging 1st half in 2020 our mexican operation is performing well deliver great results in q three and we recorded one of the strongest q three in the company is history despite the unfavorable mix impacted and added operation costs relative to the same period last year more normalized economic activities and improved supply demand balance in the market our increased share of non commodity products and our very good operation performance all contribute to the results although overall demand is improving we remain agile and are continuing to adapt facilities by shifting production to those channels that are experiencing better relative demand they are present in mexico they explain some challenges especially in the value categories due to less traffic on retail combined with a contraction in the qsr volume but we begin to see some signs of improvement towards the end of the quarter and we believe the positive trend can be sustained into q four we remain committed in long term growth and demand prospects in mexico we will continue to invest in all our ideas and premium portfolio brand both in mexico i would like to start by saying that our fresh and prepared as well as our key moore market share in the modern channel will bring more stable margins to our operations our european chicken operations deliver in q three that was thirteen sequentially above q two with both volumes and revenue seven and eighteen higher respectively supported by our exposure to retail and the continuous recovery in food service and qsr demand in particular relative to q three of 2019 we will still hire two despite eight lower volume and five lower revenue an evening of covid nineteen restrictions the introduction of uk government incentive directs towards food service as well as a consistent improvement in food service demand within continental europe have all contributed to a better sequentially improved performance versus the prior period we still have not yet reached prior lows even during this challenging time we continue to be relentless in investing they are delivering labor and new improvements driving better efficiencies managing our cost base and offsetting cost increases to lean manufacturing techniques and capital investments around automation and process flow without sacrificing the health and well being of our team members which remains a priority we are committed to delivering the safest work environment possible improving the quality of our products while achieving our sustainability agenda and bird welfare targets a relative performance analysis is provided below as the result of the last twelve months our industry continues to show improvement and overtaking the average of the competition in europe for the next quarter we expect further improvements coming from the food service and qsr segments as these segments adapt to the situation in each country and we remain vigilant and prepared to react and adapt in case market conditions change the performance of our newly acquired european pork operations have continued to improve we need that on an upward momentum we have now been profitable on an average basis for the last six quarters in a row with margins also increasing on a consistent basis the improvement in performance was driven by robust demand at retail partially offset by a reduction in food service continuous strength in pork exports especially to china as well as the implementation of operational improvements and capture of synergies exports to china remain strong up 100 in q three also exports to china have doubled as a percentage of our total pork sales and we expect demand from china to continue driving and strengthen the overall for overall exports in the new future all of our europeans freshport facilities are approved to export from china so we are well positioned to benefit from those opportunities we also continue to evolve in our strategy and we will significantly increase our volumes with a new key customer in the next quarters integration of the assets is on track to expectations over the next few years we expect to generate we have made improvements to achieve a level that is competitive with leading companies with similar portfolio we have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired european assets through some recent wins to increase our retail exposure and strengthen our partnership with key customers we are optimistic about building upon our operational improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint extract best in class operational excellence capitalize export opportunities and thus enhance our financial position identify the portfolio of channels segments and products as well as strengthening our growth business with key customers to drive innovation value added and higher margin areas we have a great team in europe dedicated to generating the best possible relative results by focusing on factors within our control while ensuring and protecting the safety and health of our team members home prices have been rising since august driven higher by a combination of stronger than expected export demand and smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the u s yeah fda is projecting new crop ending stocks at 2170000000 bushels versus 1990000000 last year which includes a 550000000 bushels increase in export demand the current corn crop is projected at 14700000000 bushels the highest in four years and over 1000000000 bushels larger than last year although corn prices have risen from the lows we saw in august prices are very similar to where they were this time last year soybean meal prices have also risen since august driven higher by larger than expected export demand primarily to china usda is projecting the current soybean crop at 4300000000 bushels up over 700000000 from last year despite the large increase in production usda is projecting new crop ending stocks at 290000000 bushels the lowest level in four years the chinese import program is causing increasing uncertainty and volatility in the oilseed market globally wheat prices in europe have also risen recently despite the larger than expected russian wheat crop and projected increased supply in other major wheat exporters like australia a slow start to the planting season in russia and larger than expected export demand out of the us are contributing to the rise in rice prices in the wheat market on the chicken production according to the fda it is a safe product as a result of the reduction in production of layer hens the industry was down half a percent relative to g three 2019 however the increase in life expectancy did not offset headcount reductions the industry continues to maintain a larger layer flock with counts leveling fourfour above last year in line with the trends observed in q one 2020 the industry has also managed to reduce the average age of laying hens promoting a younger more efficient breed this has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to manage supply of eggs in the short term enabling growth overall the trend has shown a slowing of fully placement growth which is in line with expectations given that most of the fully placement increases in 2019 and early 2020 were expected to be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period from q two to q three covid nineteen related restrictions have slowly been rolled back with many businesses and restaurants opening under modified environment to protect worker and consumer health throughout this process consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal and have continued to modify their shopping and spending habits in response to the new normal environment this new consumer environment favors the retail channel as many consumers are still required to work from home and choosing to limit exposure to potentially more crowded areas as a result retail demands for chicken like that of all proteins have remained supported throughout the quarter while food service demand still trails below years ago level this sector has proven highly adaptable and continues to improve each month from the low point in april led by the qsr segment entering into 204 the sda expect production to be flat for the quarter on a year over year basis before entering 2022 one in which the sda expect on and production to grow nine versus 2022 high unemployment and consumer uncertainty i would like to contribute to a food macro environment and the fallout effects of covid nineteen will impact the channels differently we expect the restriction of restaurant capacities social distancing guidelines consumer concerns for individual health and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations to continue favoring the increased frequency of at home meals and seeking continues to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins retail demand is likely to remain when we expect overall food service demand to remain more volatile and remain below year ago levels at least in the near term qatar is ability to adapt quickly to the new environment in a positive sign for the chicken industry moving from late 2020 to 2021 our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macro economic conditions while minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions we are already well balanced in terms of our bird side exposure we will remain diligent in seeking opportunities to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers while optimizing our existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets our key customer approaches are strategic and create the basis for further accelerate growth in important categories by promoting more customized high quality innovative products to provide us with a clear long term sustainable competitive advantage while further improving the resilience to market fluctuations with that let me refer to additional details  to our financiers our fcfna in the 3rd quarter was higher versus our prior guidance as we improved the efficiencies of our expenses but increased support for expanding the just bare brand nationally and the investment for our new prepared foods products both in us and mexico as well as the inclusion of the new assets in europe also including in the re balance we are pleased to announce that our $50000000 contribution to the hometown strong initiative and the doj agreement will continue to prioritize our capital spending plan this year to optimize our product mix that is aimed at improving our ability to supply innovative less commoditized products and strengthening partnerships with key customers even during these uncertain times while we continue to continue to evaluate all capex projects and defer those we deem non essential we reiterate our commitment to our hometown strong initiative and the doj agreement on strong return on capital employed projects that we improve our operational efficiencies and tailor customer needs to further solidify competitive advantage for patients our balance sheets continue to do the best given our relentless emphasis on cash flow from operating activities focus on management of working capital and disciplined investment in high return projects our retained earnings position remains very strong with more than $1300000000 in total cash and availability we have no short term immediate cash requirements without bonds maturing in 2025 and 2027 and our term loan maturing in 2023 during the quarter our net debt was 1900000000 the lowest since 2016 and the leverage ratio for twofive times less than twelve months of ebitda our leverage remains at a manageable level and we expect to continue to produce positive cash flows this year increasing our financial capability to pursue strategic actions we expect 2020 interest expense of around 132000000 we have a strong balance sheet and a leverage that is within our target which are supportive for us to act on great opportunities during this uncertain time we will remain focused on exercising great care in ensuring that we create shareholder value by optimizing our capital structure while preserving the flexibility to pursue a growth strategy and we will continue to consider and evaluate all relevant capital allocation strategies that will match the pursuit of our growth strategy and continue to review each prospect accordingly operator this concludes our final remarks please open the call for questions we will now begin the question and answer session in the interest of allowing equal access we request that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue for any follow up you may press start and one on your speakerphone please pick up your headset before pressing the keys too many times by mistake thank you please press star ten to withdraw your question at this time we will post momentarily to assemble our roaster how is your current level of absenteeism at plants how has that evolved in recent weeks considering the continuously high number of cases in in the us and also if you can provide  some of so a kind of  grown rate of of protective measures related to covid nineteen during the quarter and and what do you see going forward thanks yeah thank you and good morning 1st as we face this global coronavirus pandemic we have been guided by three principles so an uncompromised commitment to the safety of our team members 2nd recognizing and embracing our responsibility to provide quality food for the country and of course in endeavoring to provide continue employment opportunities and benefits to our team members during a time of unprecedented economic upheaval so the direct costs that we are  related to the extra cleaning and in our production in common areas we also provide in the ppd including masks and face shields to all of our team members we install physical barriers in our production area and of course we are maintaining social distancing whenever wherever areas we can we do more than 10000 barriers within the 1st thirty days of the pandemic and we continue to upgrade those barriers we also install that dual technology uv and bi polar ionization in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses as i mentioned we are offering free life health online the services for all of our team members that allow for virtual doctor visits at zero cost and above all cdc guidelines we remove the vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks and that is creating some challenges to operations because by removing those people we have less people at our plants yeah the situation is very fluid it varies from plant to plant but over the last few weeks months we have increased our staffing too close to the levels that we were before covid so we are already running a much better mix that we were during the the q two and we are seeing a very good increase in our absenteeism levels as people are more familiar with what we are doing as we are gaining the trust of the entire communities people are less reluctant to return to work and with that we have been improving our ability to execute the optimal mix of course we are also working with our key customers to simplify our mix to create a more optimal footprint and with the free print communication with with them we are ensuring their team members we expect to return to the optimal operation in this quarter perfect thanks for all your work on your results the next question is from ken dazarlo with bank of montreal please go ahead we are about a year from now as you adjust your your product mixes yeah and we are well balanced between small birds trapac and large birds what we are doing is as the demand has been shifting to more retail we have been shifting our operations also with the growth of ksr we have also adapted to those conditions what we are doing for 2021 is to 1st move that plan from big body bonding to small body bonding which will increase our our presence in that segment we are also doubling the capacity in our minnesota plant to comply or comply or support the growth of our key customers and our just fair brand which has double the sales in the online channel over this quarter looking into overall portfolio we move from 46 of our sales in retail to around 51 just in 2020 with small changes in our operations for next year expect a two increase in that portfolio to the retail and a one to two increase in the small business with those two conversions great my next question is can you talk about the sustainability of the mexican margins you know particularly i did see that there was a a little bit of a fx benefit how do you think about the mexican operation i think you did say that it is going to still continue the momentum into the 4th quarter then how do you think about it for 2021 how do we frame it in our minds yeah sure ken and we have been talking about mexico over the last years that they are very volatile quarter over quarter but they are more stable if you think a longer period of time or within a year what happened in the 1st quarter or the 1st semester in mexico was a completing of the infrastructure so the industry increased supply during the 1st semester and at the same time demand because of the covid nineteen really creates a challenging environment as you remember in mexico there was no support from the government with the covid nineteen like we had in us in europe there was no governmental stimulus or unemployment benefits which created a sharp slowdown and recession so in the region which really affected the the demand both in the food service and retail while within the us we saw an increasing retail compensating at least partially the shutdown in food service that did not happen in in mexico and that is why the supply and demand was completely off balance as the industry adapted their supply for the q three and we at pepsi adapted to that situation we reduce our costs and we also cut production the supply demand improved a lot and we saw the rebound in the food service and demand in q three and now we have very stable prices during this time in mexico we expect this to continue during q four q four has always been a stronger quarter for mexico with the festivities we do not know at which point that will be reduced because of the we think some increase in cases in mexico so there could be some more restrictions in in the q four but given the supply and demand situation that we are right now the results are are sustainable now for q one we expect the industry to increase production to adequate supply and demand and the return to more normal levels mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again but we expect to be very stable year over year of course our strategy is supportive of the growth to increase the higher margin differentiated products as well we saw a little bit of impact in the prepared foods especially on the more affordable products during q one but we continue to invest and the highly differentiated building products continue to sell really well longer term despite the volatility mexico is a growing economy and as the population increases their disposable income it leads to i really appreciate the answer thank you okay the next question is from ben bienvenue with steven inc please go ahead hey good morning everybody i want to ask you touched on your opening comments with asf and china and in germany i want to ask on germany more specifically i think that is a nice boon for the two of us business thank you thank you ben the operations in europe are more focused on the retail so we produce most of our products in uk for the retail uk market and because of the high welfare we command a premium in that region the big competition as you were referring to is from the far east it is on the food service sector of imported products from poland and germany mainly and spain on the european side as the germans had these issues with their production and because of the ban in china it actually increases the sales in the uk market it also creates the opportunity for our uk products to be sold into china so what we saw is that on the european side the ban actually increased the sales in the uk market what we call 5th quarter products of of significant increase in pricing but on the normal products like loins and and others we see the prices more stable because it seems to be a zero sum game at the end of the day so it increases the opportunity to china so that was a welcome i think our sales have like we mentioned have doubled during q three and we are seeing some some very stable pricing but it also increases the competition in the food space in uk hey great my 2nd question is related to grain and apologies if i missed this in your opening comments i did hear your overview of the market could you talk about how you are positioned relative to the markets you know are you more hand to mouth at the moment do you have any basis secured any color you could offer there on how you are positioned you know through the balance of 4th quarter and into next year would be helpful hey ben this is jay thank you obviously we have seen prices of corn and soybean meal increase in the last few months which has been which has been the result of a few factors for corn we have seen a reduction from the supply side with usda reporting 6000000 fewer planted acres than they originally estimated back in march well to all our final stocks for 2019 end up being 200000000 bushels less than was expected and when the final counting was done on the current crop we actually for the acres that are planted see pretty good yields above trend line yields so it is not an issue on the current crop on the supply side in terms of us production but on the demand side we have also seen much bigger exports and demand primarily driven by china still the usda is projecting a carryout carryout of around 2100000000 bushels and that includes a thirty increase in export demand from last year so even if export demand ends up higher than what usda is projecting corn stocks should still be in line with previous years and soybeans usda is projecting a 290000000 bushel carryout which should be the lowest carryout in five years this is the usda projection china has driven an increase in export demand  by 31 in addition to an increase in export demand argentina which is one of the world is largest soybean exporting countries is in the midst of an historic economic crisis which is causing farmers there to hold back available supplies from the market adding more pressure to the us to meet this demand we believe the market is likely to feel anxious about us soybean supplies until there is a resolution to this currency situation in argentina or until south american supplies can be available in terms of how our physicians we have always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive to the market conditions and the risks we see and we feel very comfortable with where we are in corn and soybeans we do recognize the risk to soybean supplies in the us and our positions reflect that the next question is from michael pikan with cleveland research please go ahead yeah hi good morning guys just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of you know the move i guess  you know into retail and you know some of that big bird product is that being chopped up and put into trays and you know how is that impacting you know some of the margins on the commodity business yes mike there is a lot of products  big birds especially during promotional seasonality during the summer that from the big birds end up being put in the trade to be sold in the retailers we continue to do that i think the the challenge to the industry is that we need to have the label available and the facilities are available to do more of that and that is why the industry has not increased more production to the trade pack as we as as we want or need ok great and then my 2nd question is you know just looking at the  you mentioned that your absentee rates are starting to go down and you are starting to get back to your normal mix in terms of your supply chain have you seen any changes in the demand for your products the the boneless dark meat do you are you starting to return that to you know historical levels and what could that mean for the lead quarter prices which has seen you know the most pressure can that help or is it  you know the fact that china is taking more pork can that help with lead quarters that are why have not lead quarter prices moved if there is more the boneless dark meat potentially being produced and you know it seems like you know the at the very least china is taking more us pork yes you are right mike because of the absence of the food service industry in us the industry produced three more in july and august than the same period last year despite a lower total production that put a lot of pressure in the lack of capacity and as we are seeing more the reopening of the food service and as we are seeing the absence of the absentees and the staffing of our plants increasing for us and for the whole industry we will see more de boning we are already at levels comparable to last year in terms of de boning which will reduce the pressure in the leg quarters of course china has been also more active in the leg quarter market over the last month and we are seeing that in the leg quarter inventory that was up on  on a sequentially based up to august but we are seeing a reduction and also the inventory today is down nine and compared to the peak q one average that we have so those two factors can contribute to the reduction in the light quarter production which is a commodity item as i mentioned and the china interest i think we saw over the last  weeks although not today the increase in the oil prices and the reduction in in the and the dollar which increase the availability of dollars from the developing countries which also increases the demand for leg quarters so what could help on the leg quarters so going forward is both on supply and demand on supply is exactly what you said less leg quarters because of the improvement in labor efficiencies and the more sales in the domestic market on the food service and on demand because of low prices and because of more affordable income in the in the developing economies hi peter galbo with bank of america please go ahead hey guys good morning thanks for taking the question you know fabio just as as i am thinking about it you know the the small bird in retail channels obviously has been tremendously profitable for for you guys during you know this time period but when and you know with the plant conversion but you know with with commodity big bird remaining you know in the cutout value you have here remaining under such pressure just at at what point does it make sense to start talking about converting another plant whether that is to retail or or to small bird because it just it just seems like that big bird portion is is not going to improve without more capacity either being converted or or taken out of the market you know at in in some capacity sure thank you peter i think the decision to convert should be based on the potential benefits to the industry as a whole i think again you need to look into a more broader long term perspective if we continue to expect the food service sector to rebound if you look at the food service sector today the food service to restaurants are down thirteen year over year and that is impacting the big party banquets for sure while the kfrs are up nine as we go to a more normal operations as we see maybe the development of vaccines we do not know when that is going to happen or we see more openings of the restaurants we expect food service restaurants especially on the food service to regain some market share that they are not operating today so i think it is a long term decision and it is also a very difficult decision to move from big bird to a smaller because we have the growers and we have the feed mills it is all built to that specific bird our our plans in the united states are really customized so any conversion it really requires significant capital and requires some significant changes in the overall supply chain both starting from the growers your feed mills and your field operations so it is  it is a high capital investment that needs to be supported in  for the long run so that is why we do not see a lot of conversions in our industry of course if this is situation continues for for a longer period of time you can see some conversions i think also it is important to to know that some other players do not have the key customer relationships that we have and moving from the big board to the small board or to the keys ready require a customer and a key customer to support and since they do not have those relationships it is harder for them to do some conversions i do not know that is that is helpful and then maybe just to follow up you know given where the balance sheet is now and something you talked about in your repair remarks you know how should we think about and mna potential maybe from a geographic perspective or does it make sense to get bigger in in pork and in europe and you know going into 2021 just just any help there and then and then maybe you can also comment on any updates on your cfo search thanks very much in terms of strategy i think our strategy continues to stay the same and our growth strategy continues in tact and as we mentioned we have a very strong balance sheet we are looking into increasing our prepared foods operation and our branded operation to to create a more balanced portfolio and we are also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more value from operational efficiencies we are seeing targets both in the us and outside the us geographically we are seeing opportunities in china and other parts of the world we will evaluate all alternatives to our evaluation criteria in terms of the cml and we are in the process of finding another cml we already engage recruiting firms and we should have some some news in the near future great thanks very much guys the next question is from adam sennstrom with goldman sachs co please go ahead yes in terms of total volume i think we should be just a little bit up we expect to be to grow in line with usda expectations and the industry for 2020 to 2021 which is a little bit lower than one yes as we have more birds in minnesota but we will also reduce the weights in our operation on the big bird that we are transforming into a small bird so we expect to be for 2020 to 2021 in line with with those two in terms of investments it is not  very significant to our total capex as the conversion of the small but plant it is not it is a simpler conversion of course that qpsr requires some dasises which is portion of equipment and some marinization equipment and we are going to invest in automation in that plant as well today is a manual deboning operation and we are going to investment in the automated automated de boning so the investment is close to twenty to $25000000 in that operation and in the in the case of the case value operation is close to $70000000 so overall it is a total of $100000000 that we can invest in those two conversions okay that is so a helpful color and then the the follow up was i just i will make sure i heard something right from the package marks that you talked about the prepared to his business in the us declining at 26 i think is what i heard and maybe hoping to just to expand on that that is a business that i think has had bit more challenges over the years and just is do we is it really just a question of return to school and and food service traffic or how do we think about that business or a margin profile moving forward we are primarily a food service brand we also are very strong in the school with our gold gold key brand both those segments are the ones that are most most affected by the the covid nineteen the non commercial food service that includes schools were down 66 at the q two and now they are down 43 we are seeing some school reopen which could help but it is the segment that is still down forty on what we call the commercial food service which is the street business where our pearce brand is  is a leading branding wings and in chunks we saw that at in q two they end up 36 lower than the prior year but they are rebounding and then today they are close to four lower than the same period last last year so the food service business has been recovering and with that our pearce brand has recovered and our volumes but the school system is still close to forty lower than the prior year and that is why we are investing in more retail branded business as we mentioned our build to suit brand has increased more than thirty and we have been very successfully expanding the just bare brand from the fresh category which is being very successful on on the online segment and also on the on the higher attribute maintain our key customers to the prepared food segment great that is the top of caller i will pass it on thank you thank you and the next question comes from karla casella with jp morgan please go ahead we are seeing any more m and a opportunities just given the volatility in worldwide protein markets yeah thank you carlotta we we set this target of two to three times because it is the best capital structure that can protect and reduce our interest payments while not creating any any problem for our for our bonds and for our leverage the two to three times is in normal operations of course during some acquisition if we have a great plan on how to reduce that back we can go further i do not think there is a number that it is specific on where we go i think it is more about what is the plan to do leverage and of course the plan to do leverage could include the issue of stock and that is why pilgrim is as a public traded company has that opportunity to use the stock as a currency ok and just one more question no in terms sorry in terms of m and a yes we are seeing more targets of course the whole situation about traveling has  created some challenges in terms of seeing and visiting assets but we are seeing some targets that are still very very attractive interesting to us and could create a lot of value for our shareholders okay great and then just in the event that jbs is able to list the us business would that cause any need for a change in your structure yeah we do not believe so i think jbs has said many times that they continue to support the farmers to be a public traded company and just as i mentioned it is a great way for us to to keep our growth thank you for using the equity as a currency in the case of a very important and transformational event for parents okay thank you once again if you have a question please press star and one on your telephone gentlemen there are no more questions registered at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to mister fobbs for closing well thank you all we would like to reiterate our continued commitment to our valued team members to provide them with a safe and healthy work environment while

drew and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call this morning i would like to start by walking everyone back from what i hope was a healthy and happy holiday season we are pleased to report improved earnings for the 4th quarter where we achieved the high end of our guidance that we provided in our last quarterly call sales of 616000000 were six sequentially are up six sequentially despite some lingering in market challenges related to covid nineteen illustrating the benefit of a diverse portfolio of businesses as well as momentum momentum that we are building operationally our fiscal 4th quarter ebda of $28000000 grew 45 or an ebda margin increased 150 basis points on a year over year basis despite despite a six decline in our revenue our business generated 31 more ebda this quarter than we did in the 3rd quarter and we were able to convert those earnings into cash allowing us to reduce our net debt by over $40000000 within the quarter we fully participated in increased demand for recreational vehicles and showed market share gain in three out of five product categories while our fire and emergency margins approved throughout the year the commercial segment was able to address an organic drop in sales of 120000000 and limit our full year detrimental ebda margin during the last nine months we faced difficulties and perhaps some unprecedented external challenges while delivering three quarters of sequential margin improvement we still have much work remaining and we continue to operate through the challenges with parts supply and absenteeism tied to the covid matter however we believe we are in a position to continue to deliver year over year improvements throughout the upcoming fiscal year through operational disciplines and capabilities that we are building one important cornerstone that we are committed to establish at reverend is to have aligned and unified leadership team that operates under the principles of timely data driven fact based decision making with a high sense of ownership and accountability we have spent quite a bit of time the last few months focused on leadership alignment and organizational structure we have completed our review of the businesses and we have implemented a redesign of our operating model this was a thoughtful examination of how the business operates where decisions are made and how we are structured to predictably deliver results creating value for our customers and shareholders the result aligns leadership and management and how we are going to run this business and where accountability sits within the organization while simplifying our business and optimizing our cost structure there are many changes that were made to this process that will provide a bit of insight on a few examples we made a decision to move our center led parts business back to the business units there was an initial hypothesis that growth would be achieved by implementing a consolidated centralized parts business stemming from some in market synergies that growth did not materialize our businesses inherently know our customers and products and have the institutional knowledge to answer questions and deliver results to our customers more efficiently further the realignment we will create a $5000000 annual cost structural cost savings combined outcome and reducing complexity for our customers the unrealized growth and what ended up being creating a duplicate cost structure drove the decision to make this change this decision was the result of a careful examination of how to efficiently serve our customers and simplify our operations commercially there are a few aspects of our operating model where we moved more firmly to a center led operation and becoming an operating company these include development development of a standalone activities related to operational excellence and commercial excellence we are scaling up capabilities and processes value creation for our shareholders many of these capabilities have been discussed by management previously but have lacked the commitment and rigor to yield sustainable improvements that create value we are focused on changing that and made investments in new personnel and technologies to to our operating model to build the disciplines necessary to drive sustainable improvement improvement or performance as part of our operational excellence we are building capabilities to improve database decision making simplify operations and improve efficiencies on our balance sheet this includes discipline review and controls of corporate costs manufacturing overhead labor and direct materials it requires increased capabilities focused on engineering manufacturing operations supply chain purchasing to accelerate the change process and created best in class operations we have made several management changes there are a couple that i would like to highlight today 1st we have expanded the role of our commercial president brian perry to include the role of senior vice president of operations in this role brian brian leads our manufacturing execution operational excellence and supply chain brian is a master black belt in six sigma lean sensei and has extensive background in manufacturing operations and purchasing making him the ideal person to build out our scintillate operational efforts he is well positioned to take on this dual role while continuing to lead our commercial segment in addition we have hired rob vislosky as vice president and chief supply officer rob joins reverend group having recently led honeywell is intelligrated global supply chain and was honeywell is corporate chief procurement officer as cpo at honeywell he managed an $18000000000 annual spin portfolio as well as leading 3000 procurement global procurement specialists rob has a very broad industrial background from aerospace automotive paint and coatings and includes logistics he has had executive leadership roles with xpo logistics dallas bar reynolds group and alcoa he brings to reverend group both the vision and the execution capabilities to build the best class global sourcing organization we are looking for and purchasing supply chain organization combined with a sense of urgency to do this at a pace rob has only been in the position at reverend for a few weeks but he is taken an exhaustive look at our infrastructure as quickly to identify the list of opportunities i am very pleased to have rob join our team and i look forward to the impact that he will have on our business performance in my nine months since joining reverend there have been challenges some that were expecting some that were not unexpected we have implemented much change during that time we began to see sequential improvements in our results we have much work remaining in the months ahead but i am encouraged about the progress today i look forward to sharing more about the plans and the path forward with you during our analyst investor day that we are planning for april with that i am going to turn over to mark for details on our 4th quarter segment performance mark thanks rod and good morning everyone please turn to page for the slide deck as i review our segment level performance prior to an emergency segment 4th quarter sales were 330000000 a 23 increase compared to prior year this includes approximately 75000000 of sales attributable to our acquisition of spartan  that occurred earlier in the year excluding spartan organic segment sales decreased six from the 4th quarter of last year while our organic fire sales were relatively flat we shipped fewer ambulance units due to lingering impacts of covid although down from prior year north american ambulance deliveries increased 21 sequentially in order trends continue to remain strong as municipalities and federal stimulus dollars prioritize health and safety needs care vet stimulus dollars remain available for ambulance units delivered through the 2021 calendar year end continuing an important driver demand for our fne segment within the fire division throughput increased sequentially once again at our e one plant in ocala florida unit production was up 44 year over year demonstrating the benefits of lean programs and operating disciplines that were deployed over the 2nd half of the year bringing in and lean expertise allowed a dual track of affecting immediate change while allowing time to develop leadership train internal resources and build a pipeline of opex projects that will sustain continuous improvement we plan to follow this model of deploying lean assistance where we feel there will be an immediate impact while training our internal teams that all businesses through a lean academy that is designed to deliver annual throughput and cost out targets fnes segment adjusted ebitda was 14800000 in the 4th quarter of 2020 compared to 7400000 in the 4th quarter of 2019 the increase was primarily due to the improvements in e one just mentioned and the acquisition of spartan  ambulance ebitda was relatively flat with the prior year despite the decrease in sales due to product productivity improvements that increased margins most notably at our largest manufacturing location in orlando spartan contributed 4000000 adjusted ebitda to the fne segment within the quarter which completes three quarters of integration that exceeded expectations the addition of this world class chassis manufacturing business provides a center of excellence that will be leveraged across our fire businesses and brands creating further opportunities for manufacturing efficiencies within the segment spartan is now integrated into the fne segment operationally and we do not plan to call out it is individual contribution in the future total fne backlog was 966000000 up sixteen year over year this includes backlog acquired from spartan and strong ambulance order intake throughout the fiscal year including the 4th quarter a decline in legacy fire backlog is largely the result of increased throughput at the ocala plant and a decrease in fire industry unit orders that occurred from the onset to covid through approximately september of 2020 industry orders during that period declined over 25 since that time and during the final two months of our fiscal 2020 our order rates improved to levels on par with fiscal year 2019 fire backlog remained and strong and now reflect competitive industry lead times and ambulance backlog is at a record high which provides a solid base for sales growth and conversion to earnings within the fne segment we currently expect year over year fne revenue improvement versus this year softness related to covid absenteeism and inspection delays which occurred primarily in the 2nd and 3rd fiscal quarters at this time another recurrence of the virus or additional government restrictions we feel confident that we will convert to earnings more efficiently and with improved incremental margins turning to slide five commercial segment 4th quarter sales were 91000000 a decrease of 56000000 compared to the prior period which included approximately 57000000 from the shuttle businesses divest in early 2020 the organic decline of sales was related to lower sales that all businesses within the segment year over year school bus sales declined fourteen in the 4th quarter which is a significant improvement to 3rd quarter decline of 31 and puts our fiscal 2nd half 2020 sales ahead of reported declines and industry registrations for the same period municipal transit sales decreased forty versus the prior year primarily due to delivery schedule adjustment to a large order to accommodate the needs of our customer that we disclosed in our fiscal 3rd quarter the change extended the delivery timeline through fiscal 2021 and there have been no further changes to that contract specialty markets remain depressed with sales down forty versus last year while this is an improvement from 3rd quarter decline to fifty the sales were primarily existing stock units built to order cancellations or delivery or delays that needed significant rework to meet customer specifications turning to segment adjusted ebitda for the commercial segment commercial segment adjusted ebitda at 6400000 was down 61 versus the prior year period which included 1000000 ebitda related to divested shuttle bus businesses the decline in ebitda was primarily the result of the sales decline in all businesses as well as the inefficiencies related to the rework of stock units within a specialty division although the stock unit rework had a negative contribution to performance in the quarter given the severe end market declines in this business we took the opportunity to right size what had become an inflated stock unit inventory within the bus division despite revenue declines in both school and municipal markets these businesses were able to conducive to flex production with demand and contributed high single digit ebitda margins commercial segment backlog at the end of the 4th quarter was 274000000 down fourteen versus the prior year quarter which contained 86000000 of shuttle bus backlog excluding shuttle bus an eighteen organic backlog increase is the pro is a result of an increase in specialty division orders within the 4th quarter in timing of a large municipal transit order that entered backlog in the 1st quarter of this year partially offset by decrease school bus school bus orders the increased specialty orders were for both terminal trucks and street sweepers and this quarter marks the best order intake since fiscal 1st quarter 2019 we have been aggressively pursuing new contracts and renewals in these markets winning a large rental company contract for street sweepers and advancing in the bid process for terminal trucks at several national accounts last month we are excited to announce the partnership with hyster yale group to develop electric and hydrogen power terminal trucks to reduce emissions and increase increase efficiency and productivity we are targeting the end of our fiscal year to have the initial prototypes available for market testing with momentum in momentum our specialty markets a longer cycle municipal transit backlog we feel the commercial segment is in a position to grow revenue despite uncertainty of surround the timing the timing of a full time returned to the classroom and impact on school bus demand as covid nineteen vaccines become more widespread there is reason to be optimistic that decisions to reopen schools in districts will benefit our peak spring selling season for school bus given the cost out activities that we took this year across all of our commercial segment businesses we expect increased volume and specialty and potentially school bus to convert at solid incremental margins we anticipate the overall variability of 2020s commercial segment bottom line margin performance will dissipate in 2021 absent any new government directives that may impact end markets employee attendance or delivery acceptance the near term potential for this segment remains in the high single digit ebitda margin profile turning the page to slide six recreation segment sales of 194000000 we are up twelve versus last year reflecting strong wholesale shipments and retail demand for class b class c and tow able units class c shipments were down mid single digits versus last year is production was limited by supply chain constraints primarily in gas units we feel a backlog in productive and production capacity are in place to support higher shipments once these bottlenecks clear despite shipping fewer class c units our award winning product introductions continue to take market share resulting in higher retail demand increased pricing and lower discounting and allowances recreation segment ebitda adjusted ebitda was 20500000 for the quarter an increase of 12000000 or 175 versus the prior year adjusted ebitda margin of tensix reflects reflects the higher sales mix of non class a products within the quarter as well as the impact of operating leverage and productivity improvements achieved across all categories with sequential and year over year margin gains despite lower class a units sales profitability increased over 650 basis points versus 4th quarter 2019 and for a business that had recently struggled to break even it was encouraging to see profitability reach levels it had not attained over the past two years we expect to continue this momentum by driving efficient manufacturing practices and commercial activities focused on dealer wins and market share gains that would deliver sustainable performance not only during this upturn in demand but across all parts of demand and stocking cycles segment backlog increased 220 year over year to 540000000 which reflects strong order intake across all rv categories over the past six months the past two quarters were historic highs for orders by a substantial margin and our current backlog is nearly double that of any point in reverend is recreation segment history we feel this supports the current industry thinking that wholesale shipments will be up twenty or more in calendar 2021 and that our product portfolio niche market placements and iconic brands lands us in a strong position to participate in that growth as we move forward we expect the sales mix of products to normalize if class a production and delivery schedules improve and therefore to expect segment margins in the mid single digits versus the ten achieved in q four on slide seven consolidated full year net sales declined five year over year to 2300000000 in a challenging year that includes expansion of production activities that our recreation segment at the onset of covid and unplanned disruptions related to the pandemic at several other businesses adjusted ebitda declined 34 compared to fiscal 2019 to 67500000 nearly 50000000 or three quarters of that total occurred in the 2nd half of the year as revenue throughput and margins improved sequentially through the period rod mentioned the number of structuring activities related to rightsizing the organization this included decentralizing the parts business from the corporate center back into the individual businesses and sun setting less profitable brands and dealer relationships within the portfolio the total structural cost savings executed through our fiscal year end are expected to deliver a total of $10000000 annually turning to slide eight full year net cash provided by operating activities was 56000000 compared to 53000000 of net cash provided in the prior year period cash generated was primarily to improvements in accounts receivable and inventory management as well as an increase in customer deposits received we will continue to work all aspects of networking capital including reinforcing the disciplines needed to reach optimal inventory levels balancing accounts receivable and payable terms and aligning more of our businesses with a model that collects a greater amount of customer deposits that working capital at october 31st 2020 was 355000000 compared to 373000000 at the end of fiscal 2019 now that is as of october 31st was 331000000 including 11000000 cash on hand versus 377000000 at the end of fiscal 2019 at fiscal year end the company maintained ample liquidity with 283000000 available under our abl revolving credit facility you may recall that our term loan amendment effective in april of last year reverts to a net leverage ratio of five25 times with certain add backs related to the spartan acquisition in the fiscal 1st quarter of 2021 we are confident that we will attain this target you may also recall that our term loan expires in april 2022 we will be working with our banking partners throughout the upcoming month to optimize our capital structure we do not plan to issue guidance today due to recent recurrence of covid nineteen cases globally or within our business across the country the safety of our employees remains a top priority contact tracing testing and measures to prevent the spread of the virus come with uncertain staffing levels that impact our businesses and supply chain partners the cdc has issued and continues to update new directives that we follow under these conditions our customer is ability to travel inspect vehicles for acceptance creates uncertainty of delivery and revenue recognition timing until we can reasonably predict the potential impacts of these changes we feel it would not be prudent to give a range of estimates however with the emergence of vaccines we hope to have better clarity when we host our virtual investor and analyst day in april that rod referenced please save the date on april 15th when we plan to provide a deeper look at our business and operating model and provide immediate term targets if we feel that the operating landscape has become more predictable we expect to also provide full year guidance we will extend a formal invitation to this event soon with that i will turn it back over to rod so i guess we get just a few closing comments then yep so you know the the fiscal year 2020 has been a challenging for the reverend group and our employees in many regards we have gone through a number of internal changes as we have moved towards the future we sold a business purchase and and integrated a business during the time in which the external environment as you all know has been very and often unpredictable i am pleased with the progress we have achieved in a short amount of time given the amount of change we have experienced our business continue to have a relatively healthy backlogs and we simply believe these support revenue growth in the upcoming year and most importantly importantly i am very pleased with what our employees have done the other day they they have they have put themselves in a situation where they have delivered on demand they can to deliver on our commitments and deliver to our customers under some very adverse circumstances as as we look to support the 1st responders in in in our country so i am very pleased i want to thank them publicly for what they have done and with that i think we will hold have a q and a with an open mic so questions and answers thank you if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue and for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key please ask one question and one follow up question and they will reach you for additional questions our 1st question is from jerry rutledge with goldman sachs please proceed yes hi good morning everyone and congratulations on a really strong performance year hey jerry thanks thank you what really stood out was the margin performance in the rv business and you alluded to makes helping i am wondering if we just stepped through you know we are looking at the year over year margin expansion much of that was improved productivity how much of that was pricing makes and do we think about the makes tailwind as being sustainable from here yeah jerry as as i said in in the my my prepared remarks you know the mix really helps us and i think we have always said that you know outside of class a those are double digit performing businesses so when you look at the mix there our mix was down class a and we really had two things helping us from a tailwind perspective the fact that we had a larger mix and those more profitable business being the class b cs and tow ables and class a actually had a high concentration of diesel product within the quarter which is a more profitable than the gas product so so even though we say covid a lot of the furniture issues we have had that we talked about previously were on our gas unit lines and so even within class a we had a margin pickup from the concentration of diesel within the quarter which we would expect to more flatten out to a reasonable normalized rate going forward and of course as class a continues to develop it will get more to the forty sixty sort of split that we traditionally have seen within that group so it really is just a matter of the amount that we sold within those other product categories plus the mixed benefit and of course as you saw within the rv itself the productivity improvements that they had drove you know significant part of that 650 basis point improvement their sales we actually down and as we go ahead sorry please go ahead yeah i was saying that sales are actually down year on year right so they actually we are able to deliver a profit that is a quarter versus last so that was majority of that benefit was from productivity okay and then fire and emergency in ocala it turned the corner can you talk about how the production rates have continued into december have you continued to ramp higher or was it forty increase essentially get you through a normalized run rate and when do we see okay from an accounting standpoint so lower per unit costs flowing through to the full extent well i do think this is rod we have made considerable progress in in that location but there is still opportunity for us to even do much better there so we as mark mentioned in his earlier discussion you know we have gotten back to more of a standard industry lead times we continue to work on throughput on both aerials and pumpers in that plant and we believe there is opportunities for continued margin expansion through productivity so while we were pleased with the path we are on and in seeing this thing move and get and be able to get look at our backlog get to what we think is a more of a standard lead time we we do still believe there is opportunity to improve our efficiencies in that plant and get a mar and get margin expansion of that business so that is just work in front of us so thank you yep thanks jerry our next question is from jamie please proceed hi good morning i guess a couple of questions one i think you noted on the commercial side you expected to see growth year over year just a clarification i am assuming that is you know normalized for the divest share so look at sort of the 90000000 quarterly run rate when you are talking indirect about growth and i guess just my 2nd question can you just give more color obviously the outlook on the on the bus side or the school bus side is is is somewhat you know uncertain as you talk to customers can you just talk about how they are thinking about buying trends in the latter part of the year what would be the major drivers what would they need to see to come back in the market and just sort of you know the overall age age of the fleet thanks well i think that you know this is rod you know the feedback we have from from in market or from dealer partners is that you know the whole thing and certainly around school openings or schools that are open staying opening that is that is the that is the driving factor in it and right now there is just tremendous uncertainty around that if the back half of this year is going to shape out definitely obviously with the emergence of the of the the multiple vaccines and i think what is our real drive for for people to get back in school from the public i think that is the that is pretty clear that people want to go back to school that that is makes promise we have got a couple of things there i think the tailwinds will help us get where we need to be we are going to know i think by the time we get to get together in april we are going to know how that shapes out but right now there is just too much uncertainty for us to look forward and project what that school bus market is going to look like not knowing what the impacts of covid is going to be until we see the success rate on this virus and what that looks like and then further moving into the into the into the spring when our you know we typically see april may being when we start getting significant orders and deliveries so that will be a timeframe we are going to know but right now it is it is it is not clear it is just tremendous uncertainty everybody is kind of awaiting that that that time period sorry and then just the the commentary on revenues for commercial mix assuming it excludes the divestiture so look at the 90000000 quarterly run rate correct and then my last question how to think about the corporate expense line you know as as we look to to 2021 any color there thanks yeah so you are right on the commercial exactly right excluding the 90000000 and then and the and the corporate of course our parts was part of the centralized so that 5000000 drops right to the corporate line so you could see that 5000000 drop that is where that was traditionally shown to our centralized parts business okay great thank you yep thank you our next question is from courtney yakavonis with morgan stanley please proceed hi thanks good morning guys morning courtney just back on the comments you know appreciate that you know there will be a mixed shift in recreation next year i think you said you expect you know in line with the industry wholesale shipments that is about twenty but i think you had said that you were expecting mid single digit margins and i think we have historically been seeing more high single digits out of that segment so i am just wanted to make sure i fully understood what you what you were thinking the mix shift impact would have on on 2021 given that class a has been weak for some time now yeah we have truthfully seen mid single digits so you know what we determined as mid right 55 to seven so that is probably in line what we have historically done but the mix shift really is what i referred to with jerry is question is again at forty of our sales being in the rv or our class a business you know those as you know are depressed margin so those bring down the ones that are a double digit from a run rate perspective so it is really the fact that rv are what we call rv are class a was actually down from a mix so as they come to the forty to fifty range there are forty in the quarter versus fifty in the prior year so you had a ten drop there from a mixed perspective and so it is really that that simple as far as looking at the other three businesses that we have in that portfolio at double digit and bringing in a lower single digit mix from the class a we will actually depress those ten down to the more of the five to seven range okay that is helpful and then any more specificity you could give us just on commercial and fne margins as we think about impact next year obviously appreciating that it is going to be dependent on your delivery schedule but any high level thoughts on the margin side yeah i think we said high single digits on the from that whole commercial side but obviously on the capacity if you are talking about capacity that is you know that is one we are still with the backlog here so as i said in my prepared remarks we took the opportunity to a lot of the units that we had developed coming into the what our normal selling season is did not develop but exiting the quarter we were very happy with some of the progress we made in our backlog is now performing so we should see the variability get out of there but when you look at the total commercial segment we would expect the high single sort of what we were expecting coming in a quarter if we would not have had the issues that we experienced on the commercial side and liquidation that we did on some of those stock units so we had expected it to get more like we guided to our last time more the mid or the high single digits for the commercial segment okay gotcha and then i guess just lastly you know you mentioned you know concerns about delivery schedules for next year but if you had to just highlight you know what are the three categories that has the most variability where you are most concerned about versus the ones that are or that you feel most confident in the delivery schedules for next year just just so we can get a sense of of where the real risk is and by by categories you mean the business units or the product categories i guess yeah i guess i just meant you know the within the business units you know obviously your recreation that club is you know pretty strong so do you feel like that is you know where you have had the most certainty you know versus some of the product lines in fne and commercial i think that you know the and i will comment then mark can clean up what i say i think that when you think about in markets that are affected by the issues i think primarily obviously in market demand in the in the school bus businesses is the issue all the businesses are subject to some level of suppl supplier issues that we are dealing with i think rv is probably the one that we have seen the most stock outs which is pretty consistent across the industry the other element that we deal with a little bit which is a timing issue not a impact probably within the fiscal year it is just the inspections that have to take place in ambulance and fire around getting a bus off the lot or a truck or an ambulance off the lot related to completing final inspections by getting people to the site that is a real issue that we we we have been dealing with in terms of you know revenue recognition cause that has to happen in order for us to to convert the bus so i think you know in in in school bus is certainly is it is in market demands there is some supplier issues that are spread throughout and we have been able to overcome for the most part but they are they they do pop up and we have to work through that and then the last thing would be that the businesses that are subject to inspections which is you know your your your emergency segment is where we see that and mark i do not know if you want to add anything no i think that is right i think as we said previously one of the things that we thought would happen here with covid as people converted like people working from home we expected that more people would adopt virtual inspections for our ambulance and fire trucks and as exiting covid our customers have come back to wanting to see their trucks in person and with the resur resurgence here we are hoping that they will go back to virtual but we have shifted back to wanting to do in person inspections so we have not seen them going back to virtual so obviously there is some flux there if people would go back to virtual inspections depending on what happens with the covid environment but we are back to our traditional as rod referred to actually seeing the units before they leave the yard so that we can revenue them and that is really the delays that i was speaking to of it is really our customers coming in and inspecting the units and approving them for sure shipment great thanks as a reminder just dial star one on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question our next question is from raj patel with jefferies please proceed hey thanks for taking the question quick one on fne margins what is the anticipated fne margin expansion once all the production inefficiencies are sorted out what do you think the new margin profile looks like in a new normal yeah from a fire perspective obviously as rod has reiterated multiple times we are still in a multiple endings journey here so as he is referred to on the e one we still have a lot of work to do we are seeing progression but of course we have other facilities within the portfolio too that we are going to address as i said in my prepared remarks that we are still expecting to be in the double digits at the end of this journey but we are still working through that right so of course we are not giving guidance here but again it is still in a multiple year perspective to get to that ten so we are just happy to see the progression here that we have seen throughout the quarter and obviously our forward looking we will provide more guidance in in april yeah i think there is there is you know when you think about operational improvements and and and how you walk walk down that what mark referred to is a multi journey when you come into the role you there is there is some quick things you can do to get popped in and get improvement and then it is about building capabilities and i mentioned from an operational excellence standpoint you know standing up the lean capabilities and and and center led type activities that get implemented in the plants around ci around purchasing building engineering capabilities to get in designed costs to the ebe those are things that that you got this capability building but they the good thing is is that it is a continual improvement continually improved process where you are going to be getting at that every day by building pipelines to go execute again so we are in the process right now coming out of our operating model discussion of standing up those capabilities and building out those teams and doing the certifications that mark talked about through lean that are going to yield benefit to us for a very very long time things that did did not exist now we are sta we are standing up those capabilities and bringing on rob to lead our purchasing organization and get focused on that significant spend i think it is going to yield a great benefit to us too so those will all contribute to a margin expansion story not only in emergency but across the business and so that is but but it does take work to stand it up but it starts with organizing and aligning and then investing in those capability building and then driving it through process rigor each each each day each week each month that is helpful thank you our next question is from with baird please proceed thanks so morning guys a question on good morning a quick question on chassis as as you are looking at your chrome production planning based on your backlog are there any portions of your business where you are getting a sense that you are having either challenges obtaining chassies or the the delivery timelines are extended and and look i mean i am i am thinking specifically around ambulances and and some of the stuff that recreation as well like you know class bs and so on yeah no i am glad to say and we we were not experiencing those in fact you know we have and we have had a pretty good supply chain from that perspective so i was happy this quarter not to be talking about chassis shortages for once even though it is only my 2nd one so i know you have heard that consistently so we have been very happy with that in fact you know in the rv side especially we you know we took advantage of what the i run rates were going to be and actually ordered ahead so we are actually sitting with plenty of chassis from that perspective and in that business and then on the ambulance side we have not had any issues from a chassis perspective and we have been getting our appropriate allocations from our oe partners okay that is helpful and then maybe my my follow up sort of sticking with with this team how do you think about steel prices and raw material inflation in 2021 w w what are some of the steps that you are taking to mitigate those because obviously historically this has been an area where we have seen some trouble in prior years thank you so i mean obviously on the parts of our business which large part of the business is build out a backlog of you know there there is always the the the issue you are trying to offset inflation with your efficiency efforts cause you you you purchase price is established on a backlog based business so we are managing that obviously a big part of what what rob is efforts is going to be is is to look at new purchasing to be able to offset offset that within a fiscal fiscal year so we can cycle through and get the margins that we need on a price cost basis but so it is it is a lot around driving efficiency to make sure that that we are doing everything we can to optimize our cost structure to have any leakage that does come through inflation into a backlog based business we can offset through other other means and mark i do not know if you want to add anything to that or i think that is right and that is one of the things that i am working personally with rob on and make sure we understand those inflationary factors as we go through 2021 as well as our agreements with our supply base and that is one of the things that that rob can acclimate it to and we there is obviously a heightened focus in those businesses where we do not have the longer backlogs we have obviously come out with some price increases as our competitors have so we are managing that with the supply base as well as our customers i do think one of the things you know one of the things we are working on is is trying to get in front of how we think about price price as a function of inflation and to make sure when you think about a price increase or setting a price in the market that you are thinking about the build cycle of when that that vehicle will get built so you reflect some inflationary characteristics in your costing in the business most of our businesses have done that to some degree but that is just something i think that we got to get great around because when you are working on a backlog based business and you are doing selling forward projection on deliveries you got to be thinking about the inflationary times that you are in and making sure that you are you are costing that vehicle such that by the time you are doing the build or you are you are shipping the vehicle that you have anticipated any inflationary costs and your pricing costs absolutely i understand that i guess i am just wondering based on what do you know today do you believe you are going to you are going to be in a position where you can be neutral from a price cost standpoint going forward or should we try to bake in some kind of a headwind thank you yeah i think based on the data we have now relative to price cost the efficiency efforts that we have gotten the business should yield is a at a minimum neutrality in our performance going forward and in the fiscal year appreciate good luck guys thanks as reminder just dial one on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question we will pause for a brief moment to pull for a final questions there are no more questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to rod for closing comments okay great well well thank you again for joining i appreciate the questions i know its again i want to you know take a moment as we close out our fiscal year in a nine month period for myself and then think about the changes that we made both in process and structure and people to thank our team for for what has been a pretty whirlwind year considering all the external situations that all of us have dealt with on top of that new leadership coming in and expecting do your things a different way and maybe change some thinking i want to complement our leadership team and also thank our frontline employees in in what they have to serve our customers and also serve this nation in getting these necessary vehicles out and out to our community so again i appreciate your time today i look forward to seeing you on april when we will have a deeper discussion around what where we are taking this business going forward have a great have a great day and have a great weekend thank you thank you this step concludes to this conference you may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation",

we make with the sec we disclose any obligation to update these forward looking statements which may not be updated good morning everyone thank you for joining our call this morning i would like to start by walking everyone back from what i hope was a healthy and happy holiday we are pleased to report improved earnings for the 4th quarter where we achieved the high end of our guidance that we provided in our last quarterly call sales of 616000000 were six sequentially or up six sequentially despite some lingering in market challenges related to covid nineteen illustrating the benefit of our diverse portfolio of businesses as well as momentum momentum that we are building operationally our fiscal 4th quarter ebitda of $28000000 grew 45 our ebitda margin increased 150 despite a six decline in our revenue our business generated 31 more edba this quarter than we did in the 3rd quarter and we were able to convert those earnings into cash allowing us to reduce our net debt by over $40000000 within the quarter we fully participated in the increased demand for recreational vehicles and showed market share gain in three out of five product categories while our foreign exchange margins approved throughout the year was able to address an organic drop in sales of 120000000 and limit our fully or deteriorating ebitda margin during the last nine months we faced difficulties and perhaps some unprecedented external challenges while delivering three quarters of sequential margin improvement we still have much work remaining and we continue to operate through the challenges with parts supply and absenteeism tied to the covid matter however we believe we are in a position to continue to deliver your improvement we are about the upcoming fiscal year through our operational disciplines and capabilities that we are building one important cornerstone that we are committed to establish at reverend is to have aligned and unified leadership team that operates under the principles of timely data driven fact based decision making with a high sense of ownership and accountability we have spent quite a bit of time the last few months focused on leadership alignment and organizational structure we have completed our review of the businesses and we have implemented a redesign of our operating model this is this was a thoughtful examination of how the business operates where decisions are made and how we are structured to predictably deliver results creating value for our customers and shareholders the result aligns leadership and management on how we are going to run this business and where accountability sits within the organization while simplifying our business and optimizing our cost structure there were many changes that were made to this process that will provide a bit of insight on a few examples we made a decision to move our center led parts business back to the business units the initial hypothesis was that growth would be achieved by implementing a consolidated centralized parts business stemming from some in market synergies that growth did not materialize our businesses inherently know our customers and products and have the institutional knowledge to answer questions and deliver results to our customers more efficiently further the realignment will create a $5000000 annual structural cost savings combined outcome of reducing complexity for our customers the unrealized growth and what ended up being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being

being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being i have a duplicate cost structure to make this change this decision was the result of a careful examination of how to efficiently serve our customers and simplify our operations conversely there are a few aspects of our operating model where we move more firmly to a center led operation and becoming an operating company these include development development of a center led activities related to operational excellence and commercial excellence or scaling of capabilities and processes we yield value creation for our shareholders management previously discussed the lack of commitment and rigor to yield sustainable improvements that create value we are focused on changing that and main investments in new personnel and technologies to our operating model to build the disciplines necessary to to drive sustainable improvement of performance as part of our operational excellence we are building capabilities to improve database decision making simplify operations and improve efficiencies on our balance sheet this includes discipline review and controls of corporate costs we have expanded the role of our commercial president brian prarie to include the role of senior vice president of operations in this role brian brian leads our manufacturing execution op rachel excellence in supply chain brian is a master black belt in six sigma alene sensay and has extensive background in manufacturing operations and purchasing making him the ideal person to build out our center of operational excellence efforts he is well positioned to take on this dual role while continuing to lead our commercial segment in addition we

and has quickly identified a list of opportunities i am very pleased to have rob join our team and i look forward to the impact that he will have on our business performance in my nine months since joining rayovac there have been challenges some that were expected and some that were unexpected we have much work remaining in the months ahead but i am encouraged by the progress to date i look forward to sharing more about the plans and the path forward with you during our analyst investor day that we are planning for april with that i am now going to turn it over to mark for details on our 4th quarter segment performance mark thanks for adding that in good morning everyone please turn to page four of the slide deck as i review our segment level performance 4th quarter sales were 330000000 a 23 increase compared to prior year this includes approximately 75000000 of sales attributable to our acquisition of sparten e r that occurred earlier in the year excluding sparten organic segment sales decreased six from the 4th quarter of last year while organic firearms sales were relatively flat we shipped fewer ambulance units due to lingering impacts of covid although down from prior year ambulance deliveries increased 21 sequentially and order trends continued to remain strong as municipalities and federal stimulus dollars prioritized health and safety needs kerzack stimulus dollars remain available for ambulance units delivered through the 2021 calendar year end continuing an important driver of demand for our f and e segment within the fire division throughput increased sequentially once again at our e one plant in ocala florida unit production was up 44 year over year demonstrating the benefits of lean programs and operating disciplines that were deployed over the 2nd half of the year bring in lean expertise allowed a dual track of affecting immediate change while allowing time to develop leadership train internal resources and build a pipeline of opex projects that will sustain continuous improvement we plan to follow this model of deploying lean assistance where we feel there will be an immediate impact good morning while training our internal teams at all businesses through lean academy that is designed to deliver annual throughput and cost out targets epherines segment adjusted ebitda was 14800000 in the 4th quarter of 2020 compared to 7400000 in the 4th quarter of nineteen the increase was primarily due to the improvements in e one just mentioned in the acquisition of spartan  ambulance ebitda was relatively flat with prior year despite the decrease in sales due to productivity improvements that increased margins most notably at our largest manufacturing location in orlando sparton contributed 4000000 adjusted ebitda to the ephe segment within the quarter which completes three quarters of integration that exceeded expectations the addition of this world class chassis manufacturing business provides a center of excellence that will be leveraged across our fire businesses total epsilon backlog was 966600000 up sixteen year over year this includes backlog acquired from sparten and strong ambulance order intake throughout the fiscal year including the 4th quarter the backlog is largely the result of increased throughput at the okeecho plant and a decrease in fire industry unit orders that occurred from the onset of covid to approximately september of 2020 industry orders during that period declined over 25 since that time and during the final two months of our fiscal year 2020 our order rates improved to levels on par with fiscal year 2019 fire backlog remains strong and now reflects competitive industry conditions ambulance backlog is at a record high which provides a solid base for sales growth and conversion of earnings within the etf segment we currently expect year over year etf revenue improvement versus this year is softness related to covid absenteeism and inspection delays which occurred primarily in the 2nd and 3rd fiscal quarters at this time absent another recurrence of the virus or additional government restrictions we feel confident that we will convert to earnings more efficiently and with improved incremental margins turning to slide five commercial segment 4th quarter sales were 91000000 a decrease of 56000000 compared to the prior period which included approximately 57000000 from the shuttle businesses divested in early 2020 the organic decline in sales was related to lower sales at all businesses within the segment year over year school bus sales declined fourteen in the 4th quarter which is a significant improvement fiscal 2nd half 2020 sales ahead of reported declines in industry registration for the same period municipal transit sales decreased forty versus the prior year primarily due to delivery schedule adjustment to a large order to accommodate the needs of our customer that we disclosed in our fiscal 3rd quarter the change extended the delivery timeline through fiscal 2021 and there have been no further changes to that contract specialty markets remained depressed with sales down forty versus last year while this is an improvement from 3rd quarter decline of fifty the sales were primarily existing stock units built to order cancellations or delivery or delays that needed significant rework to meet customer specifications turning to segment adjusted ebitda for the commercial segment commercial segment adjusted ebitda at 6400000 was 61 versus the prior year period which included 1000000 ebda related to divested shuttle bus businesses the decline in ebda was primarily the result of the sales decline in all businesses as well as the inefficiencies related to the rework of stock units within the specialty division although the stock unit rework had a negative contribution to performance in the quarter given the severe end market declines in this business we took the opportunity to right size what had become an inflated stock unit within the bus division despite revenue declines in both school and municipal markets these businesses were able to continue to flex production with demand and contributed high single digit ebitda margins commercial segment backlog at the end of the 4th quarter was 274000000 down fourteen versus the prior year quarter which contained 86000000 to shuttle bus backlog excluding shuttle bus and eighteen organic backlog the increase is the result of an increase in specially division orders within the 4th quarter in timing of a large municipal transit order that entered backlog in the 1st quarter this year partially offset by decreased school bus so school bus orders the increased specialty orders were for both terminal trucks and street sweepers and this quarter marks the best order intake since fiscal 1st quarter 2019 we have been aggressively pursuing new contracts and thank you for having me today i am excited to announce a partnership with high street energy group to develop electric and hydrogen powered terminal trucks to reduce emissions and increase efficiency and productivity we are targeting the end of our fiscal year to have the initial prototypes available for market testing with momentum we will continue to advance in the bid process for terminal trucks at several national accounts and last month we were excited to announce a partnership with high street energy group to develop electric and hydrogen powered terminal trucks to reduce emissions and increase efficiency and productivity we are targeting the end of our fiscal year to have the initial prototypes available for market testing with momentum we will continue to advance in the bid process for terminal trucks at several national accounts in our specialty markets a longer cycle municipal transit backlog we feel the commercial segment is in a position to grow revenue despite uncertainty or surrounding the site the timing of a full time return to the classroom and impacts on school bus demand as covid nineteen vaccines become more widespread there is reason to be optimistic that decisions to reopen schools and districts will benefit our peak spring selling season for school buses given the cost out activities that we took this year across all of our commercial segments we are confident in our ability to drive growth and deliver value to our shareholders we expect increased volume and specialty and potentially school buses to convert at solid incremental margins we anticipate the overall variability of 2020 s commercial segment bottom line margin performance will dissipate in 2021 absent any new government directives that may impact end markets employee attendance or delivery acceptance the near term potential for this segment remains in the high single digit ebitda margin profile turning to page to slide six recreation segment sales of 194000000 were up twelve versus last year reflecting strong wholesale shipments and retail demand for class b class c and tollable units class eight shipments were down mid single digits versus last year as production was limited by supply chain constraints primarily in gas units we feel the backlog and productive and production capacity are in place to support higher shipments once these bottlenecks clear despite shipping fewer class a units our award winning product introductions continue to take market share resulting in higher retail demand increased pricing and lower discounting and allowances recreation segment ebitda adjusted ebitda was 20500000 for the quarter an increase of 12000000 or 175 for the prior year adjusted ebitda margin of tensix reflects the higher sales mix of non class a products within the quarter as well as the impact of operating leverage and productivity improvements achieved across all categories with sequential and year over year margin gains despite lower class a unit sales profitability increased over 650 and fifty basis points versus 4th quarter 2019 and for a business that had recently struggled to break even it was encouraging to see profitability reach levels we expect to continue this momentum by driving efficient manufacturing practices and commercial activities focused on dealer wins and market share gains that would deliver sustainable performance not only during this upturn in demand but across all parts of the demand and stocking cycles segment backlog increased 220 year over year to 540000000 which reflects strong order intake across all rv categories over the past year the past two quarters were historic highs for orders by a substantial margin and our current backlog is nearly double that of any point in revs recreation segment history we feel this supports the current industry thinking that wholesale shipments will be up twenty or more in calendar 2021 and that our product portfolio niche market placements and iconic brands like lands us in a strong position to participate in that growth as we move forward we expect the sales mix of products to change i formalize if class a production and delivery schedules improve and therefore expect segment margins in the mid single digits versus ten achieved in q four on slide seven consolidated full year net sales declined five year over year to 2300000000 in a challenging year that includes expansion of production activities at our recreation segment at the onset of covid and unplanned disruptions related to the pandemic at several other businesses as a result of these actions our adjusted ebitda for the year was approximately $1200000000 revenue through put and margins improved sequentially through the period rod mentioned the number of restructuring activities related to rightsizing the organization this included decentralizing the parts business from the corporate center back into the individual businesses and sunsetting less profitable brands and dealer relations turning to slide eight full year net cash provided by operating activities was 56000000 compared to 53000000 of net cash provided in the prior year period cash generated was primarily related to improvements in accounts receivable and inventory management as well as an increase in customer deposits received we will continue to work all aspects of networking and capital including reinforcing the disciplines needed to reach optimal inventory levels balancing accounts receivable and payable terms and aligning more of our businesses with a model that collects a greater amount of customer deposits net debt as of october 31 2020 was $300500000 compared to $300700000 at the end of fiscal 2019 net debt as of october 31 2021 is expected to be in the range of $280000000 to $290000000 the 1st was 381000000 including 11000000 cash on hand versus 377000000 at the end of fiscal 2019 at fiscal year end the company maintained ample liquidity with 283000000 available under our abl revolving credit facility we may recall that our term loan amendment effective in april of last year reverts to a net leverage ratio of five25 times with certain ad backs related to the spartan acquisition in the fiscal 1st quarter of 22 we are confident that we will attain this target you may also recall that our term loan expires in april 22nd we will be working with our banking partners throughout the upcoming months to optimize our capital structure we do not plan to issue guidance today due to the recent recurrence of covid nineteen cases globally within our business across the country the safety of our employees remains the top priority contact tracing testing and measures such as masks social distancing and hand hygiene remain in place to prevent the spread of the virus come with uncertain staffing levels that impact our businesses and supply chain partners the cdc has issued and continues to update new directives that we follow under these conditions our customers ability to travel inspect vehicles for acceptance creates uncertainty of delivery and revenue recognition timing until we can reasonably predict the potential impacts of these changes we feel it would not be prudent to give a range of estimates however with the emergence of vaccines we hope to thank you for your better clarity when we host our virtual investor and analyst day in april that rod referenced please save the date on april 15th when we plan to provide a deeper look at our business and operating model and provide immediate term targets if we feel that the operating landscape has become more predictable we expect to also provide full year guidance we will extend a formal invitation to this event soon with that i will turn it back over to rod so i guess so we just i am pleased with the progress we have achieved in the short amount of time given the amount of change we have experienced our businesses continue to have relatively healthy backlogs we believe they support revenue growth in the upcoming year and most importantly i am very pleased with what our employees have done you know every day they they put themselves in a situation where they have delivered on they have delivered on whatever they can to deliver on our commitments and deliver to our customers under some very adverse circumstances as we look to support the 1st responders in our country so i am very pleased and want to thank them publicly for what they have done and with that i think we will hold it over and have a q a with an open mic so thank you if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue and for participants choosing speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your hand set before pressing the star keys please ask one question and one follow up question and then requeue for additional questions our 1st question is from hey jerry thanks what really stood out was the margin performance in the rv business and you alluded to mix helping i am wondering if we just stepped through you know we are looking at the year over year margin expand much of that was improved productivity how much of that was pricing and do we think about the mix tailwind as being sustainable from here yeah jerry as as i said in the in the my my prepared remarks you know the mix really helps us and i think we have always said that you know outside of class a those are our double digit performing businesses so when we look at the mix there our mix was down and on class a and we really had two things helping us so from a tailwind perspective the fact that we had a larger mix in those more profitable businesses of being the class bcs and tobbles and class a actually had a high concentration of diesel product within the quarter which is more profitable than the gas product so so even though we say covid a lot of the furniture issues we have had that we talked about previously were on our gas units lines and so even within class a we had a margin pick up from the concentration of diesel within the quarter which we would expect to more flatten out to a reasonable normalized it is going forward and of course as class a continues to develop it will get more to the 4060 sort of split that we traditionally have seen within that group so it really is just a matter of the amount that we sold within those other product categories plus the mix benefit and of course as you saw within our rv itself the productivity improvements that they had drove a you know significant part of that 650 basis point improvement their sales growth was really good sorry please go ahead yeah i was saying that sales were actually down here on year right so they actually were able to deliver a profit that was a quarter versus last though that was the majority of that benefit was from productivity okay and then firing emergency nice to see oka turned the corner can you talk about how the production rates have continued into december have you continued to ramp higher or was it a forty increase and increase essentially gets you to the normalized run rate and when do we see from an accounting standpoint the lower per unit costs flowing through to the full extent well i do think this is right we have made considerable progress in in that location but there s still opportunity for us to even do much better there so we as as mark mentioned in his earlier discussion that we ve gotten back to more of a standard industry lead times we continue to work on throughput on both arrows and pumpers in that plant so we believe there is opportunities for continued market expansion through productivity so while we are we are pleased with the path we are on and and we are seeing this thing move and be able to get look at our backlog and get to what we think is a more of our standard lead time we still believe there is opportunities to improve our efficiencies in that plant and get a market and get market expansion in that business so that is just work in front of us so question is from jamie cook with credit sets please proceed hi good morning i guess a couple questions one i think you noted on the commercial side you expected to see growth year over year just a clarification i am assuming that is you know normalized for the divest share so look at sort of the 90000000 quarterly run rate when you are talking in direct about growth and i guess just my 2nd question can you just give more color obviously the outlook on the on the bus side or the school bus side i think that you know this is right you know the feedback we have from from in markets or from dealer partners is that you know the whole thing uncertainty around school openings or schools it is hard to plan for i think that is the that is pretty clear that people want to go back to school that that makes promise we have got a couple of things there i think could be tailwinds to help us get where we need to be but we are going to know i think about the time we get to get together in april we are going to know more we are going to know how that shapes up but right now they are just too much uncertainty for us to look forward and project what that school bus market is going to look like not knowing what the impacts of covid is going to be until so we see the the success rate on this virus and what that looks like and and then and further moving into the into the spring when our you know we typically see april may being when we start getting significant orders and deliveries so that will be a timeframe we are going to know but right now it is it is not clear it is just it is tremendous i am sorry everybody is kind of awaiting that that that time period so  sorry and then just the the commentary on revenues for commercial assuming it excludes the divestitures so look at the 90000000 quarterly run rate and then my last question how to think about the corporate expense line you know as as we look to to 2021 any color there thanks and the corporate of course a parts was part of the centralized so that 5000000 drops right to the corporate line so you could see that 5000000 drop that is where that was traditionally shown to a centralized parts business okay great thank you yeah thank you our next question is from courtney yecovnis with morgan stanley please proceed hi thanks good morning guys just morning courtney back on the  comment you know appreciate that yeah there will be a mixed shift in recreation next year i think you said do you expect you know in line with the industry wholesale shipments up about twenty but i think you had said that you were expecting mid single digit margins and i think we have historically been seeing more high single digit out of that segment so just wanted to make sure i i fully understood what you yeah what you were thinking the mixed shift impact would have on on 2021 you know that it has been week for some time now yeah we have we have traditionally seen mid single digits so you know what we determine as mid right five to five to seven so that is probably in line with what we have historically done but the mixed shift really is what i referred to with jerry is question is again now at forty of our sales being in the  rv or our class a business you know those as you know are depressed margins so those bring down the ones that are a double digit from a run rate perspective so it is really the fact that our revenue our what we call our revenue our class a was actually down from a mix so as they come more to the forty to fifty range there were forty in the quarter versus fifty in the prior year so you had a ten drop there from a mix perspective and so it is really that that simple as far as looking at the other three businesses that we have in that portfolio at double digit and bringing in a lower single digit mix from class a will actually decrease those ten down to more of the five to seven range okay that is helpful and then any more specificity you could give us just on commercial and ethny margins as we think about impacting next year obviously appreciating that it is going to be dependent on your delivery schedule but any high level thoughts on on the margin side from that whole commercial side but obviously on the capacity if you are talking about capacity that is you know that is one we are still with the backlog here so as i said my prepared remarks we took the opportunity to a lot of the units that we had developed it coming into the what our normal selling season is did not develop but exiting the quarter we are very happy with some of the progress we made and our backlog is now performing so we should see the the variability get out of there but we we would look at the total commercial segment we would expect the high single sort of what we were expecting coming in a quarter if we would not have had the issues that we experienced on the commercial side and the liquidation that we did on some of those stock units so we would expect it to get more like we guided to last time more in the mid or the high single digits for the commercial segment that has the most variability or you are most concerned about versus the ones that are or that you feel most confident in the delivery schedules for next year just just so we can get a sense of of where the real risk is and by categories you mean the business units or the product categories you know where you have the most certainty you know versus some of the product lines and in fmcg i think that you know the and i will mark comment that mark can clean up what i say i think that when you think about in markets that are affected by the the the issues i think primarily obviously in market demand in the  in the school bus businesses is the is the issue all the businesses that are subject to some level of of supplier supplier issues that we are dealing with i think  rv is probably the one that we have seen the most stockouts which is pretty consistent across the industry the other element that we deal with a little bit which is the timing issue and not a impact probably within the fiscal year is just the inspections that have to take place in ambulances and fire around getting a bus off the lot or or i sorry a truck or ambulances off the lot related to completing final inspections by getting people to the site that is a real issue that we have we have been dealing with in in terms of you know revenue recognition because that has it certainly is it is it is in market demand there are some some supplier issues that are spread throughout that we have been able to overcome for the most part but there are they they do pop up and and we have to work through that and then and then the last thing would be the businesses that are subject to inspections which is you know your your emergency segment is where we see that at mark i do not know if you want to add anything but i think that is right i think as we said previously one of the things that we thought would happen here we expected that more people would adopt virtual inspections for our ambulance and fire trucks and as exiting covid our customers have come back to wanting to see their trucks in person and what has been resurgent here is resurgence here we are hoping that they will go back to virtual but we have shifted back to wanting to do in person inspections so we have not seen them going back to virtual so obviously there is some flux there if people would go back to virtual as we are back to our traditional as roderick referred to actually seeing the units before they leave the the yard so that we can revenue them and that is really the delays that i was speaking to of it is really our customers coming in and inspecting the units and approving them for shipment as a reminder to star one on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question our next question from a fire perspective obviously as rod is we are still in the multiple ending journey here so as he referred to on the e one we still have a lot of work to do we are seeing progression but of course we have other facilities within the portfolio too that we are going to address as i sent in my prepared remarks so we are still expecting to be in the double digits at the end of this journey but we are still working through that right so of course we are not given guidance here but again it is still in a multiple year perspective to get to that ten so just happy to see the progression here that we have seen throughout the quarter and obviously our our forward looking will provide more guidance in in april yeah i think that actually there is you know when you think about operational improvements and and and how you walk down that what marker church is a multi intergenerational it when you come into the role you see there is there is some quick things you can do to get pop and get an improvement and then it is about building capabilities and i mentioned from an operational excellence standpoint you know standing up the lean capabilities and and and center lead type activities that get implemented in the plants around  ci around purchasing building engineering capabilities to get it design cost through ve those are things that that you got to do for capability building but the the good thing is is that it is a continual improvement continually improving process where you are going to be getting at that every day by building pipelines to go execute again so we are in the process right now coming out of our operating model discussion of  standing up up and building out those teams and doing the certifications that mark talked about through lean that are going to yield benefit to us for a very very long time things that did did not exist now we are we are standing up those capabilities and bringing on rob to lead our purchasing organization and get focused on that significant spend i think it is going to yield great benefit to us too so those those will all contribute to a margin expansion story not only in emergency but across the business and so that is  but but it does take work to stand it up it but starts with organizing good morning guys a quick question on chasities is is you are looking at your your capability building and then driving it through process rigor each each day each week each month are there any portions of your business where you are getting a sense that you are having either challenges obtaining chassis or the delivery timelines are extended and and look i mean i am i am thinking specifically around ambulances and in some of the stuff for recreation as well like you know class b is and so on yeah no omega i am glad to say and we we were not experiencing those in fact you know we have and we have had we have a pretty good supply chain from that perspective so i was happy this quarter not to be talking about chassis shortages for once even though it is only my 2nd one so i know you have heard that consistently so we have been very happy with that in fact you know in the rv side especially we you know we took advantage of what the  run rates were going to be and actually ordered ahead so we are actually sitting with plenty of chassis from that perspective and in that business and then on the ambulance side we have not had any ok that is helpful and then maybe my my follow up sort of sticking with with the theme how do you think about steel prices and raw material inflation in 2020 2021 what are some of the steps that you are taking to mitigate those because obviously historically this has been a big issue we are reaching some trouble in prior years thank you yes so i mean obviously on the parts of our business which large part of our business is build out of backlog you know there there is always the the issue you are trying to offset inflation with your your efficiency efforts because you you have purchased processes established on a backlog based business so we are managing that obviously a big part of what what rob is efforts is going to be is is to look at new purchasing to be able to offset offset that within a fiscal fiscal year we can cycle through and get the margins that we need on a price cost basis but so it is it is a lot around driving efficiency to make sure that that we are doing everything we can to optimize our cost structure to to have any leakage that does come through inflation into a backlog based business we can offset through other other means and mark i do not know if you want anything to that or but i think that is right and that is one of the things that i am working personally with rob on make sure we understand those inflationary factors as we go through 2021 as well as our agreements with our supply base that is one of the things that the robins can acclimated to and there is obviously heightened focus in those businesses where we do not have the longer backlogs we obviously come out with some price increases as our competitors have so we are managing that with the supply base as well as our our customers i do think eleven of the things you know one of the things we are working on is is trying to get in front of how we think about price price as a function of inflation and to make sure when you think about a price increase or setting a price that is what we are working on most of our businesses have done that to some degree but that is just something i think that we have got to get great around because when you are working on a backlog based business and you are doing selling forward projection on deliveries you have got to be thinking about the inflationary times that you are in and making sure that you are you are costing that vehicle such that by the time you are doing deliveries it has been built i think based on the data we have now relative to price cost the efficiency efforts that we have gotten the business should as a reminder to start one on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question we will pause for a brief moment to pull for a final question there are no more questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to rod for closing comments okay great well thank you again for joining and i appreciate the questions and again i want to take a moment as we close out of fiscal year here and in a nine month period for for myself and then think about all the changes that we have made both in process and structure and people to thank our team for for what has been a pretty whirlwind year considering all the external factors that we have had to deal with situations that all of us have dealt with on top of that new leadership coming in and expecting to do things a different way and and maybe change some thinking i want to compliment our leadership team and also thank our our front line employees and and what they have done to serve our customers and also serve this nation in getting these necessary vehicles out and out to our communities so again i appreciate your time today i look forward to seeing you all in april when we will have a deeper discussion around what we are taking this business going forward have a great to have a great day have a great weekend thank you thank you this does conclude today is conference you may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation",

to miston mister brandon lohse please go ahead sir good morning and thank you for joining us on our gas 3rd quarter 2020 earnings conference call this call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available later today after our prepared remarks we will be happy to take your questions a reminder that these statements made during this call that might include one gas expectations and predictions should be considered forward looking statements and are covered under the safe harbor provision of the securities acts of 1933 and 1934 actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements and include among others statements about the length and severity of a pandemic or other health crisis such as the outbreak of covid nineteen for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ please refer to our sec filings joining us on the call this morning are pierce norton president and chief executive officer caron lawhorn senior vice president and chief financial officer curtis dinan senior vice president and chief commercial officer and sid mcannally senior vice president and chief operating officer and now i will turn the call over to caron thanks brandon good morning everyone yesterday we announced that we updated our 2020 financial guidance with net income and earnings per diluted share expected to be near the upper end of the ranges which are $186000000 to $198000000 for net income and $three44 to $three68 for earnings per share our guidance for capital expenditures and asset removal costs remain $500000000 to $525000000 for the year turning to our actual results net income for the 3rd quarter was $21100000 or ¢39 per diluted share compared with $17500000 or ¢33 per diluted share in the same period 2019 our 3rd quarter results reflect an increase in net margin of $5200000 over the same period last year which primarily due to $3700000 from new rates and $2700000 in residential sales from net residential customer growth operating costs for the 3rd quarter were up $800000 higher compared to the same period last year this includes an increase of $1800000 in expenses related to our response to the covid nineteen pandemic and a $1500000 increase in employee related costs offsetting a portion of those cost increases is a reduction in expenses of dollars for travel and employee training costs that have been impacted by the pandemic we have not recorded any regulatory assets for financial accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting orders received in all jurisdictions that allow us to defer for regulatory purposes certain net increases in expenses and lost revenues due to covid nineteen we continue to evaluate whether amounts expected to be recoverable under the accounting orders are both measurable and probable of recovery and we will record such amounts for financial accounting purposes when we meet that hurdle our guidance for 2020 does not assume that we will report any regulatory assets by the end of the year our capital expenditures and asset removal costs decreased this quarter compared with the 3rd quarter last year simply due to timing yesterday the one gas board of directors declared a dividend of ¢54 per share authorized rate base reflecting our recent regulatory activity is approximately $3710000000 as of september the 30th authorized rate base is defined as the rate base reflected in completed regulatory proceedings including full rate cases and interim rate filings we project that for 2020 our estimated average rate base which is defined as authorized rate base plus additional investments in our system and other changes in the components of our rate base that are not yet reflected in approved regulatory filings will be approximately $3910000000 with 42 of that in oklahoma 29 in kansas and 29 in texas we ended the quarter with adequate liquidity which includes approximately $391000000 of capacity in our commercial paper program and all of the capacity under our $250000000 364 day credit facility additionally as of september the 30th 2020 we have issued approximately $13000000 of equity under the $250000000 at the market equity program we put in place earlier this year we have no plans to issue equity for the remainder of 2020 now i will turn it over to curtis for our regulatory and commercial update thank you caron and good morning everyone 1st i will provide an overview of recent regulatory activity and then provide an update on our commercial activities kansas gas service filed a gas system reliability surcharge or gsrs that seeks an increase in rate approximately $7500000 for capital expenditures incurred during the period covering july 2019 through june 2020 an order from the kcc is expected in december 2020 with new rates going into effect in january texas gas service filed a rate case in december 2019 for all customers in the central texas and gulf coast service areas seeking a rate increase and requesting to consolidate the two service areas in august the railroad commission approved all terms of a $10300000 settlement as well as consolidation of the central texas service area and the gulf coast service area into a n central gulf service this is a continuation of our strategy to consolidate jurisdictions which is a benefit to customers due primarily to a more process with this latest consolidation we now have five jurisdictions in texas down from ten at the time of spin off in 2014 moving on to our commercial activities during our 2nd quarter analyst call i discussed the return to normal business levels for a couple of our large transport customers that temporarily curtailed operations at the start of the pandemic and that we were not seeing any other significant disruptions with our transport customers for the 3rd quarter 2020 our transport revenues and volumes were above the same period in 2019 and on a year to date comparison between years our transport revenues have erased the 2nd quarter 2020 impact and are now flat year over year we continue to see strong interest in natural gas from builders and developers capital spending to ex extend our service to reach new customers is the primary driver behind our increased capital expenditures guidance for 2020 as we described last quarter despite the pandemic we are seeing positive economic signs across our footprint particularly in texas and oklahoma as an example in the austin area there have been over 100 new business relocations or expansions announced thus far in 2020 which are expected to provide over 14000 additional new jobs this increase in economic activity across our territories has resulted in continued growth in our customer base year to date we have averaged approximately 24000 more sales customers than the same period last year this increase includes the connection of 18600 new customers compared with 14600 new customers in the same period last year or a 27 increase over last year is pace as i described during our last two quarterly analyst calls the impact of the on disconnects for non payment by our customers which expired in may in oklahoma and kansas and early october in some areas of texas has also impacted our average customer counts and now i will turn it over to sid for an update on operations thanks curtis our team in the field continues to adapt well to the current environment with maintenance and compliance work on or ahead of schedule our supply chain remains uninterrupted and we see no forward constraints to our planned work thanks to steady performance by our resource management team related to materials and contractor resources as caron mentioned while our capital spend was lower this quarter than the 3rd quarter of last year the issue is timing rather than performance we have been pleased with the cadence of capital execution year to date with more consistent capital spend quarter to quarter than last year due to favorable weather and improved planning by our asset management engineering and field operations teams we remain on track to meet our capital expenditure guidance as discussed earlier and now i will turn it over to pierce thank you caron curtis and and sid the pandemic has changed many things for many people our homes have become the place where we spend more and more time our customers take comfort in the warmth of our that our product provides especially as we head into colder weather as we near the end of the year it is natural to reflect on how we how far we have come for me three things standout our resiliency adaptability and commitment to safety our performance this year demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the continued value of natural gas as a preferred energy source for homes and businesses this year we were able to grow our customer base improve system integrity and established a remote workforce amidst great adversity despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic our industry is accustomed to front line response across our organization we quickly implemented additional safety protocols and new processes designed to keep our employees and our customers safe during the pandemic thanks to the adaptability and diligence of each employee we have continued providing service to our customers with minimal disruptions finally in closing i would like to recognize the one gas employees and give each of them a special thank you for their continued professionalism under stress resolve when there is no clear end in sight and poise in the face of uncertainty we will get through this pandemic by relying on the values that we anchor our company to as we address the challenges and that face our business thank you all for joining us this morning operator we are now ready for questions all right if you would like to ask a question you may signal by pressing one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speaker phone please make sure you are mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again that is one to ask a question and we will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal all right and the 1st question is from richard ciciarelli with bank of america hey good morning can you hear me okay we can good morning richard hey thanks for taking my question i was just curious how you guy are are thinking about covid in into peak winter heating season here and i realize ogs has the higher proportion of residential versus c i transport customers but how are you thinking about factoring the lingering impact especially with the resurgence of cases as you begin to look at your 2021 outlook and the moving pieces and maybe just also comment on the equity needs into next year as well richard it is sid let me start and throw to curtis for the commercial part of that question and then caron can come in on the end in terms of the financing question we have been preparing for winter since march we understood that there was a high probability that we would see a 2nd wave and that we would see some co mingling of covid and the flu so our medical protocols were built with that in mind we have not seen constraints in our service territories and our employees have done a remarkable job of proactively participating in our medical program to make sure that we could provide them with the best medical advice to keep them and their families and our customers safe but also to allow us to tamp down any widespread unavailability of employees in any of our service territories so we feel like we are well prepared we do not say that spike in the ball on the fifty we recognize that there is a challenging time ahead of us but we think we are as well prepared as we can be so let me toss to curtis to respond to the commercial question so richard on the commercial side of things as you know we have a very high percent of our of our customer base being residential and then about twelve that is our transport customers so one of the things that i noted in my comments is that we are really not seeing an impact at this point from our transport customers so we have seemed to have returned to a normal level of operations and have actually closed the gap with the activity we saw in the 3rd quarter closing the gap from what we saw during the 2nd quarter of this year on the residential side of things i think we are well prepared in our customer call centers to pre to handle the call volume that we typically run into this time of the year one of the good things about the moratoriums being lifted when they were the end of may for oklahoma and kansas and a little bit later in texas is that while those moratoriums were in place sid is operations teams were able to divert those resources to handle a lot of our other normal annual activities and to get some of those things get ahead of those activities such that when the moratoriums were lifted we were able to focus more of our resources on the disconnect process which helped with our collections through that period so several factors that we had to to remain agile to handle during the year but cooperation and the work between our commercial operations teams helped us work through that part of it to be ready when we could again resume disconnects and that is helped our overall process the last piece i would say is as caron talked about we do have the regulatory accounting orders in each of our jurisdictions we will continue to monitor the activities for increased expenses as well as areas where we have been able to decrease expenses so that and continue to accumulate those until we are able to go through the regulatory process to begin recovery of those so i will pick up on the financing question we have not updated our longer term guidance for financing which currently is that we anticipate $850000000 to $900000000 of net funds or with about a quarter of that being equity when we issue our guidance for 2021 which we expected to do probably sometime after the 1st of the year we will provide a closer look on what 2021 looks like okay got it that is that is very helpful appreciate all the color there and maybe just switching gears here obviously with elections on top of mind just curious how you are you are thinking about decarbonization goals and just given really some of the potential for electrification in buildings and some of the supply and cost constraints on the rng side i mean is that really the solution or or is green hydrogen potentially a more likely candidate just just maybe curious if you can provide some thoughts overall on timing and when we can see more formal adoption of these technologies another good question richard this is curtis again so on the commercial side i have talked before about efforts we have had around renewable natural gas there are several different projects and developers that we are talking to some already captured rng and use it for alternative uses what we may be able to bring to the table is the opportunity to improve the commercial economics of that captured gas so by bringing it into our system and getting it tracked through to be used as replacement for diesel or other products through compressed natural gas and so we are continuing to explore and hopefully we will be in a position that we have some of those projects as we move into next ye we have proven the commercial ability of those projects and we have established the gas standards and everything that we would need to do to bring that product into our system so again we continue to make progress on that we are also in an h two scale project with the university of texas and some other parties including the doe to run some different scale projects converting or producing hydrogen both from renewable power as well as from landfill gas and then using that that hydrogen that is produced to run a computer center at the university of texas as well as provide fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles so we are continuing to that project just started earlier in the mid part actually of 2020 so it is about a three year project but promising results come out of that i am going to turn it to sid and he can talk a little bit more about what we are doing and what we are seeing on the operations side analyzing the impact of hydrogen yeah richard thank you for the question as you know there is a commercial component to this an rnd component as you point out but there are also some practical implications that companies need to consider as as emergent opportunities like hydrogen start to be developed we have two working groups in place currently one is looking at technical issues including the engineering implications there will be policies and procedures around hydroden hydrogen use and there are also some system integrity implications to make sure that you can introduce hydrogen at the proper blending rate and handle that safely in terms of continuing to focus on safety of our system the 2nd is an a really interesting working group that is looking at the gas supply implications a hydrogen is a different material to compress and transport and so the location of manufacturing facilities comes into play we are scoping all of that right now and excited about continuing the conversation all right thanks very much for for all the color there that is all i had all right once again that is one to ask a question if you find your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing two the next question is from and i apologize if i say this incorrectly aga with ubs good morning morning aga c could you give us an update on bad debt and how is it trending this year as we head into winter sure good morning aga this is caron so we are still as curtis described some of our collections activity that is still that is still at place so we are not out of the covid impact certainly by a long stretch we currently are $8800000 at bad debt expense through the nine months that compares to $4600000 last year so we are up about $4000000 year over year and again we just work to monitor the situation we there are still mora moratoriums in place in some of the service areas and so until we get completely back to normal collections activities for an extended period of time it is going to be difficult to really determine what the impact has been and how the change in kansas related to eliminating state income taxes from rates could impact one gas cash flow going forward it is not expected to have a material impact in the scheme of things it is not a not a large in our overall tax picture the elimination of the state income tax is not a large event the last question from me to follow up on richard is question on decarbonization is there a regulatory framework in place to invest in rng across your jurisdictions we have tariffs established to potentially cover some additional costs related to investments in rng any color would be helpful sure aga this is curtis rng is actually contemplated in the tariffs in texas it is a recoverable gas cost there so that that was that has previously been contemplated as as part of the gas supply picture in oklahoma there was legislation introduced in the last session to compel the commission to study rng and to look at ways to bring rng into the oklahoma gas supply with the pandemic starting that was not a bill that was considered all the way through session but outside of that the oklahoma corporation commission has opened up a notice of inquiry looking at several different energy questions one of which is renewable natural gas and this and the way that the state and the commission should deal with that product so there are efforts under way at the at the state levels also not as much at this point in kansas but the other two states are a little bit further along in that regard thank you for the color and stay safe thank you aga all right and once again that is one to ask a question and it appears there are no further questions at this time mister lohse i would like to turn it back to you for any additional or closing remarks thank you all again for your interest in one gas our quiet period for the 4th quarter starts when we close our books in early january and extends until we release earnings in february we will provide details on the conference call later date have a great day this concludes today is call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect",

executive officer karen lahorn senior vice president and chief financial officer kurtis dykun senior vice president and chief commercial officer and sid mcinally senior vice president and chief operating officer and now i will turn the call over to karen thanks brandon good morning everyone yesterday we announced that we updated our 2220 financial guidance with net income net income for the 3rd quarter was $21100000 or ¢39 per diluted share compared with $17500000 or ¢55 per diluted share in the same period last year our 3rd quarter results reflect an increase in net margin of $5200000 over the same period last year which primarily due to $3700000 from new rates and $2700000 in residential sales from net residential customer growth operating costs for the 3rd quarter were $800000 higher compared to the same period last year this includes an increase of 1800000 in expenses related to our marketing and advertising programs response to the covid nineteen pandemic and a 1500000 increase in employee related costs offsetting a portion of those cost increases is a reduction in expenses of dollars for travel and employee training costs that have been impacted by the pandemic we have not recorded any regulatory assets for financial accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting orders received in all jurisdictions that allow us to defer for regulatory purposes certain net increases in expenses and lost revenue due to covid nineteen we continue to evaluate whether amounts expected to be recoverable under these accounting orders are both measurable and probable of recovery and will record such amounts for financial accounting purposes when we meet that hurdle our guidance for 2020 does not assume that we will record any regulatory assets by the end of the year our capital expenditures and asset removal costs decreased this quarter compared with the 3rd quarter last year simply due to timing yesterday the one governance board of directors declared a dividend of ¢54 per share authorized rebasse reflecting a recent regulatory activity is approximately $3710000000 as of september 30th authorized rebasse is defined as the rate base reflected in completed regulatory proceedings including full rate cases and interim rate filing additional investments in our system and other changes in the components of our rate base that are not yet reflected in approved regulatory filings will be approximately $3910000000 with 42 of that in oklahoma 29 in kansas and 29 in texas we ended the quarter with adequate liquidity which includes approximately $391000000 of capacity in our commercial paper program and all of the capacity under our $250000000 364 day credit facility additionally as a result of the consolidation of our commercial paper program with our industrial loan company our commercial paper program will no longer be reflected in our rate base we have issued approximately $13000000 of equity under the $250000000 at the market equity program we put in place earlier this year we have no plans to issue at this time for the remainder of 2020 now alternative decurs for our regulatory and commercial updates thank you karen and good morning everyone 1st i will provide an overview of recent regulatory activity and then provide an update on our commercial activities kansas gas service filed a gas system good morning this is a message from the texas gas service regarding an increase in rates approximately $7500000 for capital expenditures incurred during the period covering july 1019 through june 2020 in order from the kcc it is expected in december 2020 with new rates going into effect in january texas gas service father rate case in december nineteen for all customers in central texas this is a continuation of our strategy to consolidate jurisdictions in august the railroad commission approved all terms of a $13000000 settlement as well as consolidation of the central texas service area and the gulf coast service area into a new central gulf service area customers benefit to customers due primarily to a more efficient process with this latest consolidation we now have five jurisdictions in texas down from ten at the time of spin off in 2014 moving on to our commercial activities during our 2nd quarter analyst call i discussed the return to normal business levels for a couple of our large clients good afternoon this is the ceo of xyz transport speaking due to the pandemic our operations were temporarily curtailed but we are now back to normal we have not seen any other significant disruptions with our transport customers for the 3rd quarter of 2020 our transport revenues and volumes were above the same period in 2019 and on a year to date comparison between years our transport revenues have erased the 2nd quarter 2020 impact and are now flat year over year thank you we continue to see strong interest in natural gas from builders and developers capital spending to extend our service to reach new customers is the primary driver behind our increased capital expenditures guidance for 2020 as we described last quarter despite the pandemic we are seeing positive economic signs across our footprint particularly in texas and oklahoma as an example in the austin area as of this date over 100 new business relocations or expansions have been announced thus far in 2020 which are expected to provide over 14000 additional new jobs this increase in economic activity across our territories has resulted in continued growth in our customer base year to date we have averaged approximately 24000 more sales customers than the same period last year this increase includes the sale of the company is shares 18600 new customers compared with 14600 new customers in the same period last year or a 27 increase over last year is pace as i described during our last two quarterly analyst calls the impact of the moratoria on disconnects for non payment by our customers which expired in may in oklahoma and kansas and early october in some areas of texas our average customer count has also impacted our average customer count and now i will turn it over to sid for an update on operations thanks curtis our team in the field continues to adapt well to the current environment with maintenance and compliance work on or ahead of schedule our supply chain remains uninterrupted and we see no forward constraints to our planned work thanks to steady performance by our resource management team related to materials and contractor support as karen mentioned while our capital spend was lowered this quarter than the 3rd quarter of last year the issue is timing rather than performance we have been pleased with the cadence of capital execution year to date with more consistent capital spend quarter to quarter than last year due to favorable weather and improved planning by our asset management engineering and field operations teams we remain on track to meet our capital expenditure guidance as discussed earlier and now i will turn it over to peer three things stand out our resiliency adaptability and commitment to safety our performance this year demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the continued value of natural gas as a preferred energy source for homes and businesses this year we were able to grow our customer base improve system integrity and establish a remote workforce amidst great adversity despite the finally in closing i would like to recognize the challenges brought on by the pandemic our industry is accustomed to front line response across our organization we quickly implemented additional safety protocols and new processes designed to keep our employees and our customers safe during the pandemic thanks to the adaptability and diligence of each employee we have continued providing service to our customers with minimal disruptions finally in closing i would like to recognize the hard work and dedication of our employees during these unprecedented times thank you all for joining us this morning operator we are now ready for questions alright if you would like to ask a question you may signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again that is star one to ask a question and we will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal hello and the 1st question is from richard ciccarelli with bank of america hey good morning can you hear me okay we can hear you okay hey thanks for taking my question i am just curious how you guys are thinking about covid into peak winter heating season here and i realize ogs has a higher proportion of residential versus cni transport customers but how are you how are you thinking about that factoring the lingering impact especially with the resurgence of cases as you begin to look at your 2021 outlook and the moving pieces and maybe just also comment on the equity needs into next year as well richard it said let me start and go to curtis for the commercial part of that question and then karen can come in on the end in terms of the financing question we have been preparing for winter since march we understood that there was a high probability that we would see a 2nd wave and that we would see some commingling of covid and the flu so our medical protocols were built with that in mind we have not seen constraints in our service territories and our employees have done a remarkable job of proactively participating in our medical program to make sure that we could provide them with the best medical advice to keep them and their we feel like we are well prepared we do not say that spike in the ball on the fifty we recognize that there is a challenging time ahead of us but we think we are as well prepared as we can be so let me toss to curtis to respond to the commercial question as so richard on on the commercial side of things we have a very high percent of our of our customer base being residential and then about twelve that is our transport customers so one of the things that i noted in my comments is that we are really not seeing an impact at this point from our transport customers so we seem to have returned to a normal level of operations and i have actually closed the gap with the activity we saw in the 3rd quarter  closing the gap from what we saw during the the 2nd quarter i am on the residential side of things i think we are well prepared in our customer call centers to handle the call volume that we typically run into this time of the year one of the good things about the moratoriums being lifted when they were at the end of may for oklahoma and kansas and a little bit later in texas is that while those moratoriums were in place operations teams were able to divert those resources several factors that we had to to remain agile to handle during the year but cooperation and the work between our commercial operations teams helped us so through that part of it to be ready when we could again resume disconnects and that helped our overall process the last piece i would say is as karen talked about we do have the regulatory accounting orders in each of our jurisdictions i will continue to monitor the activities for increased expenses as well as areas where we have been able to decrease expenses so that and and continue to accumulate those until we are able to go through the regulatory process for the start of recovery our financial process to begin recovery of those i will pick up on the financing question we have not updated our longer term guidance for financing which currently is that we anticipate 850 to $900000000 of net present value worth with about a quarter of that being equity when we issue our guidance for 2021 which we expect to do probably sometime in the 1st of the year we will provide a closer look on what 2021 looks like okay got it that is that that is very helpful appreciate all the color there and maybe just switching gears here obviously with the elections on top of mine just curious how you are you are thinking about decarbonization goals and just giving really some of the potential for electrification and buildings and some of the supply and cost constraints and the r and d side i mean is that really the solution or or is green hydrogen potentially a more likely candidate just just maybe curious if you can provide some thoughts overall on timing and when we can see more formal adoption of these technologies another good question richard this is curtis again so on the on the commercial side i have talked before about efforts we have had around renewable natural gas there are several different projects and developers that we are talking to some already capture r and g and use it for alternative uses what we may be able to bring to the table to so the table is the opportunity to improve the commercial economics of that capture gas so by bringing it into our system and getting it tracked through to be used as a replacement for diesel or other products through compressed natural gas and so we are continuing to explore and hopefully it will be in a position that we have some of those projects as we move into next year we have proven the commercial viability ability of those projects and we have established the gas standards and everything that we would need to do to bring that product into our systems so again we continue to make progress on that we are also in an h two at scale project with the university of texas and other parties putting the dole to run some different scale projects of converting or producing hydrogen both from renewable power as well as from land fill gas and then using that that hydrogen that is produced to run a computer center at the university of texas as well as provide fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles so we are continuing to that project just started earlier in the mid part of 2020 so it is about a three year project but promising results to come out of that and then i am going to turn it to sid and he can talk a little bit more about what we are doing and what we are seeing on that project but there are also some practical implications that companies need to consider as as emergent opportunities like hydrogen start to be developed we have two working groups in place currently one is looking at technical issues including the engineering implications you know there will be policies and procedures around hydrogen hydrogen use and there are also some system integrity implications to make sure that you can introduce hydrogen at the proper blending rate and handle that safely in terms of continuing to focus on safety of our system the 2nd is and a really interesting working group that is looking at the gas supply implications hydrogen is a different material to all right thanks very much for for all the color there that is all i have alright once again that is star one to ask a question if you find your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two the next question is from and i apologize if i say this incorrectly aage a magorza with ubs good morning aage could you give us an update on bed bug and how is it trending this year as we head into winter so we are still and sort of describe some of our collections activity that is still still at play so we are not out of the the covid impact certainly by a long stretch we currently are 8800000 at bad debt expense through the nine months that compares to $4600000 last year so we are up about 4000000 year over year and again we just are working to monitor the situation we  there are we have moratoriums in place in some of the service areas and so until we get completely back to normal collection activities for an extended period of time it is going to be difficult to really determine what the impact has been and how the change in kansas relates to eliminating state income taxes from rates could impact wine excise taxes going forward i do not expect to have a material impact in the scheme of things it is not  not a large the elimination of state income tax is not a large event the 2nd question to follow up on research question on the carbonization is there a regular framework in place to invest in r and d across your jurisdictions we have tariffs established to potentially cover some additional costs related to investments in r and d in r and d and a carbon tax would be helpful this is curtis it is actually considered in the tariffs in texas it is a a recoverable gas cost there so that that was that has previously been contemplated as as part of the gas supply picture in oklahoma there was legislation introduced in the last session to compel the commission to study r and g and to look at ways to to bring r and g into the oklahoma gas supply with the pandemic starting that was not a bill that was considered all the way through session but outside of that the oklahoma corporation commission has opened up a notice of inquiry looking at several different energy questions one of which is renewable natural gas and the and the way that the state and the commission should deal with that product so there are efforts underway at the at the state levels also not as much at this point in kansas but the other two states are a little bit further along in that regard thank you for the caller and stay safe and it appears there are no further questions at this time mister loci i would like to turn it back to you for any additional or closing remarks disconnect",

jean marc thanks ryan good morning good afternoon everyone and thank you for your interest in constellium let us turn to slide five at constellium the health and safety of our employees is our 1st priority we have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees in response to the covid nineteen pandemic we have provided our personnel with personal protective equipment increased cleaning and sanitation allowed for and enforced social distancing and work to raise awareness with our employees i want to personally thank our employees for taking this seriously and following the precautions we have put into place as of last friday approximately one half of one of our employees have tested positive for covid nineteen and all of whom have recovered or are recovering needless to say we must remain vigilant during the 2nd quarter our plants operated well despite the significant disruptions to customer demand from lockdowns in both europe and the us as i am speaking all our plants are running now and well we are carefully monitoring covid nineteen hotspots both for the health of our employees and any potential impacts on supply chain the demand for our products gradually increased during the course of the 2nd quarter and this trend has continued into july however both levels of demand and visibility from our customers remain below historical levels we took strong actions to combat the effects of the pandemic on our business we aggressively reduced our costs including selecting variable costs to match production levels reducing fixed costs and lowering our targeted capital expenditures over forty of our workforce were on some type of partial unemployment or temporary layoff scheme during the quarter where appropriate we have also implemented permanent headcount reduction our ability to flex costs was slightly better than the scenario we provided last quarter this was a great achievement by the entire constellium team and demonstrated our flexibility and resilience our liquidity at the end of the quarter was €949000000 an increase of over €300000000 compared to the end of the 1st quarter we added an additional €50000000 of liquidity in july through credit facilities supported by the german state bringing our pro forma liquidity to approximately €1000000000 in june we accessed the debt market to refinance our 2021 bonds this transaction removed are only near term bond maturity at a very attractive coupon in conclusion with the significant actions we have taken i am very confident in our ability to navigate through this crisis on slide six you will see some of our highlights from 2nd quarter of 202 shipments were 310000 metric tons with a decrease of 25 compared to the 2nd quarter of 201 revenue decreased 33 to €1000000000 of the roughly €500000000 decline in revenue compared to the 2nd quarter of last year two thirds was related to lower shipments and 13rd was related to lower metal prices i will remind you that when our revenues are affected by changes in metal prices we operate a pass through business model to minimize middle risk net loss of €32000000 compared to net income of €17000000 in the 2nd quarter of 201 adjusted ebitda of €81000000 decreased 51 compared to the 2nd quarter of 201 with a strong focus on cost control we are able to offset a significant part of the volume headwinds to adjusted ebitda across each of our business units i am proud of what the team was able to achieve in a challenging environment constellium generated €228000000 of adjusted ebitda in the 1st half a decline of 24 compared to the 1st six months of last year our free cash flow was negative €33000000 in the 2nd quarter of 202 these results would not have been possible without our strong actions to reduce costs and capital expenditures and cash expenditures of all sorts our free cash flow for the 1st half of 2020 was €54000000 based on our current view of market conditions we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 202 i will now hand over to peter to discuss our financial performance in more detail peter thank you jean marc and thank you everyone for joining the call today turning now to slide eight you will find the change in adjusted ebitda by segments for the 2nd quarter in the 1st half of 2020 compared to the same periods of last year for the 2nd quarter of 2020 constellium achieved €81000000 of adjusted ebitda a decrease of €86000000 or 51 year over year parp adjusted ebitda of €58000000 decreased by €21000000 or 27 compared to last year a t adjusted ebitda of €31000000 decreased by €33000000 or 51 compared to the 2nd quarter of 201 as i adjusted ebitda of negative €1000000 decreased by €31000000 compared to last year lastly holdings and corporate costs of €7000000 were €1000000 higher than last year in the 1st six months of 2020 constellium achieved €228000000 of adjusted ebitda a decrease of €74000000 or 24 year over year parp adjusted ebitda of €124000000 decreased by €14000000 or eleven compared to last year a t adjusted ebitda of €83000000 decreased by €33000000 or 28 compared to the 1st six months of 201 as i adjusted ebitda of €33000000 decreased by €26000000 or 44 compared to last year lastly holdings and corporate costs of €12000000 were €1000000 higher than last year we expect agency costs of approximately €20000000 in 202 now turn to slide nine and let us focus on the parp segment adjusted ebitda of €58000000 decreased 27 compared to the 2nd quarter of last year volume was a headwind of €41000000 in the quarter packaging shipments fell by twelve primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in march of our neuf brisach plant in france due to covid nineteen shipments to the north american can sheet market increased slightly year over year automotive shipments declined 54 compared to last year as many of our automotive oem customers curtailed production for april and most of may price and mix was a headwind of €2000000 costs were a tailwind of €21000000 due to strong broad based cost control with labor and maintenance as important contributors metal costs were neutral in the quarter as we face difficult year over year comp ubc supply chain challenges and lower metal prices fx translation was a tailwind of €1000000 now now turn to slide one let us focus on the a t segment adjusted ebitda of €31000000 decreased by 51 compared to last year volume was a headwind of €46000000 on lower aerospace and tid shipments aerospace shipments fell 37 compared to last year as aerospace oems and distributors began to reduce orders tid shipments declined by twenty due to lower industrial activity in both europe and the us price and mix was a €3000000 headwind due to lower aerospace shipments costs were a tailwind of €15000000 due to strong broad based cost control with labor metals and maintenance as important contributors lastly fx translation was a €1000000 tailwind in the quarter now turn to slide eleven and let us focus on the as i segment adjusted ebitda of negative €1000000 decreased by €31000000 compared to the 2nd quarter of 201 volume was a €31000000 headwind automotive shipments declined 52 compared to last year due to customer shutdowns for a significant portion of the quarter industry shipments declined sixteen due to lower active industrial activity in europe price and mix was a €9000000 headwinds partially due to price and mix as a consequence of weaker market condition costs were a €9000000 tailwind on strong cost control with labor energy and fixed costs as important contributors lastly fx translation was a €1000000 headwind in the quarter now turning to slide twelve i want to highlight our very strong cost performance during the 2nd quarter in the 2nd quarter we managed to flex our costs by 83 cost flex represents the change of cost over the change of revenues for the 2nd quarter of 2020 compared to the 2nd quarter of 201 effectively for every dollar change in revenue we were able to flex our cost by ¢83 this compares favorably to the 75 variable cost estimate we provided last quarter at the bottom of the page you can see that each of our businesses demonstrated strong cost control with parp at 92 cost flex and a t and as i at 75 to put this in context excluding metal and depreciation we reduced costs by approximately €100000000 compared to the 2nd quarter of last year these cost savings were driven by strong cost control across the businesses including labor maintenance professional fees subcontractors and energy i will note that our 2nd quarter 2020 figures include approximately a €15000000 benefit from european state employment aid related to covid nineteen i want to congratulate the team for the aggressive actions taken on costs we will continue to maintain our strong focus on cost control particularly given the uncertain demand environment now let us turn to slide thirteen and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the 2nd quarter our leverage was fourfour times and our net debt was €2200000000 slightly lower than our net debt position at the end of 201 we remain very committed to capital discipline we reduced our 2020 capex target to approximately €175000000 a €96000000 reduction from 201 through the 1st half of 2020 we have spent €32000000 less in capex than in the same period of last year our free cash flow for the 2nd quarter was negative €33000000 during the quarter as a consequence of lower activity our factored receivables were lower than the levels that we have maintained in recent quarters and negatively impacted our free cash flow by €73000000 we would expect the reverse to occur as activity levels increase excluding the impact of factoring the company actually generated positive free cash flow in the 2nd quarter which is a very impressive outcome in my view our free cash flow for the 1st half of 2020 was €54000000 as jean marc noted earlier we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 based on our current view of market conditions generating free cash flow is a firm priority and we remain committed to deleveraging as you can see in our debt summary on the bottom left hand side of the page we have no bond maturities until 202 during the quarter we refinanced the remaining €200000000 of our four and five eighths percent notes due 2021 with 300 $325000000 of five and five eighths percent notes due 2028 202 while we initially plan to repay the 21s with free cash flow we felt it was prudent to remove this near term maturity given the favorable debt market conditions notably this was the lowest coupon dollar bond that constellium has ever priced a considerable achievement in the midst of a pandemic as a result of our financing activities thus far in 2020 we now expect cash interest of €150000000 to €160000000 our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was €949000000 at the end of the 2nd quarter as jean marc noted we added €50000000 to this balance in july and we remain very comfortable in our liquidity position i will now hand the call back to jean marc thank you peter let us turn to slide one i want to highlight something that is core to our business sustainability in early july we published our 2019 business and sustainability report which you can find on our website i would like to point out a few highlights from 201 safety is our 1st priority our target is to reduce our recordable case rates by ten year after year between 2016 and 2019 a recordable case rate decreased by 27 and we are trending very well this year this means that more of our colleagues are returning home injury free every day we also improved our energy efficiency by sixforty compared to a 2015 baseline that is the equivalent of 100000 metric tons of co two savings every year further we introduce a 2025 target to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 25 against the 2015 baseline we have a detailed plan to achieve this target as many of you know recycling is a core competency at constellium aluminum is infinitely recyclable with 75 of all aluminum ever produced still in use today muscle shoals is one of the largest recyclers of aluminum cans globally with the capacity to recycle over 20000000000 cans every year at neuf brisach we also recycle the equivalent of 12000000000 beverage cans every year as a company constellium recycled over 560000 metric tons of externally sourced aluminum scrap in 201 i am also proud that 3rd parties are recognizing constellium for our sustainability achievements the aluminum stewardship initiative or asi is an industry led initiative to drive sustainability across the entire aluminum value chain from producers to customers in 2019 we received asi certifications for singen is casting and rolling operation and we began producing asi certified coils for our customers from singen in 202 we also received asi certification of our neuf brisach facility under provisional covid conditions in 202 we achieved the ecovadis platinum rating which is awarded to the top one of companies assessed worldwide we received an esg rating of aa from msci placing us in the top five of our sector overall we had a very successful year on our sustainability objectives in 2019 and i look forward to continuing our progress on these very important initiatives now let us turn to slide sixteen and discuss our end markets we believe our balanced portfolio of products across end markets geographies and customers is a competitive advantage during challenging times like these i will start with the packaging market packaging is a core market for constellium and represented 38 of our ltm revenue we continue to see strong demand in north america and stable demand in europe further evidenced that this market is both recession resilient and secular growth we believe the packaging market as long term secular growth tailwinds driven by customer preference for aluminum cans our customers continue to invest in new can lines with several additional investments in north america just announced in the last week these additional lines should drive incre incremental demand for can sheet in the years to come the consumer preference trend is only one of the tailwinds for can sheet in europe the demand for can sheet continues to grow based on substitution of aluminum for steel in the us we continue to expect the growth of auto body sheet demand to tighten supply to the packaging market over the medium to long term now let us move to automotive over over long term automotive remains a secular growth market for aluminum customers continue to prefer larger vehicles with regulations aimed at increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions the automotive market will need to continue to lightweight in addition we expect hybrid and electric vehicles to continue to gain share of the fleet these vehicles are aluminum intensive due to the importance of light weighting to achieve their range objectives constellium is well positioned to realize the benefits of this circular shift to aluminum in automotive and the electrification of the fleet moving to more recent trends automotive oems began curtailing production in march and largely resumed production in may while demand from our customers increased significantly in june we have experienced uneven demand for our products as a result of supply chain challenges and covid nineteen hotspots while we are optimistic about automotive demand in the back half of 2020 the demand for our products will be dependent on the level of production at the oem let us turn now to aerospace aerospace represented fifteen of our ltm revenues the near term outlook for aerospace remains uncertain due to the effects from covid nineteen and the 737 max aerospace oems have reduced build rate and it is unclear how long build rates will remain at these levels we expect aerospace shipments in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2020 will be lower than the level in the 2nd quarter of 202 in tid we expect to continue to expand in niche products in a diversified range of markets over the long term in the near term the defense and rail markets remain strong but most industrial and transportation markets remain weak these markets are dependent upon the health of the industrial economy in europe and north america it is unclear when and to what extent these markets will rebound in closing i again want to thank the constellium team for their tireless efforts during this trying time we remain committed to operational execution harvesting the benefits of our investments discipline capital deployment debt reduction and shareholder value creation with that joanna we will now open the q a session thank you sir ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press star then the number one on your touch tone telephone if your question has been answered or you wish yourself to remove yourself from the queue please press the pound key your 1st question comes from the line of chris terry from deutsche bank your line is open chris if you are on mute unmute chris you line is now open hi jean marc and peter can you hear me yeah we can good morning chris good morning thanks for taking my question the 1st thing i wanted to start with was just the utilization rates and the comments from one q you sort of stepped through how you saw utilization in each of the divisions for two q and then perhaps for three q and four q appreciate you do not have guidance but i wondered whether you could maybe conceptually talk through three q versus four q and just versus two q or any comments you could make on the divisions as an update from last quarter thanks sure chris so i will start with the markets and then going to of translate it into what it can mean for the divisions right or the business units so when you look at our 2nd quarter of this year versus the 2nd quarter of last year right you see packaging roughly ten down you see automotive fifty down you see aerospace forty down right roughly and the other markets and each market is about 25 down this is made of very different dynamics right so in packaging what we are seeing now is 95 utilization there was a bit of a drop especially in april with all the lockdowns in europe redu reduction in canned consumption and all that but that has come back pretty strong and the us continues to be quite strong so we look at you know packaging again recession resilient secular growth and we are pretty confident for the 2nd half of the year and we look at the q two as being a kind of an abnormal quarter because of all that happened in april and a little bit in may if i look at automotive it has re snapped back i mean i think when we talked on q one we are talking of twenty utilization as we were speaking and now we are at above eighty right if you do the average of twenty and eighty you you get to fifty which is about what we experienced in the 2nd half in terms of reduction in their shipments it is you know it seems like it can be stronger than eighty going forward we certainly are running very well in july but we have seen that this restart has been with all kinds of fits and stops right so you got upstarts you have got supply chain disruptions you have got difficulties in bringing products from mexico building trucks in texas it is challenging so you have got all those you know operational issues that all of us in the supply chain have to deal with but clearly the demand seems to be you know well in excess of eighty of where we were last year so that that is encouraging and hopefully you know covid nineteen does not throw too much of a wrench in that good trend if i look now at aerospace where we were running at around sixty in the quarter we expect more pain in the 2nd half of the year and i think the the reason for that is it is a long supply chain and the customers you know move a little bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their orders and that that is creating a bit of a of a lag in terms of how how much pain we take we are in very detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion to look at what the 2nd half ought to look like and why contractually we could force some volumes on us that is not our type what they do not need we do not want to force on them so what we are working through is taking more pain now in the 2nd half so that 2021 we start with a clean slate so we would expect some reduction in the operating rates in aerospace in in the 2nd half of the year so if you translate all that into what it means for the different bus i would expect parp packaging and automotive to be better i would expect as i automotive structures essentially to be better in the 2nd half and would expect a t to be a more challenge in the 2nd half yeah thanks thanks so much and you sorry no go ahead i i will just sort of follow up on packaging specifically where the volumes are down at you know around about ten i think year on year and you are saying muscle shoals is doing well it seems like the us is going going well i think crown yesterday mentioned that southern europe was weak can you just comment a little bit further about packaging in the eu region is it was it down in the quarter because of demand or because you had facilities offline and maybe you could quantify some of the eu impacts yeah i think so so the reason i am saying more than ninety or 95 whatever and that is 100 is exactly because of some weakness in europe right and i think it has got to do with both you know the the the reduction in activity in southern europe i mean a lot of these countries have economies that are based on tourism and you know this is not the best year for tourism as we all know and we are seeing you know there is little clusters and hotspots so everybody is a bit you know vigilant as they should be right so that is weighing down a little bit on canned consumption in europe yes okay and and just sorry i had one follow up on on on on working capital specifically i just wanted maybe pe peter if you could talk through the you know the two q moving parts obviously you have stepped through those waterfall charts and you are getting cost doing a great job on the cost side i just wondered if you are coming a little bit further on the 2nd half of the year and what the opportunities are that on working capital sure in terms of you are saying positive for the full year you have already obviously hit the positive number at the halfway point so just just wondering if you talk through the moving parts of working capital sure happy to do it and just for context so the 2nd quarter as we said last quarter we we would use working capital and we in fact burned 63000000 of working capital in the in q two and for the 1st half we are +two so based on where we sit today i think it is plausible to think that you know with auto ramping with packaging kind of continuing to ramp back up that that we could lose some ground in the in the back half of the year so not a huge negative but we could see working capital being used in the back half of the year but chris i would say that we remain confident in spite of that that we we can achieve a free cash flow position thanks thanks peter that is that is it for me thank you okay good your next question comes from the line of josh sullivan from the benchmark company your line is open hey good morning good morning josh yeah just a question you know how are you thinking you know any tariffs on canadian aluminum you know have you increased any inventory expecting that or or or just what should we be thinking on that front of that if that comes to fruition yeah well i mean we believe it is a misguided measure if it happens right we we have lobbied against it in the past we got it removed it may come back we think it is misguided and it does not address the problem which is over capacity from china from a non market economy that does not play by the same rules as we do now that said if it happens it has got a very limited impact on us so i remind you that we pass through the metal cost essentially to most of our customers there may be a little the section of the business where we cannot reprice immediately when it happens but on the other side we may gain a little bit more on scrap recycling as well so not much of an impact for us the reason we are against it is much more a matter of principle because we believe in free and fair trade than really a problem for our finances or our e economic outcome got it and then just on on the canned sheet front you know can you remind us of you know when the you know you your larger contracts are are up for renegotiation and then just any comment around you know pricing strength yeah so we so we do not go into the details of exactly which contracts mature when but you know that we have got a few renewals coming in around the 22 horizon we are making good progress and i think the pricing environment is i would describe it as a mildly positive in the us and widely negative in europe because of the specific situation now i remind you that contractual negotiations take a lot of time here and whilst we you know i say it is mildly positive here and mildly negative there between now and whenever we actually ink a contract things may change but i think it is a pretty benign environment and our product is in demand i will brag a little bit our quality and our service is very much recognized muscle shoals has done a terrific job in over the past five years and is a very strong player in the market now very recognized quality service wise neuf brisach has always been so we have strong positions and i am looking at the future with a great deal of confidence great thank you that is it thanks thanks josh your next question comes from the line of david gagliano from bmo capital markets your line is open great thanks for taking my questions 1st of all i did have one question on the numbers for the 2nd quarter did you say there was a $15000001 time benefit included in the $81000000 adjusted ebitda line you are talking about for the for the labor benefit i thought it was a covid nineteen state aid benefit is that included in yeah that is included in adjusted ebitda but it is not a one off and it continues those programs are what is referred to as or short time work and these government programs continue through 2020 and in some cases into 202 okay so we should assume about a $15000000 quarterly benefit those programs each quarter well no because what will happen david is remember so in the 2nd quarter we had a lot of people on the sidelines right but as we ramp up then we are going to have substantially less of that i think you should assume that in the businesses that it you know it is going to so packaging for example where we had some benefit in in q two we should have you know basically very limited if if any benefit in in yeah q three and you know automotive which should fade away and and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating utilization rate there but it will be a much lower number to give you an indication i we mentioned about people being you know unemployed during the quarter at the trough which is behind us we had 6000 people under some kind of unemployment benefit or you know temporary layoff now we are at less than 2000 so it is it is closed dra dramatically yeah and and david just to put it in perspective the you know if you get to the 4th quarter the number might be something like 25 of that right just based on the utilization rate just rough number okay that is actually helpful thank you and then just in terms of the you know the the the individual and market commentary on the aerospace side obviously that is the or has been you know the highest margin business and and you know just in terms of the outlook commentary you you you framed obviously two segments up one segment down but you know the down segment is is again the highest margin segment i did not really get a census to order magnitude of the down number versus the up numbers can you just give us a sentence to you know do you believe that aerospace will completely offset the recovery in auto and and packaging in the 2nd half or or or a bit more you know color on magni order of magnitude on the on the decline in aerospace would be helpful so it is very difficult to tell david because we are as we speak in a very active discussions with our customers and at the end of the day it is a call that we have to make jointly with them as i mentioned we have got contracts whereby we can force them to take some product which they will take and pay for all but then they do not need it the following year right so they all they all the inventory they are holding back so we are looking collaboratively with them in terms of what is it exactly they need which by the way i do not think they fully know now and it is no criticism of them i mean it is very unusual time and once we know what they need and we look at what cuts do we take then i could answer your question possibly at this stage i cannot i would just say that there will be for sure more pain in in other structures and then the you know those structures in aerospace my apologies aerospace now the other thing too is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period in the recent past the 2nd half is always w weaker than the 1st half right in aerospace so right that that is something to factor in as well okay and just m my last related question is the the the i think you mentioned i think average utilization rates for aerospace related demand in this in the 2nd quarter was around sixty correct facilities is that right what is that number now we are running still around that number but i would expect it to go down maybe to fifty that kind of range okay all right that is helpful thanks very much okay yeah it is very it is important to say we are not expecting it to go down to thirty right even that is that is not not on the horizon your next question comes from the line of curt woodworth from credit suisse your line is open yeah hi good morning hi curt hi curt peter 1st question on on the €100000000 of cost reductions how much of that would you view as structural and then you know i guess just in general in terms of the amount of costs you think you could take out of the business this year on a permanent basis can you give us an update on on those efforts so if we look if we look at the i mean so the biggest piece of that 100000000 is related to labor right so x and that is that is probably labor is probably you know half of that 100000000 so what we are doing now is we are really closely looking at the business and you know what it is likely to be like for the next couple years and then you are trying to size our labor forces according to that so in that regard i think we would expect that there is going to be some kind of permanent savings but remember as we kind of ramp up the operations we do expect some of that cost is going to come back right so you know i would say it is hard to give a a really precise number zero on that curt it is it is a difficult one yeah okay kurt if i may add we have talked about horizon 22 right and one of the strategic initiatives was to look at how do we lean our organization without losing competencies capabilities but how do we lean and make the organization stronger and i think what covid nineteen is doing to us and i guess to many other companies out there is accelerate the number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented so along the lines that peter was saying i think we will come out of this with some permanent cost reductions and as we ramp up we will not ramp up and inject back 100000000 of costs how much you know wi will remain to be seen because we are really learning as we are doing and we are just in the middle of it now but we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger yeah and there is certain categories like for example professional fees subcontractors where you know kind of as we work without these because those are you know kind of big categories of reduction i think we were able to to kind of live without a lot of that going forward so so yeah i think there there is there is definitely a p piece of that that we can carry forward sure and then just to give an example that are not not trivial they are quite revealing right so we have got a very strong you know r d and technical support organization which is you know people that are centrally located and then go and help plants and historically a lot of the work was done by people going to the location now obviously in the past three months nobody has been able to travel anywhere and a lot of that has been done through a remote interaction video conference but even when you go to a to a plant and you look at i got a problem and i need to improve the speed on this mill we have had people you know interacting by the bit on a facetime and going into looking into the the roller the the the rolling mills by facetime with a technical advisor on the other side of the planet and that works actually fine which we would not have thought it would be possible so in the future what you are gaining here is well you are saving travel time which is not very good for the aerospace business but also your say you are you are the because you are saving the cost you are saving the time which means that people can be on several interventions whilst historically within a week you know it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done so i think we are we are going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our you know space that are going to be quite interesting in the future and i think it is going to help us inject more brain and talent remotely with more yeah and curt you know as we go forward we will we may be able to give you more color on this but you know hopefully it comes across that we are really looking hard at taking structural costs out and in the short term the objective is we want to be you know kind of free cash flow positive through this crisis and so that we do not take on any incremental debt ideally and in the longer term we want to emerge with a you know kind of much stronger earnings power so we are focused on exactly that and and you know we will have more to say as as we progress okay now that that is helpful and then you know in terms of the the free cash flow you know dynamics you mentioned i think a $73000000 impact from factoring this quarter or otherwise you would be free cash flow positive which is pretty pretty positive given your utilization rate and now you are talking about 95 utilization and packaging over eighty and auto and it seems like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized so you know 75 of your business is could be close to ninety utilization in a couple months i get that arrow is weaker but it would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint you know unless working capital would be a major negative you you should be generating decent free cash in the the back half of the year can you can you comment at all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year yeah sure thanks for the question so we will not put a specific number on it but we are confident that we will generate free cash flow for the full year and you know the back half of the year i think there is a there is a very good chance that we can you know generate some free cash flow but it depends a lot on what happens with trade working capital as i said we have got you know the ramp of these businesses so we want to be a little cautious until we see the pace of the ramp and the consequences of the ramp but again for the full year we we remain confident that we can generate free cash flow okay and then just final question on arrow jean marc you had a comment on i guess working with the oems to create you said a clean slate entering 202 so you know is that statement kind of reflecting the fact that the oems cut very quickly and i assume there is sort of an excess inventory issue that they are dealing with or in general in the supply chain and so you know hypothetically your your volumes would be below the actual build rate to help them clear inventory so then when you get into 2021 you know the supply chain is in is in a pretty good position and you know contractually you said you are not going to force it on them but then you know if you are going to help them manage that do they do you get any anything in return i e you know price benefit or you know this is kind of everyone helping each other just a little bit understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate comment well yeah no fair question so i think i have commented in the past on the fact that i thought that the shipments we are making into the to the oems right into the supply chain were actually higher than what the build rates were warranting at the time and obviously the build rates are going down very significantly down so now so the the pain we are going to take in the 2nd half i think is not going to cure all the you know inventory build up in the supply chain 1st of all but i think what that does is it positions us for 2021 that does not show further deterioration that is what we are we are into right and we want to be in a place where where we supply by and large consistent with what is being built right so that that is what we are trying to do whether we get there fully i do not know but certainly we are aiming to be better in 21 than what the 2nd the nine months of you know post covid will be in a t that is that is one of the goals in terms of what we are getting from the oems we have got very strong deep strategic relationships with them i have commented also in the past from the fact that we are in it for the long haul and i think it is evidenced by the ten year contract we have signed with airbus i mean ten year is a long duration never happened before and we did it because it was the right thing to do for both companies for both businesses and we did not do it as a reaction to covid or whatever right i mean that was really the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies so we are looking past the current crisis the current crisis we have got to get all in the same boat or in the same aircraft and put us in the same place work together to overcome the crisis and we are not talking about you know if i do that you give me a bit more price or whatever i think it is just a relationship where we want to be in the win win partnership and we do some things that help them and they will do some things that help us in the future which they have already done in the past and that is already that is already happened and that is continuing okay great thank you very much your next question comes from the line of matthew fields from bank of america your line is open hey jean marc hey peter one on the on the markets and then one on the balance sheet please so you know saw that can volumes were down about eleven but you know norsk reported canned volumes up eleven i think you guys face relatively the same markets in europe can you can you sort of point to why maybe they are having more success on their can volumes was it was it enough for neuf brisach being down issue or or a market issue or what like what can you just explain that discrepancy for us please sure it is mainly i believe i mean i cannot comment on their specific situation but in in our case the main reason was that we had to take down neuf brisach for a full week and then ramp it up gradually i remind you that neuf brisach was at the center of a hot spot of the 1st real hot spot in france and that was a very very terrible conditions for you know 2nd half of march so in march we continued to ship out of finnish goods but then we had to replenish the the the finnish goods and that really took down our you know our shipments in the 2nd quarter but we are back to normal now okay that is that is sort of what i expected and on the balance sheet it looks like you got a decent amount of funding from from france and and obviously switz switzerland and and germany you said it was partially guaranteed but it is also secured can you just give us a a a a a better understanding of sort of what it is secured by is it inventory or is it sort of ppe and then to what extent is it guaranteed by the french government well it depends on the facility but the big one the french one is secured on on pp e and in the case of the german ones one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured and the swiss one is unsecured and the guarantees what the way they work is they guarantee a certain percentage of the principal so it is a normal syndicate of banks with in the case of france i think the guarantee is for seventy of the or sorry eighty percent of the in the case of france of the of the principal balances guaranteed by the by the french state in the case of germany i think it is eighty too so just just for for our purposes as credit analysts eighty of that french loan is is sort of non recourse to you well again it is it is it is recourse to us what i think t t the point is is that if you are a lender so for example if you are in the syndicate of banks and you are lending say fifty your responsibility is for 100 sorry fifty 50000000 your responsibility is for ten of that right so the it is the banks that benefit from the guarantee not not the company okay so you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks yeah absolutely absolutely okay but one thing yeah i am sorry go ahead the the government is in fact stopping the loan for you it is not stopping the loan for for the banks exactly exactly but one thing to you know kind of i think is a really important point is you know our our intent in putting this liquidity on the balance sheet was to remove any question about the fact that we had e enough liquidity as we said from the beginning and based on the performance in the 2nd quarter we do not anticipate using this so the french facility we had to draw just by the terms of the agreement but it just sits on our balance sheet as cash and the german facility that we have now signed up in july you know we do not expect to draw that the dd the delay draw term loan we have not drawn that and the swiss facility we do not have that drawn in in most instances so and the way we benefit from the state guarantee is through very cheap interest rates yeah that is right right so that is right that is right cheap money and that that was important to us we do not think we need the money so we are not going to to pay a lot of interest for it yeah exactly that and it obviously was an inducement for the banks to lend right now fair enough and that is you know i think the french facility is what twofifty effectively at this point yeah yeah that is the code all right so you do not really have an incentive to pay that off quickly you know given your your bonds are kind of twice that right no no that is right now remember the the the use of the cap there are some limitations on the use of the capital right so for example we can not use that capital to go and buy back bonds in the market so it is really meant to be for you know kind of operating needs of a company but yeah you are right we do not have a we do not have a strong incentive to to repay that okay and then it but but what we will what we will do is you know obviously there is some cost to it right so as we kind of emerge from the crisis and have a little more visibility then we will unwind those facilities okay that is that is very helpful thanks for all the color and and good luck in the back half thank you thank you your next question comes from the line of sean warnock from deutsche bank your line is open hey guys thanks for taking my questions and really great job on transparency and costs here both very helpful thanks sean just when you think about big picture if you look at the auto market there are sort of projections out in the market that will have about you know 25 decline in new cars this year you know mostly based on the fact that we were not producing back in march april if you look at the used auto market you know it has been pretty strong as we have used prices really you know rising even above last year you know you talk about how production has been increasing and demand is increasing there you know to kind of get to down 25 you know you would have to have some pretty strong growth in in three q and 34 so i i guess what i am asking is do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon you know with demand pulling through based on on a lack of cars and if you can provide a little color what you are seeing there that would be very helpful yeah so i mean the older book is strong there is no question it is above the eighty that i am mentioning right but we have been a little bit caught you know by customers just a few months ago telling us we need product tomorrow and then telling us the next day the plant is shut down right so you know we are very vigilant right so i hope i i think the end demand is there i think that is true in the us that is true in europe right the governments have injected a lot of money in the hands of consumers right through the the unemployment benefits of you know different shapes and forms that you see on both continents and that is you know pretty good for end demand at the end of the day so i hope it is going to be it is going to materialize into and the older book we have is going to be actually real orders and shipments in which case it could be better but you know i have we we we we have seen fits and starts you see plants restarting and then shutting down because there is covid infections or you see people having trouble stashing you know the full shift because there is too many cases in the in the hot spots so i i i i it is still fragile i mean it looks quite good but it is still fragile right that is helpful thank you jean marc i guess that is a good lead into the next question so when when you think about your customers you know we we have had some shutdowns we have had things come back online do you do you feel that your customers and their ceos are are getting more confident in their ability to stay online they are getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curve there eah i i would think so i think all of us have made tremendous efforts to provide the proper environment from for our employees it is very interesting i i was commenting on the the you know half of a percent of our e employees have been affected by covid confirmed we have had no new case confirmed case in europe since the middle of may wow so i think this is saying something about the fact that when people take responsibility in their daily lives right because it goes beyond what they do within our factories or during the eight hours or ten hours whatever that they work with us you can have an impact and i think you know if people wear masks when they interact with outside which people they they come across i think it makes a tremendous difference so i hope the reality will slowly or more more than slowly settle in and and good practices will get that virus a away from us sooner rather than later and i think got you people are seeing the the confidence building up i mean it is human nature you need to be affected to take steps and i think we are in the process where in many places people are still being affected before they take steps but if you look at china i mean china is you know going extremely strong you know it is a small operation for us but we are above budget above last year right you look at europe no n new cases are really on a downward trend even though there are some clusters here and there and we are seeing a stronger reco rebound and i hope this is coming to us in the us throughout the us that is great that is good to hear jean marc and i i hope everybody is safe and well over there thank you very much and and good luck thank you well go ahead sir zero go ahead joanna yes sir i am showing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the

same speech in english cleaning and sanitation allowed for and enforced social distancing and work to raise awareness with our employees i want to personally thank our employees for taking this seriously and following the precautions we have put into place as of last friday approximately one half of one of our employees have tested positive for covid nineteen and all of them have recovered or are recovering needless to say we must remain vigilant during the 2nd quarter our plants operated well despite significant disruptions to customer demand from lockdowns in both europe and the us as i am speaking all our plants are running now and well we are carefully monitoring covid nineteen hotspots both for the health of our employees and any potential impacts on supply chains we are pleased to report that our production levels have gradually increased during the course of the 2nd quarter and this trend has continued into july however both levels of demand and visibility from our customers remain below historical levels we took strong actions to combat the effects of the pandemic on our business we aggressively reduced our costs including flexing variable costs to match production levels reducing fixed costs we will continue to monitor the situation closely and take any further necessary actions to ensure the long term success of our business lowering our targeted capital expenditures over forty of our workforce were on some type of partial employment or temporary layoff scheme during the quarter where appropriate we have also implemented permanent headcount reduction our ability to flex costs was slightly better than the scenario we provided last quarter this was a great achievement by the entire constellium team and demonstrated our flexibility our liquidity at the end of the quarter was €949000000 an increase of over €300000000 compared to the end of the 1st quarter we added an additional €50000000 of liquidity in july through credit facilities supported by the german state bringing our pro forma liquidity to approximately €1000000000 in june we accessed the debt market in conclusion with the significant actions we have taken i am very confident in our ability to navigate through this crisis on flight six you will see some of our highlights from the 2nd quarter of 2020 shipments were 310000 metric tons but decrease revenue decreased 33 to €1000000000 of last year two thirds was related to lower shipments and 13rd was related to lower metal prices i remind you that while our revenues are affected by changes in metal prices we operate a pass through business model net loss of €32000000 compared to net income of €17000000 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 adjusted ebitda of €81000000 decreased 51 compared to the 2nd quarter of 2019 with a strong focus on cost control we are able to offset a significant part of the volume edwin across each of our business units i am proud of what the team was able to achieve in a challenging environment costumium generated 228000000 of adjusted basis in the 1st half the decline of 24 compared to the 1st six months of last year our free cash flow was €33000000 in the 2nd quarter of 2020 this result would not have been possible without our strong actions to reduce costs and capital expenditures and cash expenditures our free cash flow for the 1st half of 2020 was €54000000 based on our current view of market conditions we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 i will now hand over to peter to discuss our financial performance in more detail thank you jeanmarc thank you everyone for joining the call today turning now to slide eight you will find the change and adjust by segment for the 2nd quarter of 2020 for the 1st half of 2020 compared to the same period of last year for the 2nd quarter of 2020 canstellam achieved €81000000 a decrease of €86000000 or 51 year over year a and t adjusted for the same period of last year achieved €81000000 a decrease of €21000000 or 27 year over year the total assets of the company decreased by €33000000 or 51 compared to the 2nd quarter of 2019 as a result of the above the net income decreased by €1000000 decrease of €31000000 compared to last year lastly the holding in corporate costs of €7000000 were €1000000 higher than last year in the 1st six months of 2020 consolidated net income achieved €228000000 a decrease of €74000000 or 24 year over year a decrease of €124000000 or eleven compared to last year a and t adjusted basis of €83000000 decreased by €33000000 or 28 compared to the 1st six months of 2019 lastly holding in corporate costs of €12000000 were €1000000 higher than last year we expect agency costs of approximately €20000000 in 2020 volume decreased 27 compared to the 2nd quarter of last year volume was a headwind of €41000000 in the quarter packaging shipments fell by twelve primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in march of our nantes plant in france due to covid nineteen shipments to the north american canned sheet market increased slightly year over year decline 54 compared to last year as many of our automotive om customers curtailed production for april and most of may price in mix was a headwind of €2000000 costs were a tailwind of €21000000 due to strong broad based cost control with labor and maintenance as important contributors metal costs were neutral in the quarter as we face difficult aerospace lower metal prices fft translation was a tailwind of €1000000 now turn to slide ten and let us focus on the a and t segment a decrease of €31000000 compared to last year volume was a headwind of €46000000 lower metal prices aerospace shipments fell 37 compared to last year as aerospace oem is and distributors began to reduce orders tidi shipments declined by twenty due to lower industrial activity in both europe and the us price in mix was a €3000000 headwind due to lower aerospace shipments costs were a tailwind of €15000000 due to strong broad based cost control with labor metal and maintenance as important contributors lastly fx translation was a €1000000 tailwind in the quarter now turn to slide eleven and let us focus on the asini segment adjusted ebitda of €1000000 decreased by €31000000 compared to the 2nd quarter of 2019 volume was a €31000000 headwind automotive shipments declined 52 compared to last year due to customer shutdowns for a significant portion of the quarter industry shipments declined sixteen due to lower industrial activity in europe price in mix was a €9000000 headwind partially due to price in mix as a consequence of weaker market conditions costs were a €9000000 headwind firstly the strong cost control with labor energy and fixed costs has important contributors secondly fx translation was a €1000000 headwind in the quarter now turning to slide twelve i want to highlight our very strong cost performance during the 2nd quarter in the 2nd quarter we managed to flex our costs by 83 cost flex represents this compares favorably to the 75 variable cost estimate we provided last quarter at the bottom of the page you can see that each of our businesses demonstrated strong cost control to put this in context excluding metal and depreciation we reduced costs by approximately €100000000 compared to the 2nd quarter of last year these cost savings were driven by strong cost control across the businesses including labor maintenance professional fees and sub contractor fees i will note that our 2nd quarter 2020 figures include approximately a €15000000 benefit from european state employment aid related to covid nineteen i want to congratulate the team for the aggressive actions taken on cost control we will continue to maintain our strong focus on cost control particularly given the uncertain demand environment now let us turn to slide at the end of the 2nd quarter our leverage was fourfour times and our net debt was €2200000000 slightly lower than our net debt position at the end of 2019 we remain very committed to capital discipline we reduced our 2020 capex target to approximately €175000000 a €96000000 reduction from 2019 through the 1st half of 2020 we spent €32000000 less in capex than in the same period of last year our free cash flow for the 2nd quarter was €33000000 during the quarter as a consequence of lower activity our factor receivables were lower than the levels that we had maintained in recent quarters and negatively impacted our free cash flow by €73000000 as activity levels increase excluding the impact of factors the company actually generated positive free cash flow in the 2nd quarter which is a very impressive outcome in my view our free cash flow for the 1st half of 2020 was €54000000 as jean marc noted earlier we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 based on our current view of the market generating free cash flow is a firm priority and we remain committed to deleveraging as you can see in our debt summary on the bottom left hand side of the page we have no bond maturities until 2024 during the quarter we refinance the remaining 200000000 of our four and five eighths percent notes due 2021 with $325000000 of five and five eighths percent notes due 2025 with a coupon of three25 while we initially planned to repay the 221 with free cash flow we felt it was prudent to remove this near term maturity given the favorable debt market conditions notably this was the lowest coupon dollar bond that conestoga has ever priced a considerable achievement in the midst of a pandemic as a result of our financing activities thus far in 2020 we now expect to repay the 221 with free cash flow our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was €949000000 at the end of the 2nd quarter as jeanmarc noted we added €50000000 to this balance in july and we remain very comfortable in our liquidity position i will now hand the call back to jeanmarc thank you peter let us stay on fifteen good morning in early july we published our 2019 business and sustainability report which you can find on our website i would like to point out a few highlights from 2019 safety is our 1st priority our target is to reduce our recordable case rate by ten year after year between 2016 and 2019 our recordable case rate decreased by 27 and we are trending very well this year this means that more of our colleagues are returning home injury free every day we also improved our energy efficiency by sixfour compared to a 2015 baseline that is the equivalent of a 100000 metric tons of co two savings every year further we introduced a 2025 target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in ten as many of you know recycling is a core competency at muscle shoals aluminum is infinitely recyclable with 75 of all aluminum ever produced still in use today muscle shoals is one of the largest recyclers of aluminum cans globally with the capacity to process over 200000000 cans per year the audio is of a man speaking in a foreign language about the company is recycling achievements we are an industry led initiative to drive sustainability across the entire aluminum value chain from producers to customers in 2019 we received asi certification for our casting and rolling operation and we began producing asi certified coins for our customers from zingen in 2020 we also received asi certification for our neprisza facility we achieved the ecovadis platinum rating which is awarded to the top one of companies assessed worldwide and we received an a rating from msgi placing us in the top five of our sector overall we had a very successful year on our sustainability objectives in 2019 and i look forward to continuing our progress now let us turn to site sixteen and discuss our end markets we believe our balanced portfolio of products across end markets geography and customers is a competitive advantage during challenging times like these i will start with the packaging market packaging is a core market for us representing 38 of our lpm revenue we continue to see growth in this market we believe the packaging market has long term secular growth tailwinds driven by customer preference for aluminum cans our customers continue to invest in new can lines with several additional investments in north america just announced in the last week these additional lines will further enhance our ability to meet customer demand and support long term secular growth i am speaking to you today to discuss the increasing demand for canned sheet in the years to come the consumer preference trend is only one of the tailwinds for canned sheet in europe in europe the demand for canned sheet continues to grow based on substitution of aluminum for steel in the us we continue to expect the growth of automobile body sheet demand to tighten supply to the packaging market over the medium to long term now let us move to automotive over the long term automotive remains a secular growth market for aluminum customers continue to prefer larger vehicles with regulations aimed at increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions the automotive market will need to continue to lightweight in addition we expect hybrid and electric vehicles to continue to gain share of the fleet these vehicles are aluminum intensive our products are well positioned to realize the benefits of the secular shift to aluminum in automotive and the electrification of the fleet moving to more recent trends omya began production in march and largely resumed production in may while demand from our customers increased significantly in june we have even experienced demand for our product we have seen challenges in the supply chain as a result of covid nineteen hotspots while we were optimistic about automotive demand in the back half of 2020 the demand for our products will be dependent on the level of production at the oem let us turn now to aerospace aerospace represents fifteen of our ltm revenues the near term outlook for aerospace remains uncertain due to the effects from covid nineteen and the 737 max aerospace oems have reduced build rates and it is unclear how long build rates will remain at these levels we expect aerospace shipments in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2020 to be lower than the level in the 2nd quarter of 2020 in tid we expect to continue to expand in each product in a diversified range of markets for the long term in the near term most industrial and transportation markets remain weak these markets are dependent upon the health of the industrial economy in europe and north america it is not clear when and to what extent these markets will rebound in closing i again want to thank the conseil team for their tireless efforts during this trying time we remain committed to operational execution with that joanna we will now open the q a session thank you sir ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press one on your touchtone telephone if your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue please press two thank you your 1st question comes from the line of kris terry from deutsche bank your line is now open hi is your mark and peter can you hear me yeah we can good morning craig good morning peter good morning everyone thanks for taking my question the 1st thing i wanted to start with was just the utilization rates and the comments from one q you you sort of step through how you saw utilization in each of the divisions for two q and then perhaps for three q and four q appreciate you do not have guidance hi could you maybe conference through three q versus four q and just versus two q any comments you could make on the divisions as an update from last quarter thanks automotive fifty down aerospace forty down retails about 25 down packaging what we are seeing now is 95 utilization there was a bit of a drop especially in april with all the lockdowns in europe reduction in consumption and all that we look at packaging again recession resilience secular growth and we are pretty confident for the 2nd half of the year we look at q two as being an abnormal quarter because of all that happened in april and a little bit in may i mean i think when we talked about q one we were talking about twenty utilization now we are at eighty right if you do the average of twenty and eighty you get to fifty which is about what we experience in the 2nd half until reduction in our shipments it seems like it can be stronger than eighty going forward we still are running very well in july but we have seen that this restart has been with all kinds of fits and starts right you have got up spots you have got supply chain disruptions you have got difficulties in bringing products from mexico building trucks in texas it is challenging so you have got all those you know operational issues that all of us in the supply chain have to deal with but clearly the demand seems to be you know well in excess of eighty of where we were last year so that is encouraging and hopefully covid nineteen does not throw too much wrenches in the works if i look now at aerospace where we were running at around sixty in the 1st half of the year we expect more pain in the 2nd half of the year and i think the reason for that is the long supply chain and customers you know move a little bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their orders and that is creating a bit of a lag in terms of how much pain we expect we are in very detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion to look at what the 2nd half ought to look like and whilst contractually we could force some volumes on us that is not our type what they do not need we do not want to force on them so what we are working through is taking more pain now in the 2nd half so that 2021 we start with a clean slate so we would expect some reduction in operating rates in aerospace so if you transfer all that into what it means for the different be used i would expect stop packaging and automotive to be better i would expect asni automotive structures essentially to be better in the 2nd half and i would expect nte to be more challenged in the 2nd half i just wanted to follow up on packaging specifically where the volumes are down you know around about ten i think year on year and you are saying muscle shoals is doing well it seems like the us is going well i think crown yesterday mentioned that southern europe was weak can you just comment a little bit further about packaging in the eu region is it down in the quarter because of demand or because you had yeah i think so so the reason i am saying more than ninety or 95 whatever that is exactly because of some  weakness in europe right and i think it has got to do with  you know the reduction in  activities in southern europe i mean a lot of these  countries are based on tourism and you know this is not the best year for tourism and we are seeing you know little clusters and hotspots so everybody is a bit you know vigilant as they should be right so that is weighing down a little bit on capital consumption in europe yes peter if you could talk through the yeah the two queue moving parts obviously you have stepped through those waterfall charts and you are getting costs out doing a great job on the cost side i just wondered if you could comment a little bit further on the 2nd half of the year and what the opportunities are that i am working capital in terms of you are saying positive for the full year you have already obviously hit the positive number at the halfway point so just just wanted if you could talk through the moving parts and working capital so happy to do it and just for context so in the 2nd quarter as we said last quarter we would use working capital and we in fact burned 63000000 of working capital in the q two and for the 1st half were +24 so based on where we sit today i think it is plausible to think that you know with auto ramping with packaging kind of continuing to ramp back up that we will be able to get back to positive cash flow good morning everyone just a quick update we could lose some ground in the back half of the year so not a huge negative but we could see working capital being a use in the back half of the year but chris i would say that we remain confident in spite of that that we can achieve a free cash flow position the audio is of a conversation between two people we think it is misguided and it does not address the problem which is over capacity from china from non market economy that does not play by the same rules as we do now that said if it happens it has got a very limited impact on us i will remind you that we pass through essentially cost to most of our customers there may be a little section of business where we are in a business where we are willing to take the risk the reason we are against it is much more a matter of principle because we believe in free and fair trade then really a problem for our finances or our economy so we are just going to have to have a discussion on that okay just on the canned sheep front you know can you remind us of you know when that was you know your larger contracts or a renegotiation and then just any comment around pricing and strength yeah so we see so we do not go into the details of exactly which contracts materialize when but you know that we have got a few renewals coming in around the 22nd horizon we are making good progress and i think the pricing environment is i would describe it as mildly positive in the us i think it is a very benign environment now our product is in demand i will brag a little bit our quality is very good this is a message from mister shoults he has done a fantastic job over the past five years and is a very strong player in the market now he is very recognized for his quality of service and has always been that way we have a strong position and i am looking at the future with a great deal of confidence thank you mister shoults your next question comes from the line great thanks for taking my questions 1st of all i did have one question on the number for the 2nd quarter did you say there was a $15000000 one time benefit included in the $81000000 adjusted ebitda those programs are referred to as short time work and these programs continue through 2020 and in some cases 2021 okay so we shrank in the 2nd quarter we had a lot of people on the sidelines but as we ramp up we are looking to bring back those programs so we are going to have substantially less of that so i think you should assume that in the businesses that you know so packaging for example where we had some benefit in q two we should have you know basically very limited if any benefit in in q three and you know automotive it should fade away and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating utilization right there but it will be a much lower number to to give you that indication well you know people being unemployed during the quarter at the trough which is behind us we had 6000 people and there is some kind of unemployment benefit or you know temporary layoff now we are at less than 2000 so it is rather dramatically fallen off just utilization rate just rough number okay that is actually helpful thank you and then just in terms of the you know the individual and market commentary and on the aerospace side obviously that is the or has been and you know the highest margin business and and you know just in terms of the outlet commentary you framed obviously two segments up one segment down but you know the down segment is is again the highest margin business i did not really get a census to order of magnitude of the down number versus the up numbers can you just give us a census to you know if you you believe that aerospace will completely offset the recovery in auto and and packaging in the 2nd half or a bit more you know color on order magnitude on the on the decline in aerospace would be helpful as they mentioned we got contracts whereby we can force them to take some product which they will take and pay for all but then they do not need it the following year right so they hold the inventory they are holding the bag so we are looking collaboratively with them in terms of what exactly they need which by the way i do not think they fully know now and it is no criticism of them it is very unusual times and once we know what they need we can make sure that we are providing them with the right product now the other thing too is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period in the recent past the 2nd half is always weaker than the 1st half right so that is something to factor in as well my last related question is i think you mentioned i think average utilization rates for aerospace related demand in the 2nd quarter was around sixty at your facilities is that right correct what is that number now we are running still around that number but i would expect it to go down hello this is jim i am calling from the horizon maybe to fifty that kind of range okay that is helpful thanks very much yeah so it is important to say but we are not expecting it to go down to thirty range note on the horizon good morning peter 1st question on on the $100000000 area of cost reductions how much of that would you view as structural and then you know i guess just in general in terms of the amount of costs you think you could take out of the business this year on a permanent basis can you give us an update on on those efforts and that is probably half of that 100000000 so what we are doing now is we are really closely looking at the business and you know what it is likely to be like for the next couple of years and then you know you are trying to size our labor force according to that well there is going to be some kind of permanent savings but remember as we kind of ramp up the operations we do expect some of that cost is going to come back right so you know i would say it is hard to give a really precise number on that kurt it is a difficult one kurt if i may add we have talked about horizon 22 and one of the strategic initiatives was to look at how do we lean our organization without losing competencies capabilities but how do we lean and make the organization stronger and i think what covid nineteen is doing to us and i guess to many other companies out there is accelerating the number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented so along the lines that peter was saying i think we will come out of this i am going to say some permanent cost reductions and as we ramp up we will not ramp up and inject back a 100000000 of cost how much you know we will remain to be seen because we are really a learning as we are doing and we are just in the middle of it now but we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger i think we were able to to kind of live without a lot of that going forward so yeah i think there is definitely a piece of that that we can carry forward a lot of work was done by people going to the location now obviously in the past three months nobody has been able to travel anywhere so a lot of that has been done through remote interaction video conference but even when you go to a plant and you look at i got a problem and i need to improve the speed of this mill we have had people you know interacting by the milk pot on a face time well i was looking into the rolling mills by facetime with the technical advisor on the other side of the planet and that works actually fine we would not have thought it would be possible so in the future what you are gaining here is well you are saving travel time which is not very good for the aerospace business but also you are saying the cost you are saying the time which means that people can be more efficient so you know historically within a week you know it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done so i think we are we are going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our  space that are going to be quite interesting in the future and i think it is going to help us inject more brain and talent remotely with more and hopefully it comes across that we are really looking hard at taking structural costs out and in the short term the objective is we want to be you know kind of free cash flow positive through this crisis so that we do not take on any incremental debt ideally and in the longer term we want to emerge with a you know kind of much stronger earnings power so we are focused on exactly that and you know we will have more to say as we progress ok now that that s helpful and then you know in terms of the the pre cash flow you know dynamics you mentioned i think it s $73000000 impact from back during this quarter or otherwise you d be pre cash flow positive which is pretty pretty positive given your utilization rate and now you re talking about 95 utilization in packaging over eighty in auto and it seems like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized so you know 75 of your businesses could be close to ninety utilization in a couple of months i get that arrow is weaker but it would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint unless working capital be a major negative you you should be generating decent free cash in the the back half of the year can you comment at all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year yeah sure thanks for the question so we will not put a specific number but we are confident that we will generate free cash flow for the full year and you know the back half of the year i think there is a very good chance that we can you know generate some free cash flow but it depends a lot on what happens with trade working capital as i said we have got you know the ramp of these businesses so we want to be a little cautious until we see the pace of the ramp and the consequences of the ramp but again for the full year we remain confident that we can generate free cash flow okay and then just final question on on aero john mark you had a comment on i guess working with the oems to create a clean slate entering 2022 so you know is that statement kind of reflective of the fact that the oems cut very quickly and i assume there is sort of an excess inventory issue that they are dealing with or in general in the supply chain and so you know you know hypothetically your your volumes would be below the actual build rate to help them clear inventories so then when you get into 2021 you know the supply chain is in is in a pretty good position and you know contractually you said you are not going to force it on them but then you know if you are going to help them manage that do they do you get any anything in return i e you know price benefit or you know this is just kind of everyone helping each other just a little bit better understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate comment well yeah no fair question so i think i have commented in the past on the fact that i thought that the shipments that were making into the oen right into the supply chain were actually higher than what the build rates were warranting at the time obviously the build rates are going down very significantly so now so the pain we are going to take in the 2nd half is i think not going to be there but i think what that does is it positions us for 2021 that does not show further deterioration that is what we are into right and we want to be in a place where what we supply is by and large consistent with what is being built so that is what we are trying to do whether we get there i do not know but certainly we are in terms of what we are getting from the uen we have got very strong deep strategic relationships with them i have also made the point that the fact that we are in it for the long haul the tenure was a long duration never happened before and we did it because it was the right thing to do for both companies for both businesses and we did not do it as a reaction to covid or whatever right that was really the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies so we are looking past the current crisis we got to get all in the same boat or the same aircraft and we are going to do that put us in the same place work together to overcome the crisis and we are not talking about you know if i do that you give me a bit more price or whatever i think it is just a relationship where we want to be in a win win partnership and we do some things that help them and they will do some things that help us in the future which have already done in the past and that is already happened and that is continuing your next question comes from the line of matthew fields from bank of america your line is open hey hey peter hey hey peter one on the markets and then one on the balance sheet please so you know saw that canned volumes were down about eleven but you know nordisk reported canned volumes up eleven i think you guys face relatively the same markets in europe can you can you sort of point to some of the differences and similarities i think they are having more success on their canned volumes was it enough for them to think down the issue or was it a market issue or what like what can you just explain that discrepancy for us please and that was a very terrible condition for the 2nd half of march so in march we continued to ship out finished goods but then we had to replenish the finished goods and that really took down our shipment in the 2nd quarter but we are back to normal now we have funding from france and obviously switzerland and germany you said it is partially guaranteed but it is also secured can you just give us a  a better understanding of sort of what it is secured by is it inventory or is it sort of pppenne and then to what extent is it guaranteed by the french government well it it depends on the facility but the big one the french one is secured on pppenne and e and in the case of the german ones one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured and the swiss one is unsecured and the guarantees what the way they work is they guarantee a certain percentage of the principal so it is a normal syndicate of banks with in the case of france i think the guarantee is for seventy of the or sorry eighty of the in the case of france of the of the principal balances in the case of germany i think it is eighty too so just for our purposes as credit analysts eighty of that french loan is is sort of non recourse to you well again it is it is recourse to us what i think the point is is that if you are a lender so for example if you are in the syndicate at a bank and you your responsibility is for 100 sorry fifty your responsibility is for ten of that i do not know how to say this but it is like we are just doing a favor for the banks exactly but one thing to you know kind of i think is a really important point is you know our our intent in putting this liquidity on the balance sheet was to remove any question about the fact that we had enough liquidity as we said from the beginning and based on the performance in the 2nd quarter we do not anticipate using this so the french facility we have no plans to use it just by the terms of the agreement but it just sits on our balance sheet as cash and the german facility that we have now signed up in july we do not expect to draw that the ddd the delayed draw term loan we have not drawn that and the swiss facility we do not have that drawn in most instances so the way we benefit from the state guarantee is through very cheap interest rates that is really cheap and that was important to us we do not think we need the money so we are not going to pay a lot of interest for it yeah exactly that is the code alright so you do not really have an incentive to pay that off quickly you know given your your bonds are but no no that is right no remember the the use of the capital there are some limitations on the use of the capital right so for example we can not use that capital to go in buyback bonds in the market so it is really meant to be for you know kind of operating needs of the company but yeah you are right we do not have a we do not have a strong incentive to to repay that but what we will do is what we will do is well obviously there is some cost to it right so as we kind of emerge from the crisis and have a little more visibility then we will unwind those facilities i think the cost here both very helpful just when you think about big picture if you look at the auto market there is sort of projections out in the market that will have about you know 25 decline in new cars is here mostly based on the fact that we were not producing back in march april but if you look at the used auto market you know it has been pretty strong as a weight with used prices really you know rising even above last year you know you talk about i mean the older book i mean the older book you know the demand has been increasing and the demand is increasing there you know to kind of get to down 25 you know you would have to have some pretty strong growth in in three q and 34 so i guess what i am asking is do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon you know with demand pulling through based on a lack of cars and if you can provide a little color on what you are seeing there that would be very helpful i was just going to say there was no question it is above eighty that i am mentioning right but we have been a little bit caught you know by customers just a few months ago telling us we need product tomorrow and then telling us the next day the plant is shut down right so you know we are very vigilant right so i hope i think the end demand is there i think that is true in the us that is true in europe right the governments have injected a lot of money in there right now i am going to talk about the benefits of you know different shapes and forms that you see on both continents and that is pretty good for end demand at the end of the day so i hope it is going to be actually real orders and shipments in which case it should be better but you know i am going to go into more detail on that you see plants restarting and then they are shutting down because there is a covid infection or you see people having a trouble or staffing you know the false shift because there is too many cases in the hotspot so it still fragile i mean it looks quite good but it is still fragile that is helpful thank you john mangan i guess that is a good lead to the next question when you think about your customers you know we have had some shut downs we have had things come back online do you feel that your customers and their ceos are getting more confidence in their ability to stay online or getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curve there yeah i would think so i think all of us have made tremendous efforts to provide the proper environment for our  employees i was commenting on the fact that half of our employees have been affected by covid confirmed we have had no new case confirmed in europe since the middle of may so i think it is important to say something about the fact that when people take responsibility in their daily lives it goes beyond just their own lives because it affects others as well you can have an impact i think you know if people wear masks when they

contribution margin adjusted ebitda and adjusted longterm capitalization which are all non gap measures used by management when evaluating our performance and results of operations explanations and reconciliations of these measures to their gap counterparts are contained in our news release and a slide presentation so with that i will turn the call over to suzanne thank you scott and good morning to everyone joining us for our 2nd quarter update i would like to begin by acknowledging that we are all adjusting to a new normal as we focus on staying safe and healthy during the coronavirus we are living in a world of video calls facetime webcasts working from home wearing face masks and washing our hands a lot and we are connecting in new ways like you many of us are not in our offices and are not able to see one another face to face in fact today is the 2nd time in nearly two months that steve rasche steve lindsey and i have been in the same location rest assured that we are distancing and disinfecting and getting the job done it is not easy to stay connected in times like this at spire connecting with us should feel like a handshake at the front door but without the ability to actually shake someone is hand we found ourselves leaning into other expressions of caring and friendship like how we listen how we check on our elderly neighbors how we smile and wave for load of strangers it is how our crews stop work take off their hats and put their hands over the heart when a funeral procession drives by these moments of connection and curing inspire the good in all of us and provide the energy it takes to walk through a time like this a time when some communities are impacted more than others but none go untouched a time when we understand how essential are services and how people count on us to deliver a time when safety has an expanded meaning and personal protective equipment becomes an everyday necessity but at spire it is easier for us to pivot we have a very clear mission that guides us answer every challenge advance every community and enrich every life through the strength of our energy you see we believe we are called to answer this and every challenge that arises we know that people rely on our energy every day and that we are an essential service we know that we cannot let our customers and communities down and we know that safety is a core value a value at the heart of every decision it is because of this deeply held belief that we set in motion a broad range of protective steps to address the coronavirus health crisis and its economic impact on our customers while passionately protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities we began in early march by activating our incident support team or the ist a cross functional team of 25 leaders from operations and all our shared services the ist has been meeting nearly every morning to discuss challenges solve issues and coordinate actions from hr policies to supply chain access to ppe and impact to employees customers and operations by the middle of march we activated the highest level of our crisis response plan by convening our crisis management team or cmt i asked steve lindsey to lead this team aspiring chief operating officers steve immediately gathered all of our chief officers and business unit presidents to quickly make executive decisions around broad ranging challenges steve will talk more about this in a moment from my perspective i like to say that it has been inspiring to watch the isg and cmt work together we bring a collection of expertise to our conversations from the very professional perspective of spire is leadership to our external involvement with the american gas association and our firsthand conversations with medical experts via the many hospital boards we serve on together we are careful to balance the needs of our many stakeholders including you we are communicating early and often with all employees and customers we are connecting regularly with our board and keeping our governors legislators and regulators informed every step of the way most importantly the cmt is keenly aware of the impact our decisions have on people and everything we do our goal is to flatten the curve and help control the spread of coronavirus while safely and reliably providing energy for our customers and communities thank goodness our largest operations are in missouri and alabama areas of the country that have been minimally impacted by the pandemic in fact only eleven of our 3500 employees have tested positive for the coronavirus and all but one person is back to work so as we work to meet the challenges created by the coronavirus we remain focused on our strategy to deliver growth and value by growing organically investing in infrastructure and advancing through innovation we continue to take steps to ensure that we remain strong both financially and from an operations perspective we will hear more on that from steve and steve when they discuss our capital spending including investments in new business and infrastructure upgrades as well as our updated capex forecast that supports our longterm growth outlook as reported in our earnings announcement this morning our 2nd quarter net economic earnings per share was below last year and our fy twenty plan as steve rasche will discuss in more detail the results were driven by lower margins due to warmer weather across our footprint margins that were not fully mitigated by a regulatory mechanism however our results were minimally impacted by the coronavirus and finally we will spend some time updating you on our process as we continue to pursue favorable regulatory outcomes across our jurisdiction with the focus on and filings in missouri with that i will turn the call over to steve lindsey to discuss our results and coronavirus responses in more detail thank you suzanne i want to begin by acknowledging the outstanding efforts of our employees during the difficult times brought on by the coronavirus and the resulting economic shutdown you are providing great service for our customers while taking extra care to ensure their health safety and wellbeing as well as your own and helping support our communities in this time of need and we all thank you very much suzanne mentioned we quickly activated the cmt with ten primary areas of focus this morning i would like to take a moment to outline the steps we have taken to address the coronavirus its impact on three of those areas our employees customers and communities keeping these stakeholders healthy safe and supportive is more than a priority for us it is a core value it is who we are at spire for our employees we have educated everyone on healthy practices and encourage people to follow the advice of the experts including the cdc and other public health organizations our guidelines include staying home when not feeling well frequent hand washing social distancing and other best practices we implemented policies to help employees handle the impacts of the coronavirus including taking care of family members or dealing with children being home from school an example of this is the implementation of our emergency leave program for field workers and technicians we have taken extra safety precautions to protect them and our customers we pre screen a customer is premise to ensure that no one is sick or symptomatic before we allow our workers to enter a home or business and we equip our employees with personal protective equipment for our office based employees we implemented a work from home policy starting in march and extending through may along with work from home and social distancing we have also implemented related policies to eliminate all non essential travel as well as group meetings and gatherings and across our company we stepped up the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing our work locations currently we are developing work transition plans that include reopening offices and facilities for our customers we are 1st and foremost focused on making sure they are well served and that they continue to grow and then we continue to provide safe and reliable energy that they have come to rely on regardless regardless of the situation at hand to help reduce customer contact and limit the potential for spreading the illness postpone work that was not time critical or urgent and to help our customers through what is surely a difficult time financially we work with our regulators to suspend involuntary disconnections and late fees through the end of may also expanding customer bill assistance programs as a company we have pledged $500000 matching gifts to augment the contributions made by customers and employees into our dollar health program 1000s of customers have already signed up to give and their match gifts total more than $300000 so far similarly we have donated $250000 to local area food pantries and meal programs from alabama to wyoming we are helping provide about 650000 meals for families struggling to make ends meet during this time we also led an effort with other companies to donate and set up laptops for children in limited income schools so they are able to learn from home since we are all in this together we have been coordinating and staying in close communications with various state and local government bodies healthcare organizations and industry groups to ensure that we are doing the most good by leveraging our collective energy and resources while we have been hard at work to address the impacts of the coronavirus and serve our customers well we have also remained focused on our business objectives centered on growing our company we continue to invest in organic growth and infrastructure upgrades across our utilities for the 1st half of fiscal 2020 we invested $53000000 in new business keeping up keeping pace with last year is record levels of investment and new premise activations as you can see our investment and our utilities is is expanding year to date we have invested $279000000 focused on new business and pipeline replacement that is up $24000000 or nearly ten for the 1st half of last year on the gas related business side our spend is actually down year over year largely reflecting the completion of the spire stl pipeline for the full year of fiscal 2020 we have increased our planned capital spend to $640000000 up $30000000 from our prior forecasted investment about 88 of our 2020 spin will be on our gas utilities with two thirds of the increase or about $20000000 attributable to utility investment we also plan to invest $10000000 in the 3rd quarter at spires storage regulatory mechanisms we have including incentives to accelerate system upgrades in missouri and alabama and realtime brick making in alabama are key to timely recovery and support infrastructure modernization earnings growth and better environmental performance to reduce methane emissions as you know from our discussion last quarter in missouri we have been working through a number of cases decided by the missouri public service commission going back to 2016 that had been challenged and appealed by the office of public counsel and resulted in adverse appellate court rulings late last year at the time of the appeal court orders we said we would pursue all avenues legislative judicial and regulatory to preserve the ability to continue investing in the safety reliability and environmental performance of our pipeline system while achieving timely recovery the start of the missouri legislative session in january we worked to introduce bills in both the house and senate to clarify the isrs statute as it relates to the eligibility of infrastructure upgrade spend for accelerated recovery the senate bill passed early march on may 6th the house passed the substitution of the senate bill given the differences between the versions passed in each chamber the legislation will now go to conference committee to reconcile the two versions meanwhile we have continued to file new isrs requests including one in early february late last month we the staff of the missouri public service commission and the office of public counsel reached the unanimous stipulation and agreement subject to missouri psc approval that would result in an $11000000 annualized increase in isrs revenue regarding the cases subject to the appeals court ruling these have been remanded back to missouri public service commission for final resolution following the denial of our request for the missouri supreme court review in mid march the commission has 120 days or until the middle of july to render a decision including whether any refund is required for anyone who would like more detail on the various isrs cases there is a table in the appendix of our slide presentation today finally in alabama we have been implementing new off system sales and capacity release program that went into effect december 1st we are also continuing to pursue the benefits of the accelerated infrastructure modernization rider or aim and are on track to achieve the threshold number of miles replaced this year in order to qualify for the in 2021 like we were seeing this past year with that i will turn the call over to steve rasche for a financial review and update good morning and let me add my wishes for good health and safety to everyone and a huge shout out to all of our 1st responders healthcare workers and our own team who continue to serve bravely every day let me cover our quarterly results the financial impact of coronavirus and an update to our targets for the 2nd half of our fiscal 202 turning to our results for the quarter we delivered consolidated net economic earnings of $144000000 down $3900000 from last year our gas utility posted earnings of just over $144000000 down $2400000 from last year as a result of warmer weather and losses on investments as marketing delivered earnings of just over $5000000 down just over $1000000 from last year as higher volumes from our expansion were offset by less favorable market conditions and higher costs and we saw higher earnings from the spire stl pipeline which entered service last quarter a lower loss from fu spire storage reflecting the benefits of our operational improvements and slightly higher corporate costs looking at our per share results courier earnings of $two75 per share were down ¢fifteen from last year reflecting lower earnings as well as the impact of preferred and common stock issued over the last twelve months i would offer two additional comments 1st as suzanne mentioned we saw limited financial impact from the coronavirus this quarter since it really did not hit our service territory is in until mid march or in the forward impact in a few minutes and secondly as reflected here net economic earnings continues to include all isrs revenues or saying in another way excluding the provision we booked for gap purposes for this quarter isrs revenue is subject to a provision for $2200000 including interest bringing the cumulative provision at march 31 to $16900000 overall whether this quarter was warmer than normal by eleven in missouri and by 26 in alabama compared to last year is colder weather we saw margins and missouri decline by $3000000 as slightly lower residential volume metric margins were offset by higher net isrs revenues combined with a significant drop in commercial markets our southern utility showed margin growth as lower demand was offset by annual rate increases margins were also significantly below our expectations of normal weather and mitigation mechanisms that offset that exposure again in our southern service territory is the mechanisms largely worked as planned in missouri however we saw a $7000000 negative impact to margins against normal weather consisting of two components 1st wnar this new weather normalization tool was introduced in our last rate proceeding and should ensure that we get the right recovery of the residential volume metric charge not over collecting in cold periods not under collecting in warmer ones while the mechanism did address a portion of our weather deficiencies this quarter we estimate that it was ineffective by six or roughly $5000000 secondly we saw a short fall in commercial and industrial margins that do not have weather mitigation in missouri even for smaller more weather sensitive customers total impact here was about $2000000 we clearly have some work to do both working with our regulators to improve the effectiveness of our weather mitigation and our next missouri rate proceeding and two generating earnings from other sources in the back half of 2020 to offset some of this happen there were two other key variances this quarter zero m expenses and other expenses as outlined here on slide one total zero m expenses as reported were down $12600000 and although we have a history of cost control this reduction reflects the benefit of a regulatory deferral of a pension remeasured charge with the offsetting expense recorded in other expenses as shown here excluding this adjustment our run rate utility zero m was up $2900000 or twosixty due to higher operations and employee costs the remaining zero m expenses represent higher marketing costs due to our business growth and a cost of spire stl pipeline which is now in operations the other key variances in other expenses with a run rate increase after the adjustment for the peasant pension re measurement of $6500000 reflecting two items 1st prior year spire stl pipeline afudc which no longer exists is now inter operating numbers and secondly a $3600000 swing in returns on investments held the support on non qualified benefit plans not surprisingly this year we saw unrealized losses this quarter compared to a much stronger earning stream in the 1st quarter of 201 i would note that the explanation of all cost variances contribution margins as well as our review of our year to date results are included in the appendix to this presentation for your reference you know since the health crisis began we have been focused on our liquidity position hearkening back to our flight book from the great recession we moved aggressively with the assistance of our bank group to draw on our credit facility in mid march as the commercial paper market became uneconomic in late march we secured $150000000 term loan to provide additional liquidity and we stand in a strong financial position with total available liquidity at march 31 of $661000000 and a solid long term capitalization as well in fact we issued equity early in the quarter with proceeds of just under $10000000 as we turn to the coronavirus impacts on our operating results a bit of perspective roughly seventy of our earnings and margins are residential and the current health crisis fit near the end of the winter heating season where we earn a majority of our return as a result we have been relatively insulated so far from the economic downturn we are watching closely our commercial and industrial customers especially the smaller firms who are bearing the brunt of the of the current shutdown and we are tracking the incremental costs that the actions that steve and suzanne touched on a few minutes ago now none of us have a crystal ball to predict how this situation will play out based on what we know today including data and regional economic projections we have constructed a forecast of key impacts based upon the following assumptions from an economic standpoint continuation of the downturn through this quarter and then a slow ramp up in activity that will stretch at least through the rest of calendar 2020 from an operational standpoint normal weather or return of normal collection activities disconnection and late payment fees as well as minimal disruption for our construction crews based on these assumptions we have estimated the following financial impacts as a result of our moratorium on fees we anticipate losing fee revenue of roughly $1900000 we have seen some decline in our commercial and industrial margins reflecting both the temporary shutdowns of large manufacturers and the anticipated lower demand from our smart commercial accounts we estimate that impact to be approximately $2200000 we have not yet seen any appreciable change in our residential margins and we will continue to monitor that closely however we are anticipating a significant increase in bad deaths in the coming quarters to estimate our exposure we went back to our records for the last recession in 2008 and 2009 when we saw bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue increase about twenty basis points over normal levels flying that experience to our current book of business results in an estimated exposure of $3500000 and of course we are tracking other direct costs including the cost of pp e enhanced facility cleaning employee costs for lost time among others we are pursuing opportunities to offset these headwinds including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result of stay at home orders such as travel and we are finding additional operating efficiencies we are also working with our regulators as steve mentioned both as we have been to deal with the immediate impacts to our customers and our business during the quarter and now discussing potential regulatory treatment of the increased costs including bad debts and the cost of responding to the health crisis and helping our customers recover stepping back our estimates are based upon a current view of the economic recovery and as you can see we have provided sensitivities on each of these key exposures to gauge the impact under a different sets of assumptions looking forward we remain on solid ground and are focused on growth as steve mentioned we have upgraded our capital investment target for the year to $640000000 in addition we have updated our five year capital investment target now through 2024 to $2800000000 that level of investment is driven by utility infrastructure upgrades and should drive rate based growth of between seven and eight for the forecast period in addition we reaffirm our long term net economics per share growth target of four to seven and given the current uncertainty surrounding the resolution of our missouri disrupts recovery we will continue to refrain from bps guidance for fiscal year 2020 at this time and finally our financing plans remain on track with only modest equity needs for the remainder of 202 so in summary we are in solid shape and remain focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders with that let me turn it back over to you suzanne thank you steve and steve as we close today is presentation i think it is important to take a moment to acknowledge the strength of our collective energy buyers utilities have been operating for more than 160 years thanks to great leadership great partnerships and a legacy of hardworking caring employees we have survived wars the great depression weather disasters and the 1918 influenza pandemic the law of successful history and with the support of our investors our communities and our public policy leaders we will work our way through the impact of the coronavirus we will do it together and we will do it in a way that brings sustained long term value for our shareholders customers and the communities we serve before we open for questions i would like to thank spire is employees many whom are listening to this webcast i know how hard you work and i know how much you care about one another our customers and the communities that we live and work in you make me proud every day and i am forever grateful for the way you rally to answer challenges you are leaders you are conveners you are helpers you are heroes you understand that fundamentally energy exists to help people and you give your all to deliver energy safely reliably and with all your heart to the investors and analysts on the call today we would like to thank you for your investment and the trust you place in us on behalf of our board of directors our executive team and our employees we take that trust very seriously especially during these uncertain times we look forward to seeing you again soon either as part of the upcoming virtual aga financial forum or other virtual conferences and road shows in the months ahead of course we look forward to the time when we can once again meet face to face until then we wish you well and trust that you will stay safe and healthy now we will take your questions we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star then one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star then two at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster the 1st question comes from richie ci ciciarelli with bofa securities please go ahead hey good morning hope everyone is healthy and safe today appreciate you taking my questions just had a couple here on isrs can you just go over the the difference between the two versions of the the house and senate bill and and where you ultimately expect that that to land once it gets reconciled and then on the recent settlement with the isrs filing where i guess what changed this time around with the opc where you were able to garner a se a settlement there hi richie this is steve lindsey and i appreciate you calling in this morning on your 1st question relative to the legislation in in terms of the content of our portion there is really not that much different between the house and senate bills what you have are some some things that that get attached as as they go through the process and so really we are fairly consistent with those bills and again if you go back to what they are trying to accomplish it is to really reinforce what the intent of the statute was when it was put in place over fifteen years ago which is around infrastructure upgrades particularly around bare steel and cast iron and and to really just kind of caught it by some of that in terms of the language so i do not think there is a lot of difference between those two and that is why when it goes back to the committee for reconciliation there will be some cleanup relative to the things that are attached there relative to your your 2nd part of the question in terms of the stipulation i think we have just been working collectively and and again we we felt this way all along that that the pipe that we have been replacing meets all the requirements relative to what needs to be part of the infrastructure upgrades included in the isrs program even to the fact that we still agree that that the plastics that we have been replacing are much more efficient way to upgrade our system but this primarily focused on the bare steel and cast iron and did they meet those criteria we are providing additional evidence but i think in terms of the reason that we got to this is because we continued to work together to to strongly support again the intent of of why we have been replacing this pipe around safety reliability and efficiency of operating our systems so i think it is i think it is progress if you want to look at it that way and again even with the cases that are still there we will continue to present evidence and hopefully make our case around the pipe that had been replaced in previous years is the same criteria that we are using going forward got it thank you that is that is very helpful and then just around your your capex profile i think you might have been been one of the few companies that raised their spending this year for 202 just curious what is given you the increased competence to ex execute on on the plan this year given the the headwinds with with covid related pressures hey richie this is steve great question a couple of things 1st of all i guess the downside the warmer weather that has impacted our margins is it does give us a little bit better working conditions on our capital spend and as as steve talked about we had a strong winter season and now we are heading into the the heart of our capital spend so i think that is point number one and then number two you know playbook for utilities as we look at how we can best try to offset both the headwinds from weather and also the headwinds from coronavirus that we talked about ramping up our capital spend is one of those activities it is clearly something that helps get us back to work and we are doing it with the cooperation and understanding of all the leaders throughout our states and our jurisdictions and i think it is just helping us to ensure that not only are we doing the right thing by upgrading our infrastructure but we are also doing it in a way that is going to make us more resilient as we go forward so i think that it is really just an evolution of all those things and again you have seen us ramp up and and ramp down in the past and we think this is an opportunity for us to ramp up a little bit and and richie this is the other steve let me follow up from an operational perspective i would like to reinforce that as we and again while this past quarter was only really several weeks in terms of the measurement period we never stopped working and and you will hear some businesses talk about return to work we talked about more of the transition and if you think about it from a construction and capital perspective we we really did not take our foot off the gas we obviously changed some of our processes and procedures relative to personal protective equipment and and to be quite honest we limited going into customer is homes to do service tie overs and change overs we will go back and do that but but again in terms of the infrastructure that we have been working on and will continue to that really did not slow down and that is a great tribute to our our our frontline and boys the management that is out there that that really put you know pulled together if you think about our three strategic areas of focus one of those is innovation and we got innovative in the way we are continuing to think about our work the other part i would just want to reinforce is that our capital for these type programs is fairly evenly distributed across our three major operating areas in terms of the side of missouri west and alabama and so we are not just impacted in one area in terms of and upper back we are fa fairly evenly spread even with the new business as well so if you think about that increase that we saw a year to date of of nearly ten that are referenced that is pretty evenly spread across all of our operating companies which i think gives us a good balance as well yeah thank you very much i appreciate it all right that is all i had thanks the next question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse please go ahead hi good morning hi hi hey i was wondering if you guys have a better sense at all how whether legislation would preclude the need for a ruling at the supreme court or not you know at this point you know after conferring with your own lawyers and maybe outside counsel michael this is steve the the the supreme court opportunity at least for that the ruling that came out of the appellate court has already passed they they opted not to take the zero i get it the appeal that we end the public service commission went forward so really the the legislation that steve lindsey talks about is the best opportunity for a longer term fix we obviously are continuing to work with missouri public service commission the staff the opc and the other interveners to not only crispin up the the support for our filings but then also to get to a more unified view going forward of what makes sense for our customers and i i would just say too that is consistent with when we started this journey we pursued a regulatory legislative and judicial outcome and so all three of those paths so we are on track with what we strategically set out to begin with what is the july 16th decision that we are waiting on what is that okay so so this would be a d this is on the cases that were remanded back to the commission so once they go back to the public service commission they in essence have 120 days to make a decision based on those cases that that did not go through to the supreme court so so you have got several moving parts that are going on here from the legislative perspective and regulatory but but that is on the cases that were under appeal that have been remanded back to the commission zero those dec the decision you are referencing there is the decision by the regulators right on the right yeah this is it has been remanded back to the missouri commission yes got it i got it okay and on the guidance the long term guidance the base year is still 2019 or is there a base year yeah you know i i i chuckle michael it is a fair question i i think the answer is if you look at our capital spend program over five years and driving rate based growth of seven to eight we expect that we should be able to drive the kind of growth that we have talked about in the longterm over the bottom line i chuckle because we are all dealing with and we have spent a lot of time and i know our peers are because you have been on those calls a lot of time dealing with the current situation yeah and the fullness of time as we understand what is happening in in in the current year 2020 we will find a way to rebase and make sure everybody understands but right now we are just trying to make sure that we and our customers get through this year and we do it in a fashion that we feel good about so that when we hit 2021 and beyond we are hitting it at full steam with our customers coming along for the ride yeah that would be my understanding i mean i think a lot of people are trying to look through 2020 as a abnormal year so that is just wanted to see what it is definitely to be an abnormal year yeah yeah i think a lot of people would like to look through this year all right thank you very much guys and stay safe and healthy thanks again if you have any questions please press star then one the next question comes from brian with please go ahead hi good morning good morning brian good morning brian hey just curious on the weather normalization mechanism in missouri that was you know ineffective what you know structurally what made it ineffective and what would you need to do it in in in so far as you know further discussions with regulators and or you during your next rate case to fix it or can it be perfect all right well good morning this is steve lindsey thanks for the question and i wish i knew all the answers to that because it is a very complex formula i think the one thing i would say is is we have something in place now that we did not have before which is positive it did help but it did not completely address the the the differences between weather obviously and and and the volumes and the revenue so but i think there is a couple pieces to it one is and i think that steve mentioned this 1st of all it does not even include the small commercial class and some of those others that are really weather sensitive and look and behave a lot like the residential class so i think that is one opportunity that if you look at other weather normalization mechanisms in the country they do include that so so that is clearly an opportunity the other is that it is it is not linear and and what i mean by that is every day is not the same every week is not the same as you go through the month so you could have some outcomes that show results days that did not really translate to the way gas load from a customer is perspective so i think there is opportunity as we move forward and and again it is a it is a start it is not perfect we recognize that and we think we will be able to make a pretty strong presentation as to where the deficiencies are because again the program is intended to mitigate risk as as steve indicated if it is too cold we should not benefit if it is too warm we should not be harmed and it is really to try to tighten that band and and what we would look to do going forward is to tighten the band even closer than than what it is now got it and and re remind me what percent of the overall bill is a fixed charge yeah you know and that that roughly depends on you know the the type of year that you are having but it could be 25 twenty to 25 i think based on a residential customer and again that that has variability obviously based on the type of winter that you have because that is where most of the volumetric fees comes down okay great and just on the supreme court denial of your request for rehearing remind remind me how how many 1000000s of dollars of revenues is that and when might that impact net economic earnings is it after a committed decision so the little part of july or you know from a a legal perspective do you you now have i do not know more clarity as to you know the the the recovery or of those costs you know i am curious to when a provision might be taken against net economic earnings yeah brian this is steve rasche there is a there is a detailed chart in the appendix to our presentation that you can take a look at which really outlines the various layers of isrs the total provision that is the total of all the collections that are included in the rulings that were that are part of the appellate court decision and then the supreme court is decision not to take it on are $16900000 and that we continue to collect on those and we are collecting 2000000 and change every quarter so up until the time that the missouri public service commission makes a final determination we will continue to collect those collect those funds i would point out there are various components of that of that 16900000 part of it has to do with the conclusion whether bare steel was worn out and deteriorated and another component about incidental plastics that are replaced along with longer lines of the the cast iron of bare steel and the public service commission is going to have to weigh in based upon the remand from the appellate court on each one of those and when they reached their decision and that is that july 15th date that we have been talking about then the commission will not only decide on the on how to handle each of those individual isrs determinations but it will also have determined whether or not determined whether or not the the amounts will be refunded to the extent they determined there is a refund or if the the amounts will be used in some other fashion and the commission has full rights to be able to decide how they want to handle that so again that is at that point once we have a determination from the public service commission then i think we are we are obviously obligated to take a look at our net economic earnings calculation and to the extent that those revenues are now not going to be earned revenues or earnings and then we would adjust our economics measure at that and just to keep it in perspective of the 69 a little over $4000000 of that impacts our current year vast majority of it was the initial provision that we booked at for the last fiscal year okay got it understood and then just on the the equity if if i heard you correctly you issued 10000000 of equity in the fiscal 2nd quarter and that satisfied your needs for the entire year no i mean if you go to our our guidance page you can see that we have we have a guided range of of equity of $fifty to $100000000 is our total need for the year so in the 1st quarter we knocked out roughly 10000000 of that at the low end and and the beauty of where we stand is we we do have an ongoing discussions with our rating agencies we we do have some leverage and some cushion in our our credit metrics which are the ones that everybody is always looking at so we do believe that we will be in the equity markets later this year as long as the markets continue to rebound in an orderly fashion but it is not anything we have to do but i think our preference is in order to maintain strong credit metrics and a balanced capital structure that it would be appropriate for us to get in the range of the equity that we have guided in our longterm guidance okay and then the the february stipulation on 11100000 revenues under isrs is that what you filed for boy we filed for the the reason why i am struggling brian is that we filed for a lot of different numbers because we filed for amounts that had not been awarded for plastics and prior filings i i think the best number to think about in terms of what was our net expectation in terms of what we were going to get out of the filing it was probably in i do not have it off the top of my head it was in the high eleven sort of close to $12000000 range and there is always some difference between what we expect and what we actually get because our isrs filings generally include 45 to sixty days worth of forecast at capital spend and so that always gets trued up in a rate case and and that is clearly what happened in this in this filing for isrs i am sorry okay and when does the missouri legislature end this year well you know we are we are kind of writing the playbook as we go right now there is probably at least another couple of weeks of session i know that again this is this is not a special session this was just to start up again and we were we were very pleased to be included as part of the legislation as being considered but we we came out or or as we talked about we are out of both chambers and now we are in reconciliation so so we knew that ours is moving forward at a pace that the at least we are we are pleased so far okay got it thank you so much right thanks the next question comes from please go ahead thank you good morning lots have been asked and answered so just a few follow ups and clarification if i could just following up on that last question so we will get a legislative response one way or another by the end of the month if that is successful then can you does that have any impact on sort of the july outcome in your opinion well i w i would say that it does not directly because it is looking forward but i think it what it does is is give some hopefully guidance to the commission that that what we have been again operating under the assumption though for over fifteen years has been validated and has been cleaned up if you will and this legislation again we think that everything we have been doing from this point forward from when the program went into place has been has met those requirements i think this reinforces that so hopefully from the commissions perspective they can use that as as as part of their decision making in that the the the infrastructure that we have been upgrading does meet these requirements okay and i am i am sure everyone on the phone is aware of it it is not it is not unusual for a house to produce a bill and then the senate sent over to the other chamber this in this case the senate they pretty much write it the same way but not exactly the same way so then the committees are created and as steve said it goes to conference so that they can settle those those differences so that is that is not unusual at all in the legislative process right let me just ask this your bill is not attached or it does not include other things that would be controversial per se so if it could get to the governor is desk i think he is in i would not call it i would not call it controversial but like a lot of bills you know they are they are written in one chamber for a specific need and then it goes to the other chamber and the other chamber adds other elements which is what happened in this instance so that is when the two committees come together in conference and sort of clean the bill up to and that is where we are and again that is not uncommon okay i think you referenced additional investment in store or in storage for 10000000 how much more is to go there this is steve we are still in the process of figuring out what our longterm development plan is obviously given some other things we have been focused on you know we are clearly very pleased with the operational performance of the storage field this winter and you saw that in the improved operating results and we but we have not yet come up with the longer range plan but what our commitment to to our investors and to you all is that we will continue to bring you along for the journey and so as we think about the amount that we are going to spend between now and the next call that is the $10000000 that we increased in our in our capital spend target for this year okay and then just kind of going back to the ineffectiveness of the weather mitigation and i know you guys are looking at ways to improve that does that will that have to wait really until you go through your next rate case in order to be improved or could it be improved before then that would be yes so so your your your questions basically how to answer it it is a part of the overall rate rate structure and so that will be part of our next rate filing yes which i would say again that is not unusual the key requirements of a rate case is to set revenue requirement and rate design and it is rare very rare for commissions to take up either rate design or revenue requirement outside of a rate case it does occur but it is you know it is very rare and i would just add on i get a little bit of the floor here it is it is not unusual either for these mitigation mechanisms to be in place as a starting point because they are complex and there are different classes of customers that even when they are in those classes people use energy in different ways either all heating or some are more year round and those sorts of things so they are they are a bit complex so i like steve and steve mentioned i was glad to see the commission work with us and start and we will continue to refine as we pop cases over time all right i appreciate it thank you very much thank you again if you have a question please press star then one the next question comes from richard sunderland with j p morgan please go ahead hi good morning just just one for me today thanks for taking the time the the stl pipeline additional capacity if if i missed this earlier apologies but any update on discussions around contracting that and i would imagine there have been some impacts from covid some maybe expectations at this point if any yeah thank you for the question you know we will continue to look for opportunities but right now 1st of all i want to confirm that it did go into service and served the side of the state very well as we went through the winter we will continue to operate that pipeline the way it was designed to do and access gas from the northeast to bring to this side for our customers here again as as as opportunities emerge but i think a lot of those opportunities have probably been been been put on a standstill right now as we are going through some of these challenges but those opportunities are out there we will continue to pursue those with the additional capacity so just just to follow up real quick the the opportunities as you see them would those potentially be as soon as say 2021 or is this more of a long dated opportunity to put additional contracts in place and then i guess eventually add compression yeah so yeah good question we have shared with you in the past we absolutely can add compression to the pipeline and again i want to echo steve is comment from an operational perspective the the pipeline has performed very well this past winter even i mean it is against the backdrop of a warmer winter but we were able to exercise that pipe pretty well and from pressure and flows and so forth it operated again very well there is additional capacity and we can add compression and there is a market and i suspect some of that will depend on how the natural gas and and industry plays out over time there has been a lot going on in our industry as far as wells and lock ins and supply sources and those kinds of things so we will we will sort that over time that the the pipeline operationally and there is a market city behind it so we will we will see how that plays out thanks for the update yeah thank you thank you again if you have a question please press star then one at this time there are no further questions so this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to scott dudley for any closing remarks well thank you all for joining us i know it is a busy earnings day we are going to be around throughout the rest of the day and we will look forward to catching up with many of you then thanks and be safe the

please note this event is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to scott dudley managing director investor relations please go ahead hello this is susan sipherwood president and ceo of webcast and you may download it either from the webcast site or from our website under investors and then events and presentations presenting on the call today are susan sipherwood president and ceo steve lindsey executive vice president and chief operating officer and steve rashi executive vice president and cfo before we begin let me cover our safe harbor statement today is call including responses to questions may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 although our forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions there are various uncertainties and risk factors that may cause future performance or results to be different than those anticipated these risks and uncertainties are outlined in our quarterly and annual filings with the sec in our comments we will be but we are going to look at economic earnings contribution margin adjusted eva and adjusted long term capitalization which are all non gap measures used by management when evaluating our performance and results of operations explanations and reconciliations of these measures to their gap counterparts are contained in our news release and the slide presentation so with that i will turn the call over to suzanne thank you scott and good morning to everyone joining us for our 2nd quarter update i would like to begin by acknowledging that we are all adjusting to a new normal as we focus on staying safe and healthy during the coronavirus we are living in a world of video calls facetime webinars working from home wearing masks and washing our hands a lot and we are connecting in new ways like you many of us are not in our offices and are not able to see one another face to face in fact today is the 2nd time in nearly two months that i have seen my colleagues it is not easy to stay connected in times like this as fire connecting with us should feel like a handshake at the front door but without the ability to actually shake someone is hand we found ourselves leaning into other expressions of caring and friendship like how we listen how we check in how we show up how we smile and wave to strangers it is how our crew stops work take off their hats and put their hands over their heart when a funeral procession drives by these moments of connection and caring inspire the good in all of us and provide the energy it takes to walk through a time like this a time when some communities are impacted more than others but none go untouched a time when we understand we have a very clear mission that guides us answer every challenge advance every community and enrich every life through the strength of our energy you see we believe we are called to answer this and every challenge that arises we know that people rely on our energy every day and that we are an essential service we know that we cannot let our customers and communities down and we know that safety is a core value a value at the heart of every decision it is because of this deeply held belief that we set in motion a broad range of protective steps to address the coronavirus health crisis and its economic impact we began in early march by activating our incident support team or the ist a cross functional team of 25 leaders from operations and all our shared services the ist has been meeting nearly every morning to discuss challenges solve issues and coordinate actions from hr policies to supply chain chain access to ppe and impact to employees by the middle of march we activated the highest level of our crisis response plan by convening our crisis management team or cmt i asked steve lindsey to lead this team as fire inc is chief operating officer steve immediately gathered all of our chief officers and business unit presidents to quickly make executive decisions around broad ranging challenges steve will talk more about this in a moment from my perspective i would like to say that it has been inspiring to watch the ist and cmt work together together we bring a collection of expertise to our conversations from the very professional perspective of fire leadership to our external involvement with the american gas association and our firsthand conversations with medical experts via the many hospital boards we serve on together we are careful to balance the needs of our many stakeholders including you we are committed we are connecting early and often with all employees and customers we are connecting regularly with our board and keeping our governors legislators and regulators informed every step of the way most importantly the cmt is keenly aware of the impact our decisions have on people and in everything we do our goal is to flatten the curve and help control the spread of coronavirus while safely and reliably providing energy for our customers and communities our largest operations are in missouri and alabama areas of the country that have been minimally impacted by the pandemic in fact only eleven of our 3500 employees have tested positive for the coronavirus and all but one person is back to work so as we work to meet the challenges created by the coronavirus we remain focused on our strategy to deliver growth and value by growing organically investing in infrastructure we continue to take steps to ensure that we remain strong both financially and from an operations perspective we will hear more on that from steve and steve when they discuss our capital spending including investments in new business and infrastructure upgrades as well as our updated catbec forecast that supports our long term growth outlook as reported in our earnings announcement this morning our 2nd quarter net economic earnings for share are expected to be in the range of ¢twelve to ¢fourteen per share as steve rasky will discuss in more detail the results were driven by lower margins due to warmer weather across our footprint margins that were not fully mitigated by regulatory mechanisms however our results were minimally impacted by the coronavirus and finally we will spend some time updating you on our process as we continue to pursue favorable regulatory outcomes across our jurisdictions but the focus on the focus on the with that i will turn the call over to steve lindsey to discuss our results and coronavirus responses in more detail thank you susan i want to begin by acknowledging the outstanding efforts of our employees during the difficult times brought on by the coronavirus and the resulting economic shutdown you are providing great service to our customers while taking extra care to ensure their health safety and well being as well as your own and helping to support our communities in this time of need and we all thank you very much suzanne mentioned we quickly activated the cmt with ten primary areas of focus this morning i would like to take a moment to outline the steps we have taken to address the coronavirus and its impact on three of those areas employees customers and communities keeping these stakeholders healthy safe and supported is more than a priority for us it is a core value it is who we are as a company for our employees we have educated everyone on healthy practices and encouraged people to follow the advice of the experts including the cdc including the cdc and other public health organizations our guidelines include staying home when not feeling well frequent hand washing social distancing and other best practices we implemented policies to help employees handle the impacts of the coronavirus including taking care of family members or dealing with children being home from school an example of this is the implementation of our emergency leave program for our field workers and technicians we have taken extra safety precautions to protect them and our customers we pre screen our customers premise to ensure that no one is sick or symptomatic before we allow our workers to enter a home or business and we equip our employees with personal protective equipment for our office based employees we implemented a work from home policy starting in march and extending through may along with work from home and social distancing we have also implemented related policies to eliminate all non essential travel as well as group meetings and gatherings and across our company we stepped up the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing our work locations currently we are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and customers developing work transition plans that include reopening offices and facilities for our customers we are 1st and foremost focused on making sure they are well served and that they continue to receive safe and reliable energy that they can rely on regardless of the situation at hand help reduce customer contact and limit the potential for spreading the illness postpone work that was not time critical or urgent and to help our customers through what is surely a difficult time financially as our regulators suspend involuntary disconnections and late fees through the end of may while also expanding customer bill assistance programs as a company we have pledged $500000 in matching gifts to augment the contributions made by customers and employees into our dollar help program 1000s of customers have already signed up to give and their matched gifts total more than $300000 so far similarly we have donated $250000 to local area food pantries and meal programs we are from alabama to wyoming helping provide about 650000 meals for families struggling to make ends meet during this time we also led an effort with other companies to donate and set up laptops for children in limited income schools so they are able to learn from home since we are all in this together we have been coordinating and staying in close communication with various state and local government bodies healthcare organizations and industry groups to ensure that we are doing most good by leveraging our collective energy and resources while we have been hard at work to address the impacts of the coronavirus and serve our customers well we have also remained focused on our business objectives centered on growing our company we continue to invest in organic growth and infrastructure upgrades across our utilities for the 1st half of fiscal 2020 we invested $53000000 in new business keeping up with last year is record levels of investment and new premise activations as you can see our investment in our utilities is expanding here today we are announcing a new solar project that will bring clean renewable energy to our customers this project is part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility we are proud to be leading the way in this important initiative we have invested $279000000 focused on new business and pipeline replacement that is up $24000000 or nearly ten for the 1st half of last year on the gas related business side our spend is actually down year over year largely reflecting the completion of the spire stl pipeline for the full year of fiscal 2020 we have increased our planned capital spend to $640000000 up $30000000 from our prior forecasted investment 2020 will be on our gas utilities with two thirds of the increase or about $20000000 attributeable to utility investment we also plan to invest $10000000 in the 3rd quarter at spire storage regulatory mechanisms we have including incentives to accelerate system upgrades in missouri and alabama and real time rate making in alabama are key to timely recovery and support infrastructure modernization earnings growth and better environmental outcomes as you know from our discussion last quarter in missouri we have been working through a number of isrs cases decided by the missouri public service commission going back to 2016 that have been challenged and appealed by the office of public counsel and resulted in adverse appellate court rulings late last year at the time of the appeal court orders we said we would pursue all avenues legislative judicial and regulatory to preserve the ability to continue investing in safety reliability environmental performance of our pipeline system while achieving timely recovery to start of the missouri legislative session in january we worked to introduce bills in both the house and senate to clarify the ista statute as relates to the eligibility of infrastructure upgrade spending for accelerated recovery the senate bill passed early march on may six the house passed the substitution of the senate bill given the differences between the versions passed in each chamber the legislation will now go to conference committee meanwhile we have continued to file new esrs requests including one in early february late last month we the staff of the missouri public service commission and the office of public counsel reached a unanimous stipulation and agreement subject to missouri psc approval that would result in an $11000000 annualized increase in esrs revenue regarding the cases subject to the appeals court rulings these have been remanded back to the missouri public service commission for final resolution following the denial of our request for the missouri supreme court review in mid march the commission has 120 days or until the middle of july to render a decision including whether any refund is required for anyone who would like more detail on the various issues cases there is a table in the appendix of our slide presentation today finally in alabama we have been implementing new off system sales and capacity release program that went into effect december 1st we are also continuing to pursue the benefits of the accelerated depreciation of the equipment good morning everyone let me add my wishes for good health and safety to everyone and a huge shout out to all of our 1st responders healthcare workers and our own team who continue to serve bravely everyday the financial impact of coronavirus and an update to our targets for the 2nd half of our fiscal year 2020 according to our results for the quarter we delivered consolidated net economic earnings of $144000000 down $3900000 from last year our gas utility post their earnings is just over $144000000 down $2400000 from last year as a result of warmer weather and losses on investments marketing deliveries of just over $5000000 down just over $1000000 from last year as higher volumes from our expansion were offset by less favorable market conditions and higher costs and we saw higher earnings from the spirasco pipeline which entered service last quarter a lower loss from our fort worth storage reflecting the benefits of our operational improvements and slightly higher corporate costs looking at our per share results current year earnings are expected to be in the range of onethirty to oneforty per share ¢75 per share were down ¢fifteen from last year reflecting lower earnings as well as the impact of preferred and common stock issued over the last twelve months i would offer two additional comments 1st as susan mentioned we saw limited financial impact from the coronavirus this quarter since it really did not hit our service territories until mid march more on the forward impact in a few minutes and secondly as reflected here our earnings per share were down for this quarter interest revenues subject to a provision were $2200000 including interest bringing the cumulative provision at march 31 to $16900000 overall whether this quarter was warmer than normal by eleven in missouri and by 26 in alabama compared to last year is comparable period we saw margins in missouri decline by $3000000 as slightly lower residential volumetric margins were offset by higher net error risk revenues combined with a significant drop in commercial markets our southern utility showed margin growth as lower demand was offset by annual rating increases margins were also significantly below our expectations of normal weather and mitigation mechanisms that offset that exposure again in our southern service we saw margin growth as lower demand was offset by annual rating increases the mechanisms largely worked as planned in missouri however we saw a $7000000 negative impact to margins against normal weather consisting of two components 1st wnar this new weather normalization tool was introduced in our last rate proceeding and should ensure that we get the right recovery of the residential volumetric charge not overcollecting in cool periods not undercollecting in warmer ones while the mechanism is in place we need to ensure that we get the right recovery of the residential volumetric charge secondly we saw a shortfall in commercial and industrial margins that do not have weather mitigation in missouri even for smaller more weather sensitive customers total impact here was about $2000000 we clearly have some work to do both working with our regulators to improve the effectiveness of our weather mitigation and our next steps there were two other key variances this quarter onm expenses and other expenses as outlined here on slide thirteen total onm expenses as reported were down $12600000 and although we have a history of cost control this reduction reflects the benefit of a regulatory deferment of a pension remeasurement charge with the offsetting expense excluding this adjustment our run rate utility zero m was up $2900000 or twosix due to higher operations and employee costs the remaining zero m expenses represent higher marketing costs due to our business growth and the cost of the spr stl pipeline which is now in operations the other key variance is in other expenses with a run rate increase after the pension measurement two items 1st prior years firesttl pipeline afuvc which no longer exists is now in our operating numbers and secondly a $3600000 swing in returns on investments held to support our non qualified benefit plans not surprisingly this year we saw unrealized losses this quarter compared to a much stronger earning stream in the 1st quarter of 2019 you know since the health crisis began we have been focused on our liquidity position parkening back to our playbook from the great recession we moved aggressively with the assistance of our bank group to draw on our credit facility in mid march as the commercial paper market became on economic in late march we secured a bridge facility from our bank group and we stand in a strong financial position with total available liquidity at march 31 of $661000000 and a solid long term capitalization as well in fact we issued equity early in the quarter with proceeds of just under $10000000 as we turn to the coronavirus impacts on our operating results a bit of perspective roughly seventy of our earnings and margins are residential and the current health crisis hit near the end of the winter heating season where we earn a majority of our return as a result we have been relatively insulated so far from the economic downturn we are watching closely our commercial and industrial customers especially the smaller firms who are bearing the brunt of the of the current shutdown and we are tracking the incremental cost of the actions that steven susanne touched on a few minutes ago now none of us have a crystal ball to predict how this is going to play out based on what we know today including data and regional economic projections we have constructed a forecast of key impacts based upon the following assumptions from an economic standpoint continuation of the downturn through this quarter and then a slow ramp up in activity that will stretch at least through the rest of calendar 2020 from an operational standpoint normal weather a return of normal collection activities as well as minimal disruption for our construction crews based on these assumptions we have estimated the following financial impacts as a result of our moratorium on fees we anticipate losing fee revenue of roughly $1900000 we have seen some decline in our commercial and industrial margins reflecting both the temporary shutdowns of large manufacturers we anticipate a lower demand from our smaller commercial accounts we estimate that impact to be approximately $2200000 we have not yet seen any appreciable change in our residential margins and we will continue to monitor that closely however we are anticipating a significant increase in bad debts in the coming quarters to estimate our exposure we went back to our records for the last recession in 2008 and 2009 when we saw bad debt expense as a percentage of total assets we are increasing about twenty basis points over normal levels flying that experience to our current book of business results in an estimated exposure of $3500000 and of course we are tracking other direct costs including the cost of ppe enhanced facility cleaning employee costs for lost time among others we are pursuing opportunities to offset these headwinds including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result we are finding additional operating efficiencies we are also working with our regulators as steve mentioned both as we have been to deal with the immediate impacts to our customers and our business during the water and now discussing potential regulatory treatment of the increased costs including bad debt and the cost of responding to the health crisis and helping our customers recover stepping back our estimates are based upon a current view of the economic recovery and as you can see we have provided sensitivities on each of these key exposures to gauge the impact under a different set of assumptions looking forward we remain on solid ground and are focused on growth as steve mentioned we have upgraded our capital investment target for the year to $640000000 in addition we have updated our five year capital investment target now through 2022 to $1500000000 thank you that level of investment is driven by utility infrastructure upgrades and should drive rate based growth of between seven and eight for the forecast period in addition we reaffirm our long term net economics for shared growth target of four to seven and given the current uncertainty surrounding the resolution of our missouri basin recovery we will continue to refrain from fps guidance for fiscal year 2020 at this time and finally our financing plans remain on track with only modest equity needs for the remainder of 2020 so in summary we are in solid shape and remain focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders with that let me turn back over to you susan thank you steve and steve as we close today is presentation i think it is important to take a moment to acknowledge the strength of our collective energy firefighters utilities have been operating for more than a 100 years sixty years thanks to great leadership great partnership and a legacy of hard working caring employees we have survived wars the great depression weather disasters and the 1918 influenza pandemic the long successful history and with the support of our investors

you are using a speakerphone please pick up your hand set before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star then to at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster good morning i hope everyone is healthy and safe today appreciate you taking my question just had a couple here on iz hey richie this is steve lindsey and i appreciate you calling in this morning on your 1st question relative to the legislation in terms of the content of our portion there is really not that much difference between the house and senate bills what you have or some some things that get attached as they go through the process and so really we are fairly consistent with those bills and again if you go back to what they are trying to accomplish it is it is to really reinforce what the intent of the legislation is so it was when it was put in place over fifteen years ago which is around infrastructure upgrades particularly around bare steel and cast iron and to really just kind of codify some of that in terms of the language so i do not think there is a lot of difference between those two and that is why when it goes back to the committee for reconciliation there will be some clean up relative to the things that that are attached there relative to your your 2nd part of the question terms of the stipulation i think we have just been working collectively and and again we we felt this way all along that that the the the pipe the pipe the pipe is the pipe we have been replacing meets all requirements relative to what needs to be part of the infrastructure upgrades included in the yucca source program even to the fact that we still agree that that the plastics that we have been replacing are a much more efficient way to upgrade our system but this primarily focused on the bare steel and cast iron and did they meet those criteria we are providing additional evidence but i think in terms of the reason that we have got to this is because we continue to work together to to strongly support again the intent of of why we have been replacing this pipe around so i think it is progress if you want to look at it that way and again even with the cases that are still there we will continue to present evidence and hopefully make our case around the pipe that had been replaced in previous years is is the same criteria that we are using going forward great i thank you that is that is very helpful and then just around your your capex profile i think you might have been one of the few companies that raised your spending this year for 2020 just curious what is giving you the increased confidence to execute on the on the plan this year given the the headwinds with with covid related pressures hey rich this is steve great question couple things 1st of all i guess the downside of the warmer weather that has impacted our margins is it does give us a little bit better working conditions on our capital spend and as steve talked about we had a strong winter season and now we are heading into the the heart of our our capital spend so i think that point number one and then number two yeah playbook for utilities as we look at how we can best try to offset both the the headlunns from weather and also the headwinds from coronavirus that we talked about wrapping up our capital spend is one of those activities it is clearly something that helps get us back to work and we are doing with the cooperation and understanding of all the leaders throughout our states and our jurisdictions and i think is just helping us to ensure that not only are we doing the right thing by upgrading our infrastructure but we are also doing it in a way that is going to make us even more resilient as we go forward so i think that it is really just an evolution of all those things and again you have seen us ramp up and and ramp down in the past and we think this is an opportunity for us to ramp up a little bit and and richie this is the other steve let me follow up from an operational perspective i would like to reinforce that as we and again while this past quarter was only really several weeks in terms of the measurement period we never stopped working and and you will hear some businesses talk about return to work we talk about it more as the transition and if you think about it from a construction and capital perspective we we really did not take our foot off the gas we obviously changed some of our processes and procedures relative to personal protective equipment and and to be quite honest we limited going into customers homes to do service tieovers and and changeovers we will go back and do that but but again in terms of the infrastructure that we have been working on and we will continue to that really did not slow down and that is a great tribute to our our front line employees the management that is out there that that really you know pulled together if you think about our three strategic areas of focus one of those is innovation and we got innovative in the way we are continuing to think about our work the other part i would just want to reinforce is that our capital for these site programs is fairly evenly distributed across our three major operating areas in terms of the east side missouri west and alabama and so we are not just impacted in one area in terms of ratcheting up we are fairly evenly spread even with the new business as well so if you think about that increase that we saw year to date of of nearly ten that i referenced that is pretty evenly spread across all of our operating companies which i think gives us a good balance as well yeah added thank you very much i appreciate the call that is all i had the next question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse please go ahead hey i was wondering if you guys have a better sense at all how whether legislation would preclude the need for a ruling at the supreme court or not you know at this point after conferring with your own lawyers and maybe outside counsel i take the appeal that we and the public service commission put forward so really the legislation that steve lindsey talked about is the best opportunity for a longer term fix we obviously are continuing to work with the missouri public service commission the staff the opc and the other interveners to not only crisp up the the support for our filings but then also to get to a more unified view going forward and what makes sense for a compromise ok so this would be  this this is on the cases that were remanded back to the commission so once they go back to the public service commission they go through the process of having a hearing and then they make a decision and so the july 16th decision that we are waiting on is that ok so this would be  this this is on the cases that were remanded back to the commission so once they go back to the public service commission they go through the process of having a hearing and then they make a decision and so the july 16th decision that we are waiting on is that i have 120 days to make a decision based on those cases that that did not go through to the supreme court so you got several moving parts that are going on here from the legislative perspective and regulatory but but that is on the cases that that were under appeal that have been remanded back to the commission all those decisions the decision you are referencing there is the decision by the regulators on the remand right yeah and that had been remanded back to the missouri commission yes and got it i got it okay and on the guidance the long term guidance the base year is still 2019 yeah you know i chuckle michael it is a fair question i think the answer is if you look at our capital spend program over five years and driving great base growth at seven to eight we expect that we should be able to drive the kind of growth that we have talked about over the long term over the bottom line i chuckle because we are all dealing with and we have spent a lot of time and i know our peers are because you have been on those calls a lot of time dealing with the current situation and in the fullest of time as we understand what is happening in in the current year 2020 we will find a way to rebase and make sure everybody understands but right now we are just trying to make sure that we and our customers get through this year and we do it in a fashion that we feel good about so that when we hit 2021 and beyond we are hitting it at full steam with our customers coming along for the ride yeah that would be my understanding i mean i think a lot of people are trying to look through 2020 as  an abnormal year so yeah just wanted to see what that is about definitely going to be an abnormal year yeah i think a lot of people would like to look through this year alright thank you very much guys and stay safe and healthy hey just curious on the weather normalization mechanism in missouri that was quote unquote ineffective what you know structurally what made it ineffective and what would you need to do in so far as you know further discussions with regulators and or during your next ray case to fix it or can it ever be fixed perfect alright well good morning everyone this is steve lindsey thanks for the question and i wish i do all the answers to that because it is a very complex formula i think the one thing i would say is that we have something in place now that we did not have before which is positive it did help but it did not completely address the differences between weather obviously and and the volumes and the revenue so but i think there is a couple pieces to it one is and i think as steve mentioned is it does not even include the small commercial class and some of those others that are really weather sensitive and look and behave a lot like the residential class so i think that is one opportunity that if you look at other weather normalization mechanisms in the country they do include that so that is clearly an opportunity the other is that it is it is not linear and and what i mean by that is every day is not the same every week is not the same as you go through the month so you could have some outcomes that show results of degree days that did not really translate to the way gas flows from a customer is perspective so that is another opportunity i think there is opportunity as we move forward and and again it is it is a start it is not perfect we recognize that and we think we will be able to make a pretty strong presentation as to where the deficiencies are because again the program is intended to mitigate risk as as steve indicated if it is too cold we should not benefit if it is too warm we should not be harmed and it is really to try to tighten that band and and what we would look to do going forward is to tighten the band even closer than and what it is now got it and and remind me what is the percent of the overall ok great just on the supreme court denial i think that is where most of the volumetric piece comes in okay great and again that has variability obviously based on the type of winter that you have because that is where most of the volumetric piece comes in okay great and just on the supreme court denial i think that is where most of the volumetric piece comes in okay great and again that has variability obviously based on the type of winter that you have because that is where most of the volumetric piece comes in remind remind me how how many 1000000s of dollars of revenues is that and when might that it impact net economic earnings is it after a commission decision so the little part of july or you know from a legal perspective do you now have more clarity as to you know the the recovery or or you know the of those calls i am curious when a provision might be taken in the economic growth of an area hi this is steve brash there is  there is a detailed chart in the appendix to our presentation that you can take a look at which really outlines the various layers of isreal the total provision that is the total of all the collections that are included in the rulings that were that are part of the appendix to our presentation decision and then the supreme court is decision not to take it on is $16900000 and that we continue to collect on those and we are collecting $2000000 in change every quarter so up until the time that the missouri public service commission makes a final determination we will continue to collect those collect those funds i would point out there are various components of that of that $16900000 part of it has to do with the the conclusion whether cast iron bearing steel is worn out and deteriorated and another component about incidental plastic that are replaced along with longer lines of the cast iron bearing steel and the public service commission is going to have to weigh in based upon the remainder from the appellate court on each one of those and when they reach their decision and that is that july 15th date that we have been talking about then the commission will not only decide on that but also will consider the incidentals that are present in the cast iron bearing steel and how to handle each of those individual issue determinations but it will also determine whether or not determine whether or not the the amounts will be refunded to the extent they determine there is a refund or if the the amounts will be used in some other fashion and the commission has full right to be able to decide how they want to handle that so again at that and just to keep it in perspective of the 169 little or $4000000 that impacts our current year the vast majority of it was the initial provision that we booked ok got it understood and then just on the equity if i heard you correctly you issue $10000000 of equity in the fiscal 2nd quarter and that satisfies your needs for the entire year no i mean if you go to our our guidance page you can see that we have we have a guided range of up to a $100000000 as our total need for the year so in the 1st quarter we knocked out roughly 10000000 of that at the low end and the beauty of where we stand is we we do have and we are in ongoing discussions with our rating agencies we we do have some leverage and some cushion in our our credit metrics which are the ones that everybody is always looking at so we do believe that we will be in the equity markets later this year as long as the markets continue to rebound in an orderly fashion but it is not we have to do it i think our preference is in order to maintain strong credit metrics and a balanced capital structure that it would be appropriate for us to get in the range of the equity that we have guided in our long term guidance okay and then the february of stipulation for 11100000 revenues under isrs is that what you filed for boy we filed for a lot of stuff but we filed for that the reason why i am struggling brian is that we filed for a lot of different numbers because we filed for amounts that had not been awarded for plastics and prior filings i think the best number to think about in terms of what was our net expectation in terms of what we were going to get out of the filing it was probably and i do not have it off the top of my head it was in the high elevenths or low $12000000 range and there is always some difference between what we expect and what we get so what we expect in terms of what we actually get because our interest rate filings generally include 45 to sixty days worth of forecasted capital spent so that always gets true up in a rate case and and that is clearly what happened in this in this filing for us i am sorry and when does the missouri legislature end this year ok got it thank you very much the next question comes from selman akacil with stifel please go ahead thank you good morning lots has been asked and answered so just a few follow ups and clarifications if i could just following up on that last question so we will get a legislative response one way or another by the end of the month if that is successful then does that have any impact i would say that it does not directly because it is a looking forward but i think what it does is give some hopefully guidance to the commission that that what we have been again operating under the assumptions of for over fifteen years has been validated and has been cleaned up if you will in this legislation again we think that everything we have been doing from this point forward from when the program went into place has been has been met with the requirements i think this reinforces that so hopefully from the commission is perspective they can use that as as as part of their decision making and that the the infrastructure that we have been upgrading does meet these requirements and i am sure everyone on the phone is aware but it is not it is not unusual for a house to produce a bill and then the senate is sent over to the other chamber in this case the senate pretty much writes the same way but not exactly the same way so then the committees are created and as steve said it goes to conference so i think he is in i would not call it controversial but like a lot of bills you know they are written in one chamber for a specific need and then it goes to the other chamber and the other chamber adds that is when the two committees come together in conference and sort of clean the bill up so and that is where we are and again that is not uncommon ok i think you referenced additional investment in storage in storage for 10000000 how much more is to go there yeah tom and this is steve we are still in the process of figuring out what our long term development plan is you know we are clearly very pleased with the operational performance of the storage field this winter and you saw that in the improved operating results and we but we have not yet come up with the longer range plan but what our commitment to to our investors and to you all is that we will continue to bring you along for the journey and so as we think about the amount that we are going to spend between now and the next call that the $10000000 that we increased in our in our capital spend target for the year okay and then just kind of going back to the inefficiency of the weather mitigation and i know you guys are looking at ways to improve that does that will that have to wait really until you go through your next rate case in order to be improved or could it be improved before then that would be yeah yes so so your your question basically how to answer itself it is a part of the overall and so that would be part of our next rate filing yes which i would say again that is that is not unusual the two requirements of a rate case are set revenue requirement and rate design and it is very very rare for commissions to take up either rate design or revenue requirement outside of a rate case it does occur but it is you know it is very rare and i would just add on i will get a little bit of the floor here it is it is not unusual either either for these mitigation mechanisms to be we are starting point because they are complex and there are different classes of customers and even within those classes people use energy in different ways either all heating or some or more year round and those sorts of things so they are a bit complex so i like steven and steve mentioned i was glad to see the commission work with us and start and we will continue to refine as we see cases over time all right i appreciate it thanks very much again if you have a question please press star then one the next question comes from richard sunderland with j p morgan please go ahead we have had discussions around contracting that and i would imagine there have been some impacts from covid so maybe  expectations at this point if any they used to bring to this side for our customers here again as as opportunities emerge but i think a lot of those opportunities have probably been put on standstill right now as we are going through some of these challenges but as those opportunities are out there we will continue to pursue those with the additional capacity so just to follow up real quick the the opportunities as you see them would those potentially be as soon as say 2221 or is this more of a long dated opportunity to put additional contracts in place and then i guess eventually add compression yeah so yeah good question we have shared with you in the past we absolutely can add compression to the pipeline and again i want to echo steve is comment from an operational perspective the pipeline has performed very well this past winter even i mean it is against the backdrop of a warmer winter but we were able to exercise that pipe pretty well and from pressure and flows so 4th that operated again very well there is additional capacity and we can add compression and there is a market and i suspect some of that will depend on how the natural gas and and industry plays out every time there has been a lot going on in our industry as far as wells and lock ins and supply sources and those kinds of things so we will we will sort that every time but the pipeline operationally and there is a market sitting behind it so we will so we will see how that develops thanks for the update yeah thank you like you at this time there are no further questions so this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to scott daudelin for any closing remarks you may now disconnect",

differ materially from the results expressed or implied in forward looking statements these statements are based on management is current assessments and assumptions and they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties in addition we will also use certain non gaap financial measures we believe the supplementary information is a is useful to investors although it should not be considered superior to the measures presented in accordance with gaap a full description of these risks as well as financial reconciliations to non gaap terms are in our press release and fcc filing the press release can be found in the investor relations portion of our website and our form ten q which was also filed with the fcc shortly before this call a recording of today is call will be available for about a month and details for how to access that replay can also be found on our website with that i will now turn it over to our president and ceo mary berner mary thanks collin and good morning everyone in the 3rd quarter we continued to deliver against the goals we established at the start of the pandemic crisis maximizing revenue offsetting the virus impact through rigorous cost management and liquidity enhancement and ensuring that we emerge from the pandemic well positioned for long term success to those ends we grew revenue sequentially each month in the quarter with september finishing 35 higher than june we executed on our expense reduction plan realizing over 25000000 affixed cost savings in the quarter with the expectation of delivering more than 85000000 in 2020 we generated positive ebitda and cash from operations for the quarter bringing year to date free cash flow excluding m a and the abl draw to over 45000000 but we strengthened our balance sheet significantly completing the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transaction finishing the quarter with over 350000000 of cash a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to reinvestment and or additional debt pay down while the environment remains uncertain we now have the resources and flexibility to respond to opportunities that might arise from the disruption and invest in areas that will drive growth while continuing to improve our balance sheet on virtually all metrics our 3rd quarter results represented a significant improvement from q two same station revenue finished down 29 year over year but as i mentioned improved sequentially each month in terms of total dollars in the spot market which is arguably the best indicator of the overall health of the core radio business we saw year over year improvement each month both inclusive and exclusive of political dollars like last quarter our diary markets which were less affected by the pandemic shutdowns outperformed our ppm markets political as you might expect was clearly very strong as our footprint overlapped nicely with swing states we had 5800000 of political revenue in the quarter which was a new high water mark for a 3rd quarter and have benefited from that spending pace through the election government spending also contributed positively in the quarter and while still negative versus last year financial general services and professional services also outperformed other categories digital as a whole posted another quarter of growth while streaming and local digital marketing services remain pressured in the difficult macroclimate podcasting more than offset those declines up nearly fifty in the quarter podcasts or casting delivered record quarterly revenue reflecting our particularly strong news talk portfolio and our highest ever download count over 102000000 in september up 47 year over year also in the quarter we launched the new marketplace minute a short form three times a day briefing that highlights the most important stories about money business economy developed in partnership with american public media the marketplace minute is distributed across smart speakers broadcasting and podcasting marking the 1st time any public media company has partnered with a commercial audio company to extend its reach the min marketplace minute also serves as a great example of our effective use of partnerships to create exciting new content for podcasts audiences on the expense front we mentioned last quarter that we were targeting approximately 85000000 afis fixed cost reductions for the year including permanent reductions on an annual run rate of 36000000 more than 25000000 of these fixed cost savings were achieved in q three and we anticipate realizing more than 15000000 in q four many of these savings resulted from difficult decisions mandated by the pandemic induced revenue declines however others reflected changes in the way we expect to conduct our business in the future informed by new ways of operating developed during the pandemic and or developed to meet our evolving business needs for example we have consolidated some sales management and are in the process of centralizing our sales marketing research and insights efforts into one group that services the entire organization as opposed to the more fragmented ad channel configuration that was previously in place lastly we continue to find new ways to streamline business processes particularly in non revenue producing functions with the benefit of these cost takeouts and tight working capital management we delivered positive free cash for the 2nd straight quarter during the pandemic we further added to our cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transaction which brought our quarterly y qu quarter end cash balance to more than 350000000 these significant cash reserves not only provide us security with which to navigate the unpredictability of the months ahead but also the capability and flexibility to act on a creative opportunities that may come our way looking ahead as we move into the 4th quarter we continue to see positive momentum in bookings driven largely by political but also reflecting underlying improvement across all revenue streams current pacing is down in the mid teens versus last year with political providing about a 450 basis point benefit we remain guarded about the finish to the year given the recent acceleration of coronavirus infections across the country pol potential shutdown measures and reaction to that and the generally uncertain macro environment so for the remainder of the 4th quarter and likely well into 2021 while we hope for continued improvement our performance will remain highly sensitive to the shape and pace of external events however it goes without saying that we remain unrelentingly disciplined and focused on continuing to re engineer the business to maximize revenue and reduce our cost that said given our liquidity position more ex efficient expense profile and growth initiative we feel comfortable about our ability to not only stay the course but capitalize on the rebounding economy where and when it occurs and with that i will turn the call over to frank frank thank you mary i i will start by providing some more detail on the 3rd quarter speaking on a same station basis and follow that with some additional color on non operating items in q three total revenue was 196400000 down 29four from q three 2019 but an increase of 34five over q two total revenue as mary noted on a month basis we saw total revenue improvement as the quarter progressed with september revenue 35 higher than june spot and network markets performed comparably in the quarter down in the low 30s versus 2019 with digital slightly offsetting those results up two driven by our podcasting business which was up nearly fifty on an entirely organic basis digital dollars represented over ten of revenue in the quarter political spend accelerated as the quarter went on finishing at 5800000 versus 1700000 in q three 2019 and 3600000 in q three 2018 of note this was a record quarter for political and we are on track for another record quarter in q four moving down to p l expenses declined by 42000000 or nineteen driven by both reductions and bearable cost related to the revenue declines and active fixed cost reductions as mary mentioned we continue to expect to rea realize more than 85000000 in benefits in total this year from our fixed cost actions to date of these more than 25000000 were achieved in q three and more than 15000000 will be achieved in q four broken down between temporary and permanent effects about 19000000 of the 85000000 relate to permanent actions which have an annual expense benefit of approximately 36000000 the amount of the temporary cost that will return over time will largely depend on revenue recovery in 2021 putting revenues and expense together for the quarter ebitda finished at 20400000 normalizing for m a activity we once again grew our cash balance by 3500000 in the quarter bringing total free cashflow generation year to date excluding m a and the abl draw to more than 45000000 achieving this outcome despite the pandemic is the result of positive ebitda generation rigorous management of working capital and reduced cap backs as we said on our last call we cut our 2000 and tw 2020 cap back spend projection to 17000000 and with 4000000 spent in q three we are on track to deliver that our cash taxes this year have also been materially reduced from the combination of lower operating performance and cares act benefits so in q three we received approximately 2500000 of tax refunds related to taxes paid in 2019 i would also note that in q four working capital requirements coming from increased revenues bond interest payment and though small an estimated tax payment related to the gain on the tower sale will cause us to burn some portion of the free cash flow generated year to date we were pleased to announce about a month ago the initial closing of the tower transaction which provided a cash inflow of 202300000 under our debt agreements 64000000 the net proceed from the assets being sold and not leased back are required to pay down debt pro rata subject to a twelve month reinvestment right 96000000 of the proceeds from assets being sold or leased back were required to pay down debt immediately as such concurrent with the closing we paid down 49000000 of the term loan at par and on monday october 5th we launched a tender offer for 47200000 of senior secured bonds at par the tender offer was successfully completed on november 3rd we do expect to have subsequent closings for the remaining proceeds from the tower transaction by the end of the 1st half of 2021 additionally for tax purposes the gain in the transaction will largely be offset by anticipated net operating losses this year that debt now has been reduced by more than 330000000 since the beginning of the year and by more than 585000000 or 46 since the quarter that we emerged from bankruptcy as a reminder we do not have financial maintenance convenance in either our term loan or bonds and they do not mature until 2026 as mentioned on previous calls we are also still working through the potential monetization of the valuable piece of property in nashville that we hope to bring to market once commercial real estate activity approaches more typical levels lastly i wanted to note some new disclosure in our ten q related to ncaa based on the cancellation of march madness in 2020 we believe the rights fees 2020 season are not payable to ncaa the ncaa however chose to terminate the contract based on nonpayment of those fees on september 28th 2020 we and the ncaa filed competing lawsuits with regard to the dispute surrounding the agreement while it is always important for contract disputes to escalate to litigation and litigation can be unpredictable we believe in the merits of our position at this stage we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of the litigation but we will keep you informed as it progresses with that we can now open the line for q a operator thank you to ask a question you will need to press star one on your telephone keypad that is star one to withdraw your question press the pound or the hash key please stand by while we compile the q a roster and your 1st question comes from michael novo capital market thank you for taking the questions 1st of all i am i i was wondering you had mentioned that you have obviously now a large cash position it was and you indicated that you may not use all of that cash to pare down debt so i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about uses of cash and then also if there are m a opportunities what you may be looking at sure hi mike you know i i i think we characterize it as our huge cash position has put us in a fantastic s position to be defensive about the uncertainty that exists but as you point out also opportunistic in ways that we can use cash to drive value so obviously playing down debt remains a huge priority and we know there is a great return to use our cash that way however you know should interesting opportunities come our way we are open to considering that whether in radio or otherwise but we do recognize the high bar for expected return and i was just wondering as you were kinda giving us some thoughts about q four and and the and the pacings there can you just kinda give us a little bit about color on maybe spot versus network what you are seeing in digital just kind of give us a little bit more color on the on the individual line items in q four hi michael it is frank 1st let me comment about q three then i will give you a little bit more color on q four so q three had a a very nice recovery in both the spot and the network markets and as you heard in my prepared remarks they performed comparably but i will say that in the 3rd quarter the national spot improved considerably from the 2nd quarter as we got into a more normalized environment in the 4th quarter both channels are progressing nicely we are benefiting in the network from the return of the nfl which we are pleased with the the national markets are are stronger if you look at the local markets though part of the benefits we are getting in the local markets clearly political which displaces to some extent some of the local business so the trends at this point we are seeing is fairly strong but it is very and we are cautious with regard to the the pandemic and and the spread and it remains to be seen how that will impact the rest of the quarter and how did the bookings look as you go into december which is outside of the political realm of you know what you may have gotten for in in in october and november at this point we will really just comment on pacing as of this date and you will have more color obviously in our earnings call next year okay fair enough that is all i have thank you as a reminder to ask a question you will need to press star one on your telephone keypad that is star one to withdraw your question press the pound or the hash key please stand by while we compile the q a roster and there are no questions at this time okay thanks everybody thanks everybody for joining our call today thanks ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect",

goals we established at the start of the pandemic crisis maximizing revenue offsetting the virus is impact through rigorous cost management and liquidity enhancement and ensuring that we emerge from the pandemic well positioned for long term success to those ends we grew revenue sequentially each month in the quarter with september finishing 35 higher than the previous month thank you we executed on our expense reduction plan realizing over 25000000 of fixed cost savings in the quarter with the expectation of delivering more than 85000000 in 2020 we generated positive ebitda and cash from operations for the quarter bringing year to date free cash flow excluding m and n and the abl draw to over 45000000 we strengthened our balance sheet significantly completing the initial closing of our tower sale of our wireless tower assets and completing the divestiture of our paging assets finishing the quarter with over 350000000 of cash a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to reinvestment and or additional paydown while the environment remains uncertain we now have the resources and flexibility to respond to opportunities that might arise from the disruption and investment areas that will drive growth while continuing to improve our balance sheet on virtually all metrics our 3rd quarter results represented a significant improvement i am speaking on behalf of youth two same station revenue finished down 29 year over year but as i mentioned improved sequentially each month in terms of total dollars in the spot market which is arguably the best indicator of the overall health of the core radio business we saw year over year improvement each month both inclusive and exclusive of political dollars like last quarter our diary markets which were less affected by the pandemic shutdowns outperformed our expectations political as you might expect was clearly very strong as our footprint overlapped nicely with swing states we had 5800000 of political revenue in the quarter which was a new high watermark for a 3rd quarter and had benefited from that spending pace through the election government spending also contributed positively in the quarter and while still negative versus last year financial general services and professional services also outperformed other categories digital as a whole posted another quarter of growth while streaming and local digital marketing services remained pressured in the difficult macro climate podcasting more than offset those declines up nearly fifty in the quarter podcasters reporting delivered record quarterly revenue reflecting our particularly strong news talk portfolio and our highest ever download count over 102000000 in september up 47 year over year also in the quarter we launched the new marketplace minute a short forum three times a day briefing that highlights the most important stories about money business economy developed in partnership with american public media the marketplace minute is distributed across smart speakers broadcasting and podcasting marking the 1st time any public media company has partnered with a commercial audio company to extend its reach the marketplace minute also serves as a great example of our effective use of partnerships to create more content and reach more people on the expense front we mentioned last quarter that we were targeting approximately 85000000 of fixed cost reductions for the year including permanent reductions on an annual run rate of 36000000 more than 25000000 of these fixed cost savings were achieved in q three and we anticipate realizing more than 15000000 in q four many of these savings resulted from difficult decisions mandated by the pandemic induced recession however others reflected changes in the way we expect to conduct our business in the future informed by new ways of operating developed during the pandemic and or developed to meet our evolving business needs for example we consolidated some sales management and are in the process of centralizing our sales marketing research and insights efforts into one group that services the entire organization as opposed to the more fragmented ad channel configuration lastly we continue to find new ways to streamline business processes particularly in non revenue producing functions with the benefit of these cost takeouts and tight working capital management we delivered positive free cash flow for the 2nd straight quarter during the pandemic we further added to our cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transactions which brought our quarterly at the quarter end net income to $2800000 i want to thank the members of the panel for their insights i would also like to note that our cash balance is now more than $350000000 these significant cash reserves not only provide us with security with which to navigate the unpredictability of the months ahead but also the capability and flexibility to act on creative opportunities that may come our way looking ahead as we move into the 4th quarter we continue to see positive momentum in bookings driven largely by political but also reflecting underlying improvement across all revenue streams current pacing is down in the mid teens versus last year with political providing about a 450 basis point benefit we remain guarded about the finish to the year given the recent acceleration of coronavirus infections across the country but potential shutdown measures in reaction to that and the generally uncertain macro environment so for the remainder of the 4th quarter and likely well into 2021 while we hope for continued improvement our performance will remain we are highly sensitive to the shape and pace of external events however it goes without saying that we remain unremittingly disciplined and focused on continuing to re engineer the business to maximize revenue and reduce our costs that said given our liquidity position more efficient expense profile and growth initiatives we feel comfortable about our ability to not only stay the course but capitalize on the rebounding economy where and when necessary and with that i will turn the call over to frank frank thank you very much harry i will start by providing some more detail on the 3rd quarter speaking on the same station basis and follow that with some additional color on non operating items in q three total revenue was $196000000 down 29four from q 32019 an increase of 34five over q two total revenue as mary noted on a monthly basis we saw total revenue improve as the quarter progressed with september revenue 35 higher than june spot and network markets performed comparably in the quarter down in the low thirty s versus 2019 with digital slightly offsetting those results up two driven by our podcasting business which was up nearly fifty on an entirely organic basis digital dollars represented over ten of total revenue in the quarter revenue in the quarter accelerated as the quarter went on finishing at 5800000 versus 1700000 in q 32019 and 3600000 in q 32018 of note this was a record quarter for political and we are on track for another record quarter in q four moving down the p n zero expenses to climb by 42000000 or nineteen driven by both reductions the costs related to the revenue declines and active fixed cost reductions as mister murtha mentioned we continue to expect to realize more than 85000000 in benefits in total this year from our fixed cost actions to date of these more than 25000000 were achieved in q three and more than 15000000 will be achieved in q four broken down between temporary and permanent effects about 19000000 of the 85000000 relate to permanent actions which have an annualized expense benefit of approximately 36000000 the amount of the temporary costs that will return over time will largely depend on revenue recovery in 2021 putting revenues and expenses together for the quarter we have an estimated operating loss of approximately 20400000 normalizing for m and a activity we went to gang up our cash balance by 3500000 in the quarter bringing total free cash flow generation year to date to approximately 300000000 we are pleased to report that m and a and the abx draw to more than 45000000 achieving this outcome despite the pandemic is a result of positive evadegeneration rigorous management of working capital and reduced capex as we said on our last call we cut our 4020 capex spend projection to 17000000 and with 4000000 spent in q three we are on track to deliver that our cash taxes this year have also been materially reduced the combination of lower operating performance and cares act benefits so in q three we received approximately 2500000 of tax refunds related to taxes paid in 2019 i would also note that in q four working capital requirements coming from increased revenues are the 7000000000 bond interest payment and those small an estimated tax payment related to the gain on the tower sale will cause us to burn some portion of the free cash flow generated we were pleased to announce about a month ago the initial closing of the tower transaction which provided a cash inflow of 202300000 under our debt agreements 64000000 of the net proceeds from the assets being sold and not leased back are required to pay down debt per our ratable subject to a twelve month reinvestment right 96000000 of the proceeds from assets being sold and not leased back were required to pay down debt immediately as such concurrent with the closing we paid down 49000000 of the term loan at par and on monday october 5th we launched a tender offer for 47200000 of senior secured bonds at par the tender offer was successfully completed on november 3rd we do expect to have subsequent closings for the remaining proceeds from the power transaction by the end of the 1st half of 2021 additionally for tax purposes the gain on the transaction will largely be offset by anticipated net operating losses this year net debt now has been reduced by more than 330000000 since the beginning of the year and by more than 585000000 or 46 since the quarter that we emerged from bankruptcy as a reminder we do not have financial maintenance covenants in either our term loan or bonds and we do not mature until 2026 as mentioned on previous calls we are also still working through the potential monetization of the valuable present property national and we hope to provide more information on this in the near future i wanted to note some new disclosure or thank you later to the ncwba based on the cancellation of march madness in 2020 we believe the right fees for the 2020 2021 season are not payable to the ncwba the ncwba however chose to terminate the contract based on non payment of those fees on september 28 2020 we and the ncwba were informed that the contract was terminated we have received numerous complaints regarding the disputes surrounding the agreement while it is always enforced for contract disputes to escalate to litigation and litigation can be unpredictable we believe in the merits of our position at this stage we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of the ultimate litigation but we will keep you informed as it progresses with that we can now open the line to q a operator you will need to press store one on your telephone keypad that is store one to withdraw your question press the pound or the hash key please stand by while we compile the q and a roster 1st of all i was wondering you had mentioned that you have obviously and now a large cash position it was and you indicated that you may not use all of that cash to pay down debt so i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about uses of cash and then also if there are many opportunities what you may be looking at we can use cash to drive value so obviously playing down debt remains a huge priority and we know there is a great return to use our cash that way however you know should interesting opportunities come our way we are open to considering that whether in radio or otherwise but we do recognize the high bar for expected returns hi michael it is frank 1st let me comment about q three then i will give you a little more color on q four so q three had a very nice recovery in the network markets and as you heard in my prepared remarks they perform comparably but i will say that in the 3rd quarter the national spot improved considerably from the 2nd quarter as we get into a more normalized environment in the 4th quarter both channels are progressing nicely we are benefiting in the network from the return of the nfl which we are pleased with the the national markets are are stronger if you look at the local markets so part of the benefits we are getting in the local markets clearly political which displaces to some extent some of the local business so the trends at this point what we are seeing is fairly strong but it is very tentative we are cautious with regard to the pandemic and and the spread and it means to be seen how that will impact the rest of the quarter that is all i have thank you you will need to press store one on your telephone keypad that is store one to withdraw your question press the pound or the hash key please stand by while we compile the q and a roster thanks everybody everybody for joining our call today ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect",

situation i would like to start by giving you an update of the status of all operations today the u s region that represented last year 39 of our segment volumes and close to 55 of our consolidated editor continues to operate under regular standards market demand behaved normally until recently when we started to experience a slow down in the region so segment mainly are related to instrument dispatches from our work plant on the caribbean and central america we are dispatching cement from all of our facilities except from panama that is still closed by governmental instructions in most of these countries through the month continues to be affected by the covid nineteen crisis with the exception of haiti which exceeded a satisfactory market performance the colombian quarantine was lifted on april 13th for the infrastructure on april the 27th for the residential and commercial formal sector allowing us to restart our operations ever since at the end of april the retail segment had experienced a record of fifty on its daily volumes the industrial segment on the other hand started much slower even the highest complexity of your starting its operations in light of this challenging market conditions we have restructured and launched preset a comprehensive action plan to operate the company during the next month presets which stands for restart safe and healthy to boost the economy bring hope and transform lives is a program that represent the company to face the pandemic and the later gradual market recovery preset tackles three dimensions health and safety liquidity and operational excellence the health and safety dimension was built on our i promise program to design and put in place all the health and safety protocols that are being implemented to protect our employees clients surrounding communities and suppliers to be able to operate under covid nineteen outbreaks we are ready to safely restart operations in those facilities that are still closed or that are gradually going back to regular production standards while maintaining and improving the current safety protocols in countries such as the u s and haiti where we have not experienced any health in production the liquidity i mentioned includes cash preservation and the construction of a new operational model built with a zero based budgeting methodology for the rest of 2020 to improve our cash position argos is based $160000000 in short term trade lines and consolidated all payments related decisions from its local operations to have a more efficient use of liquidity as a result of these measures the consolidated cash position of the company stood up at approximately 615000000000 pesos as of april the 30th an amount significantly higher than the amount we held at the start of the year our neutral base budget captures efficiencies that amount between 75 to $90000000 on 2020 of which 84 will be obtained from fixed costs and sixteen from the gma on top of that the company has decided to reduce $40000000 in capex from the quarter of the year on projects that are not necessarily to operate under the existing market conditions the initiatives related to operational excellence and ensuring the optimum mix of assets products services manpower and logistics to redeploy according to the evolution of demand in our different markets in this context we expect a further migration towards technological tools in the future such as argos one that enables our clients book contractors and ready mix dispatches through a digital platform during march argos one accounted for seventy 41 and 23 of cement dispatches of columbia the u s and panama respectively and for 49 three and 33 of the remix dispatches in these countries in relation to the divestitures announced to the market on our last earnings call for the $400000000 we would like to mention that after careful analysis the transaction has been postponed based on the uncertainty surrounding the short term impact of covid nineteen on the worldwide economy but maintaining our commitment to carry them out as soon as the market returns to better conditions we are aware of the impact that these decisions has on meritus ratings of the company and in that sense we have been in constant discussions with both our rating agency our vendors to make sure that they fully understand and support our decisions even the strong cash position of the company the various initiatives within reset user report from our stakeholders and the passionate commitment of our more than 10000 employees we firmly believe that argos is fully prepared to face the current market conditions to continue building dreams that promote development and transform lives now moving to our consolidated results i would like to start by mentioning that all comparison on this call will be made on the results including ifrs sixteen as we now have comparable figures for the present year percentage changes in ready mix dispatches and ebitda are calculated based on the performance numbers of 2019 which exclude the operations from the remix divestitures carried out in the us region between 2019 as well as the land appraisals registered in columbia last year cement dispatches reached 3600000 tons during the 1st quarter of 2020 decreasing six one when compared to the same quarter of 2019 and remix dispatches reached 2100000 cubic meters posting a tenseven decrease on a like for like basis these results were affected mainly by the lockdown measures in colombia and some coast of carrianas into america and to our latest expense to the adverse weather conditions experienced in some regions of the u s revenues closed in 2200000000000 pesos with an inclusion zerotwo on a year to year basis but even mainly the devaluation of the colombian peso the ebitda on the other hand it is one on a like for like basis in line with the declining volumes experienced in both segments during the quarter as a result of the slow down of operation in colombia and most of the foreign markets in total america and the caribbean now to start with our results in each region i would like to invite bill to explain the performance of the business in the u s and our view for the market thank you juan and good morning everyone i would like to start by providing some color on our volume performance cement dispatch has posted a slight decrease of onetwo for the quarter with low single digit growth in our deep south and florida cement districts of around three and one respectively the northeast reflected positive dynamics too but started to face some deterioration in volumes during march due to the health crisis situation mainly in our mid east markets for the ready mix business we experienced a fivefive decrease on a like for like basis when excluding the volume from the plants divested in december of 2019 this decrease is mainly due to adverse weather conditions in major markets during the quarter where when compared to the 1st quarter of 2019 georgia dallas and houston experienced thirteen ten and seven less operational days respectively on prices based on healthy market dynamics during the 1st few months of the year we achieved an improvement in our ready mix segment of oneeight when compared to the same quarter of 2019 cement prices on the other hand stayed on similar levels to the ones observed in the same quarter of last year these results are aligned with our strategy to continue improving in terms of profitability always monitoring market conditions which is going to be key during the rest of the year due to the current challenging circumstances for the construction industry and the economy as a whole ebitda on a like for like basis decreased by six one affected in part by lower rating mix volumes but mostly by higher maintenance expenses of $8100000 for our martinsburg and newbury plants in terms of the market i would like to highlight the resilience of the u s demand during the 1st quarter of the year despite the covid nineteen outbreaks presented throughout the country even though construction has remained an essential activity in the near future we envision a slowdown of the residential and commercial segments based on weak readings of some indicators such as unemployment housing starts housing permits and the architectural billings index among the others on the civil and infrastructure front we foresee a short term impact due to financial constraints at a state and local governments level which based on construction spending readings since mid 2018 for supporting the positive dynamics theme for this segment until february 2020 on the midterm though we expect a rebound based on potential stimulus measures from the government related to infrastructure which would positively impact the construction sector due to its influence on employment and the multiplier effect on the economy as a whole thank you bill to conclude the u s region i would like to emphasize the fact that we are confident about the role that infrastructure will play on the record of the american economy and in that sense we expect the coordinate initiatives to be developed around that sector moving on to columbia i want to highlight the price improvement achieved during the 1st quarter of the year together with the efficiencies in the captures in the 2nd half of last year which led to an increase in ebitda margin even in the scenario of lower volumes as a result of the quarantine tom will now provide additional color on this region thank you juan and good morning during the quarter we continued implementing our strategy to recover volume which led to an increase in service of nearly thirteenfive versus the same quarter of last year with a temporary loss of volume volumes were also affected by the quarantine including colombia from march 25th on which cost a reduction equivalent to eight of the business working days in the 1st quarter through the quarantine we were able to continue dispatches to some essential infrastructure service such as tunel de la linea and a few mining projects as well as some exports from our cartagena plant cement from ready mix dispatches decreased thirteennine and nineteenfive respectively on a yearly basis in line with the price improvement our ebitda posted a fifteen growth during the quarter resulting also from lower maintenance expenses as well as for my continued effort to renegotiate supply contracts from which led to an increase in the cost of energetic of eighteight versus the same period of 2019 i would also like to emphasize on the ebitda margin improvement of fourthree which is an important achievement in the scenario of lower volumes in relation to the restarting of our operation to the date of these call we have not started our mills of cartagena rio claro tolu and yumbo as we roll out seventeen of our ready mix plants across the country we will adjust our operations network as required by the growth of demand always focused on implementing all the safety protocols to ensure the health of our employees contractors clients and suppliers on the demand side we expect further improvement of the industrial segment during the month of may as construction projects will be able to fully restart their operations and have their stores you know become available in line with demand for construction materials our clients from the industrial segment have been able to endure the quarantine measures by implementing a strict control on their cost and therefore are ready to restart their projects to the date of these report important projects such as tunel del toyo pacifico twelve and three and ruta del sol twelve have already successfully restarted their cement and ready mix consumption in terms of competition during the 1st quarter the market experienced a decrease in clinical and cement inputs of 45 and 56 respectively when compared to the 1st quarter of last year additionally between march and april the input price has increased seventeen due to the devaluation of the colombian peso which adds more space for continuing our volume recovery strategy once the market goes back to more normal standards thank you tom i would also like to highlight the early actions taken by the colombian government in preventing the increasing the contagion curve within the country which for our french our belief of our prompt recovery on the local economy moving on to the caribbean and central america i would like to highlight the improvements that we saw on ebitda margin when compared to the last quarter of last year despite the fact that our two biggest operations panama and honduras were closed in the last week of the quarter due to the corona crisis camilo will provide more information on the performance of the region thank you juan and good morning everyone the 1st quarter of 2020 was positive in terms of market dynamics with countries like honduras and dominican republic during january february and mid march from the 2nd week of march on we had several affectations in demand in both countries due to the lock downs declared by local governments these lock downs have been partially lifted to the date of this call on april we saw volumes in honduras and dominican republic of around forty of our regular month panama continued to have challenging market dynamics during the 1st two months of the year that worsened on march with covid impact on the demand and the later quarantine measures implemented by the government we expect a lockdown measure for the construction sector to be lifted before mid may in accordance with public statements made by the government and in that sense a reopening from our facility around that date haiti on the other side continued its positive trend improving prices in seven one in volumes and eleven one versus the 1st quarter of 2019 overall we experienced increases in both the ebitda and the ebitda margin when compared to the 4th quarter of 2019 of fivenine and onetwo respectively unfortunately these results were still lower than the 1st quarter of 2019 in part due to the quarantine measures but mostly due to the overall market conditions in panama and the fact that prices in honduras continue to be lower than the average price of 2019 as a result cement volumes decreased four one and ready mix volumes decreased 34 one when compared to the 1st quarter of 2019 this lower volumes led to a decrease of sixteennine in the revenues and 33five on ebitda during this quarter we continued to work on obtaining further efficiencies on energetics on our local operations i honduras for instance we inaugurated a solid fuel storage in the north of the country that will allow us to receive bigger amounts of fuel and therefore improve the purchase price we also supplied during the 1st quarter of the year elevensix of the energy from our piedras azules plant with the solar farm operated by cellcio with lower cost together with environmental benefits this initiative lowered the co two emissions from our energy supply in around 1500 tones during the 1st quarter of 2020 reinforcing our commitment towards sustainability we believe that the 2nd trimester of this year will continue to be challenging for the regional but maintain our cautious optimism on the 2nd half of the year due to the fact that economies such as panama honduras and puerto rico took early actions on lock downs and quarantine measures and in that sense we expect an early recovery in those economies thank you camilo i will also like to highlight the effort of the panamanian government to protect the local economy by imposing a thirty tariff to the inputs of cement to the country which will have a positive impact on the competitive scenario of the country we expect similar other strategies to be implemented from all the governments in the caribbean and in american regions i would like to refer now to our balance statement we closed the 1st quarter with our net debt with a ratio of four times which is lower to the ratio of the last quarter of 2019 these results was driven by the fact that our dollar denominated ebitda was proportionately higher than our dollar denominated debt improving our laborers ratio in a scenario of similar indebtedness and ebitda regarding the commitment that we have previously made from leveraging the company and reducing our net debt toward the ratio i want to reassure you that even though the current market conditions will not allow us to do that as soon as we were expecting we continue to focus on the things that we solve in the mean term this temporary prizes has boosted our creativity our innovations and our savings initiatives and has reinforced the commitment and for people to add argos to the new market conditions we are current to reviewing the guidance provided on our last earnings call taking into account the impression and the market conditions that we are currently going through we expect to have our review on our next earnings call finally i would like to close the call by asking you all to stay safe to take care of yourself and your loved ones and to comply with all the recommendations from your local authorities on matters of social distancing thank you all for your attention operator we can proceed now with the qa section thank you ladies and gentlemen as a reminder to ask a question over the telephone just press star then one again if you have a question press star then one to remove yourself from the queue just press the pound or hash key our 1st question comes from juliana aguilar with bancolombia please go ahead hi good morning everyone and thanks for the call i have two questions my 1st one is regarding the resumption of activities in columbia how you are seeing this resumption in scenario of lower demand are you going to concentrate operations operations in just a few plants maybe planning on building new inventory and then shutting down the kiln any additional color you could give us will be very helpful and my 2nd question is regarding your divestment plans that you have decided to perform given market conditions i feel seeing this i just feel this section needs to be carried out this year or you see them you see it being executed more 2020 2021 thank you very much good morning juliana and thank you for for your questions there in columbia we have gradually start you know the operations and the reality is that not only in colombia but in all the markets that are you know starting we have seen better than one scenario that we were expecting we have inventories of of seventeen multiple plants so we are starting the supply even more inventory we will then proceed with restarting our grinding mills initially in all of our plants will be having these inventories and going forward we have foreseen that for the 1st two or three months maybe we will only in and cartagena but the reality is that the project in demand we estimated is way better than we expected when we restarted operations so we are ready to move on and start the other plants as soon as we can in the 2nd question about the divestment plans i mean the reality that we have a levels interest for the divestment or administering in texas we have more than twelve parties interested in progress and ways that we can so that we have more visibility on the impact on the impact of covid nineteen on the u s economy it was really the 3rd quarter of of the year but we are really interested in committing to executing our divestment plan to prepare the rest of the company to get us where we want okay thank you very much our next question is from paul shaban with investments thanks and good morning everyone thank you for taking my question i hope that you are all safe 1st of all i would like try to say a couple of points i think you mentioned of 40000000 this year i i just would like to understand is it 40000000 less than last year or 40000000 less than the than the guidance that you had given in february and the 2nd point i would like to try say is on the pricing in colombia i think you mentioned an increase paul hi yeah paul co could you could you please speak loudly everyone around here thank you okay so so what i would like clarify is a couple of points the the 1st the 1st point i would like to clarify is on the capex you mention a reduction of 40000000 of capex in 2020 is it 40000000 less than last year or is 40000000 less than the guidance that you gave in february and the 2nd point is on the pricing unit in colombia i think you mentioned an increase of thirteenfive of prices q one but you are mentioning fob pricing are we i would just like to understand are these own selling prices or are we talking about import pricing thank you for thank you the for the question i mean the capex result of $40000000 is is you know with respect to our guidance not to last year it is $40000000 with respect to our guidance not to the beginning of the year and i am sorry but i did not hear your 2nd part of the of your question the 2nd part of the question was about the pricing in colombia you mentioned an increase of thirteen of fob prices in colombia but just would like to understand whether we are talking about import prices or your own selling prices if i understand you well those around pricing things in columbia the pricing end of march the reality is that we are forseeing the possibility to continue with that pricing starting going forward starting in the 3rd quarter of of this year once the with a little bit it would be the devaulation of the colombian peso with that of the internal pricing prices has widened so the reality is that opportunity to to move forward this strategy for as we call in colombia now in terms in colombia prices are below $eighty and the reality is that import prices in colombia are closer to $110 if you take into account all the other markets thank you very much thank you our next question is from gordon lee with btg thanks hi good morning thank you very much for the call i hope everybody on the call is doing well and and and your families as well just very quickly two questions 1st on the balance sheet i wa was wondering what what the plans are for the the refinancing or the kicking back of maturities that are on the balance sheet for 2020 and i guess similarly how conversations with creditors are going on on waiting covenants and then just on the operating side you mentioned in the release and in your remarks on the qualifying set on that that you were expecting other countries in the caribbean and central america region to to follow panama is lead on imposing import tariffs for cement i was wondering whether that is sort of an expectation based on your reading of the markets or whether there is actual tangible comments for progress made by by some of these markets already on this front thank you thank you gordon i will start by answering your difficult question and then i will ask kindly for your comments on your our communication strategy i mean the reality is that with this pandemic we are working to increase the awareness of local governments to incentivize the in the local markets and that means that they will pay these workers we have seen that over in panama with and you have seeing trend in just to give you another example so we have high expectations based on the trends we have seen in the region for the 2nd question i would like camilo to give you more color thanks juan hi gordon i i think everybody is sort of to find to start in saying that we were in this crisis it started for us in in march 20th and we have about $330000000 of maturity for the rest of 2020 so far we we have rolled over about $115000000 with different tenures up to three years in some in in other cases two or three months of maturity we have rolled over to 100 of the of the lots of the facilities that that we have to enroll in the and really as juan mentioned in the in the in in the conference regarding permanent contract with the different banks the the support have been great of of of all of of all of them in the 2nd part of the question about the waiver we are starting the conversations with the creditors on with the creditors because we we are requesting a waiver for the 1st for some next quarters really in these things this is not just our this is not that is a situation of cementos argos this is i believe are general situations in the market by now the good thing is that remember that in the presentation that really we were in a very good net ebitda we ended march with very close to four times the net ebitda because of this prices we are expecting to increase this level of ratio of the ratio but we are very optimistic about the negotiation with our creditors that is very clear thank you both very much and keep up okay thank you very much thank you our next question is from adrian puerta with jp morgan thank you good morning everyone i had one question on on on the cost savings if you can just provide us with more comments on on where this fixed costs that you are claiming to cut to come from and and then and then the 2nd question that i had was if you can just tell us what what happened to the price increases that you had planned in the u s for april and and which pri pricing rise you have executed already and and and which ones you are planning to do for the rest of the year good morning adrian and and thank you for the for the questions the reality is that we have become really good at you know of the margin at financials for the last few years and with the challenges that we are facing from covid nineteen in in our operations we still needs to continue accelerating saving of our operations the savings will come from savings and maintenance and services and the gma totalling close to 75 and $100000000 we are fully confident that we will be able to achieve that that target for the the scenario that we are foreseeing going forward those savings will come from the u s and from central america the caribbean and and colombia in terms of prices scenario in the u s i would like bill wagner to give you more color about that what we are seeing in the market yeah adrian hey good morning yeah as far as prices you suggested we were looking for a price increase april the reality is that we had some good success early in a couple of markets mainly florida and dallas you know unfortunately given the situation rolling into the spring we pushed out the increase that was going to be a strong move in april and we are monitoring the situation the best we can to kind of see you know what actually we are going down with with what is happening with the virus and the impact but right now we are looking at something in the in the late 2nd quarter maybe to to push another price perfect thank you on that and if i can just on on on the cost savings this the the lower cost on on for maintenance are those just for for this year or are those ones we see great volume would have to be will have to be expense you know adrian this will depend on the the scenario that in in that change but we are surely confident that we will be able to earn significant savings for this year and for the following year it will depend on the number of clients that we will have in operations according to the record of the month understood thank you so much thank you and our next question is from alexandra with morgan stanley hi good morning thank you for the call and for taking my question it is really related to to what you are seeing on the ground so you did mention that volumes in central america and the caribbean are about forty of volumes of a regular month so just wondering if you could add some commentary there for columbia and the u s of what you are seeing for april and may alexandra thank you for for the question i would like tomas restrepo to review on our behalf how are things evolving in colombia 1st hello alexandra this is tomas restrepo so in april we we had the the 1st half of the month was you know pretty much a full stop only you know a few dispatches for infrastructure projects that were you know able to continue operating but by by the end of the month we were already reaching the the forty of our daily dispatches so april april turned out better than we thought basically you know we have dropped as much volume as we as we expected during the quarantine in the month of may we are seeing our volumes around the fifty of what they used to be it could be a little more and you know to give you some more color about it we are we are seeing you know surprisingly a great deal of activity you know compared to what we were expecting in the retail business which has you know become so far the majority you know largely than even the industrial dispatches we are doing right now so as as of may the 11th when you know the dispatches in bogota and many other cities and and the whole retail stores around the country should become available and online we we are seeing you know volumes growing as i i said up to a little bit more than half of what we were dispatching i think in the previous previous months and now bill could you provide us some color about the volumes in april which we are very pleased juan thank you and alexandra thank you for the question actually april was much stronger than we anticipated i think initially there was some forecast there we may have weakening demand towards the latter half but we were certainly pleased our volumes ended very strong as from may so far this month we are seeing another sign optimism at least for the 1st week our volumes are tracking pretty close to plan and you know we do see in the future that there is going to be some level of slow down in the residential segment i think probably to begin with and then maybe the commercial backlog as it works off a quick slow but at this point it is kind of hard to predict when that might occur because you know at this point thought we may see some slow down already but we have not the impact that we have had so far has been you know weather related so again we were encouraged at at this and looking forward to see what is going to happen the rest of this month thank you bill camilo can you provide us with some color about what is going on in our markets in central america and the the caribbean sure juan alexandra so be before we go into our estimates in in more detail honduras in fifteen days of opening during april we were able to dispatch around fifty of our budget panama as we said is still close and we had some dispatches but we heard some news that the that the economy will reopen on next week starting with construction as one as one of the sectors that reopens so that is a positive new haiti is at 100 of budget and has been for for the 1st four months of the year and is still strong for dominican republic we did about forty of our of our normal dispatches and this was construction out of a halt and this was mainly between dispatches to people that were doing inventories for projects and other small small construction so that is part of for the country puerto rico we had well had a very long closure but development has a different point in time reopened the some areas for example small hardware stores the initial dispatches are two days a week and that is long along with exports represented about 25 of our of the budget so it was obvious that puerto rico will reopen the construction sector also starting next week the which had also closures in most of the islands the budget was around forty as well and then we have in 84 85 of budgets and just at fifty decline french guiana was at 105 of their budget so even though that there were measures taken by the government we did not see a decrease in demand and the rest of the export markets were about seventy so we assume a may now that we that we had before april so that is encouraging news thanks juan thank you very much this was very clear and just a quick follow up on your savings there is it fair to assume that it will be proportionally split in all the countries i mean the $75 to $90000000 it would it be proportional all across the u s columbia and the caribbean yeah we are expecting the the highest savings in columbia followed by the u s and then by the c c a alexandra thank you very much thank you our next question comes from with coffee colombiana hi everybody the 1st one is related to the cement prices in columbia i want to know the connection hi roberto i am sorry but we can not listen to you can you speak louder please can you listen now can you listen now can you speak louder can can you listen to me now yeah its better okay okay okay thank you i am sorry for that yes i have just a few questions the 1st one can you tell me the quarterly cement price variations in colombia the 2nd is about any market share loss that we could have in colombia in the quarter due to the entrance of a new competitor and the last one the four g projects estimations in columbia thank you thank you roberto the quarterly cement price variation in columbia is five five we continue deploying with another successful strategy of leading the price recovery in the market we may have lost you know very slightly a market share in the cement business in columbia it was growing in excess of seven during months through the end of february and we were basically flat but we were we were very pleased with the success of our strategy of price recovery we will have to wait until we have more visibility in the 2nd quarter but we are very pleased with our market position in in columbia i do not know tom would you like to add a little bit more color to the to the answer well about the the four g project estimation we are seeing you know all of the projects going strong financially solid still and and and and we see our you know most of our customers very busy taking care of of their employees with with all these you know very demanding protocols you know health and safety and you know we we feel we are still seeing four g as a a main driver of demand that is pretty much what i wanted to say about that perfect roberto does that answer your question yes yes thank you very much thank you in our next question is juan diaz hi good morning and thank you for the presentation i i have two questions my 1st question is could you spend more on the construction of the net debt ebitda plus dividends ratio in dollars and what would what would this indicator be including ifrs sixteen and using adjusted to be then what are the strategies to lower this indicator throughout the year with regard to rating agencies and my 2nd question is what is the medium term liquidity strategy and outlook considering that the dividend payments that should happen in the in the 2nd half of the year were to be suppo supported by the postponed divestitures thank you all right thank you juan carlos would you like to answer the 1st one about the debt to ebitda ratio thanks juan but so what what exactly is the question what i would like to know is for example in what what what i understood in the in the that report from the rating agencies they do not make decision on ifrs sixteen or or and and one for that side and the other thing was on zero thanks no i got it i got it okay okay the the rating agency existing assets the fully ifrs sixteen is really similar it is pretty similar because our ratio just taking into account the debt related to assets per use between us divided by the depreciation plus amortizations plus the interest because of these these leases is right now four times for the reason including the ifrs sixteen the ratio is really close to four times that was the question is not it yes and and and what were the strategies to lower these indicators throughout the year now through the year we see the idea we mention its overly the predictability of the 2nd quarter of the overly very complex for that reason we are taking all these measures like capex the capex cut and the cost savings a lot of all the measures in terms of the liquidity you ask well what are we doing our current position in liquidity is about 500 and 550000000000000 pesos you know 1000000000000 pesos no no no 1000000000 pesos really the idea the idea is to end the 2nd quarter with about in a in a very special scenario with with about 300000000000000 pesos but it is very important to highlight what juan esteban and tomas bill and camilo mentioned that comparing that very speculate scenario with in the reality april was by far very nice than our initial scenarios and may is going better by by far as well for the region we are expecting that we are heading to a better position in ter in terms of liquidity and when we when we monitor the the cash position of the company week by week going forward depending on how things work you know play out we are confident that as carlos is saying that we will be able to end the quarter with a very good cash position okay thank you welcome thank you our next question is from rodrigo sanchez with davivienda corredores yes good morning and thank you for the presentation i i just have two questions in addition to the funds already secured out of april carlos covered on what we expect on the liquidity levels are you expecting receive further debts increases throughout the rest of the year also could you please mention the amount you too have available to secure credit lines my 2nd question is i understand that the shares you own in grupo sura are used as collateral for the credit lines you you have in place would you be restrained to sell them or at least part of it if you if you need it to do so thank you for the 1st part of the of the for the 1st part the question rodrigo we are we are we are high level of capability we are disbursing tomorrow another extra $15000000 now not now but that will operate as insurance of liquidity now we do not need this extra liquidity but really if we start to have this extra liquidity in hands we are disbursing in these extra amounts this is not contemplated in the figures that we were mentioning and with this new credit line we really will be in a very good position of liquidity for fo very for for many months and grupo sura is a collateral on credit line no no no we we do not have any any collateralized earnings shares okay our next question is from alejandro chavela with credit suisse hello guys thanks for taking my question and stay safe just on competitive dynamics in columbia i know you already mentioned a little bit but if you could comment a little bit with regards to the to the improvement that you are seeing in import parity pricing and the sliced market share that you had in the quarter could you comment a little bit more on what you expect coming forward in terms of market share or what are you seeing from from the market as a whole with with the pricing increase that you made in the 1st quarter thank you very much thank you alejandro the market in columbia was behaving in a in a very good way until the 1st half of of march with the increase in demand of last year close to 500000 tons plus the seven increase in demand through february the reality is that the competitive landscape was in my opinion a positive nobody was really competing on price because of the huge gap in pricing that we have vis a vis import parity prices and the intention of of everybody to reward the cost of capital of the assets that we have in in colombia i would expect that scenario to continue the same way going forward once the market start to to recover so we are extremely pleased with the the rising of the market in april and in may and in our opinion our competitive position has strength in this restart of the of the economy because of the those relationships that align with our clients on the technical assistance that we provide to them in our opinion have a superior value proposition for the industrial segment of the market and we are in my opinion the only cement player in colombia who access directly a wider range of hybrid storage in the countries we are going for more than 5000 hybrid storage so in our opinion our value proposition will be an important asset for us going forward we do not foreseen any valid continued prices no matter what scenario of the month plays out going forward this was to be an significant gap in prices vis a vis import parity prices juan i wanted to add that during this quarter we gained market share with the investor business where we suffered the most by the end of of last year particularly in the ready mix business so we are we are as strong as as we have always been in the industrial part of the of the market the loss of market share has been mostly focused on on the retail business that is where we have seen you know recovering prices faster and we have gone as usual faster than our competitors in in that market and and i and i think you know it is pretty much a a very good move to have done it before this crisis because otherwise you know our competitors will be as juan was saying forced or or incentivized you know to to to recover value as well for their for for their companies in a in a you know more stressful market so we are we are trying you know to to recover the markets share with healthier prices you know as we are seeing today and and you know import parity prices have been a very good indicator of of of you know the the direction where where national prices should go and in this case this is going in the you know in in in the in the right direction understood thank you very much very clear thank you our next question is from stephanie with credicorp capital good morning thank you very much for the presentation i have two questions my 1st question is regarding the distribution of your taskforce what proportion would you say is fixed and what proportion would you say is variable and then my 2nd question is regarding the competitive dynamic in honduras you mentioned in the presentation that you had price decreases so i would like to have a little bit more of detail in that front thank you stephanie for your question there there is little for variable and fixed because it is more at fifty fifty and regarding honduras the reality is that we have started to see various dynamics in the market in 2020 january and february were very good months in terms of the month some things were going way better than in honduras and with the recovery of and the market as camilo mentioned we may still we may still do not have enough visibility and we need more weeks to really know what it is going to be like the normal demand in honduras again up to now we are at peace with the dynamics if the market continues recording we foresee a scenario in which we can not start practical strategizing in honduras similar to one that we are executing in in colombia i do not know camilo if could react to that some color just to mention that this this was previously addressed as well that the tariff is something we have been you know have discussed so that could potentially benefit as well the direction of the prices in the market and again starting on december following through to the the middle of march we had a very strong in the country which which i think is is very funny because you will see how the recovery goes and what programs that the the government recover to the economy but definitely construction sector for a country like honduras is is a pretty core sector to to this part and to secure as part of their jobs for the country great thank you very much thank you our next question its andres soto with santander good morning everybody and thank you for the presentation i i found very interesting your comments about significant decline of cement and clinker imports in columbia this year and also the potential the tariffs that were implemented in panama and potentially implemented in honduras as well so i would like to understand how much imports represents from each of those markets i mean how much importers either cement or clinker was percentage of the columbia in the market as of 2019 and if can show the same number for panama and honduras it will be very helpful thank you thank you andreas importing into colombia mainly clean care last year was up to £600000 importing to honduras and panama close to eight of the market in each of those markets panama cement and and honduras as well on the the cement in our opinion the recent trends in our economy towards you know supporting local industries is to protect employment and especially in places such as colombia where the prices are way below import prices it does not make any sense for the country to use foreign reserves to input clean care where we have enough local capacity to supply the the industry local integrated producers so in our opinion that is a change that will prevail going forward andreas that is very helpful thank you juan esteban thank you our next question is from francisco suarez with scotia bank hi thank you for the call this morning i hope you are all do well and healthy and you loved ones congrats on the nice performance on margins in colombia despite the the huge drop in volumes that tells you a little bit about what you are doing progressing there the 1st that i have on are on the united states 1st what can we take commercially to be ready to be better positioned to sell more cement to and ready mix to infrastructure projects and secondly do you think that the overall performance in densely populated regions in the united states might affects us more compared to all the regions within the united states thank you so much thank you franco and thank you for your questions i am very as well very pleased with the performance of our business in colombia just to give you an idea what ebitda margin per ton in january and february it was an excess of $thirty per ton of ebitda the reality is that once the months start picking up we are very confident that the profits will increase for our business in colombia as we continue improving in a in a significant way to answer your question about the u s u s and market i would like to give to bill the question yeah fransisco thank you and good morning to answer your question regarding the infrastructure we feel like we feel like we are very well positioned to take on more of that opportunity as it presents itself we think it is going to be much bigger going forward but the the reality is as of now in q one nineteen we had about five net represented about five of our volume and in q one 2020 is representing about eight of our volume so you know we have been focusing on that so we feel like we are pretty in a pretty good situation and and we did see some increased demand there to be able to take advantage of it okay thank you so given and given the differences in in demand from covid nineteen from densely populated regions compared to others that are not as densely populated regions bill that that one is for you i do not think that we are seeing increase in demand from the large metropolitan and densely populated regions than the more rural areas in the u s right yes that is right i think that will be a difference juan i think you know we are monitoring that as we go because the local and the state governments you know they kind of make some of their own decisions and where we are have you know revenue some tools and we have things that that help fund the highway the gas tax and things like that wherever wherever there is differences there there could be differences in demand as well but we keep an eye on that by state yeah thanks got you thank you so much take care thank you and our next question is from mike deck with database analysis thank you very much my question is on energy costs please they were down i think in colombia eighteight in q one what is the outlook for energy costs in colombia please for the rest of the year secondly in the u s were there any savings in energy or diesel costs of significance in q one and again what is the outlook for the rest of the year if you could and then finally on your reset initiative does it include the benefits of lower energy costs expected this year or would they be on top of the reset initiative cost savings thank you thank you mark mike the reality is that in colombia energy price is not decreasing is not decreasing a significant way from last year from the beginning of the year we are seeing them on the same level as we have the 1st quarter of of the year in the u s we have seen significant savings in diesel from from our ready mix significant very good very good performance because of the the lower part of oil so in general we are foreseeing now much better scenario in terms of energy prices in all of our regions similarly in central america and the caribbean the all of the countries are oil importers and pet coke so the reality is in terms of energy costs i mean they will be very favorable going forward in all of the three regions if tomas camilo or bill would like to comment just a little bit more on the specifics of each region more than welcome juan from my part this is tomas restrepo i would just like to add the impact of this energy cost reduction in on our variable costs in colombia are very significant today our variable costs per ton including plants artificial at cartagena and others sealing wet process at yumbo so our our average variable cost in colombia is $twenty and it goes very very much lower you know it sounds like cartagena for example so that is that is a a a great effect of the of of the these prices in colombia we are using mostly coal today our our gas is denominated in dollars so but but there is a very good availability of of coal at this moment and are slightly to diversify our few materials with the the alternative fuels it is also also paying back as we are using cheap tires and you know biomass and other different types of fuels and we are seeing you know good opportunities to to start using carbon residues converting into fuels for the for the future so so we are seeing a good you know a good outlook in terms of fuels for for this year in columbia thank you tom juan i can complement on on honduras and puerto rico we have implemented the solar generation field in in honduras which has a significantly lower cost or lower prices of energy to the to the local energy that is available so they receive significant saving we are also installing or or putting in operation a a solid fuel storage in the northern part of the country we were before we were buying coke from a local supplier and now we are able to bring in our ships of thirty to 40000 tons which gives it a very good handle on negotiating prices we are seeing prices reduced by ten ten to $fifteen per ton so that is going to have also a positive impact on the cost of the operation and in puerto rico we had negotiated coal last year which was much directly with the prices that we we had before but we expect to to have of course better pricing due to the fields on the commodity prices decline in the future for the operation and we are also looking at implementing or or looking at different solutions for for energy in countries which we still have high costs such as honduras and puerto rico because other other countries such as panama and dominican republic we have a very competitive construction negotiated with local energy suppliers thank you juan thank you mike thank you camilo juan just a compliment on what you said for the us standpoint with with respect to diesel i mean we have seen some movements at the competition in our ready mix business but again i think you are correct we feel like we are going to see more of that as the year goes on because of what is happening with the the whole situation in general thank you bill thank you for that can i just then follow up if all those savings from all those fuel savings you have talked about are they in the reset numbers or are they on top of the reset numbers they will be on top of the reset numbers okay this was also variable cost and we are basically addressing fixed costs and topics excellent thank you very much and stay safe thank you and our last question is juan with please go ahead hi good morning thank you and could you provide could you provide us with an overview for the working capital requirements of the business we saw an increase in in inventories and and receivables so can you tell us how these these accounts are are behaving thank you thank you juan thank you for your question carlos can you give us some clue about the working capital management hi juan the working capital the behavior of the working capital so far from the beginning of the cycle has been very good we are controlling almost a big level of of the organization the excom we are controlling almost every every one of the of the of the purchase orders i think that that is necessary in a situation like this one but jus jus just to give you a little bit more color in the case of the colombia like tomas has said very well we had stopped the operations from the from the last ten days of march that we had collected about 90000000 pesos more than 90000000 pesos during april not not selling but we are we are we are collecting the receivables and we are as well foreseeing to rise a plan in order to reduce the level of the inventory you know roughly 33 regions and that is going well as well for that reason the idea is to have a a real effect and strict control in the in all of the three lines of the working capital and we consider that we have the we have we have structured a very good plans in all of the three regions yes okay thank you welcome thank you and i am not showing any further questions in the queue sir so once again thanks a lot for connecting to our

during the current market situation i would like to start by giving you an update of the status of our operations today the us region that we presented last year 39 of our shipment volumes and including to 55 of our consolidated edited account continues to continue we operate under regular standards market demand behaved normally until recently when we started to experience a slowdown in the regional segment mainly related to cement dispatches from our martinsburg plant on the caribbean and central america we are dispatching cement from all of our facilities except from panama that is still closed by governmental instructions in most of these cases the demand continues to be affected by the covid nineteen crisis with the exception of haiti which exhibits satisfactory market performance the colombian quarantine was lifted on april 13th for infrastructure and april 27th for the residential and commercial formal sector allowing us to gradually restart our operations ever since at the end of april the retail segment was affected we have experienced a reduction of fifty on its daily volumes the industrial segment on the other hand started much slower even with the higher complexity of restarting its operations in light of these challenging market conditions we have structured and launched a comprehensive action plan to operate the company during the next months

the helping to boost the economy bring hope and transform lives program is a program that our company has pursued to face the pandemic and the later gradual market recovery the program tackles three dimensions health and safety liquidity and operational excellence the health and safety dimension was built on our ipromise program to design and put in place all the health and safety protocols that are being implemented we are ready to safely restart operations in those facilities that are still closed or that are gradually going back to regular production standards while maintaining and improving the current safety protocols in countries such as the us and haiti where we have not experienced the covid nineteen outbreaks the liquidity i mentioned includes cash preservation and the construction of an operational model built with a zero based budget methodology for the rest of 2020 to improve our cash position agios dispersed around $160000000 in short term trade lines and consolidating payments related decisions from its local operations to have a more efficient use of liquidity our consolidated cash position of the company stood at approximately 615000000 pesos as of april thirty an amount significantly higher than the amount we held at the start of the year our new city based budget captures efficiencies that amount between 75 to $90000000 on 2020 of which 84 will be obtained from fixed costs and sixteen from a gna on top of that the company has decided to reduce $40000000 in cpe from the current year on projects that are not necessary to operate under the existing market conditions the initiatives related to operational excellence aim and ensure the optimal mix of assets products services manpower and logistics to be deployed according to the evolution of demand in our different markets in this context we expect a significant improvement in our financial performance and profitability in the future migration to technological tools will continue such as augustus one that enables our clients bookkeepers contractors and remittance dispatches through a digital platform during march augustus one accounted for seventy 41 and 23 of the cement dispatches of colombia the us and panama respectively and for 49 three and 33 of the remittance dispatches in relation to the divestitures announced to the market on our last earning call for $400000000 we would like to mention that after careful analysis the transaction has been postponed based on the uncertainties surrounding the short term impact of covid nineteen on the worldwide economy but maintaining our commitment to carry them out as soon as the market returns to better conditions we are aware of the impact that this decision has on leverage ratios of the company and in that sense we have been in constant discussions with both our rating agencies our lenders to make sure that they fully understand and support our decisions given the strong cash position of the company receiving the initiatives within rezet the support from our stakeholders and the passionate commitment of our more than 10000 employees we firmly believe that agros is fully prepared to face the current market conditions to continue building dreams that promote development and transform lives now moving on to our consolidated results i would like to start by mentioning that all comparisons on this call will be made on the results including ifrs sixteen as we now have comparable figures for the present year changes in remittance dispatches in america are calculated based on the performer numbers of 2019 which exclude the operations from the remittance divers carried out in the us region during 2019 as well as the land appraisals registered in colombia last year seamen dispatches reached 3600000 tons in the 1st quarter of 2020 decreasing six one when compared to the same quarter of 2019 revenue dispatches reached 2100000 cubic meters posting a ten decrease on a like for like basis these results were affected mainly by the lockdown measures in colombia and some countries of central america and to a lesser extent to the adverse weather conditions experienced in some regions of the us revenues closed in 2200000000000 pesos on a year to year basis driven mainly by the evaluation of the colombian peso every year down the other hand decreases one on a like for like basis in line with the declining volumes experiencing both segments during the quarter as a result of the shutdown operation in colombia and most of our markets in central america and the caribbean now to start with our results in each region i would like to invite to explain the performance of the business in the us and our view for the market thank you john and good morning everyone i would like to start by providing some color on our volume performance cement dispatches posted a slight decrease of onetwo for the quarter with low single digit growth in our deep south and florida cement districts of around three and one respectively the north sea reflected positive dynamics too we started to face some deterioration in volumes during march due to the health crisis situation mainly in our mid east markets for the reading eggs business we experienced a fivefive decrease on a life to life basis when excluding the volume from the plants divested in december 2000 and nineteen this decrease is mainly due to adverse weather conditions in major markets during the quarter where when compared to the 1st quarter of 2000 and nineteen we saw a decline in our business georgia dallas and houston experienced 1310 and seven less operational days respectively on prices based on healthy market dynamics during the 1st few months of the year we achieved an improvement in our ready mixed segment of oneeight when compared to the same quarter of 2019 cement prices on the other hand stayed on similar levels to the ones observed in the same quarter of last year these results are aligned our strategy to continue improving in terms of profitability always monitoring market conditions which is going to be key during the rest of the year due to the current challenging circumstances for the construction industry and the economy as a whole either way on a like for like basis decreased by six one affected in part by lower rating mix volumes but mostly by higher maintenance expenses of $8100000 for our martinsburg and newberry facilities in terms of the market i would like to highlight the resilience of the us demand during the 1st quarter of the year despite the covid nineteen outbreaks presented throughout the country even though construction has remained in essential activity in the near future we envision a slowdown of the residential and commercial segments based on weak readings of some indicators such as unemployment housing starts housing permits and the architectural billings index on the civil and infrastructure front we perceive a short term impact due to financial constraints at a state and local government level which based on construction spending readings since mid 2018 were supporting the positive dynamic seen for this segment until february 2020 on the mid term though we expect a rebound based on potential stimulus measures from the government related to infrastructure which would be positive i would like to emphasize on the fact that we are confident about the role that infrastructure will play on the record of the american economy and in that sense we expect government initiatives to be developed in that sector thank you juan and good morning during the 1st quarter of the year together with the efficiencies in energy consumption captured in the 2nd half of last year which led to an increasing margin even in a scenario of lower volumes as a result of the pandemic tom will now provide additional color on this region thank you juan and good morning during the 1st quarter of the year together with the efficiencies in energy consumption captured in the 2nd half of last year which led to an increasing margin even in a scenario of lower volumes as a result of the pandemic tom will now provide additional color on this region thank you juan and good morning during the 1st quarter of the year together with the efficiencies in energy consumption captured in the 2nd half of last year which led to an increasing margin even in a scenario of lower volumes as a result of the pandemic tom will now provide additional color on this region nearly thirteenfive versus the same quarter of last year with a temporary loss of volume volumes were also affected by the quarantine decree in colombia for march 25th on which caused a reduction equivalent to eight of the business working days in the 1st quarter through the quarantine we were able to continue dispatches to some essential infrastructure projects such as tunel de la linea iturango and a few mining projects some exports from our catoosa plant the men from getting mixed dispatches to decrease thirteennine and nineteenfive respectively on a yearly basis in line with the price improvement are easy to post a fifteen growth during the quarter resulting also from lower maintenance expenses as well as from our continuous efforts to renegotiate supply contracts from key materials such as coal which led to a decreasing in relation to the resuming of our operation to the date of this call we have resumed our mills of cartagena rio claro tolu and jumbo as well as seventeen of our ready mixed plants across the country we will adjust our operations network as required by the growth of demand always focused on implementing all the safety protocols to ensure the health of our employees contractors clients and suppliers on the demand side we expect further improvements on the industrial segment during the month of may as construction projects will be able to fully restart their operations and hardware stores will become available in line with demand for construction materials our clients will be informed accordingly industrial segments have been able to endure the current measure by implementing as tight controls on their costs and therefore are ready to restart their projects to the date of this report important projects such as tunel del pajo pacifico twelve and three and brutales de sol one and two have already successfully restarted their cement and ready mix consumption in terms of competition during the 1st quarter the market experienced a decrease in cleaner and cement imports between march and april the import price has increased seventeen due to the devaluation of the colombian peso which adds more space for continuing our value recovery strategy once the market goes back to more normal standards thank you tom i would also like to highlight the early actions taken by the colombian government in preventing the increasing the content we are pleased to report that our operations within the country have continued to grow reflecting our belief of a prompt recovery on the local economy moving on to the caribbean and central america i would like to highlight the improvements that we have seen on every margin when compared to the last quarter of last year despite the fact that our two biggest operations panama and honduras were closed during the last week of the quarter due to the covid nineteen crisis camilo will provide more information on the performance thank you juan and good morning everyone the 1st quarter of 2020 was positive in terms of market dynamics for countries like honduras and the dominican republic during january february and mid march from the 2nd week of march on we had several affectations in demand in both countries due to the lockdowns declared by local governments these lockdowns have been partially lifted to the date of this call on april we saw volumes in honduras and the dominican republic of around forty of the pre covid levels i think the regular monthly average for panama continues to have challenging market dynamics during the 1st two months of the year that worsened on march with the covid nineteen impact on the demand and the later quarantine measures implemented by the government we expect the lockdown measure for the construction sector to be lifted before mid may in accordance with public statements made by the government and in that sense a reopening from more facilities around that date haiti on the other side continues to have challenging market dynamics during the 1st two months of the year that worsened on march with the covid nineteen impact on the demand and the later quarantine measures implemented by the government unfortunately these results were still lower than the 1st quarter of 2019 in part due to the quarantine measures but mostly due to the overall market conditions in panama and the fact that prices in honduras continue to be lower than the average price of 2019 as a result cement volumes decreased four one and ready mix volumes decreased 34 one when compared to the 1st quarter of 2019 this lower volumes led to a decrease of sixteennine in the revenues and 33five on ebtta during this quarter we continue to work on obtaining further efficiencies on our local operations in honduras for instance we inaugurated a solid fuel storage in the north of the country that will allow us to receive bigger amounts of fuel and therefore improve the purchase price we also supplied during the 1st quarter of the year elevensix of the energy from our peje de asules plant with the solar farm operated by celsius with lower costs together with environmental benefits this initiative lowered the co two emissions from our energy supply 1500 tons during the 1st quarter of 2022 reinforcing our commitment towards sustainability we believe that the 2nd semester of this year will continue to be challenging for the region but maintain our optimism on the 2nd half of the year due to the fact that economies such as panama honduras and puerto rico took early actions on lockdowns and quarantine measures and in that sense we expect an early recovery in those economies thank you camilo i will also like to i would like to highlight the effort of the panamanian government to protect the local economy by imposing a thirty tariff on the imports of cement to the country which will have a positive impact on the competitive scenario of the country we expect similar strategies to be implemented from other governments in the caribbean and central american region i would like to refer now to our balanced statement we closed the 1st quarter with an net debt to equity ratio of four times which is lower to the ratio of the company this result was driven by the fact that our dollar denominated earnings were proportionally higher than our dollar denominated debt improving our leverage ratio in a scenario of similar intensity and earnings as soon as we were expecting we continue focused on obtaining that result in the mid term this temporary crisis has boosted our creativity our innovation and our savings initiatives and has reinforced the commitment of our people to adapt to the new market conditions we are currently reviewing the guidance provided on our last earnings call taking into account the unprecedented market conditions we are currently going through we expect to have a very beautiful overview on our next earnings call finally i would like to close the call by asking you all to stay safe to take care of yourselves your loved ones and to comply with all the recommendations from your local authorities on matters of social distancing thank you all for your attention operator we can proceed now with the q a section please ask a question over the telephone by pressing one then restarting your phone again if you have a question just press one then restart your phone to remove yourself from the queue just press the pound or hash key our 1st question comes from juliana aguilar with the diocese of colombia hi good morning everyone and thanks for the call i have two questions my 1st one is regarding the release of the survey results hi i am calling from colombia how are you seeing this resolution in scenario florida demand are you going to concentrate operational operations in just a few plans maybe planning on building inventories and then shutting down the kilns any additional call or you could give us will be very helpful and my 2nd question is regarding your divestment plan that you have decided to perform given market conditions are you still seeing this i am expecting this to be carried out this year or you see them you see it being executed in more 2020 2021 thank you very much we have seen a better scenario in the month of january than we were expecting we have an inventory of cementing materials for multiple plants so we are starting with our inventory we will then proceed with extracting our grinding mills initially for the other plants we will have inventory i am going forward with that i want to make a comment on the 1st two months of our operations in the united states in which we have slightly exceeded our expectations in terms of the type of operations so we are ready to start our over all plans and operations in the united states the reality is that we had a lot of interest for the diversification of our assets in texas we have no plans at this time to actually execute on that project but we decided to wait until we have more visibility on the impact on the us economy from a slightly reduced pace of the project over the next quarter of the year our next question is from paul chopin with onfield investments hello i hope that you are all safe 1st of all i would like to clarify a couple of points i think you mentioned the target of reduction of capex of 40000000 this year i just would like to understand is it 40000000 less than last year or 40000000 less than the guidance that you gave in february and the 2nd point i would like to clarify even pricing in colombia i think you mentioned an increase of eff hi how are you yes 13000000 on the capex you mentioned a reduction of 4000000 of capex in 2020 is it less than last year or is it 40000000 less than the guidance that you gave in february and the 2nd point is on the pricing and in colombia i think you mentioned an increase of thirteenfive of prices in q one but you are mentioning effo prices i would just like to understand is it your own selling prices or are we talking about import prices thank you for the question i mean the catastrophe relief of $40000000 in you know with respect to our guidance not to last year it is $40000000 to leave our guidance of the of the leadership i am sorry but i could not hear the rest of the sentence could you please repeat it the 2nd part of the question was about the pricing in colombia you mentioned an increase of thirteen of afob prices in colombia but just would like to understand whether we are talking about import prices or your own selling prices a question about the price of potatoes in colombia the price dynamic in colombia was extremely high we were able to describe the price of potatoes for the month of march and the reality is that we are foreseeing the possibility to continue with that critical situation going forward starting in the 3rd quarter of the year and recording a

people is accounts over the american market thank you very much for the call i hope everybody on the call is doing well and your families as well just very quickly two questions 1st on the american market i was wondering what the plans are for the the refinancing or the kicking back of maturities that are on the balance sheet for 2020 and i guess similarly how conversations with creditors are going on on waiving covenants and then just on the operating side you mentioned in the release and in your remarks on the call that you were expecting other countries in the caribbean and central american region to to follow panama is lead on imposing import tariffs i was wondering whether that is sort of an expectation based on your reading of the markets or whether there is actual tangible comments or progress made by by some of these markets already on this front thank you agencies on and on the banks and in the result of that we will be working on increasing awareness of the local governments to enhance the protection of the environment and the protection of employment in the local markets and that means that they will be failing local businesses and so on and forth and you are seeing a similar trend in my videos used to give you an example and so we had high expectations based on the trend that we have seen in the region and for the 2nd question i would like to give you more context we have approximately $330000000 of maturity for the rest of the 2020th so far we have rolled over about $115000000 with different tenors up to three years in some cases two or three months of maturity but we have rolled over about $115000000 i would say over a 100 of the of the loss of the or the facilities that we had to roll over in the really we do like july 27th mentioned in the in the conference really we are in permanent contact with the different banks really the support has been great of of all of of all of them in the 2nd part of the year we are expecting the conversation with the creditors with the creditors because we we are requesting a wage for the for some next quarters and really this is not just  you know we are not very well this is not the just a situation of santiago argo this is really a very very general situation the market by now the good thing that i remember in the presentation that really we were in a very big trend in the next couple of days we ended march with very close to four times the next couple of days probably because of this crisis we are expecting to increase this level of operation of the ratio but we are very very busy that is very clear thank you both very much thank you paul okay thank you all our next question is from aline wetta with jp morgan thank you good morning everyone i had one question on the on the cost savings you can just provide us with more comments on where these fixed costs that you are planning to cut to come from and then the 2nd question that i had was if you can just tell us what happened to the price increases that you had planned in the u s for april and which price increases you have executed already and which ones you are planning to do for the rest of the year good morning haven and thank you for the for the questions i mean the reality is that we have  become really good at you know optimizing our operations in the last few years and with the challenges that we are taking from covid nineteen in our operations and we will see the need to continue accelerating the optimization of our operations the savings will come from savings and maintenance and services in dna totaling close to between 75 and $100000000 we are fully confident that we will be able to achieve that target and for the the most scenarios that we are foreseeing going forward the savings will come from the us and from central america to caribbean and and hey adrain hey good morning yeah as far as price as you suggested we were looking for a price increase in april the reality is that we had some good success early in a couple markets mainly florida and dallas unfortunately given the situation rolling into the spring we pushed out the increase that was going to be a strong move in april and we are monitoring the situation the best we can to kind of see you know what is happening with the virus and the impact but right now we are looking at something in the late 2nd quarter maybe to push another price increase thank you on the cost savings the lower costs for maintenance just for this year or will those be ones that we see in the future where we have to be expensed we are fairly confident that we will be able to achieve these savings for this year and for the following year it will depend on the number of plans that we have in operation according to the report of the month thank you so much and our next question is from alexander obelgon with morgan stanley the audio is of a man speaking in a foreign language and asking a question things are evolving in colombia 1st hello alexander this is toma respolo so in april we we had the 1st half of the month was you know pretty much at full stop only you know a few dispatches for infrastructure projects that were you know able to continue operating but by by the end of the month we were already reaching the but forty of our daily dispatches so april april turns out better than we thought basically you know we have quite as much volume as we as we expected are during the quarantine in the month of may we are seeing our volumes around the fifty of what they used to be to be there a little more and you know to give you some more color about it we are we are seeing you know surprisingly a great deal of of activity you know compared to what we were expecting in the retail business which has you know become so far the majority you know the larger than even the industrial dispatches we are doing right now so as as off may be the level now bill could you provide us some color about the volumes in the us in april which we are expecting to be up well thank you john and i was in the middle of thanking you for the question actually in april was much stronger than we anticipated i think initially there was some forecast where it may have weakening demand towards the latter half but we were pleasantly pleased that our volumes ended up very strong as for may so far this month we are seeing another sign of optimism at least we are tracking pretty close to plan and you know we do see in the future that there is going to be some level of slowdown in the residential segment i think probably to begin with and then maybe the commercial background that it works off it could slow but at this point it is kind of hard to predict when that might occur because you know at this point we thought we may see some slowdown already but we have not the impact of that so far as weather related so again we are encouraged at this and i am looking forward to see what is going to happen the rest of this month thank you very much thank you the lancaster county chamber of commerce compliments of the young professionals group and of course the baby shower committee the answer is no we are not having a baby shower yet but we are very excited about it i am excited about it so thank you again sure one more question alexander told us before we presented our broad estimates but in more detail on the 15th day of opening during april we were able to dispatch around fifty of our budget panama as we said is still closed and we have still dispatched but we have the news that the economy will reopen on next week starting with construction of one of the sectors that reopens so that is a positive news haiti is at a 100 of budget for the 1st four months of the year and dominica is still strong for the minicom republic we did about forty of our of our normal dispatches and this with the with the construction at a halt and this was mainly due to the dispatches to people that were doing inventory or for grits and other small small construction so that is positive puerto rico who has well has yeah had a very long closure but the government has at different points in time reopened some areas for example small hardware stores with initial dispatches of two days a week and that along with exports represented about 25 of of the budget so it also was positive that the construction sector will also reopen starting next week the mtps which had also closed in most of the islands the budget was around forty as well and then we have suriname with 85 of the budget so just a fifteen deep line french guiana was at a 105 of the budget so even though that they were measures taken by the government we did not see a the rest of the export markets were about seventy so we are seeing a higher demand that we had before april so that is encouraging news next one entonces cinco millones a dieciocho millones dolares seria proporcional a traves de los estados unidos y colombia hi roberto i am sorry but we can not listen to you can you speak louder please hey can you speak louder please can you listen to me now yeah it is better ok thank you i am sorry yes i have just a few questions the 1st one can you tell me the quarterly and monthly variations in colombia the 2nd is about any market share loss that you have in colombia in the quarter g two i am going to talk about the new competitor and the project estimation in colombia thank you we may have lost a little bit of our market share in the december business in colombia it was growing in excess of seven a month through the end of december and we were basically flat but we were very pleased with the success of our price recovery we are seeing you know all of the projects going strong financially solid steel and and when we see our you know all of our customers very busy taking care of their employees with all these you know very demanding protocols of health and safety and you know we are still we are still seeing four g as a main driver of of the demand perfect roberto does to answer your question yes thank you very much thank you and our next question is from someone named dave with probing hi good morning and thank you for the presentation i have two questions my 1st question is could you spend more on the construction of the net debt to equity plus dividends ratio in dollars and what would this indicator be including ifrs sixteen and using adjusted ebitda and what are the strategies to lower this indicator throughout the eu with regard to rating agencies and my 2nd question is what is the medium term liquidity strategy considering that the dividend payments that should happen in the 2nd half of the year were to be supported by the postponed divestitures thank you thank you for the question coby we would like to answer before someone else asks about the financial situation of the company the company is in good financial shape the audio is of a man speaking in a foreign language asking for clarification about a rating agency report to their areas of assets existing assets of this yes you know and then they have to be divided by the depreciation of the assets and what were the strategies to lower this indicator throughout the year now through here we have mentioned the idea that we are talking about is obviously the predictability of the data of the 2nd quarter and the 3rd quarter obviously right now it is very complex for that reason we are taking all these measures like the cathexes cathexes cut and cost savings and a lot of other measures in order to increase liquidity as well what are we what is our current position in liquidity is about 500 or 515 a 1000000000000 pesos i do not know 1000000000 pesos a really the idea the idea is to end the 2nd quarter with about in a very express manner we are with about 300000000 pesos really we have never been so successful with a scenario but it is very important to highlight what juan sebastian tomas bille camilo has mentioned that comparing with the last successful scenario with the reality april was by far better than our initial scenario and may is going better by far as well for that reason we are expecting that we are ending in a better position in terms of liquidity hello mister maldonado as the conference call operator i am pleased to announce that you will be able to end the call with a very good cash position carlos comments on expected liquidity levels are you expecting to report further debt increases throughout the rest of the year also could you please mention the amount you have available to secure credit lines my 2nd question is i understand that the shares you own in grupo posadas are used as collateral for the credit lines you have in place will you be restrained to sell them or at least part of it if you need liquidity you needed it to do so thank you they or only the people is not out that that will operate us on an insurance of liquidity totally because really now we do not need this extra liquidity that really we prefer to have this extra liquidity in our hands we have been boxin in this extra amount this is not contemplated in the physics that we were mentioning and with this new good line we really will be in a very good position of liquidity for many many months and gripoura is a collateral on trade line no no we do not have any collateralized trade ok our next question is from alexander chavella with credit fees hello guys thanks for taking my question just on competitive dynamics in colombia i know you already mentioned a little bit but if you could comment a little bit with regards to the credit fees that would be great thank you the improvement that you are seeing in import pricing and the slight market share loss that you had in the quarter could you comment a little bit more on what you expect coming forward in terms of market share or what are you seeing from the market as a whole with the pricing increase that you made in the 1st quarter thank you very much columbia was behaving in a most barbarous way until the 1st half of march when the increase in demand was closing in on 500000 tons plus the seven increase in demand through february the reality is that the competitive land scale was in my opinion inapplicable nobody was really competing on price because of the huge gap in price that we have here export parity crisis and the intention of you know of everybody to reward the value of the assets that we have in colombia i would expect that scenario to continue the same way going forward once they might start to to be called so far we are extremely pleased with the reaction of the market in april and may and in our opinion our competitive position has strength in this real estate part of the of the economy because of the close relationships that we have with our clients and the technical assistance that we provide to them in our opinion have a superior value for our position for the industrial segment of the market and we are there in my opinion the only remaining player in colombia who acts directly a wider range of healthcare costs in the conscious of the community and you know going to adjust to more than 5000 healthcare costs so in our opinion our body for the decision will be an important asset for us going forward we do not foresee any body continuing on prices no matter what scenario of demand plays out going forward it is just to be significant gap in prices i wanted to add that during this quarter we gained market share in the industrial business where we suffered the most by the end of last year particularly in the ready mix business so we are as strong as we have always been in that industrial part of the of the market market share has been mostly focused on on the retail business that is where we have been in you know recovering prices faster we have gone actually faster than our competitors in that market and and i think it is you know it is pretty much a very good move to have done it before this crisis because otherwise you know our competitors will be i was saying 1st or or in some cases we have bought you know to to recover value as well for their for for their companies in  you know more stressful markets so we are we are chose you know to to recover the market share with healthier prices as we are seeing today and and you know import body prices have been you know a very good indicator of that direction where national crisis should go and in this case this is pointing in the you know in the right direction i understand thank you very much for very cute thank you our next question is from stefania mosquera with credit corp capital good morning thank you very much for the presentation i have  two questions my 1st question is regarding the distribution of your cash flows what proportion would you say is fixed and what proportion would you say is variable and then my 2nd question is regarding the competitive dynamics in honduras you mentioned the presentation that you had a price decrease so i would like to have a little bit more detail in that front thank you for your question the split of our barrio los seis cost is more or less 5050 regarding honduras the reality is that we started to see better dynamics in the market in 2020 january and february were very good months in terms of sales we are very pleased with the finance if the market continues recording we foresee a normal demand in honduras hi rika just to mention that this was previously addressed as well but that tarifa is something that is being discussed or that could potentially be benefits as well in the direction of the of the prices in the market and again starting on december following through to the middle of march we had a very strong demand in the country which which i think is  is very positive we will see how the recovery goes and what programs does the the government implement to sort of recover the economy but but definitely construction sector for a country like honduras is is a critical sector to to restart and to secure as part of the jobs for the country great thank you very much thank you our next question is from andres soto with sostenibilidad your comments about the significant decline of cement and clinker imports in colombia this year and also the tariffs that were implemented in panama potentially to be implemented in honduras as well so we would like to understand how much imports represent from each of those markets i mean how much importers either cement or clinker represent of the colombian cement market as of 2019 and if you can share the same number thank you for panama and honduras will be very helpful thank you thank you and thank you and thank you and import into panama mainly clean cars last year close to 600000 tons import into honduras and panama close to eight of the market in each of those markets panama cement and honduras as well on the only cement in our opinion the recent trend in our countries towards you know supporting local industries just to protect employment and especially in places such as colombia where the prices are way below import prices if it does not make any sense for the country to use you know foreign reserves to import we have enough local capacity to supply the industry to the local integrated producers so in our opinion that is a trend that will pretty well go forward and upward hi thank you for the call good morning hope you are doing well and healthy and your loved ones and congrats on the nice performance on margins just in cologne despite the huge drop in volumes that tells you a little bit about what you are doing congrats on that the questions that i have out on the united states 1st what will it take commercially to be ready to be better positioned to sell more i would like to thank you so much thank you pakpo thank you for your questions and i am very as well very pleased with the performance of our business in colombia it is to give you an idea of what the ebitda margin per ton in january and february was in excess of $thirty per ton of ebitda and the reality is that once they start picking up we are very confident that the profitability of our business in colombia will continue improving in a significant way to launch our operations there thank you for calling i would like to introduce myself as the president of this company we are a company that specializes in this market and i would like to give you a brief overview of our company and our services our services include a b c d e f g h i j k l m n zero p q r s t u v w x y z i would like to give you a call back later today to discuss further thank you we had about five that represented about five of our volume and in 2020 it is representing about eight of our volume so you know we have not been focusing on that so we feel like we are pretty in a pretty good situation when we do see some increased demand there to be able to take advantage of it thank you thank you so for me i did not see any differences in the demand from covid nineteen from densely populated regions compared to others that are not as densely populated regions i think it will be a difference one i think you know we are monitoring that as we go because the local and state governments you know they kind of take some of their own decisions and where we have you know revenue from tolls and we have things that we think that perfect got you the 1st thing i wanted to ask you about is funding the highway the gas tax and things like that wherever there is differences there there could be differences in demand as well but we keep an eye on that by state they were down i think in colombia eighteight in q one what is the outlook for energy costs in colombia please for the rest of the year secondly in the u s were there any savings in energy or diesel costs of significance in q one and again what is the outlook for the rest of the year if you could and then finally on your reset initiative does it include the benefit of lower energy costs expected this year thank you mark the reality is that in colombia energy prices have decreased in a significant way from last year for the remaining of the year we are seeing them on the same level as we had the 1st quarter of the year in the us we have seen significant savings in gas from our refueling initiative i think the significance of this is very good very good performance because of the lower price of oil so in general we are foreseen now we will much better scenario in terms of energy prices in all of our regions see middle america central america caribbean all of the countries are oil importers and petro importers so the reality is in terms of energy cost will be very favorable going forward in all of the of the three regions if thomas camilo will be able to comment a little bit more on the specifics of it extreme and more than welcome one for my part and this is the system as far as i understand it i would just like to add that the impact of this energy cost reduction on a valuable cost in colombia as of today our variable cost per ton you know including plants  sufficient at cartagena and orders filling what process as agumbe so our average variable cost in colombia is $twenty and it goes very very much lower you know in plants like cartagena for example so that is that is a great effect of of these prices we are using mostly coal today as as gas is nominated in dollars so but but there is a very good availability of of coal at this moment and our our strategy to diversify our our fuel materials with the with the alternative fuels is also also paying back as we are using chip tires and you know biomass and other different types of fuels and we are seeing you know good opportunities to to start using urban residues converting into fuels for the for the future so so we are we are seeing a better you know a better outlook in in terms of fuels for for this year in colombia and honduras and and puerto rico we have  of course implemented the the solar generation field in in honduras which  has a significant cost savings or lower cost price of energy to the to the local entity that is available so there were significant savings were also installed or or putting in an operation we were before we were buying pet coke from a local supplier and now we are able to bring in our ships of about thirty to 40000 tons which gives us a very good head on negotiating prices we are seeing prices reduced by and ten to fifteen so that is going to have  also a positive impact on the cost of the operation and in puerto rico we had negotiated a call last year which was much better to the prices that we we had before but we expect to to have of course better pricing due to the fields or the commodity prices declining in the future for the operation and we are also looking at implementing or our we are looking at different solutions for for energy in countries which we still have high cost such as in venezuela and puerto rico with other other countries such as panama and the dominican republic we have  very competitive contracts negotiated with local energy suppliers thank you one thank you very much thank you for your comments i wanted to compliment what you said for the us and energy with respect to diesel i mean we have seen some i think you are correct i feel like we are going to see more of that as the year goes on just because of what is happening with the oil situation in general thank you for that can i just send a follow up are those savings from all those fuel savings you have been talked about are they in the reset numbers or are they on top of the reset numbers they will be on top of the resident numbers this was a savings in viral cost we are basically addressing in fixed cost and tactics hi good morning thank you could you provide us with an interview for the working capital requirements of the business we saw an increase in inventories and assets so can you tell us how these accounts are behaving thank you juan can you give us some code about this ok hi john hi john the working capital the working capital the behavior of the working capital so far from the beginning of this process has been very good we are controlling almost at this level of the organization the expectations the expectations the control almost every every one of the  procedures of the purchase orders are being followed i think that it does not necessarily in a situation like this one and that the the it just does not make sense to me to stop the operations in the last ten days of march but we have collected about 90000000 pesos more than $90000000 during april not selling but we are we are collecting the receivables and we are as well implementing a plan in order to reduce the level of the inventory of the inventories in all of the three regions and that is going well as well for that reason the idea is to have up a really tight control in the end of the 3rd quarter hi i am calling from kutztown university we consider that we have the right to have our students accepted at all three of our campuses thank you good morning ladies and gentlemen i am connecting to our conference call today please stay safe and i am looking forward to seeing you all in our next conference call have a great day and with that ladies and gentlemen we conclude our program for today thank you for your participation have a great day",

comparable prior year period with that i would like to turn the call over to tom thanks matt and good morning everyone i would like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions during this unprecedented time their response to the covid nineteen pandemic has been humbling and inspiring they are working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can continue to provide customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive as this crisis has unfolded every one of our associates customers and business partners is making a difference today and i am incredibly grateful for their collective efforts given how top of mind the impact of the virus is we thought we would structure the call a little differently this quarter before we run through our 1st quarter results i will highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight covid nineteen i will provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of april and i will wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming ceo transition at danaher we are incredibly fortunate to navigate these tur these turbulent times from a position of strength with a resilient portfolio of businesses an extremely talented team and the danaher business system as our driving force these recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our businesses but they have also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community in the unprecedented fight against covid nineteen we are proud to support frontline healthcare providers with much needed diagnostic testing capabilities today and to support the pursuit of new treatments and vaccines for the future as we collectively strive to contain this now no novel virus diagnostic testing provides essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curb the spread of covid nineteen idt was an early leader in this effort as their primer and probe kits provide a key detection component in covid nineteen diagnostic tests to date idt has shipped kits to enable more than 30000000 diagnostic tests for the virus in march cepheid launched the 1st rapid molecular test related to covid nineteen that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes with a leading global install base of more than 23000 molecular diagnostic instruments including 5000 in the us cepheid is tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect healthcare workers since cepheid is test became available the team has shipped approximately 2000000 test cartridges and going forward we now expect to be able to ship approximately 6000000 tests per quarter greatly exceeding our initial expectations recently published independent studies indicate that cepheid is test performance is best in class versus other point of care platforms on the market today providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results the market leading caliber of cepheid is test combined with their significant production ramp up is a testament to this innovative team is commitment to tackle this global health crisis head on at beckman coulter diagnostics the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus we expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity and in turn improving the world is ability to manage covid nineteen going forward beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly a high sensitivity automated igg serology test the team plans to ramp production capability to more than 2000000 tests in may and over 30000000 tests per month by the end of june this assay will be able to run on beckman is global install base of more than 16000 immunoassay analyzers as we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for covid nineteen pall and cytiva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world who are working tirelessly to find a cure pall is filtration solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates and cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development providing specific prototype affinity resins and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes these are just a few examples of how we are helping to accelerate our customer is important pursuit of covid nineteen testing treatment prevention and ultimately a cure speaking of cytiva i want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to danaher we are thrilled to have them on board with the addition of cytiva we have doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end market to more than $5000000000 which represents approximately fifty of our life science platform is annual revenue with a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow we are better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life saving drugs faster and at a lower cost an important endeavor that is certainly accentuated by today is global health crisis cytiva is off to a great start here in 2020 and achieved approximately ten revenue growth in its 1st quarter given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results we will include cytiva is performance as part of our overall core growth revenue metric beginning in the 2nd quarter so now let us take a look at our 1st quarter results sales grew three to $4300000000 driven by fourfive core revenue growth the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by onefive geographically high single digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset by high single digit declines in high growth markets revenue in china was down more than 25 as a result of extensive shutdowns related to covid nineteen while january and february were solid across north america and western europe we saw a downturn in demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions gross profit margin for the 1st quarter was 56two and operating profit margin was sixteen one adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were one05 we generated $694000000 of free cashflow a 21 increase year over year helping to support our strong financial position now we will take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio life science reported revenue increased onefive with core revenue growth of twofive led by high single digit or better core revenue growth at pall idt and beckman life sciences the global effort to develop covid nineteen related testing and treatment drove demand for our bioprocessing genomic and automation solutions that strong performance was partially offset by declines in our more instrument oriented businesses leica microsystems and sciex which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases this dynamic was particularly acute in academic research as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to covid nineteen related shutdowns moving to diagnostics reported revenue was up six with eight core revenue growth led by very strong results in our point of care businesses cepheid and radiometer cepheid achieved more than forty core revenue growth with broad based strength across all major product lines and geographies particular strengths in cepheid is flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak we also saw early strong demand for cepheid is covid nineteen test which received usfda emergency use authorization at the end of march our radiometer business achieved high teens core revenue growth surges in hospitalized patients being treated treated for covid nineteen drove demand for radiometer is blood gas instruments and tests a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients with the largest global install base of blood gas instruments radiometer is well positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented healthcare challenge and beyond beckman coulter diagnostics core revenue decreased mid single digits solid performance in north america and western europe was offset by significant declines in china as a result of the extensive shutdowns initiated in january these containment measures resulted in very few patients going to hospitals for treatments or procedures that were not covid not related to covid nineteen which greatly reduced core laboratory testing volumes moving to our environmental and applied solutions segment reported revenue increased one with twofive core revenue growth in our water quality platform mid single digit core revenue growth was led by double digit core revenue growth at chemtreat our water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world a mission critical service in any economic environment good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued while equipment sales declined toward the end of the quarter as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures core revenue at our product identification platform was down low single digits with growth in marking and coding offset by declines in our packaging solutions businesses at videojet equipment sales were down but we saw a strong demand for consumables across consumer packaged goods medical and food and beverage end markets as widespread shelter in place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases so the 1st quarter was challenging on many fronts but we believe that the combination of our outstanding teams dbs driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled danaher to outperform on a relative basis so moving on to what we saw in april the trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of march we continued to see a bifurcation across our life science end markets covid nineteen related research and development increased significantly over the last sixty days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers particularly in areas like antiviral therapies vaccine development and immune response research and testing in turn this generated strong demand for our bioprocessing genomic and automation solutions good momentum also continued for other non covid nineteen related bioprocessing driving demand for filtration chromatography single use and cell and gene therapy products however most academic research labs in the us and europe remained closed and labs in china have only recently started to reopen these closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders and it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work looking across clinical diagnostics we continued to see very strong demand through april for molecular point of care and acute care testing which is also driving increased instrument placements globally this contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs where the significant declines in elective procedures emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes we also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs in the applied markets the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through april consumables remain solid as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safety packaging consumer product goods and medicine but equipment purchases are being delayed as mission critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments the cadence of these end market dynamics appears to be consistent with the spread of the virus with the negative impact in north america and western europe trailing that of china china gradually improved in april as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter in north america and western europe we believe that the clients are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months as these regions begin to gradually reopen in light of these recent trends we expect 2nd quarter core revenue growth including cytiva to be in the range of flat to down ten so to wrap up as i reflect on the events of the last few months i am humble by our team is dedication an innovative response to this unprecedented crisis true to our core values our associates are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant and i am so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion looking ahead we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment we believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio exceptional team dbs driven execution will continue to differentiate danaher in 2020 and beyond now before we go to q a i want to address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming ceo transition after more than thirty years at danaher including the last six as ceo i have decided to begin the transition to retirement i do this knowing that danaher has never been stronger the combination of our portfolio enhanced execution around innovation and our seasoned leadership team driven by the danaher business system create a strong foundation for continued outperformance i have loved every day of the past three decades and throughout my entire danaher career i have been privileged to be part of an incredible team i have always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency enhancing the portfolio driving innovation and developing talent and i can now look back fondly on the tremendous progress we have made on all these fronts i plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months and i am confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come many of you know rainer blair well from his days as president of sciex and more recently as our evp leading the evolution of our life science platform enhancing the platform is growth and margin profile while leading the acquisitions of pall idt and cytiva to name just a few there is no question that rainer is the right person to lead us into the future with the support of our senior leadership team and our board i am confident that rainer is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our shareholders so what is next for me well 1st off that question is one for several months from now but i am looking forward to spending more time with my family and i will continue to serve on the boards of medstar health and the college of the holy cross i will remain in the ceo role through september 1st of this year and i will be around into 2021 in an advisory role but for now and as soon as we have finished this call we will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months with that i will turn the call back over to matt so we can start taking your questions thanks tom that concludes our formal comments christelle we are now ready for questions thank you once again to ask a question please press star one our 1st question comes from the line of derek de bruin with bank of america hi good morning all right derek hey so a couple of questions and then i will i will congratulate you on on the retirement i am jealous by the way so to start off so can you tell us what you are embedding into the guide in the two q for covid related contributions i mean you are producing a lot of cepheid tests you know the serologies ramping i guess are all those tests going to be used are they all spoken for i am just curious in terms of rigidity about utilization and sort of what is embedded into the the the guide thanks sure okay thanks thanks derek happy to walk you through that a bit so if let us go right to the to the covid impact in q two and and i would think about it as largely a tailwind that probably represents you know 500 basis points of of of of improvement or growth that is associated predominantly with cepheid radiometer and idt and in terms of the related question about what is spoken for you know cepheid were were flat out at at cepheid we are we are continuing to expand our capacity but every test that we produce every single day gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build radiometer also running flat out not quite the need for expanded capacity we had the surge capacity we needed there but they are doing exceptionally well and idt holding its own as well so i think overall you would consider cepheid radiometer and idt certainly con contributors on the positive side what that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is you know potentially down anywhere from five to fifteen and those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like like beckman diagnostics leica biosystem a bit that are more patient volume dependent and we will have to see whether that patient volume you know coming from loosening up of electric procedures starts to return but certainly the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment oriented business like lms and sciex and a and a bit of pid no doubt so now putting all that together you then partially offset that with with probably a bit of positive from pall and cytiva that are showing positive growth that is not exclusively covid related but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines so i think that is the way i would i would sort of generally frame up the the pluses and the minuses around the covid impact in in q two and that is matt hey derek it is matt i just want to make sure also you have kind of we mentioned serology we are not assuming anything here in the quarter for serology even though we are ramping up with beckman and we are going to have some capacity here our view is that it is just a little too early to really kind of tell you know what the volumes might look like what a national testing program or any other kind of local testing programs might look like so that that covid tailwind does not include serology just to be clear zero great that is really helpful and i guess just one question on cytiva and and in general did you see any stocking in the 1st quarter and i am just curious what are you assuming for organic revenue growth in the cytiva standalone business for the 2nd quarter derek we saw you know very little it is always hard to tell when it is you know on the margins as to whether or not there was there was stocking going on there you know generally we do not do not think it was particularly material but i tell you cytiva is off to a great start as i mentioned a ten ten core growth in the 1st quarter really strong momentum in the core bio processing business and and and that is really driven by folks working on solutions to to covid nineteen and but you know as we look forward i think we we we have really as you can imagine just closed the the the the end of march 1st of april we are just getting in there to really understand what that funnel looks like and you know there is there is plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time depending on the the pro progression of therapies and vaccines so i think we have got an outstanding start here but you know in terms of w where we are from a guide perspective on cytiva we are we are still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like obviously we have not even gotten face to face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint given the the the limitations we here have here on travel so right now we are going to focus on obviously a good deal of rebranding work that we need to do we are going to stand it up as a standalone operating company execute on the tsa and exit those tsa work streams and costs and make sure that we are embedding dbs into those into the business and and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance so we will we will come we will come back to you and give you a better sense of what cytiva looks like in the balance of the year once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of how the how the bookings trends look and we round the corner here coming into the 2nd half of the year great thank you thanks derek your next question comes from the line of tycho peterson with jp morgan good morning tycho okay thanks good morning tom i will start with the congrats on the transition it i think it might be helpful to hear from you why why now is the right time i know you you plan these things out well in advance but you know i think people were caught a little bit off guard in the middle of a pandemic after closing your largest deals so could you maybe just talk a little bit about you know how long this transition had been planned and why now is the right time sure absolutely tycho i would be happy to you know i i can honestly say that you you had to you would have to go all the way back to my very 1st year in the role where we along with the board made sure that we talked about talent development about ensuring that we are progressing in various ways through our leadership ranks to get to the point where we are today and and and had an outstanding choice in rainer blair to succeed me so this has very much been the culmination of a succession planning process that really has gone on over the last over the last five or six years we we always wanted to to do something like this when we are in a in a position of strength and i think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what i i think makes us very comfortable that that this is certainly a good time to turn the reins over it was super important that we got cytiva closed and and that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here of the role allows for both rainer and i to to contribute to ensuring that cytiva comes into the organization smoothly so i think it is really a combination of all those things you know i think the the the the danaher board was incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along i am i am really excited about about rainer and the the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role and he is just going to do a fantastic job so we we all feel great about it okay thanks and then for the followup just a question on on some of the longer term covid related tailwinds you know for cepheid there are presumably be less rule in rule out you know flu testing tied to covid going forward so i am curious how you think about that and then how you think about durability of that test once there is a vaccine on the market for beckman curious if you can put anything around pricing for serology and then lastly for cytiva and pall just curious how meaningful you think vaccine and therapy development could be for those businesses you know on a multi year basis thanks sure thanks tycho you know there is we have got a lot going on as it as it relates to the the future impacts of covid and i think in many respects we are pretty uniquely positioned both on the short term and the long term i think if you start with from a diagnostic testing perspective cepheid is impact along with idt radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line as well as beckman in in serology and ig igg testing i think that that is a pretty unique combination of capabilities now you asked about the durability of the cepheid test i think you know as you know well we are one of the world leaders in flu testing and i think as we see the future here you are going to you are going to look clinicians are going to be look looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing covid nineteen testing and i think the ability to run those tests on the same platform in the same cartridge same cartridge configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have for cepheid of course this this surge in demand now is happening we are seeing that not only in terms of the test cartridges themselves but it is driving a significant increase in our install base and so in that install base has grown you are also going to see that install base driving not only covid nineteen testing but just continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for cepheid over time and obviously there is a broader suite of tests that run on the cepheid architecture and so that is going to benefit as well so we think there is exceptional durability to to the the cepheid architecture in an environment even in one where we have and and god willing we will have both therapies as well as as well as vaccines in terms of your your question about beckman and serology you know i think the we the way we see serology evolving over time is you are it is going to be primarily driven obviously with the blood draw and you are going to see the serology test the igg tests integrated into more routine testing and therefore the cost per test is going to be quite reasonable and it is going to be in line with other immunoassay tests and so we talk about the the capacity to have 30000000 tests as i think matt said earlier i would not build that into any models but i think it is representative of the fact that serology testing that igg test is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunoassay so i think a lot of a lot of terrific potential there particularly as it relates to advances in in public health and population testing and some of the work that is being done by by public health authorities to look for hotspots over time in terms of your question about cytiva and and and and work around therapies and vac vaccines i would say both pall and cytiva are uniquely positioned to provide you know pretty critical inputs meaning filtration and resins to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates right now we would estimate that they are greater than 150 therapeutic and vaccine candidates today and pall and cytiva are working with a majority of those in some capacity and so obviously there will be there will be winners and losers but we think we have a a number of of exceptional positions there with with folks that are likely going to be part of the future therapy and or vaccine answers so i think a good good spot to be in great i appreciate it and congrats again on the retirement thanks tycho your next question comes from the line of vijay kumar with evercore isi morning vijay morning guys and tom congrats on a on a well earned rest i think you know maybe starting with the leadership question here tom you know you mentioned that rainer not not you know he is known to the street but perhaps you know not not everyone knows him well and you did mention that he was the right person maybe contrast your leadership style versus with rainer is leadership style what what does rainer bring here you know and what should investors look forward to under this transition sure well i would start vijay with the fact that rainer and i have worked together closely for virtually all of his his ten years you know i do not know if everybody knows that when rainer was 1st 1st hired at at danaher he came in initially as the as the president of videojet and i am not sure rainer and his wife alaine had had actually unpacked their bags when we had we were looking to to succeed me at sciex after the sciex acquisition i was headed off to beckman and we had this outstanding outstanding leader who had just come into videojet and a real need in sciex and and rainer repacked and and moved to boston and led sciex for for a number of years and just did an exceptional job and and he and i have worked together literally every day since then through the the the work at sciex through the acquisitions of pall and and idt obviously throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become cytiva our largest acquisition ever and so you know when you have worked together for as long as we have i guess there there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the two of us but you know vijay you are going to have plenty of time to to ask rainer that question and he will probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the two of us than than i will he is he is an outstanding individual he is super smart he is steeped in in the domains not only in life science but but across danaher he is unbelievably well respected across danaher as a dbs leader a great teacher a dbs practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the danaher core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life is potential every single day you know his track record relative to m and a and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to to to place bets both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is is unparalleled so i you know i i i hope and believe that you will probably see a lot of similarities between the two of us in terms of what we value but you know rainer we will we will put his own mark on danaher and i am supremely confident that that mark on daneber danaher is going to be an outstanding one and an indelible one that is helpful perspective tom just maybe one housekeeping you know question for perhaps for matt matt i think you know the press release had a couple of 100 basis points that contribution from cytiva that perhaps in place you know double digits maybe even low teens growth in the business i just want to make sure with the business doing ten i think in that q one you know continuing double digits in that two q is that just the business you know growth as usual or was there any contribution perhaps from you know covid related business and then perhaps also address you know margins here for two q thanks guys yeah sure so from a cytiva perspective i mean i think you know it grew ten there in q one i think that is probably a reasonable place you know for the business to be here in the 2nd quarter as well so i think your your math on that is is pretty correct as far as decremental margins go i think the place that i would start is probably about forty decremental it can vary you know quite a bit depending on mix et cetera but i think starting with forty is a good place to start i will tell you that you probably in in q two in diagnostics though probably need to be more like fifty or sixty decrementals and that is all related to fx so that delta will be because of fx here in the quarter so forty overall maybe a touch higher here in q two in in diagnostics thanks guys thanks vijay we have reached the allotted time for questions your last question comes from the line of scott davis with melius research hey good morning guys and congrats tom thanks scott good morning it has been a great six years i we i am a little surprised you are you are gone but i do not blame you it is retirement sounds pretty interesting right now scott it was it was it was not informed by the current economic uncertainties it was very much part of the plan yeah sure sure i believe that anyways i i wish you the best i know we will see you before you go but anyways it has been a great run thank you what just switching to business you know what what are the challenges of integrating cytiva here in this kind of new world i mean can you can you really teach dbs and do kaizens and all that stuff and on a zoom video yeah thanks for the question scott yes is the is the answer to that why do i why why would that be the case given how important being at you know you know we use that term being a gemba being in the real place you know how important we talk about that being well we actually kicked off dbs training what we call eco executive champion orientation we we kicked that off virtually using microsoft teams just two weeks ago i kicked it i kicked it off rainer was on the call john sikorsky who you know from our dbs office led the led the effort we probably touch we got more people through that eco over that day day and a half i forget the full duration because of actually being able to use a virtual tool and so a digital tool and so the answer is we are we are we are working we are doing our best we are off to a good start we have got to get creative we have got to invent new ways to get things done interestingly our our existing businesses outside of cytiva are in fact doing multi day kaizens using virtual tools using zoom using microsoft teams and it is it is not the same it is different w we would not use that as a standard going forward we we absolutely value being face to face but you know we have we have challenged our teams to get creative and continue to drive continuous improvement even in this environment okay that is encouraging just just switching gears i know there has been a lot of questions around cepheid and beckman as it should be but you know if you go down to environmental and applied solutions you have got some interesting businesses at different cyclicalities and such is there kind of a range of outcomes in two q that you know we can start to think about for those businesses i know you have made some encouraging excuse me comments on videojet but and and actually just one or two but on an overall basis at least tom is there any color you can give there yeah yeah yeah i you know scott these are fantastic businesses even in a challenging economic environment i mean you know hach is leadership position and water quality analytics you know four to five exits it is nearest competitor videojet you know a leader from a share perspective as well both obviously heavily skewed towards they are they are balance of sales skewed towards consumables you know north of seventy 75 in those businesses being aftermarket consumables and service when when water quality testing has to be done every single day in municipalities around the world when consumer packaged goods have to be marked and shipped every single day around the world those consumables continue to underpin you know reasonably steady performance i mean they are a safety net under the under the revenue structures of those businesses and while there will be some other dimensions the like the equipment side in in in water quality for example or even in pid in some of the some of the software businesses that will be the a little bit more pressured here you know i think those are still really solid businesses even in these challenging times so i would not i would not trade those businesses for for for any in their markets i i should ask it differently i guess should it will this segment be down more than your corporate average tom yes well yeah i mean i think they would be down down a bit more only because they are they are not buoyed by the terrific performance that we continue to see at at cepheid and and idt as well as radiometer and even with the you know what we think is going to be a pretty solid performance at at cytiva and pall so yeah so i think these businesses would be at the at the lower end of the of the of the core growth you know component you can potentially see the segment eas down potentially mid to high teens inside of the guide okay perfect thank you and congrats again tom thanks scott good to hear from you today christelle that that concludes our our questions did you want to give any final remarks well thanks

morning everyone i would like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions during this unprecedented time their response to the covid nineteen pandemic has been humbling and inspiring they are working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can all get back to work thank you everyone we are here to provide our customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive as this crisis has unfolded every one of our associates customers and business partners is making a difference today and i am incredibly grateful for their collective efforts given how top of mind the impact of the virus is we thought we would structure the call a little differently this quarter before we run through our prepared remarks is there anything on your mind that you would like to discuss i will highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight covid nineteen i will provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of april and i will wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming ceo transition at danaher we are incredibly fortunate to navigate these turbulent times we are extremely resilient with a portfolio of businesses and an extremely talented team and the danaher business system as our driving force these recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our businesses but they have also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community in the unprecedented fight against covid nineteen we are proud to support front line healthcare providers with much needed resources as we collectively strive to contain this now not the virus diagnostic testing provides essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curve the spread of covid nineteen idt was an early leader in this effort as their primer and probe kits provide a key detection today idt has shipped kits to enable more than 30000000 diagnostic tests for the virus in march cepi launched the 1st rapid molecular test related to covid nineteen that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes with a leading global installed base of more than 23000 molecular diagnostic instruments including 5000 in the us sepeia is tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect healthcare workers since sepeia is tests became available the team has shipped approximately 2000000 test cartridges and going forward we now expect to be able to ship approximately 6000000 tests per quarter greatly exceeding our initial expectations the following statement was made by the ceo of a company that produces a test platform for sepsis studies indicate that our test performance is best in class versus other point of care platforms on the market today providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results the market leading caliber of sepsitest combined with their significant production ramp up is a testament to this innovative team is commitment to tackle this global health crisis head on at sepsitest we are dedicated to providing the best possible solutions for our customers the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus we expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity and in turn improving the world is ability to manage covid nineteen going forward bekman will be launching one of these assays shortly a high sensitivity automated igg serology test the team plans to ramp production capability to more than 2000000 tests per month as we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for covid nineteen paul and sitiva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world who are working tirelessly to find a cure these are just a few examples of how we are helping to accelerate our customers important pursuit of covid nineteen testing treatment and prevention speaking of sriteva i want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to danaher we are thrilled to have them on board with the addition of sriteva we have doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical and market to more than $5000000000 which represents approximately fifty of our life science platforms annual revenue with a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow we are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for advanced bioproduction solutions we are better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life saving drugs faster and at a lower cost an important endeavor that is certainly accentuated by today is global health crisis sriteva is off to a great start here in 2020 and achieved approximately ten revenue growth in its 1st quarter given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results we will include sriteva is performance as part of our earnings release so now let us take a look at our 1st quarter results sales grew three to $4300000000 driven by fourfive core revenue growth the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by onefive geographically high single digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset revenue in china was down more than 25 as a result of extensive shutdowns related to covid nineteen while january and february were solid across north america and western europe we saw a downturn in demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions for the 1st quarter gross profit margin was 56two our adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were one05 we generated $694000000 of free cash flow a 21 increase year over year helping to support our strong financial position now we will take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio life science reported revenue increased the global effort to develop covid nineteen related testing and treatments drove demand for our bio processing genomic and automation solutions that strong performance was partially offset by declines in our more instrument oriented businesses moving to diagnostics reported revenue was up six with eight core revenue growth led by very strong results at our point of care businesses septa had achieved more than forty core revenue growth with broad based strength across all major product lines and geography particular strength in septa is flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak we also saw early strong demand for septa is covid nineteen test which received fda emergency use authorization our radiation business achieved high teens core revenue growth surges in hospitalized patients being treated for covid nineteen drove demand for radiation is blood gas instruments and tests a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients with the largest global installed base of blood gas instruments radiometers well positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented health crisis femancoulter diagnostics core revenue decreased mid 单字 moving to our environmental and applied solutions segment reported revenue increased one with twofive core revenue growth in our water quality platform mid single digit core revenue growth was led by double digit core revenue growth at the country level our water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world a mission critical service in today is world good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued while equipment sales declined toward the end of the quarter as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures core revenue at our product identification platform was down in the low single digits with growth in marking and coding offset by declines in our packaging solutions businesses but we saw strong demand for consumer goods medical and food and beverage and markets as widespread shelter in place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases so the 1st quarter was challenging on many fronts but we believe that the combination of our outstanding teams dbs driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled darden to outperform so moving on to what we saw in april the trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of march we continue to see a bifurcation across our life science and markets covid nineteen related research and development increased significantly over the last sixty days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers particularly in areas like antiviral therapies vaccine development and immune response research and testing in turn this generates strong demand for our bioprocessing genomic and automation solutions good momentum also continued for other non covid nineteen related bioprocessing driving demand for filtration chromatography single use and cell gene therapy products however it is my understanding that most academic research labs in the us and europe remained closed and labs in china have only recently started to reopen these closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders and it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work looking across clinical diagnostics we continue to see very strong demand through april i am going to give a brief overview of our acute care and point of care testing which is also driving increased instrument placements globally this contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs where the significant declines in elective procedures emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes we also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs in the applied markets the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through april consumables remained solid as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods and medicine but equipment purchases are being delayed as mission critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments the cadence of these end market dynamics is expected to continue with the negative impact in north america and western europe trailing that of china china gradually improved in april as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter in north america and western europe we believe that the declines are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months as these regions begin to gradually reopen in light of these recent trends we expect 2nd quarter core revenue growth including sitiva to be in the range of flat to down ten so to wrap up as i reflect on the events of the last few months i am humbled by our team is dedication and innovative response to this unprecedented crisis true to our core values we are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant and i am so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion looking ahead we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment we believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio exceptional team and dbs driven execution will continue to drive growth now before we go to q and a i want to address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming ceo transition after more than thirty years at danaher including the last six as ceo i have decided to begin the transition to retirement i do this knowing that danaher has never been stronger the combination of our portfolio is unmatched i would like to start by thanking dan and her business system for providing me with the opportunity to speak today i have loved every day of the past three decades and throughout my entire dan and her career i have been privileged to be part of an incredible team i have always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency enhancing the portfolio driving innovation and developing town and i can now look back fondly on the tremendous progress we have made on all these fronts i plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months and i am confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come many of you know rayner blair well from his days as president of cypress and more recently i am pleased to introduce doctor ryan reynolds as the new leader of our life science platform enhancing the platform is growth and margin profile while leading the acquisitions of paul idt and sigtiva to name just a few there is no question that ryan reynolds is the right person to lead us into the future with the support of our senior leadership team and our board i am confident that ryan is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our shareholders well 1st off that question is one for several months from now but i am looking forward to spending more time with my family and i will continue to serve on the boards of medstar health and the college of the holy cross i will remain in the ceo role through september 1st of this year and i will be around into 2021 in an advisory role but for now and as soon as we finish this call we will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months with that i will turn the call back over to matt so we can start taking your questions thanks tom that concludes our formal comments cristel we are now ready for questions thank you once again to ask a question please press star one your 1st question comes from the line of david debruin with bank of america hey so a couple of questions and then i will i will congratulate you on on the retirement i am jealous by the way so to start off so can you tell us what you are embedding into the guide in the two queue for covid related contributions i mean you are producing a lot of you know sephiatech you know the serologies ramping up i guess are are all those tests going to be used or they all spoken for this is curious in terms of what we are thinking about utilization and so what is embedded into the the guide thanks sure okay thanks thanks derek happy to walk you through that a bit so if let us go right to the to the covid impact in q two and and i would think about it as largely a tailwind that probably represents you know 500 basis points of of improvement or growth that is associated predominantly with sefeid radiometer and idt and in terms of the related question about what is spoken for you know sefeid we are we are flat out at sefeid we are continuing to expand our capacity but every test that we produce every single day we have a new ship and the demand is continuing to build radiometer also running flat out not quite the  need for expanded capacity we had the search capacity we needed there but they are doing exceptionally well and idt holding its own as well so i think overall you would consider seafieidt and idt certainly contributors on the positive side what that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is in good shape so is you know potentially down anywhere from five to fifteen and those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like like beckman diagnostics like biosystems a bit that are more patient volume dependent and we will have to see whether that patient volume you know coming from loosening up of elective procedures starts to return but certainly the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment oriented business like lms and sciex and and a bit at pid no doubt so now putting on the headset and that together you then partially offset that with with probably a bit of positive from paul and siteva that are showing positive growth that is not exclusively covid related but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines so i think that is the way i would sort of generally frame up the the pluses and the minuses around the covid impact in in q two and then there is like in there is matt and then there is matt hey derek it is matt i just want to make sure also you kind of we are not assuming anything here in the quarter for serology even though we are ramping up with beckman and we are going to have some capacity here our view is that it is just a little too early to really kind of tell you know what the volumes might look like what a national testing program or any other kind of local testing programs might look like so that that covid talewind does not include serology just to be clear zero great that is really helpful and i guess just one question on site heva in in general did you see any stocking in the 1st quarter and i am just curious what are you assuming for organic revenue growth in the psykova standalone business for the 2nd quarter we saw  you know very little it is always hard to tell when it is you know  on the margins as to whether or not there was there was stocking going on there you know generally we do not do not think it was but i tell you sitivo is off to a great start as i mentioned ten core growth in the 1st quarter really strong momentum in the core bioprocessing business and and that is really driven by folks working on solutions to to covid nineteen and but you know as we look forward i think we we have really as you can imagine it is given we just closed the the yeah the end of march 1st of april we are just just off to a great start to really understand what that funnel looks like and you know there is there is plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time depending on the the progression of therapies and vaccines so i think we have got an outstanding start here but you know in terms of where we are from a guide perspective on siteiva we are still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like obviously we have not even gotten face to face with the team yet from an operating review so right now we are going to focus on obviously a good good deal of rebranding work that we need to do we are going to stand it up as a standalone operating company execute on the tsa and exit those tsa work streams and costs and make sure that we are embedding d b into the business and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance so we will we will come back to you and give you a better sense of what sitiva looks like in the balance sheet once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of how the bookings trends look and we round the corner here coming into the 2nd half of the year great thank you thanks dear your next question comes from the line of at tyson peterson with j p morgan morning tyson good morning tom i will start with the congrats on the transition i think it might be helpful to hear from you here you why why now is the right time i know you you planned these things out well in advance but you know i think people were caught a little bit off guard in the middle of a pandemic after closing your largest deals so could you maybe just talk a little bit about you know how long this transition had been planned and why now is the right time sure absolutely tycho i would be happy to you know i i can honestly say that you you had that you would have to go all the way back to my very 1st year in the role where we and along with the board made sure that we talked about talent development about ensuring that we are progressing in in various ways through our leadership ranks to get to the point where we are today and and and had an outstanding choice in ryan or blair to succeed me so this has very much been the culmination of a succession planning process that really worked over the last five or six years we have always wanted to do something like this when we are in a position of strength and i think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what i think makes us very comfortable that this is certainly a good time to turn the reins over it was super important that we got siteva closed and and then we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here of the role allows for both reiner and i to to contribute to ensuring that sitiva comes into the organization smoothly so i think it s really a combination of all those things you know i think the the danaher board was incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along i am i am really excited about about ryan and the the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role and he is just going to do a fantastic job so we yeah we all feel great about it okay thanks and then for the follow up just a question on on some of the longer term covid related tailwinds you know for seth yeah there will probably be less rule in rule out you know flu testing tied to covid going forward so i am curious how you think about that and then we think about durability of that test once there is a vaccine on the market for beck being curious if you can put anything around pricing for serology and then lastly for sitiva and paul just curious how meaningful you think vaccine and therapy development could be for those businesses you know on a multiyear basis thanks sure thanks tycho you know there is we have we have got a lot going on as it as it relates to the the future impacts of covid and i think in many respects we are pretty uniquely positioned both on the short term and the long term i think if you start with from a diagnostic testing perspective sepsis impact along with idt radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line as well as beckman and certain in serology and igg testing i think that is a pretty unique combination of capabilities now you asked about the durability of the sepsis test i think yeah you know as you know well we are we are one of the major suppliers of these tests and we have been for many years i think as we see the future here you are going to you are going to look clinicians are going to be looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing covid nineteen testing and i think the ability to run those tests on the same platform and the same cartridge job with the same cartridge configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have for sephia of course as this surgeon demand now is happening we are seeing that that is not a problem in terms of the test cartridges themselves but it is driving a significant increase in our install base and so as that install base has grown you are also going to see that install base driving not only covid nineteen testing but it is continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for seepet over time and obviously there is a broader suite of tests that run on the seepet architecture and so that is going to benefit as well so we think there is exceptional durability even in one where we have and god willing we will have both therapies as well as as well as vaccines in terms of your your question about beckman and serology you know i think the way we see serology evolving over time is you are it is going to be primarily driven obviously with a blood draw you are going to see the serology test the igg test integrated into more routine testing and therefore the cost per test is going to be quite reasonable and it is going to be in line with other immunosassay tests and so while we talk about the the capacity to have 30000000 tests as i think matt said earlier i would not build that into any models but i think it is representative of the fact that serology testing that igg test is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunosassay tests so i think a lot of a lot of terrific potential there particularly as it relates to advances in in public health and population testing and some of the work that is being done by by public health authorities to look for hotspots over time in terms of your question about sitteva and and work around therapies and by vaccines i would say both paul and sitteva are uniquely positioned to provide you know pretty critical inputs meaning filtration and resins to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates right now we would estimate that they are greater than 150 therapeutic and vaccine candidates today and paul and sitiva are are working with a majority of those in some capacity and so obviously they will be they will be winners and losers but we think we have a number of of exceptional positions there with with folks that are likely going to be part of the future therapy and or vaccine answers so i think yeah good good spot to be in great i appreciate it and congrats again on the retirement thanks teco your next question comes from the line of vj kumar with evercor isi morning vj morning guys and congrats on a well earned rest i think you know maybe starting with leadership question here tom well i would start a b j with the fact that ryan and i worked together and we worked well together he came in initially as the as the president of videojet and i am not sure reynolds and his wife elaine had actually unpacked their bags when we had we were looking to to succeed me at cyrix after the cyrix acquisition i was headed off to bechmann and we had this outstanding outstanding leader i would just come into videojet in a real need at cyrix and reiner repack and and moved to boston and and led cyrix for for a number of years and just did an exceptional job and and he and i have worked together literally every day since then through the the the work at cyrix through the acquisitions of paul and and idt obviously throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the market opportunities and positioning the company for success we have an opportunity that has become sitiva our largest acquisition ever and so you know when you work together for as long as we have i guess there there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the two of us but you know vj you are going to have plenty of time to ask ryanor that question he will probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the two of us than i will in the domains not only in life science but across danaher he is unbelievably well respected across danaher as a dbs leader a great teacher a dbs practitioner and and somebody who lives and breathes the danaher core values and and our shared purpose of helping realize life is potential every single day you know his track record relative to mna and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to i think to place bets both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is is unparalleled so i yeah you know i i hope and believe that you will probably see a lot of similarities between the two of us in terms of what we value but you know ryan will will put his own mark on danaher and i am supremely confident that that mark on danaher is going to be an outstanding one and an indelible one i just may be one housekeeping question for perhaps for matt matt it seems you know the press release had a couple of 100 basis points of contribution from sitewa that that perhaps implies you know double digits maybe even low teens growth in the business i just want to make sure with the business doing ten i think in that q one you know continuing double digits in that two q is that just up the business you know growth as usual or was there any contribution and perhaps from  you know co vid related  business and then perhaps also address that you know deferral margins here for too few thanks guys yeah sure so from  siva perspective i mean i think you know it grew ten there in q one i think that s probably a reasonable place you know for the business to be here in the 2nd quarter as well so i think your your math on that is is pretty correct as far as deferral metal margins go i think the place that i would start is probably about forty decrepentals it can vary you know quite a bit depending on mix etc but i think starting with forty is a good place to start i will tell you that probably in in q two in diagnostics though probably need to be more like fifty or sixty decrepentals and that is all related to fx so that delta will be because of fx here in the quarter so forty overall maybe a touch higher here in q two and in diagnostics thanks guys thanks vj we have reached the allotted time for questions your last question comes from the line at scott davis with maleus research hi yeah good morning guys and congrats tom thanks scott good morning it has been a great six years i mean i am a little surprised you are you are going but i do not blame you retirement sounds pretty interesting right now laughter he said by the current economic uncertainties it was very much part of the plan yeah sure i believe that anyway so i wish you the best i know we will see you wherever you go but anyway thank you and a great run what are the challenges of integrating sitiiba here in this kind of new world i mean can you can you really teach dbs and do kaisens and all that stuff and you know on a zoom video yes thanks for the question scott yes is the is the answer that why do i why would that be the case given how important being at you know you you know we use that term being at gemba being in the real place you know how important we we talk about that being well we actually kicked off dbs training what we call eco executive champion orientation we we kicked that off virtually i used microsoft teams just two weeks ago i kicked the guy off ryan was on the call john szkowski who you know from our dms office led the effort we probably touched we got more people through that eco over that day day and a half i forget the full duration because of actually being able to use a virtual tool and so a digital tool the answer is we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we

are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we we are doing our best we are off to a good start we have got to get creative we have got to invent new ways to get things done interestingly our our existing businesses outside of sitiva are in fact doing multi day chaizen using  virtual tools using zoom using microsoft teams and it is it is not the same it is different we would not use that as a standard going forward we absolutely value being face to face but you know we have we challenged our teams to get creative and continue to drive continuous improvement even in this environment that is encouraging just just switching gears i know there have been a lot of questions around perteconsept and expectations but you know if you go down to environmental and applied solutions you get some interesting businesses different cyclicalities and and such is there kind of a range of outcomes and too many questions tom you know we can start to think about for those businesses and i know you made some encouraging comments on video chat but and actually just water too but on an overall basis at least these times as there is an economic environment you know hock is leadership position in water quality analytics you know four to five x its nearest competitor it is its nearest competitor you know a leader from a shareholder perspective as well both obviously heavily skewed towards their their balanced to sales skewed towards consumables you know north of 7075 in those businesses being after market consumables and service when when water quality testing has to be done every single day and municipalities around the world when consumer packaged goods have to be marketed and shipped every single day around the world those consumables continue to underpin you know reasonably steady performance i mean they are a safety net under the yeah under the revenue structures of those businesses and while there will be some other dimensions the like the equipment side in in water quality for example or even in pid and some of the yeah some of the software businesses that will be a little bit more pressured here you know i think those are still really solid businesses even in these challenging times so i would not i would not trade those businesses for for any in their markets i i should have asked it differently i guess will this segment be down more than your corporate average yes well yeah i mean i think they would be down but down a bit more only because they are they are not buoyed by the terrific performance that we continue to see at at sappi and an idt as well as radio and even with the you know what we think it is going to be pretty solid performance at at siteeva and paul so yes i think these businesses would be at the at the lower end of the of the core growth you know component you could potentially see the the segment esa down potentially mid to high teens inside of the guide okay perfect thank you and congrats again tom that is all right scott good to hear from you today crystal that that concludes our our questions did you want to give any final remarks well thanks everyone for joining us today we are around all day for questions this concludes today is conference call you may now disconnect",

chief financial officer mister josh reed mister joshua reed thank you you may begin thank you and good morning everyone on the call with me are doctor todd brady aldeyra is president and chief executive officer and david mcmullin our chief commercial officer doctor brady will begin with an overview of our recent highlights and upcoming clinical milestones i will discuss our 2nd quarter financial results and then we will take your questions please note that this morning is conference call contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of aldeyra forward looking statements include statements regarding the timing of planned clinical trial initiation aldeyra is possible or assumed future results of operations expenses and financial position business strategies and plans research development and commercial plans or expectations trends market sizing competitive position industry environment and potential growth opportunities among other things these statements are based upon the information available to the company today as a result of the covid nineteen pandemic clinical site availability staffing and patient recruitment have been negatively affected and the timelines to complete our clinical trials may be delayed aldeyra assumes no obligation to update these statements as circumstances change future events and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the company forward looking statements including the current and potential future impact of the covid nineteen pandemic on our business results of operations and financial position additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ materially from our forward looking statements are described in greater detail in the company is press release issued this morning containing financial results for the quarter ended june thirty 2020 and the company is filings with the sec and with that i will turn the call over to doctor todd brady our president and chief executive officer thank you joshua and good morning everyone as our industry and healthcare 1st responders continue working together to defeat the worst public health crisis in a century our thoughts are with those affected by covid nineteen the seemingly relentless spread of the novel coronavirus has made 2020 a tragic and surreal year but we remain hopeful and confident in the abilities of our industry to develop the therapies necessary to extinguish this virulent disease i again want to especially thank our team for their work and dedication to our mission developing 1st in class medicines to improve the lives of patients with immunological diseases whose conditions are not being adequately treated by the current standard of care from our perspective the key pipeline development to the 2nd quarter was our type c meeting with the fda which charted the remaining clinical pathway to an nda submission for topical ocular reproxalap in dry eye disease the meeting culminated in an agreement to use levels of reactive aldehyde species or rasp the therapeutic target for reproxalap as an objective sign in point for subsequent clinical evaluation in the 4th quarter of this year we plan to initiate clinical testing to assess the activity of topical ocular reproxalap in reducing tear levels of rasp and other objective signs of dry eye disease and we expect preliminary results by the end of the year the timing of the clinical trial is of course subject to finalization of trial design rasp assay development and potential disruptions due to covid nineteen initiation of a safety study in dry eye disease patients is also planned for the 4th quarter an nda submission is expected by the end of 2021 our optimism for the use of rasp as an objective sign of dry disease is supported by data from our successful phase iia trial in which reproxalap treatment diminished levels of rasp tear rasp in tears as measured by elisa following 28 days of treatment for the upcoming rasp trials the longest duration of dosing under consideration is also 28 days whereas the shortest dosing duration is one to two days additionally the upcoming rasp trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the effect of acute changes in dryness on rasp and other signs and symptoms of dry eye disease we will be sharing additional details as a protocol following rasp assay validation and fda requirement and look forward to providing trial designs shortly from a safety perspective topical ocular reproxalap already has been evaluated in more than 1000 patients with no observed safety concerns in short the safety consistency and clinically significant activity of reproxalap across numerous clinical trials suggest that reproxalap could be an important addition to the limited number of therapeutic options for dry eye disease which affects more than 30000000 patients in the united states looking at other ocular programs in our pipeline top line results from the phase iii invigorate allergen chamber trial of reproxalap and allergic conjunctivitis are expected in the 1st half of 2021 in the retinal disease area the 2nd quarter of this year the european commission granted orphan medicinal product designation to adx 2191 for the treatment of retinal detachment opening a new market opportunity for adx 2191 in the european union as drugs receiving the orphan medicinal product designation are eligible to protocol assistance research funding and upon approval ten years of eu market exclusivity adx 21 nove 2191 are novel and proprietary intravitreal methotrexate injection is being evaluated in the phase iii guard trial for proliferative vitreoretinopathy pvr is a rare but sight threatening condition and a leading cause of failure of retinal detachment surgery effecting roughly 4000 patients per year in the united states and nearly twice as many in europe and japan combined given the nature of pvr and given the clinical site delays caused by covid nineteen the progress of guard has been slow although we expect to provide you with an update by the end of this year as many of you know there is no approved therapy for pvr and adx 2191 has received orphan drug and fast track designations from the fda adx 2191 is also the subject of our new clinical program in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma or pvrl a rare aggressive high grade cancer that affects approximately 2900 people in the united states with about 600 new cases diagnosed annually there are no approved treatments for the disease although the standard of care is pharmacy compounded methotrexate that has been injected into the eye we have recently filed for orphan drug designation for adx 2191 in pvrl turning to our systemic disease programs we are very excited about adx 21 adx 629 which to our knowledge is the 1st systemically available rasp inhibitor the clinical testing of which represents the 1st time systemic rasp inhibition has been assessed clinically marking an exciting new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism of action an ind has been filed with the fda for phase ii clinical testing of adx 629 in patients with covid nineteen in order to prevent cytokine release syndrome and respiratory compromise clinical development is expected to begin this year in an animal model of cytokine storm adx 629 demonstrated a broad and highly statistically significant reduction in cytokine levels including tnf alpha interferon gamma and il seventeen while up regulating the key anti inflammatory cytokines il ten the data suggests that rasp inhibitors have the potential to represent immunological switches which may modulate immune systems from pro inflammatory states to anti inflammatory states in the 4th quarter of this year we also expect to initiate clinical trials of adx 629 in psoriasis an auto immune disease and atopic asthma an allergic disease in combination trials in covid nineteen psoriasis and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation and the results of the trials will characterize the immune modulating activity of adx 629 and rasp inhibition more generally switching to adx 1612 our novel hsp ninety inhibitor enrollment has been completed in the investigator sponsored phase ii eudario trial in ovarian cancer regarding the adx 1612 covid nineteen program consistent with fda feedback additional preclinical antiviral testing of adx 1612 against sars cov two the virus that causes covid nineteen will be performed by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases which has accepted our request to evaluate adx 1612 in in vivo models we plan to update on the adx 1612 covid program by the end of 2020 we approached the mid point of the 3rd quarter in a strong financial position enhancing our flexibility with recent common stock sales to two healthcare focused funds perceptive advisors and avidity partners these transactions raised gross proceeds of approximately 19500000 completing our previously announced at the market offering program we expect our cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations through 2022 including potential reproxalap approval in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis now with that i would like to turn the call back over to josh for the financial review thanks todd for the quarter ended june thirty 2020 we reported a net loss of $7500000 compared with a net loss of $13300000 for the quarter ended june thirty 2019 net loss per share with ¢25 for the quarter ended june thirty 2020 compared with ¢49 for the same period in 2019 losses have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research and development program as well as from general and administrative expenses research and development expenses were $4900000 for the quarter ended june thirty 2020 compared with $10700000 for the same period in 2019 the decrease to $5800000 is primarily related to a reduction in clinical and preclinical development manufacturing and personnel costs general and administrative expenses were $2200000 for the quarter ended june thirty 2020 compared with $3100000 for the same period in 2019 the decrease of $900000 is due to lower personnel related costs including stock based compensation and other miscellaneous administrative costs in the 2nd quarter of 2020 total operating expenses were $7100000 compared with total operating expenses of $13700000 for the same period in 2019 as of june thirty 2020 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were $66200000 subsequent to june thirty 2020 $25200000 in cash was received from at the market offering programs sales to perceptive advisors avidity partners and other investors based on current operating plans cash cash equivalent and marketable securities as of june thirty 2020 plus the additional at the market offering program proceeds are expected to be sufficient to fund operations through the end of 2022 including potential nda approvals for reproxalap in dry disease and allergic conjunctivitis assuming positive clinical trial results and planned nda submission acceptances and approvals use of cash cash equivalent and marketable securities are also expected to include the continuation of part one of the phase iii guard trial in pvr and phase ii clinical testing of adx 629 an orally administered rasp inhibitor in inflammatory diseases now i will turn the call back to todd for closing comments thanks josh we have a number of milestones planned for the 2nd half of 2020 and look forward to executing on our clinical development strategy across our ocular and systemic programs looking at our irr calendar next week we will be presenting at the btig virtual biotechnology conference and wedbush pacgrow healthcare virtual conference these events will be webcast please check the events and presentation section of our website for details we always look forward to meeting with investors and hope to connect with you at these or other upcoming events as always we remain committed to executing efficiently in our strategic plan and bringing to market novel therapies that impu that improve the lives of patients with serious unmet medical needs with that josh dave and i will be happy to take your questions operator at this time if you would like to ask a question please press then the number one on your telephone keypad that is one to ask a question our 1st question comes from the line louise chen with cantor hi thanks for taking my questions here so 1st question i have for you is could you get into more detail on significance the fda is recognition of rasp as assigned for dry eye disease is and what that means for you in terms in terms of potential approval and market opportunity and then the 2nd question i have for you is on your covid trials how adaptive are those trials in light of the constantly evolving landscape for the treatment of covid and then how is enrollment gone and then my last question here is you noticed that there has been some headwinds to clinical trial progression due to covid can you give more color on which trials may be impacted here thank you hi good morning louise and and thanks for your excellent questions the rasp development is truly transformative for aldeyra rasp is the pharmaceutical target is upon which the company was founded many years ago to our knowledge no company has ever therapeutically addressed rasp and yet rasp represents a very broad based anti inflammatory approach that probably applies to many many diseases not only ocular diseases such as dry eye disease but also systemic diseases so for all those reasons we were thrilled about the fda is decision to classify rasp as an objective sign of dry eye disease which as you know is an inflammatory condition what it means practically for the company is that the ongoing clinical trials the clinical trials that are about to start regarding the assessment of rasp should be likely to work based on the fact that the mechanism of reproxalap and our other rasp inhibitors is the direct inhibition of rasp these compounds bind covalently to rasp so what we are really measuring is a chemical reaction in vivo and in this case in the the tear fluid of patients that have been administered reproxalap and all of that leads us to believe that we will be position to file an nda for dry eye disease next year as we have previously announced regarding the covid trial designs we anticipate for both programs enrolling approximately wait thirty patients i think there will likely be a two to one randomization drug to placebo at this point we have not included adaptive designs i think the nature of the results of these 1st trials will help us determine subsequent clinical testing which is obviously going to be much more significant if there are positive results from the preliminary outputs that we have here enrollment has not started the ind has been filed for 629 as i mentioned on the call today 1612 is the subject of further in vivo investigation in covid that is being performed by niaid and we are absolutely thrilled about niaid decision to to test adx 1612 on our behalf the covid impact as you mentioned louise across the industry has been significant the one trial in our case in our pipeline that has been affected by covid nineteen is the guard trial the phase iii guard trial for pvr what seemed to have happened during the peak of covid cases back in march april may and so forth was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite vision changes despite losing sight the number of of patients coming in was diminished at during that timeframe and furthermore many clinical sites as you know simply did not have research staff which were considered for a while to be non essential such that it was difficult if not impossible in some cases to enroll to enroll patients however the good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline we do not seem to be have been ov overtly affected by covid in terms of enrollment the dry eye program was largely under discussion with the fda during the peak number of cases in the spring the allergy program the phase iii allergy program was on planned hold because of pollen as you know you cannot enroll allergy programs with ambient pollen and we expect the invigorate program to re initiate again in the fall so we were quite fortunate in terms of timing with regard to our other clinical programs we have relative to the impact of of covid okay thank you as a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press then the number one on your telephone keypad that is one to ask a question our next question comes from the line of justin kim with oppenheimer company hi good morning guys thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress i know it is early days but you know as you think about establishing reproxalap action on rasp as a sign of dry eye we have had some discussion with investors on what would be an appropriate duration of observation to assess this activity can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the acute versus four week time points from a trial perspective disease perspective and labeling perspective great good morning justin and good to hear from you the as i highlighted in my comments this morning the potential range of dosing duration for the rasp trials is anywhere from one to two days on the acute end to 28 days on the more chronic or subchronic end which reflects the phase iia trial that is the data in our corporate deck showing that after 28 days of administration of reproxalap there was a highly statistically significant reduction in rasp levels as measured by elisa i want to spend a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure rasp rasp ex exist in our body in two forms so called free rasp that are rasp that are sort of floating around and then rasp that are bound to proteins the elisa measures rasp bound to proteins and as you know elisa is an antibody mediated detection assay the reason why we are able to generate antibodies to bound rasp is that when rasp bind to proteins they are antigenic and form antibodies in some cases antibodies against self protein so the elisa measures bound rasp and bound rasp generally accumulate over time which is why in the phase iia study over 28 days we use the elisa to assess rasp levels on the other end of the spectrum of regarding one to two day or acute dosing of reproxalap we think that techniques such as lc ms mass spec might be more relevant to assessing rasp because there we would be looking at pre rasp levels that would acutely following dosing so somewhere within those two ranges of dosing paradigms and those two different assay techniques we will end up validating the precise technique and and then establishing protocol design for the 1st of the rasp studies to begin shortly okay great got it and maybe then you know how do you think about dosing regimens to the investigator and have you had conversations with the fda on you know whether you would have to do sort of you know q i d or b i d you know just to appreciate that you would be tapering in in sort of the disease state eventually right and and that gets back to the 1st part of your question how might the clinical community perceive duration of dosing and dosing regimen 1st of all i think that signs of diseases including dry eye disease are primarily or 1st and foremost regulatory milestones i do not believe that certainly in the case of dry eye disease that either physicians or patients are particularly worried about signs patients do not wake up in the morning thinking i wonder what my schirmer is test is i wonder what my corneal stain is and so forth instead we view signs and i think most patients and physicians view signs as regulatory milestones so the dosing paradigm for trials associated purely with signs i think is a lot less important in this case for one to two doses day the one to two day dosing paradigm you are thinking of of a limited number of doses for the 28 day dosing paradigm i would expect we would dose q i d which is the 1st phase of our induction maintenance dosing paradigm which was established with the release of the phase iii renew trial back in december in terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm for reproxalap in general in terms of treating patients i think that the induction maintenance paradigm established with renew over twelve weeks r really sets the tone a and and more precisely the label for how the drug will be used and that is a q i d dosing initially followed by b i d dosing for the maintenance phase okay that is really helpful maybe just a clarification question i i know in the press release it says that there is going to be a dry eye nda filing by the end of next year is the current thinking still to continue onward with the concurrent filing just you know i know i know later it says that it is also going to be filed just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect them together still our current thinking is that both will be filed together pending positive clinical data of course it turns out that the timelines for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis continue to overlap the safety studies the efficacy studies the timeline for filing the mda m nda all of those seem to overlap for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point which suggests that a concurrent nda is perhaps the best regulatory strategy but of course we will have to see how events play out over the latter part of this year and the early part of next year before we can guide specifically on the possibility of concurrent nda we really do like the concurrent nda paradigm however because of the overlap between dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis there seems to be about a fifty overlap such that about half of the patients with dry eye disease complain of ocular itching and about half the patients with allergic conjunctivitis complain of dryness and and a single compound that could treat both diseases or is indicated for both diseases would be highly advantageous not only to to physicians but also to patients as well right great that makes a lot of sense my last question is just you know on the safety study is there an expectation for what the size and scope you know duration as well as number of patients you would you would anticipate for it right for dry eye disease my current understanding is that the fda generally requires 100 patients complete one year of dosing however based on other res other sponsors interactions with the agency we believe that we can file based on six months of safety data so what happens is most sponsors will over enroll they will begin with more than 100 patients such that they have 100 completers at at twelve months and to our knowledge the the safety trials are are fairly standard in in dry eye disease i will say as i mentioned in my prepared comments that we have tested well over 1000 patients we have seen no safety signals no changes in intraocular pressure no retinal findings no aberrant corneal findings or any other safety signals that would suggest that there has been an with reproxalap dosing in any patient that is received drug so far great great thanks again and i will hop back in the queue yep thanks justin and there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to doctor brady for closing remarks well thank you all again for joining us today as always we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress have a nice day thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today is conference call we

additionally the upcoming rat trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the effect of acute changes in dryness on rasps i will be sharing additional details of the protocol following rasp assessment validation and fda requirement and look forward to providing trial designs shortly from a safety perspective topical gelocalyx already has been evaluated in more than 1000 patients with no observed safety concerns in short the safety consistency and clinical efficacy of this product have been well established in conclusion the significant activity of reproxalap across numerous clinical trials suggests that reproxalap could be an important addition to the limited number of therapeutic options for dry eye disease which affects more than 30000000 patients in the united states looking at other ocular programs in our pipeline top line results from the phase three allergen chamber trial of reproxalap in allergic conjunctivitis are expected in the 1st half of the year in the retinal disease area in the 2nd quarter of this year the european commission granted orphan medicinal product designation to adx 221991 for the treatment of retinal detachment opening a new market opportunity

methotrexate that has been injected into the eye we have recently filed for orphan drug status turning to our systemic disease program we are very excited about adx 2199 which to our knowledge is the 1st systemic raspinhibitor that has been assessed clinically marking an exciting new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism an ide has been filed with the fda for phase two clinical

research and development programs research and development expenses were $4900000 for the quarter ended june 32nd compared with $10700000 for the same period in 1999 the decrease of $5800000 is

telephone keypad that is star one to ask a question our 1st question comes from the line of louis fenderson with cancer therapies inc so 1st question i have for you is could you get into more detail on the significance of the fde is recognition of rasping as a sign for dry eye disease and what that means for you in terms of potential approval and market opportunity and then the 2nd question i have for you was on your covid trials how adaptive are those trials in light of the constantly evolving landscape for the treatment of covid and then how is enrollment gone and then my last question here is you noticed that there has been some head winds to clinical trials can you talk about that good morning louise and thank you for your excellent question the rasp development is truly transformative for elida rasp is the pharmaceutical target upon which the company was founded many years ago to our knowledge no company has ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever

ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever and yet rasps represent a very broad based anti inflammatory approach that probably applies to many many diseases not only ocular diseases such as dry eye disease but also systemic diseases so for all those reasons we were thrilled about the fda is decision to classify rasps as an objective sign of dry eye disease which as you know is an inflammatory disease what it means practically for the company is that the ongoing clinical trials the clinical trials that are about to start regarding the assessment of ras should be likely to work based on the fact that the mechanism of rapalap and our other ras inhibitors is the direct inhibition of ras these compounds bind covalently to ras so what we are really measuring is a chemical change and in this case in the  tear fluid of patients that have been administered repoxal in all that leads us to believe that we will be in a position to file an nda for dry eye disease next year as we have previously announced mister president regarding the covid trial designs we anticipate for both programs enrolling approximately sixty patients i think thirty patients i think they will likely be a two to one randomization drug to placebo at this point we have not included adaptive designs i think the nature of the results of these 1st trials will help us determine subsequent clinical testing which is obviously going to be much more significant if there are positive results from the preliminary outputs that we have here enrollment has not started yet the adx 1621 is the subject of further in vero investigation in covid that is being performed by nioad and we are absolutely thrilled about nioad is decision to test adx 1621 on our behalf the covid impact as you mentioned louise is across the board what seemed to have happened during the peak of covid cases back in march april may and so forth was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite the efforts of the hospital staff despite losing sight the number of of patients coming in was diminished during that timeframe and furthermore many clinical sites as you know simply did not have research staff which were considered for a while to be non essential such that it was  difficult if not impossible in some cases to enroll to enroll patients the good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline we do not seem to have been overtly affected by covid in terms of enrollment the dry eye program was largely under discussion with the fda during the peak number of cases in the spring the allergy program the phase three allergy program was on a planned hold because of pollen as you know you cannot enroll allergy programs good morning my name is doctor we are expecting the incentive program to reinitiate again in the fall so we were quite fortunate in terms of timing with regard to our other clinical programs relative to the impact of of covid okay thank you as a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad that is star one to ask a question or next good morning guys thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress i know it is early days but as you think about establishing or re establishing our practice the lack of action on ras is a sign of dry eye we have had some discussions with our investors on what would be an appropriate duration of observation to detect festivity can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the acute versus four week time points from a trial perspective disease perspective and labeling perspective good morning justin and good to hear from you as i highlighted in my comments this morning the potential range of dosing duration for the rasp trials is anywhere from one to two days on the acute end to 28 days on the more chronic or subchronic end which reflects the phase to a trial that is the data in our corporate deck showing that after 28 days of administration of repsolap there are no significant adverse events i want to spend a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure rasps rasp exists in our body in two forms so called free rasps that are rasps that are sort of floating around and then rasps that are bound to proteins the elisa measures rasp bound to proteins as you know elisa is an antibody mediated assay the reason why we are able to generate antibodies to bound ras is that when ras binds to proteins their antigen is formed in some cases antibodies against self proteins so the elisa measures bound ras and bound ras generally accumulates over time which is why in the phase two study over 28 days we use the elisa to assess ras levels on the other end of the spectrum we have a western blot we think that techniques such as lc ms ms might be more relevant to assessing ras because there we would be looking at free ras levels that would change acutely following dosing so somewhere within those two ranges of dosing paradigms and those two different assay techniques we will end up validating the precise ok i am finished transcribing the spoken words eventually right and that gets back to the 1st part of your question how might the clinical community perceive a duration of dosing and dosing regimens 1st of all i think that signs of diseases including dry eye disease are primarily or 1st and foremost regulatory milestones i do not believe certainly in the case of dry eye disease that that is the case i think that patients and physicians are particularly worried about signs patients do not wake up in the morning thinking i wonder what my schirmer test is i wonder what my corneal stain is and so forth instead we view signs and i think that both patients and physicians view signs as regulatory milestones so the dosing paradigm for trials associated purely with signs i think is a lot less important for the one to two day dosing paradigm you are thinking of a limited number of doses for the 28 day dosing paradigm i would expect we would dose qid which is the 1st phase of our induction maintenance dosing paradigm which was established with the release of the phase three renewal trial back in december in terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm they look at it as a way to deliver the drug to the patient in general in terms of treating patients i think that the induction maintenance paradigm established with renew over twelve weeks really sets the tone and more precisely the label for how the drug will be used that is a qid dosing initially followed by bid dosing for maintenance phase okay that is really helpful maybe just a clarification i am not sure if this is what you are asking for i know that the press release says that it is going to be a dry and drier by the end of next year is the current thinking still to continue on with the concurrent filing just you know i know later it says that ac is also going to be filed just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect them together still our current thinking is that both will be filed together pending positive clinical data of course it turns out that ac is also going to be filed just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect them together still the safety studies the efficacy studies the timeline for filing the nda all of those seem to overlap for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point which suggests that a concurrent nda is perhaps the best regulatory strategy but of course we will have to see how events play out over the latter part of this year and the early part of next year before we can guide specifically on the possibility of a concurrent nda we really do like the concurrent nda paradigm however because of the overlap between dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis there seems to be about a fifty overlap such that about half of the patients with dry eye disease complain of ocular itching and about half the patients with allergic conjunctivitis complain of dryness and a single compound that could treat both diseases or is indicated for both diseases would be highly advantageous not only to to physicians but also to patients as well right great that makes a lot of sense my next question is just you know on the safety study is there an expectation for what the size and scope you know duration as well as the number of patients you would you would anticipate for it right for dry eye disease you know my current understanding is that the fda generally requires 100 patients complete one year of dosing however based on other sponsors interactions with the agency we believe that we can file based on six months of safety data so what happens is most sponsors will over enroll they will begin with more than a 100 patients we have 100 completers at at twelve months and to our knowledge the the safety trials are are fairly standard in in dry eye disease i will say as i mentioned in my prepared comments that we have tested well over a 1000 patients we have seen no safety signals no changes in interocular pressure no retinal findings no aberrant corneal findings or any other safety signals that would suggest that there has been an issue with rhexaplaton dosing in any patient that is received drug so far great great thanks again and i will hop back in the queue yep thanks jossy and there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to doctor braddy for closing remarks well thank you all again for joining us today as always we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress have a nice day thank

questions operator please go ahead thank you edward ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session if you wish to ask a question please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced if you wish to cancel a request please press the pound or hash key your 1st question comes from from jp morgan please ask a question good morning management thanks for taking my question my question is on the ad market so can you give us an update on the trend in the 2nd half it seems revenue decline widen in the 3rd quarter and you still mentioned covid nineteen was still one of the major reasons so can you elaborate on that also can management talk about the ad revenue trend of our industries which are the key categories you have seen some recovery and which industry industries still face a lot of challenges thank you morning this is edward speaking i will answer this question actually in the 3rd quarter our advertising business was impacted by the the currents of the epidemic in certain areas of china as well as the popularity of short term videos and the live streaming ecommerce which continues to gain market share during the quarter as you might know our advertising and performance based advertising accounted for about eighty and twenty of our total advertising revenues respectively actually in q three our brand advertising revenues increased on a sequential basis this steady growth was mainly due to the gradual recovery of our offline promotional campaigns and the original ip programs as more offline activities continue to take place in the remainder of 2020 we expect our brand advertising revenues to achieve double digit growth the 1st quarter however on the other hand our performance based advertising continues to face challenges during the 3rd quarter mainly due to i think the following two vectors 1st some of our clients were subject to stricter industry regulations and therefore they had to adopt a more conservative ad placement strategy and secondly the overall supply of the inventory in the market exceeded the market demand which made raising the ecpm is of performance based adverti advertising more difficult the sector the top five industries covered by our advertising business are auto ecommerce fmcg financial services and internet services those industries which have traditionally accounted for a substantial portion of our advertising revenues including auto and were mostly impacted in the 1st half of the year however as the pandemic gradually brought under control in the 3rd quarter both industries have since recovered significantly in regards to the auto market the industry continue to show strong signs of recovery in the period according to china passenger car association in september retial sales of passenger cars increased by about seventhree year over year wholesale sales of new energy passenger cars increased by more than ninety year over year as such we expect the auto sector to continue their recovery in the 4th quarter the online advertising industry has been underperforming due to the reverse of the epidemic in certain areas of china as well as this year is geopolitical issues so far video and ecommerce were the only sources of advertising growth in this quarter while the rest of the industry underperformed in recognition of the changing market dynamics we have already established our in both the short form video and the ecommerce spaces the majority of our original content is now produced in the short form video format and the more than eighty of our brand advertising projects are now short form video projects which we are able to monetize through a combination of content production and advertising sales we are confident that despite facing today is complex and volatile advertising market our competitive advantage will enable us to continue preparing the growth of our going forward i hope i have answered your question yes it does thank you very much edward thank you your next question comes from from 1st shanghai securities please ask a question hi as to the 2nd agents payments how do you plan to use the additional cash on the company is balance sheet are you considering privatization or hi carmen this is shuang let me answer your question as of as of september 30th 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of us dollar 350000000 we hope to maintain our cash strong cash flow during the pandemic it was driven by our effective cost control measures as well as the excellent return we achieved in our it showcased our strategic investment experience as for existing capital the plan to use these resources in three key areas 1st we will continue to optimize our produce with our flagship news app ifeng remaining at the core of our service offerings at the same time we will also aim to develop more platform based products which is capable of meeting the future needs of consumers we will also explore new business opportunities with both government and enterprise business partners secondly we will actively explore more strategic investment opportunities by evaluating potential investments into those vc funds that are aligned with our business goals in particular we are focused on funds with extensive experience in entertainment video luxury consumer products and other vertical services it will help to keep us up to great up to date on the very rapidly evolving market dynamics of new business sectors thirdly we remain committed to creating shareholder value and delivering returns to our shareholders in a variety of ways having said that dividends are certainly one form of giving back to our shareholders that we will consider going forward this year we have observed the privatization of some companies as well as registration system reforms in a domestic capital market we will certainly evaluate our choices in due course with our continuing focus on ensuring shareholder rights and maximizing their interest right now we will also be sure to take over to take our own situation and market environment into account in addition we will continue to work towards refining our core business and executing on new business initiatives we are now taking active steps to expand our ecommerce business by upgrading our ecommerce products and building out our own supply chain to further improve the monetization capabilities of our ecommerce business we hope to share our business progress on this front with everyone as soon as next quarter i hope this answers your question carmen zero thanks thank you once again if you wish to ask a question just press star one your next question comes from frank from please ask a question good morning management thank you for taking my question two questions the 1st one is i remember that you mentioned the company market share narrowed a lot in this year i think you did quite a good job when do you expect to break even looking forward and the 2nd question is on the advertising on the advertising side can you update us how looks like today compared to last quarter or a year ago and what direction do you think kpm will go in the future thank you okay frank this is shuang i will answer the 1st part of the question maybe edward can add a few more on the other question our operating loss for the 1st nine months of 2020 was rmb 73800000 which is much lower than the operating loss of rmb 248000000 in the same period of last year as such we are now on track to achieve our operating target for the full year however due to the impact of the pandemic our top line performance in 2020 we do not expect to break even at level this year as a public company we fully understand the importance of profitability and we are well aware that maintaining the healthy growth of our core business is the optimal path to long term profitability with the continuous optimization of our strategy and vertical operations we are confident that we can leverage our existing business to not only ensure the growth of our core business but also develop additional growth drivers such new area as ecommerce product reviews and our regional ip programs over the long term we believe that our effective corporate governance structure will enable us to strike the fine balance the team grows and profitability i i think you you mentioned the the trend going forward next year right so maybe edward can add a few more words on this hi frank this is edward speaking actually as i have previously mentioned in question you know looking forward the advertising industry is still full of challenges i think it like 1st it depends on the of the academic worldwide especially in china and within next year it is getting better but it is still a question right and so in this kind of macro economic environment we think of the advert online advertising industry are still facing challenges maybe in especially in the 1st half of 2020 and also in the online advertising industry is evolving and users spend more and more time on platforms like this kind of short form video platforms so our advertising incomes are still facing pressure especially for how to make our advertising more closely effective is a big challenge for us but we as i also mentioned before actually we have recognized this kind of changing in market dynamics we already put a

and with your name to be announced please press the pound or hash key to cancel a request your 1st question comes from binbindin from jp morgan please ask a question good morning management thanks for taking my question  my question is on the housing market so can you give us an update on the housing market trend in the 2nd quarter it seems you are expecting a rough decline to widen in the 3rd quarter and you are still mentioning covid nineteen was still one of the major factors hi can you please elaborate on that also can management talk about the automotive industry which are the key categories you are seeing some recovery but which industries still face a lot of challenges thank you as well as the popularity of show form videos and live streaming e commerce which continues to gain market share during the quarter as you may know our brand advertising and performance based advertising accounted for about eighty and twenty of our total advertising revenues respectively our brand advertising revenues increased on a sequential basis this steady growth was mainly due to the gradual recovery of our offshore promotional campaigns and the original ip programs as more offshore activities continue to take place in the remainder of 2020 we expect our branded advertising revenues to increase however on the other hand our performance based advertising continues to face challenges during the 2nd quarter mainly due to i think the following two factors 1st some of our clients are subject to stricter industry regulations and therefore they had to adopt a more conservative approach and therefore they had to adopt a more conservative approach and therefore they had to adopt a more conservative approach secondly the overall supply of either inventory in the market exceeds the market demand which made  raising the ecmps of performance based advertising more difficult those industries which have traditionally accounted for a substantial portion of our advertising revenues including auto and beer were mostly impacted in the 1st half of the year however as the pandemic continued other industries have picked up the slack both industries have since recovered significantly in the 3rd quarter in regards to the auto market the industry continues to show strong signs of recovery in the period according to china passenger car association in september retail sales of passenger cars increased by about seventy year on year overall the industry has been performing underperforming due to the reverse of the epidemic china as well as this year is geopolitical issues show from video and e commerce were the only sources of advertising goals in this quarter while the rest of the industry underperformed in recognition of the changing market dynamics we have already established our presence in both the show from video and e commerce spaces the majority of our original content is now produced in the show from video format and more than eighty of our brand advertising projects are now show from video projects which we are able to monetize through a combination of content production and advertising sales we are confident that despite the facing today is complex and volatile market our competitive advantage will enable us to continue propelling the growth of our business line going forward thank you very much eddie your next

everyone as soon as next quarter i hope this answer your question thank you once again if we should ask a question please press star one good morning management thank you for taking my question the 1st one is that i remember that you mentioned the company target to narrow the loss admit it i think you did a quite a good job your to do list and when do you expect to break even looking forward thank you so probably on the advertising flight you know the unified flight on grandad can you update us on how kpm looks like today compared to last quarter or a year ago and what direction do you think kpm will go in the future thank you i am edward can add a few more words on the other side our operating loss for the 1st nine months of 2020 was rmb 73threeeight 1000000 which is much lower than our operating loss of rmb 2400000000 in the same period last year as such we are now on track to achieve our operating target for the full year however due to the impact of the pandemic our revenue has been impacted in 2020 we do not expect per given at operating level this year as a public company we fully understand the importance of profitability and we are well aware that maintaining the healthy growth of our core business is the optimal path to long term profitability with the continuous optimization of our current strategy and vertical operations we were confident that we can leverage our existing business strengths to not only ensure the growth of our core business but also develop additional growth drivers in such a new era as e commerce product reviews and original ip programs over the long term we believe that our effective corporate governance structure will enable us to strike a fine balance between growth and i think you still mentioned the the advertising trend going forward next year right so maybe ed will add a few more words hi frank this is ed speaking actually as i have previously mentioned in a $1000000000 question you know looking forward as the advertising industry is still full of challenges i think it like  1st of all it depends on the development of the epidemic worldwide especially in china we think next year it is getting better but it is still a question right and so in this kind of  macro economic environment we think the other but online advertising industry is still facing challenges maybe in and also this  in the other online advertising industry is evolving and users spend  more and more time on platforms like抖音和快手 this kind of show form video platforms so our advertising incomes are still facing pressures especially for the how to make our advertising more cost effective is a big challenge for us and but so we as also mentioned before actually we have recognized this kind of changing in market dynamics we already put a lot of effort and in like the short film video and e commerce spaces so next year yeah yeah will be challenged but we also feel very excited and confident we think we can handle this challenge and make some progress in affordable housing business thank you frank thank you john on adams thank you frank please press star one there are no further questions at this time i would like to hand the conference back to management please continue thank you for joining us on this call have a good day thank you all thank you for participating you may all disconnect",

everyone as we approach five months since the start of the pandemic we are encouraged by the positive signs of recovery in the health care space and grateful for those who have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic including our tenants and partners they have demonstrated extraordinary resilience well beyond what we anticipated we expect we will continue to contend with covid nineteen as it ebbs and flows what is encouraging is the progress of better treatments and promising vaccine developments moderna pfizer astrazeneca and many others are reporting positive results from fast tracked clinical trials many expect a successful vaccine in 2020 with widespread availability next year public health officials are also taking a much more targeted approach to addressing hotspots which is allowing health care services to remain open across the country we are seeing physicians ramp up their volumes quickly now approaching pre covid levels they are experiencing heightened for delayed care providers are balancing the delivery of much needed care with safety precautions and they have gained valuable experience in treating their covid patients as a result we are not seeing the use of lengthy or widespread bans on elective procedures several publicly traded national healthcare companies including hca surgery partners and tenant have recently reported steady improvements in volumes throughout may june and july likewise we have seen tenant utilization our buildings rebound to nearly ninety of pre covid levels it does vary geographically somewhat from a low of 75 in washington dc to 100 here in nashville and work order requests are now running it pre covid levels and leasing momentum has also rebounded tours with prospe prospective tenants which dipped below fifty of typical volumes in april are now running well above average rent collection stands at 97 for the 2nd quarter as well as july new deferral requests to fall into nearly zero in the last thirty days and over half of deferrals granted during the 2nd quarter were repaid early which is very encouraging forgivable ppp loans kicked in as designed for payroll rent and utilities the healthcare sector receive more than twelve of all ppp loans of which the biggest recipients were physician offices at more than $8400000000 hr is operating results for the 2nd quarter were steady despite the impact of covid strong cash leasing spreads high tenant retention and stable contractual rent bumps were positive signs of the resiliency of our tenants and the stability of our portfolio with tours being well off pace in april and may occupancy could be marginally softer in the 2nd half of the year but with a sharp recovery in june and july we expect occupancy to strengthen going into two as a result same store noi growth will likely be closer at two in 2020 and bounce back toward three next year external growth is still on pace for a solid 202 the pipeline is strong even after we took extra time to underwrite the financial health of tenants we have increased the top end of our acquisition guidance to be in line with our volume last year and well ahead of our our historical average we have plenty of funding capacity from the mercy dispositions cash on hand forward equity and full availability on our line of credit we are poised to take advantage of a sizable and growing pipeline the pandemic has underscored the critical nature of healthcare services even in uncertain times it has shown that hospitals are the hub of essential care including high acuity outpatient services which drive the stability of our cashflows despite the pandemic we still expect to produce positive ffo per share growth in 2020 rising secular demand a strong balance sheet and a robust pipeline position as well to grow safely in the years ahead now i will turn it over to ms mancini for some additional commentary on healthcare trends bethany thank you the healthcare sector continues to prove its resilience and significant to the us population and economy after five months of experience with covid nineteen a hospitals and physicians are now better equipped with protocols in place and adequate ppe to serve covid patients at the same time providers are managing higher demand from the delay of scheduled care 2nd quarter employment growth numbers are showing covid unprecedented impact on jobs in april and may with promising signs of recovery in the health care sector from late may into june and continued positive momentum heading into the 3rd quarter notably the pace of recovery in the ambulatory sector including physician offices has doubled that of the broader economy healthcare providers are meeting pent up demand for elective care and the resurgence of strong utilization trends returning to more normalized levels quickly hr is tenants on average are operating near full capacity and they are better prepared to provide ongoing outpatient care even in the event of a local surge telemedicine served a critical role in april and may for many providers the easing of its restrictions and higher reimbursement helped sustain patient care and physician practice revenues during the height of the pandemic and the shutdown of non emergent care since then physician offices and most of our markets have returned to seeing a majority of patients in person the trump administration issued an executive order earlier this week to review and continue medicare is coverage of telehealth services after which cms proposed to permanently allow medicare providers to use tele health for evaluation and management services along with visits for some mental health related care depending on reimbursement and technology and security requirements we foresee telemedicine allowing our tenants to improve their efficiency in providing lower acuity services it could spur greater access of rural communities to urban care centers and support providers in general as they meet rising demand for high acuity care from an aging population cms remains active on the regulatory front in pursuing several medicare cost saving initiatives these include hospital pricing transparency site neutral payments for off campus hospital based outpatient care and the addition of newly covered services in outpatient settings these initiatives incentivized care in lower cost settings typically in medical office buildings and ambulatory surgery centers as we approach the presidential election we can expect heated public debate over another round of federal stimulus and covid nineteen relief for healthcare providers we believe the sector is positioned well even have some additional legislation to continue to meet the demands of responding to covid and deliver the underlying growth in healthcare services our population will need in the quarters to come the results of the election for both the presidency and congress could impact the nation is mix of health insurance coverage and expansion of medicare and medicaid regardless of election results we expect the shift of healthcare delivery will continue toward lower cost outpatient settings now i will turn it over to rob hall for an overview of investment activity rob thank you bethany healthcare realty is investment activity during the quarter can be characterized as two distinct periods defense at the outset and back to offense by the end of the quarter we started on defense by shoring up liquidity with an agreement to sell two single tenant net lease properties to saint louis based mercy for $244000000 or $633 per square foot what is also important is that this transaction represents a meaningful shift out of slower growing properties and smaller markets and into attractive growing msas with significant opportunities for future investment additionally we took a deeper dive in due diligence for acquisitions rather than terminating contracts and risk losing solid deals because of covid nineteen for example we doubled the length of inspection periods to monitor the health and stability of these properties we also conducted extensive tenant interviews over multiple billing cycles and we analyze rent collection and deferral requests at buildings under contract compared it to our own portfolio and it stacked up really well these critical steps allowed us to shift to offense as we approach the 3rd quarter in july we closed on four mobs for $83000001 property marks our 1st acquisition in the san diego market a market where we have identified substantial opportunity for future investment another in los angeles will benefit from the hospital is recent affiliation with aa rated cedar sinai health system which will provide an infusion of capital to increase hospital services in this dense market the last two located in atlanta and seattle represents additional investment in attractive growth markets on campuses where we own multiple properties all through the quarter our team continued to use their deep industry relationships to source deals and build a pipeline even as the volume of marketed transactions declined we now have ten buildings under six separate contracts or letters of intent for an additional $163000000 these targeted acquisitions are located in six markets where we already have whe where we already are invested we expect to close these deals by year end and along with properties closed in july we will fully reinvest the $244000000 of mercy proceeds our renewed confidence to proceed with closings and a growing pipeline are driving the increase in our acquisition guidance up to 300 to 375000000 for the year we expect our average cap rate to remain between five and fiveeight the outlook for acquisitions remains positive as healthcare providers continue to experience meaningful improvement in patient visits and procedures and mo mob rent rolls are holding up allowing sellers to return to the model although a few buyers are temporarily on the sidelines cap rates are steady as investor demand is wide and deep for the stable cash flows from mobs while several sizeable portfolios are available we have not found them compelling enough to deviate from our targeted process of investing in one or two buildings at a time on the development front we are making steady progress on a $30000000 redevelopment project in memphis during the course of the pandemic several tenants expanded their space requirements including the surgery center and a large orthopedic tenant as a result the lease percentage has moved up to 94 during the 1st quarter of 2021 we expect exterior improvements to be completed and the buildings to anchor tenant to take occupied the remainder of the suites will take occupancy throughout the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 202 the pandemic has delayed some development discussions but hospitals are not abandoning long term expansion plans for example in july a leading health system in tacoma announced a $300000000 investment in a new bed tower and next week here in nashville saint thomas will break ground on its $300000000 expansion we are planning redevelopments at both of these campuses and we expect to start these projects soon i am pleased with our teams ability to build a solid investment pipeline during these times their hard work will lead to timely to the timely reinvestment of proceeds generated from recent sales and positions as well for creative growth in 202 now i will turn it over to chris to discuss financial and operational performance for the quarter thanks rob 2nd quarter performance was strong as covid related revenue impacts were offset by operating expense controls and g a reductions normalized ffo per share of ¢42 was an increase of five over the same period a year ago before diving into the specific operating metrics for the quarter i will touch on rent collection and deferrals we saw significant sequential improvements in may june and july this was the result of a swift rebound and patient volumes following the end of government mandated shutdowns early in the quarter we collected over 99 of 2nd quarter rent including two of deferrals these deferrals are to be payback in the 2nd half of the year for july deferrals were less than $100000 of our of our over 40000000 in monthly rent in addition over half of deferrals granted in the 2nd quarter were repaid early signaling how our tenants are getting back to business scheduled rent deferral payments for july are tracking well at 88 while this is promising it is early in the process so we took a $730000 bad debt reserve representing 25 of outstanding deferrals at quarter end we will continue to monitor and analyze collections through the balance of the year and adjust reserves accordingly now shifting to operating performance trailing twelve month same store noi grew onenine which was impacted by lockdowns in the quarter in three main ways 1st there was an $800000 sequential reduction in transient parking income parking volumes returned to approximately eighty of pre pandemic levels by the end of june 2nd $673000 of the total rent deferral reserve was in the same store portfolio and 3rd and most notable was a benefit of $1000000 for a reduction and net operating expenses due to lower building traffic in the quarter the primary reductions were in maintenance and utilities which each decline over a half a $1000000 compared to the previous year as utilization and foot traffic has rebounded in june and july we expect operating expenses to return to more customary 3rd quarter levels including typical seasonal utilities but for these three impacts trailing twelve month same store growth would have been approximately twenty basis points higher noi growth in future periods should be reliably strong given the multi tenant leasing metrics this quarter including retention of 84six average in place contractual increases of two89 and cash leasing spreads of fourfive in the quarter we had 179000 square feet of new leases take occupancy led by gains at several repositioned and development properties this level of new leasing exceeded our historical average of approximately 100000 square feet per quarter looking forward given a slowdown in leasing tours early in the 2nd quarter due to local restrictions we could see leasing drop below our historical average in the 2nd half of the year our same store guidance ref reflects the potential for this impact moving into 2021 we expect leasing to increase as tourists have already rebounded to pre covid nineteen levels and demand for outpatient space continues to strengthen now shifting to liquidity and leverage our bad dividend payout ratio was 84 for the quarter and 93 for the trailing twelve months we expect full year 2020 to be in the low 90s and net debt to ebitda improved to five one times including the issuance of $33000000 of equity through the atm in addition we entered into forward equity contracts for an additional $74000000 these proceeds can be drawn at our election over the next twelve months we do not expect to draw any of the forward equity proceeds until 21 given the substantial liquidity available to fund our growing investment pipeline our liquidity includes $44000000 of cash at quarter end and $244000000 from the mercy dispositions which closed last week our investment in the mercy properties resulted in an unlevered irr of elevenfive while the reinvestment in multi tenant mobs and major msas will improve the diversification and growth profile of our portfolio for example contractual escalators for the mercy assets have been running oneseven which is more than a 100 basis points below our existing portfolio and our acquisition pipeline the cap rate rotation upon reinvestment will result in a little more than ¢three of annual dilution the timing of the reinvestment through the 3rd and 4th quarters will bring forward all of the three +cents into 202 however even with this dilution and the covid nineteen impacts discussed earlier we anticipate positive ffo per share growth in 2020 and we are positioned well for continued ffo per share growth in 21 and beyond todd thank you chris operator chuck we will be ready to open it up to the question and answer period thank you we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star then one on your touch tone phone if you are using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star then two at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster and our 1st question will come from nick joseph with citi please go ahead thank you appreciate the color on the acquisition pipeline wha what is the typical hit rate on assets that are in negotiation yeah i think if you look at the the pipeline 163000000 that we are looking at right now it is you know they are they are in within our range that we have given the five to 58 probably down in the you know low to mid 5s is is where on average those are going to be are you nick i guess i guess i am more curious on the 100 yeah the 120 negotiation i mean would you expect to close on 100 of those or wh wha what is typically the fallout for the for that bucket of potential acquisitions yeah i mean i think if you think about the 120 we have we have said that there are some in there that we think might close by the end of the year and then and and then moving into early next and i would say the cap rates in in those buildings are in the similar range to what we have under contract to pipeline and certainly it is early and and we are in discussions with those sellers there are some that sometimes may fall out or take longer to close on but we have a good line of sight on those and are are optimistic about the opportunities there i i would add to that maybe nick it is a little hard to obviously give you an a one percentage probability but it it is a range but i think you know it is not 5050 if that helps you it is probably you know not 100 as rob just said but you know maybe it is it is seventy eighty at least and and the nice thing is i mean those are ones that are pretty far along in discussions there is clearly a lot of other things not in that number that are a little further out there maybe not as highly probable so you know i think it is that number is is a strong number just in general if you think about productivity going into two thanks that is helpful and you mentioned the portfolios on the market today you know what would make you more interested is it pricing is it something specific about the mix of assets within those that would be more interested in executing on those yeah i would say that rather than pricing just the markets and the systems that they are associated with the strength of those markets the opportunities for growth is really a a key piece that we look at and i would also say that the you know the on adjacent makeup versus versus the off makeup typically what you see is is you know there is a number of properties a few properties in there that you really liked but then there is other properties in there that you really do not like and i think that is where these portfolios that are out there they kind of fall into now and and nick i think as we have looked we have looked at portfolios over the years we also recognize you know you can not always find the perfect portfolio by definition and so it really comes down to is there a high enough proportion of what rob described as attractive assets that would be worth you know taking on a few of those things that that we do not like as much and so you know we have we have always struggled with that we we obviously think our portfolio reflects a lot of the quality metrics we are looking for and we want to improve the average but you know if seventy eighty of the assets really fit then i think it makes some sense and you know the transaction the atlanta transaction three years ago you know was a great example of that you know we we certainly looked at the duke transaction hard and competed for that so you know i would throw that in there but some others like cnl and and others we we could not get there thank you our next question will come from sarah tan with jp morgan please go ahead hi i am on from my morning just have one question could you talk about the acquisition landscape and cap rates are looking like i am i am sorry i did not hear the the end of your question can you repeat that i am sorry i just wanted to ask i i could you discuss the acquisition landscape and what cap rates does it look like sure i would say that pricing for acquisitions has remained steady the the cashflows and and mobs has held up remarkably well during this period and i think that is a testament to the security and reva reliability of the asset class and so you are seeing again continued demand for the product there ha ha has been a few buyers that are that are temporarily on the sidelines but we see plenty of capital continuing to to participate in the space and so because of that we just have not seen any any meaningful movement in cap rates the the other thing rob i might add to that would be you you have even seen you know really since covid a couple of transactions by welltower that are very supportive of that that you have seen cap rates sort of right in the mid 5s for those portfolios so i think that sort of underscores that you know that five one two range for typical you know mobs and portfolios is very consistent over the last really couple of years and then you know occasionally you see you know deviations from that more when you get down to specific assets that may drive it to towards five or less or the other way for lower quality assets thank you our next question will come from vikram malhotra with morgan stanley please go ahead thanks for taking the question this 1st one you know you had a nice improvement on the 1st day out and you highlighted where you think it is going to kind of end up towards your end i am just wondering how sustainable that level is is there any capex kind of bump we should expect next year or do you think this level is sort of sustainable going forward vikram obviously you chris i will touch on it maybe you jumped in but remember we are all social distancing so we are we are not as easily able to not talk over each other which i apologize chris but i i would say on the dividend you are exactly right vikram chris mentioned low 90s for this year and certainly we are trying to steadily improve that so we do hope to maintain that level if not improve it each year but you know as chris also talked about we have got a lot of leasing strengthening as we go into the later part of this year and into next year so we do expect that what probably benefited us frankly in the 2nd quarter and maybe even in the 3rd would be a little less spending on ti because of the slowdown in leasing we see that probably picking right back up later in the year and into next year so you know it is it is a little early to tell exactly where we will be for 21 but we like the direction generally where we are headed and we will we will certainly have a better sense of that as we start putting our plans together for 21 later this year okay great and then todd is sorry go ahead i think todd is right i was only thing i would add to that is just the the idea that where we are terms of our capital other than ti i i do not see any any major shifts there but if we do not see the continued improvement that we have been seeing the last several years it would be tied to that be tied to absorption and new leasing which is which is great for longterm in terms of of earnings and such but but could you know slow the momentum temporarily in terms of of continued driving that payout ratio lower but long term we are we are certainly moving in the in the right direction okay great and then just you know on the a bit more color on the pipeline i know in the past you have alluded to you know potentially looking a bit more at off campus i am just wondering through covid are there you know how was that thought process changed maybe give us a sense of the pipeline mix between on and off and and also just through covid are there any other markets you are thinking about in terms of new investments or or development rob you want to touch on maybe the current pipeline and and what that might look like on versus off and then i can add to it yeah i think that when you look at the at the current pipeline the majority of it is is in on on an adjacent but there are a few assets in there that that kind of fall into the on campus category by our definition and i think those are kind of similar to what you have heard us say in the past vikram about strong markets that are markets where we already have investment and you know i think that is where if we are going to go off campus that is where you think we will we will do that kind of investing markets that we know and familiar with and investing in off campus assets that are sort of part of the provider provider network and and lend itself to that relationship i i would add rob that that in terms of just thinking differently you know post covid or or now we are still in covid but as we look ahead i do not see that we would make a tremendous change in the markets that we are going after i think with the ones we have been working on building our presence in still look very attractive to us you know even with what is going on now obviously like everyone we are going to be watching all the trends we are not heavily exposed to certain markets in the northeast new york boston you know great cities obviously but there are some some bigger trends you know challenges that that may come you know over time with with all this demand and so forth less about healthcare there but i would say we really like some of the tech you know job concentration that we see in a lot of the markets we have been focused on i mean two of the markets that we have added you kind of asked that question about adding markets we just added san diego as rob pointed out in the last year we have been adding a bit in raleigh the raleigh durham area which we liked as well but but merely ninety of what we have been doing eighty ninety of of the activity in the last few years has been very focused on our top fifteen markets so it is a lot of activity in the same markets we have been building scale in and then occasionally reaching out like i mentioned to san diego raleigh some others like that there is probably rob four or five you know other markets we would certainly look at and see some depth in but you know it is it is our our definitely leaning towards the markets we are currently invested in great thank you thank you vikram our next question will come from jordan sadler with key keybanc capital markets please go ahead thank you 1st i just want to follow up on the the pipeline i am not sure if i am overly reading into your commentary but it sounded like you mentioned the large and growing pipeline is there potentially more behind this or are there a handful of larger deals that you are looking at cause i am noticing you know you have taken the leverage on a pro forma basis quite low and i know it is a challenging environment so it does make sense but i am guessing pro forma leverage with forward equity and gail and mercy like those are the four times those directly come along so kind of curious what what you are you know teed up for yeah i would say on the on the pipeline jordan you know our team is is is always building and and adding to our pipeline and we we take the approach of you know i think if you look at what we have closed on this year about eighty of that is what we would consider you know all for lightly marketed deals so our team is out there constantly developing those relationships we have identified buildings that we want to own and you know we have dialog with the sellers or or or brokers in those markets that that we we trust and and you know are constantly trying to to get those sellers to the table so we we think that behind what we have laid out here certainly there is there is more opportunity that we are working on and i think that is where we see the growth in the pipeline coming and setting us up well for for 202 so i think that is why we we have the confidence that we do because we see the dialog that our team is having with these these sellers that are that are sort of behind what we have laid out here and jordan i i would add to that i do think i mean i think maybe what is in your question too is sort of you know are we preparing for something bigger i think it is more about i mean in some ways yes but it is not a complete change of stripes for us i think it is very much sticking to what rob just described really going after and targeting what we want rather than you know waiting on the marketed deals that said of course we we look at the marketed deals and if they measure up we certainly go after them and it is not you know we we certainly are encouraged that you know we would like to you know go after some some deals if we can in this situation where we we seem you know to be able to as you said have the capital the resources but you know again we are going to probably stick to you as you you would know us to do stick to the quality side of things but we are encouraged by you know the productivity and the effectiveness that rob described of sustaining a higher level of acquisition i think that is the key and really dri you know recognizing the importance of of prudent growth or external growth in addition to our internal growth to kind of work that algorithm of ffo growth per share is a mix and i know i think it was you just you just spoke to a question of a similar thing but is a mixed kind of skew continue to skew toward the adjacent type assets you think i certainly think we will we will skew towards on an adjacent versus off but you know again we are we are okay with off i think rob touched on that we are okay with that i would say you know today we sit closer to almost ninety on an adjacent we have done a fair bit of adjacent as you kind of point out and and sometimes you know what you find is those are the ones that you know you can go in and target and get you know really get those assets more regularly and you know the on campus it is tough because you are waiting for those hospitals to let that go typically so we really liked the dynamic that of on an on an adjacent and and i could see you know the off fluctuating i think we we maybe last year hit around 25 you know off so we are okay with that it is still going to skew that way towards on an on an adjacent though okay and then lastly like maybe for chris on the cap rates i i have got the cash cap rates i am kind of curious you mentioned the escalators on mercy can you give me the gap cap rate on that at disposition and then i am just curious what the escalators and gap cap look on the acquisition as well yeah on on mercy the the gap and cash were pretty close to the same because we are about at the midpoint of the of the lease term so they are they are kind of right on top of each other in terms of the the new acquisitions that we are that we are looking at the escalators as i mentioned are pretty similar to what our existing portfolio is you know that 28 to 29 range in terms of escalators and you know it it varies on the impact of the gap based off of the term that is inside of our acquisitions but but in general we typically say the gap adds about 25 to fifty basis points to the to the cap rate on a gap basis in our acquisitions okay thanks for clarifying our next question will come from lucas heart heartrich with green street advisors please go ahead thanks everyone for your time this morning this is john on for lucas just a quick one from me just looking at the improvements in your expectations for the cash releasing spreads on the multi tenant side you know what is behind that optimism i will say the usa trends are pretty favorable and just wondering if there is actually some opportunity for some outside there as well thank you very much yeah if you really look at the change in our guidance on on the cash leasing spreads we did change it this quarter compared to last but that really was just kind of bringing it back more in line with what we had seen pre covid last quarter we we were taking we did not want to be overly aggressive you know not having a lot of of leasing data in the midst of of what was going on and so we had taken had taken down our expectations but as as we worked releases during the quarter and continued our discussions you know things have have really shown great you know resilience and so our expectations is that our cash leasing spreads we will be able to kind of maintain what we had been seeing previously which longterm we say we we expect three to four and and so we are we are so far we are seeing that those types of metrics are are holding up well and our next question will come from rich anderson with smbc please go ahead thanks everybody good morning so one thing we are not talking about is the risk going forward of reinfection and you know certainly in many of the states that you traffic and we are we are seeing some uptick but no no talk of sort of a a reversal of you know elective surgery shutdowns and whatnot can you can you discuss that a little bit about how how you are seeing that play out i mean even though the availability or or states are allowing for elective surgeries are people really jumping in and and doing it and is there a risk that you know a month or so from now we could be having another conversation about shutting it down rich i it is a very good question and i think we all sort of have that unease you know going into the fall i think collectively that you know things can change and you know we have the flu season coming and and things get worse typically in the winter so it is a very good question i do think you know we do not want to be glib about the optimism because you know it is it is a long road here and you know maybe the toughest time ahead of us the good news is i think is i think bethany pointed out and i pointed out and we have all seen there is just been a lot of improvement on treatments and how to deal with this and so i think we we all feared obviously in the front end that hospitals would just be totally overwhelmed and obviously that was tested in a couple of places including new york and and i think the good news is we came out on the better end of what we all feared and so you know you are seeing it as you said in hotspots you know houston went through it and you are seeing different places and and the good news is they they seem to be handling it and it is not creating these long lengthy shutdowns you know you did see in texas the governor trying to push you know some some again you know policies there but it really actually was a bit of a carve out for ascs you know in some of the outpatient surgeries it was more about protecting that inpatient capacity so i do think you are going to see a little bit of that we do have to brace for that in terms of hotspots i do not think it is you know nationwide shut it all down the way it was early on it is going to be much more targeted and you know i am i am no expert any more than anybody on the phone but as we watch this move around the country you know it is kind of it is the hotspot it is these you know fires that kind of come up and then burn out and i hope that continues to you know you know be quelled you know and and contained but i i think it is very encouraging what we are seeing and even though we might you know experience some some issues i think we are encouraged i mean the public companies that report their surgery numbers have been really incredible so i do not think there is a big hesitation to come back and do it it will just be a matter of you know the public health officials continue to sort of treat this in a targeted way rather than a blanket way and and we think that will be the case okay my 2nd question and last question is what what is your perspective of how the hospital industry looks like after this is all done i mean would you say the hospital in business not the medical office business per se but the hospital business is weakened by all this in the sense that you know we kind of went in over hospitals to begin with and and and maybe this fast tracks some consolidation or closings that probably or maybe would have just happened eventually i am just wondering if if you think sort of picking your your your your relationships becomes even more important in the aftermath because hos the hospital industry overall is is probably a notch weaker because of everything that happened yeah i think it is it is fair a fair assessment and good commentary we we were having a discussion with our board earlier this week about that with several health system leaders there on our board and and and i think it is what you said you are going to it is it is a classic you know problem that these crises just like the financial crisis caused the strong are going to get stronger the weak are going to get weaker and there is different dynamics to that but in the hospital well that is very true and you know you are seeing an hca do extremely well you know coming through this and i think they they do a good job of figuring it out and and there is a lot of not for profit systems that are leaders in their markets i do think the strength and and scale matters larger systems versus small independent system obviously you know more more urban versus in suburban versus rural is going to be a huge trend i know that that the trend of moving into the cities everybody is questioning a little bit but i still think those strong you know population growth centers are going to be where you are going to see the success and so i do think you are correct that picking the right partners will matter more being a sharp shooter will will continue to be critical for success and i think that is something we have been honing ever since we sort of found that trend to be true from the financial crisis even before so it it is true i i do think you are right hospital is probably taken you know they have clearly taken a hit and were helped a lot by the cares act and cms in general but i do think we are encouraged that the strong ones i mean this is a demand need based business you know this is not just you know selling luxury items it is it is very much need based and so there is a huge need for it inpa because i made my comments or remark that i mean hospitals are proving that they are so critical and i think the acuity level of hospitals is only going to continue to climb and you are going to see acuity level with outpatient climb both on and off campus it is a continuum and i think you know all those innovations will continue and it will be more a little bit more of a winner versus loser at game and and i think we are we are pretty well positioned to to follow that trend and and related to that response thanks todd that was great do you think the long awaited monetization of hospital and medical office will will be you know more of a realistic outcome of this even for stronger hospitals that maybe are now taking on you know more market share need more technological advances and so on is is that something that we can finally say well not not not to get religious but it is like testing our faith right in this theory and it is just we got to keep the hope alive right we just have not seen it is the real answer it has all the makings to suggest that would be possibly true we have a very contradicting data point here with the mercy transaction that we just did a little bit of a specific situation where they had a propensity you know to to want to own their assets so a little different but we have heard of a few other anecdotes just recently of some other hospitals doing similar things so you know hospital systems think strategically very differently they do not focus i mean as they should they focus on providing care and and and all the things they need to do to expand their business and succeed they are not sitting around thinking about cap rates for mobs but i think there is going to be there are going to be some more of those it may be a little bit more from your stressed systems and so then weeding through that back to your earlier question figuring out is it worth it is it the right systems to be with is the question for that right right great thanks very much thanks thanks rich the next question will come from john chen with bmo capital please go ahead thanks good morning todd in your opening remarks you know you mentioned noi trending back at three which is certainly against recent trends of not only hr but other mob leads i am just wondering if you could just discuss your confidence level in that statement and if that is being driven by occupancy picking up or leasing spreads on on leases that you are negotiating now i i think the simple answer is and chris always hits this it is that our average contractual rent bump across you know multi tenant and single tenant is two83 it is two89 for the multi tenant so that is that is the driver of of our same store growth and and what chris always walks through is okay we we grew the revenue at that level and then at your right you you advanced that ball a little bit with cash leasing spreads but that is a pretty small piece of the pie each you know quarter or year so you you do help that you do have a little bit of you know turnover as well that kind of hurts that but the revenue model is more of a you know high 2s kind of number and then really it becomes you know what are your expenses doing and how much operating leverage do you have your margin and so that is the algorithm we see that gets us there pretty conservatively with it but it is really the big driver is is our revenue model of our escalators and and we continue to feel good about that the cash leasing spreads help with the margin absolutely and and as chris talked you know we are looking to try to drive absorption as we go into 21 and that will help also but even without a lot of of increased absorption you can see same store noi growth running you know around three and how does free rent impact this number cause i imagine you are offering more free rent or you been more recently chris do you want to touch on that yeah i mean obviously free rent will go into it if if if you have a larger percent a percentage of it versus what you had before but i will say generally no we are not adding a lot of free rent you know we really do not have much if any inside of our renewals if we are if we are doing it at all it it typically is inside of of new leasing and so when you have that with the new leasing it just kind of creates a little bit of a delay before you see the the the revenue impact from that absorption but but overall no we have we have not seen a marked expansion of of free rent okay and then maybe i will ask nick joseph is question a little differently i think you mentioned $150000000 of acquisitions you had under contract and now you have closed $83000000 post quarter are you still on track to close that remaining 70000000 or so or have any of those deals fallen apart yes we are still on track to to close those i think we have got i think i mentioned we have 163000000 that is either under contract or or loi so we have we have actually in increased that under contract amounts since since the last time and and i think rob too you said and we we expect that we will close those two categories under contract noi by year end which is what will yes help us get those mercy proceeds reinvested by year end right and the four adjacent acquisitions you you mentioned are just a rated health systems are those health systems at all tenants in the buildings required they have i would say that there are have certainly have physicians that are you know utilizing the hospital next door i think there is one where the hospital is is not a tenant but but all the others are are tenant by the hospital thank you thanks john our next question will come from todd stender with wells fargo please go ahead thanks probably in order just to stick with that last theme about the the assets under a contract and maybe this is for rob can you speak to the condition of those buildings i know historically you guys are prepared to put some redevelopment dollars into them but in the context that maybe todd what you were speaking to maybe tis come down maybe just getting some broader thoughts about how you guys are allocating capital thanks yeah i would say that the assets that were on a contract to to purchase an roi i mean they are all in in good condition i mean we are not planning to invest a significant amount of capital into any of them as an as a redevelopment play if that is if that is answering your question it is thank you and and maybe for todd did i hear that right maybe expectations of lower tis coming down the road i think that is a 2020 phenomenon we are not necessarily suggesting that looking into two we actually think it should rebound to sort of historical levels in relationships and and all that is is is what we have heard some others say too we had slower tours and and new leasing activity with new perspective met new tenants that create absorption which is where you have higher ti spend in in the 2nd quarter you know especially april and even a little in may and therefore you get this lag effect of when those tenants would normally take occupancy and that is probably a 3rd and 4th quarter phenomenon so it is really a back half issue and even a little bit you saw it in the 2nd quarter so you know that is all we are saying and then back to sort of normalize levels in two okay i would clarify that too of you know tha that is a little bit on the perspective leasing front what todd is talking about of of and we do not know for sure yeah what we have kind of run in different scenarios and so we are looking at one scenario that that yes we could see a little bit less absorption here in the next couple of quarters and then rebounding which could have an impact but then also if you look at it in terms of total spending you start looking at fad right now we are running at the low end and frankly a little below the low end of our guidance range as it relates to 2nd general ti and so there is just timing that is always related to that so that may you know pick up certainly we think we will be in the range back to you know potentially near the midpoint of the range and so that is part of what what is playing into the guidance as as it relates to defad in my prepared remarks i have talked about you know right now we are are running significantly below where we are on a on a trailing twelve month basis but you know we do think that that can pick up in the later half of the year and and what drives our our view that our fad payout ratio will will probably end up the year down in the in the low ninety is not in the low eighty is that you saw this quarter so i just wanted to to clarify that point that is helpful because that is where i was going u ultimately with this is seeing that fad payout ratio declined and and in the in the spirit of seeing maybe some dividend growth at some point but maybe it does not shake out that low okay that is helpful all right that is it for me thank you thanks todd the next question will come from tayo okuseya with mizuho please go ahead zero yes good morning everyone congrats on the transaction it makes perfect sense to me my focus is really on the outlook for the mobs i i think you mentioned in your comments earlier on that you know hospitals in general and associate level they seem to be doing well when we kind of you know think about hca results and some of the other hospital operators but a lot of that is also kind of due to the massive amount of grants they have kind of received over this period as well could you just kind of talk about how you are thinking about kind of in a world where there are no grants or in a world where you know where that source of government funding is is decreased maybe in the next you know act that that congress enacts you know what do you kind of see happens in that world i mean specifically could we start to see deferrals going up again or or you know would love for you to to just kind of expand on that well it is you know it is it is all speculation obviously tayo but it is it is interesting you know i think we saw the most extreme thing hopefully that we will ever see in our lifetimes right but maybe not amen to that right right so you know april was just absolutely extreme and and clearly the government steps in and we just hope you know we do not see that again but i think we have as i mentioned we have learned a lot and i think we learned that hospitals you know good or bad you know hospitals and physicians they really make a lot of money on the elective procedure side in surgeries and when that was shut down i mean you are cutting off the most profitable segment of the business and you know healthcare it it is it is a little cold to say that because obviously they are only doing they are they are only supposed to be doing what is necessary but it is necessary there is a ton of that need and so when you cut off that lifeblood if you will it really hurts the system so i think now if you go back to the discussions earlier where it is more of a targeted approach and maybe you know for a short period in houston they they asked you know for some elective procedures to be to be you know reduced and and not even in all afcs but in hospitals so i think you are going to see a more targeted approach rather than the sort of absolute you know month long or more shutdowns so it should therefore it should not be quite as financially difficult you know is it going to be tough yeah just like school schools for a lot of us you know with kids and it is going to be tough you know as soon as they shut down the school for a week two or something or or even if you are lucky if they are open so there is going to be ebbs and flows as i mentioned in my remarks but i think we are much better shape today than we were when we knew very little in march so i do not think it is as dire as you know we could all fear but it is you know it is never david emory used to always say it is never as good or as bad as it may seem and that is probably very appropriate here it it it will be not easy but it it i do not think it is going to be as bad as it was and and i it is not changing our outlook about hospitals and on campus mobs we will watch that just like everybody but i think in my own experience you know personally if you have ever dealt with a family member or or a friend or loved one whatever it might be who is had a serious illness you do not think twice about going to the hospital or going to that you know high acuity specialists that might be near the hospital when it gets real this that is what this is about you know the light touch stuff and it is really cool that there is innovations that can do things you know in in lower costs you know off campus settings and that is fine that is a very real thing and and not to say that trend is not real but you know we we think the dynamics of real estate and demand supply and demand are best where it is that high acuity sort of of nucleus if you will around the hospital and and as rich asked you know we got to watch that nucleus make sure it is healthy the hospitals that we are working with so that that is our focus that is helpful thank you thanks tayo",

press release for the 2nd quarter ended june thirty 2020 the company is earnings press release supplemental information forms ten q and ten k are available on the company is website thank you carla 1st i would like to offer our best wishes to everyone as we approach five months since the start of the pandemic we are encouraged i want to take a moment to express my deep appreciation for the positive signs of recovery in the healthcare space and grateful for those who have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic including our tenants and partners they have demonstrated extraordinary resilience well beyond what we anticipated we expect we will continue to contend with covid nineteen as it ebbs and flows what is encouraging is the progress of better treatments and promising vaccine developments moderna bizer astrazeneca and many others thank you positive results from fast track clinical trials many expect a successful vaccine in 2020 with widespread availability next year public health officials are also taking a much more targeted approach to addressing hotspots which is allowing healthcare services to remain open across the country we are seeing physicians ramp up their volumes quickly now approaching pre covid levels they are experiencing heightened demand for providers are balancing the delivery of much needed care with safety precautions and they have gained valuable experience in treating their covid patients as a result we are not seeing the use of lengthy or widespread bans on elected procedures several publicly traded national healthcare companies including hca surgery partners and tenet have recently reported steady improvements in volumes throughout may june and july likewise we have seen tenant utilization increase it does vary geographically somewhat from a low of 75 in washington dc to 100 here in nashville tenant work order requests are now running at pre covid levels and leasing momentum has also rebounded tours with prospective tenants which dip below fifty of typical volumes in april are now running well above average rent collection stands at 97 for the 2nd quarter as well as july new deferral requests have fallen to nearly zero in the last thirty days and over half of deferrals granted during the 2nd quarter were repaid early which is very encouraging forgivable ppp loans kicked in as designed for payroll rent and utilities the healthcare sector received more than twelve of all ppp loans of which the biggest recipients were physician offices with tours being well off pace in april and may occupancy could be marginally softer in the 2nd half of the year sharp recovery in june and july we expect occupancy to strengthen going into 2021 as a result same store eyegrowth will likely be closer to two in 2020 and bounce back toward three next year external growth is still on pace for a solid 2020 the pipeline is strong even after we took extra time to underwrite the financial health of tenants we have increased the top end of our acquisition guidance to be inline with our volume last year and well ahead our historical average we have plenty of funding capacity from the mercy dispositions cash on hand forward equity and full availability on our line of credit we are poised to take advantage of a sizable and growing pipeline the pandemic has underscored the critical nature of healthcare services even in uncertain times it is shown that hospitals are the hub of essential care including high acuity outpatient services despite the pandemic we still expect to produce positive ffo per share growth in 2020 rising secular demand a strong balance sheet and a robust pipeline position us well to grow safely in the years ahead now i will turn it over to ms mancini for some additional commentary on healthcare trends thank you the healthcare sector continues to prove its resilience and significance to the us population and economy after five months of experience with covid nineteen hospitals and physicians are now better equipped with protocols in place and adequate ppe to serve covid patients at the same time providers are managing higher demand from the delay of scheduled care 2nd quarter employment growth numbers are showing covid is unprecedented impact on jobs in april and may with promising signs of recovery in the healthcare sector from late may into june and continued positive momentum heading into the 3rd quarter notably the pace of recovery in the ambulatory sector including physician offices has doubled that of the broader economy healthcare providers are meeting pent up demand for elective care and the resurgence of strong utilization trends returning to more normalized levels levels quickly hrs tenants on average are operating near full capacity and they are better prepared to provide ongoing outpatient care even in the event of a local surge telemedicine served a critical role in april and may for many providers the easing of its restrictions and higher reimbursement helped sustain patient care and physician practice revenues during the height of the pandemic and the shutdown of non emergent care since then physician offices in most of our markets have returned to seeing a majority of patients in person the trump administration issued an executive order earlier this week to review and continue medicare is coverage of telehealth services after which cms proposed to permanently allow medicare providers to use telehealth for evaluation and management services along with visits for some mental health related care depending on reauthorizations and technology and security requirements we foresee telemedicine allowing our tenants to improve their efficiency in providing lower acuity services it could spur greater access of rural communities to urban care centers and support providers in general as they meet rising demand for high acuity care from an aging population cms remains active on the regulatory front in pursuing several medicare cost saving initiatives these include hospital pricing transparency site neutral payments for off campus hospital based outpatient care and the addition of newly covered services in outpatient settings these initiatives incentivize care in lower cost settings typically in medical office buildings and ambulatory surgery centers as we approach the presidential election we can expect heated public debate over another round of federal stimulus we believe the sector is positioned well even absent additional legislation to continue to meet the demands of responding to covid and deliver the underlying growth in healthcare services our population will need in the quarters to come the results of the election for both the presidency and congress could impact the nation is mix of health insurance coverage and expansion of medicare and medicaid regardless election results we expect the shift of healthcare delivery will continue toward lower cost outpatient settings now i will turn it over to rob hole for an overview of investment activity rob thank you bethany healthcare real estate investment activity during the quarter can be characterized as two distinct periods defense at the outset and back to offense by the end of the quarter we started on defense by shoring up liquidity with an agreement to sell two single tenant net lease properties to saint louis based merriweather for $244000000 or $633 per square foot what is also important is that this transaction represents a meaningful shift out of slower growing properties and smaller markets and into attractive growing msas with significant opportunities for future investment additionally we took a deeper dive in due diligence for acquisitions rather than terminating contracts and risking losing solid deals because of covid nineteen for example we doubled the length of inspection periods to monitor the health and stability of these properties we also conducted extensive tenant interviews over multiple billing cycles and analyzed rent collection and deferral requirements we closed on four multifamily properties for $83000000 one property marks our 1st acquisition in the san diego market a market where we have identified substantial opportunity for future investment another in los angeles will benefit from the hospital is recent affiliation with double a minus rated cedar sinai health system which will provide an infusion of capital to increase hospital services in this dense market the last two located in atlanta and seattle represent additional investment in attractive growth markets on campuses where we own multiple properties all through the quarter our team continued to use their deep industry relationships to source deals and build a pipeline even as the volume of marketed transactions declined we now have ten buildings under six separate contracts or letters of intent for an additional $163000000 these targeted acquisitions are located in six markets where we already have a presence we expect to close these deals by year end and along with properties closed in july will fully reinvest the $244000000 of mercy proceeds our renewed confidence to proceed with closings and a growing pipeline are driving the increase in our acquisition guidance up to 300 to $375000000 for the year we expect our average cap rate the outlook for acquisitions remains positive as healthcare providers continue to experience meaningful improvement in patient visits and procedures moo mob rent rolls are holding up allowing sellers to return to the market although a few buyers are temporarily on the sidelines cap rates are steady as investor demand is wide and deep while several sizable portfolios are available we have not found them compelling enough to deviate from our targeted process of investing in one or two buildings at a time on the development front we are making steady progress on a $30000000 redevelopment project in memphis during the course of the pandemic several tenants expanded their space requirements including a surgery center as a result the lease percentage has moved up to 94 during the 1st quarter of 2021 we expect exterior improvements to be completed and the building is anchor tenant to take occupancy the remainder of the suites will take occupancy throughout the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2021 the pandemic has delayed some development discussions but hospitals are expected to continue to be in demand we are not abandoning long term expansion plans for example in july a leading health system in tacoma announced a $300000000 investment in a new bed tower and next week here in nashville saint thomas will break ground on its $300000000 expansion we are planning renovations at both of these campuses and we expect to start these projects soon i am pleased with our team is ability to move forward with these plans i want to start off by saying that the solid investment pipeline during these times their hard work will lead to timely to the timely reinvestment of proceeds generated from recent sales and positioned us well for creative growth in 2021 now i will turn it over to chris to discuss financial and operational performance for the quarter thanks rob 2nd quarter performance was strong is covid related revenue impacts offset by operating expense controls and dna reductions normalized ffo per share of ¢42 was an increase of five over the same period a year ago before diving into the specific operating metrics for the quarter i will touch on rent collection and deferrals we saw significant sequential improvements in may june and july this was the result of a swift rebound in patient volumes following the end of the pandemic mister chairman members of the board i have some data to present to you this morning 1st i want to report that we collected over 99 of 2nd quarter rent including two of deferrals these deferrals are to be paid back in the 2nd half of the year for july deferrals were less than $100000 of our over 40000000 in monthly rent in addition over half of deferrals granted in the 2nd quarter were repaid early signaling how our tenants are getting back to business schedule rent deferral payments for july are tracking well at 88 while this is promising it is early in the process so we took a $730000 bad debt reserve representing 25 of outstanding deferrals at quarter end we will continue to monitor and analyze collections through the balance of the year and adjust reserves accordingly now shifting to operating performance same store sales in the u s grew onenine which was impacted by lockdowns in the quarter and three main ways 1st there was an $800000 sequential reduction in transient parking income parking volumes returned to approximately eighty of pre pandemic levels by the end of june 2nd $673000 of the total rent deferral reserve was in the same store portfolio and 3rd and most notable was a benefit of $1000000 from a reduction in net operating expenses due to lower building traffic in the quarter the primary reductions were in maintenance and utilities which each declined over a half a $1000000 compared to the previous year as utilization in foot traffic has rebounded in june and july we expect operating expenses to return to more customary 3rd quarter levels including typical seasonal utilities but for these three impacts trailing twelve month same store growth would have been approximately twenty basis points higher in our opinion growth in future periods should be reliably strong given the multi tenant leasing metrics this quarter including retention of 84six average in place contractual increases of two89 and cash leasing spreads of fourfive we had 179000 square feet of new leases take occupancy led by gains at several repositioning and development properties this level of new leasing exceeded our historical average of approximately 100000 square feet per quarter looking forward given a slowdown in leasing tours early in the 2nd quarter due to local restrictions we could see leasing drop below our historical average in the 2nd half of the year our same store guidance remains unchanged moving into 2021 we expect leasing to increase as tourists have already rebounded to pre covid nineteen levels and demand for outpatient space continues to strengthen now shifting to liquidity and leverage our fad dividend payout ratio was 84 for the quarter and 93 for the trailing twelve months we expect full year 2022 to be in net debt to equity improved to five one times including the issuance of $33000000 of equity through the atm in addition we entered into forward equity contracts for an additional $74000000 these proceeds can be drawn at our election over the next twelve months we do not expect to draw any of the forward equity proceeds until 21 given the substantial liquidity available to fund our growth our liquidity includes $44000000 of cash at quarter end and $244000000 from the mersey dispositions which closed last week our investment in the mersey properties resulted in an unleveraged irr of elevenfive while the reinvestment in multi tenant mobs and major msas will improve the diversification and growth profile of our portfolio for example contractual escalators for the mersey assets have been running oneseven which is more than a 100 basis points below our existing portfolio and our acquisition pipeline the cap rate rotation upon reinvestment will result in a little more than ¢three of annual dilution the timing of the reinvestment through the 3rd and 4th quarters will bring forward all of the three +cents into 2020 however even with this dilution our portfolio is expected to grow we anticipate positive ffo per share growth in 2020 and we are positioned well for continued ffo per share growth in 2021 and beyond to ask a question you may press star then one on your touch tone phone if you are using a speakerphone please pick up your headset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star then two at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster yeah i think if you look at the the pipeline 163000000 that we are we are looking at right now it is you know they are they are in within our range that we have given the five to 58 probably down in the you know you know low to mid 5s if we are on average those are going to be are you i guess i get more curious on the 100 yeah the 120 in negotiation i mean would you expect to close on that what is typically the fallout for for that bucket of potential acquisitions yeah i mean i think if you think about the 120 we have we have said that there are some in there that we think might close by the end of the year and then and then and then moving into early next year and i would say the cap rates in in those buildings are in the similar range to what we have under contract and pipeline and certainly it is early and and we are in discussions with those sellers there are some that sometimes sometimes fall out or take longer to close on but we have a good line of sight on those and are optimistic about the opportunities there i would add to that maybe nick it is a little hard to obviously give you and  one percentage probability but it is a range but i think you know it is not 5050 if that helps you it is probably you know not a 100 as rob just said but you know maybe it is it is 7080 at least and and the nice thing is i mean those are ones that are pretty far along in discussions there is clearly a lot of other things that are not in that number that are a little further out there maybe not as highly probable so yeah i think it is that number is is a strong number just in general if you think about productivity going into 21 thanks that is helpful and then you you mentioned the portfolios on the market today you know what would make you more interested is it pricing is it something specific about the mix of assets within those that would get you more interested yeah i would say that rather than pricing just the markets and the systems that they are associated with the strength of those markets the opportunities for growth is really a key piece that we look at and i would also say that the you know the on adjacent makeup versus versus the off makeup typically what you see is is you know there is  a number properties a few properties in there but then there is other properties in there that you really do not like and i think that is where these portfolios that are out there they kind of fall into now so yeah we have we have always struggled with that we we obviously think our portfolio reflects a lot of the quality metrics we are looking for and we want to improve the average but you know if 7080 of the assets really fit then i think it makes some sense and you know the medallion only transaction the atlanta transaction three years ago you know was a great example of that yeah we we certainly looked at the duke transaction hard and competed for that so you know i would throw that in there but some others like csnl and and others we our next question will come from sarah tan with jp morgan please go ahead hi  i am on from mitec and i just have one question could you talk about the acquisition that i am hearing about that steven walkup is looking at to ask could you discuss the acquisition landscape and what can not rate has looked like sure i would say that pricing for acquisitions has remained steady the the cash flows and in mohs has held up remarkably well during this period and i think that is a testament to the security and reliability of the asset class and so you are seeing you know continued demand for the product there has has been a few buyers that are that are temporarily on the sidelines but we see plenty of capital continuing to to participate in the space and so because of that we just have not seen any any meaningful movement in cap rates the the other thing rob i might add to that would be you have you have even seen you know really since covid a couple of transactions by welltower that are very supportive of that that you have seen cap rates sort of right in the mid five for those portfolios so i think that sort of underscores that you know that fivefive range typical you know mob is and portfolios is very consistent over the last really couple of years and then you know occasionally you see you know deviations from that more when you get down to specific assets that may drive it to towards five or less or the other way for lower quality assets vikram mahaltra with morgan stanley please go ahead thanks for taking the question this 1st one you know you had a nice improvement on the fab payout and you highlighted where you think this could kind of end up towards your end and i am just wondering how sustainable that level is is there any gappex kind of bump we should expect next year or do you think this level is sort of sustainable going forward remember we are all social distancing so we are we are not as easily able to not talk over each other which i apologize chris but i would say on the dividend you are exactly right bicram chris mentioned low ninety s for this year and certainly we are trying to steadily improve that so we do hope to maintain that level if not improve it each year but you know as chris also talked about we have got a lot of leasing strengthening as we go into the later part of this year and into next year so we do expect that what probably benefited us frankly in the 2nd quarter and maybe even in the 3rd would be a little less spending on ti because of the slowdown and leasing we see that probably picking right back up later in the year and into next year so you know it is a little early to tell exactly where we will be for 21 but we like the direction generally where we are headed and we will certainly have a better sense of that as we start putting our plans together i was going to say that i think we are doing pretty well for 21 later this year ok great and then todd is sorry going to todd is right i was only going to add to that is just the idea that where we are in terms of our capital other than ti i do not see any any major shifts there but if we do not see the continued improvement that we have been seeing the last several of years it would be tied to that be tied to absorption in new leasing which is which is great for long term in terms of of earnings ok great and then just you know on the little bit more color on the pipeline i know in the past we alluded to you know potentially looking a bit more at off campus i am just wondering through covid are there you know how has that thought process changed maybe give a sense of the pipeline mix ok great and then just you know on the little bit more color on the pipeline i know in the past we alluded to you know potentially looking a bit more at off campus i am just wondering through covid are there you know how has that thought process changed maybe give a sense of the pipeline mix ok great and and also just through covid are there any other markets you are thinking about in terms of new investments or or development rob do you want to touch on maybe the current pipeline and and what that might look like on versus off and then i can add to it yeah i think that and when you look at the at the current pipeline the majority of it is is in on on an adjacent but there are a few assets in there that that kind of fall into the on campus category by definition and i think those are kind of similar what you have heard to say in the past about strong markets that are markets where we already have investment and you know that think that is where if we are going to go off campus that is where you think we will we will do that kind of investing markets that we know i am familiar with and and investing and off campus assets that are sort of part of the provider provider network and and lend itself to that relationship i would add rob that that in terms just thinking differently you know post covid or now we are still in covid but as we look ahead i do not see that we would make a tremendous change in the markets that we are going after i think the ones we have been working on building our presence and still look very attractive to us you know even with what is going on now obviously like everyone we are going to be watching all the trends we are not heavily exposed to certain markets in the northeast new york boston you know great cities obviously but there are some some bigger trends you know that may come you know over time with with office demand and so forth less about healthcare there but i would say we really like some of the tech you know job concentration that we see in a lot of the markets we have been focused on i mean two of the markets that we have added you kind of ask that question about adding markets we just added san diego as rob pointed out in the last year we have been adding a bit in raleigh the raleigh durham area which we like as well but but nearly ninety of what we have we have added has been in healthcare so doing 8090 of of the activity in the last few years has been very focused on our top fifteen markets so it is a lot of activity in the same markets we have been building scale in and then occasionally reaching out like i mentioned to san diego raleigh some others like that there is probably rob four or five you know other markets we certainly look at and see some depth in but you know it is it is are we are definitely leaned towards the markets we are currently invested in great thank you thank you vickers our next question will come from jordan sadler with kbank capital markets please go ahead thank you 1st of all i just want to follow up on the pipeline i am not sure if i am overly reading into your commentary but it sounded like you mentioned a large and growing pipeline is there potentially more behind this or is there you know is there is there is there is there more to come a handful of larger deals that you are looking at i am noticing you have taken the leverage on a pro forma basis quite low and i know it is a challenging environment so it does not make sense but i am guessing pro forma leverage with the forward equity and debt service probably at four times the price that i think i am wrong so i am kind of curious what what you are you are teed up for yeah i would say on the on the pipeline jordan you know our team is is is always building and and adding to our pipeline and and we we take the approach  of but you know i think if you look at what we have closed on this year about eighty of that is what we would consider you know all for lightly marketed deals so our team is out there constantly developing those relationships we have identified buildings that we want to own and you know we have dialog with the sellers or or  brokers in those markets that that we we trust and and yeah are constantly so we think that behind what we have laid out here certainly there is there is more opportunity that we are working on and i think that is where we see the growth in the pipeline coming and setting us up well for 2021 so i think that is why we we have the confidence that we do because we see the dialog that our team is having with these sellers that are that are sort of behind what we have laid out here and jordan i would add to that i do think that i mean i mean i think that is true maybe what is in your question too is sort of you know are we preparing for something bigger i think it is more about i mean in some ways yes but it is not a complete change of stripes for us i think it is very much sticking to what rob just described really going after and targeting what we want rather than you know waiting on the market deals that said of course we we look at the market deals and if they measure up we certainly go after them and and it is not you know we we certainly are encouraged that you know we would like to you know go after some some deals kind of work that algorithm of ffo growth per share is the mix and i know i think it was we just spoke to a question of a similar vein but is the mix going to skew continue to skew toward the adjacent type assets you think i certainly think we will we will skew towards on an adjacent versus off but you know again we are we are okay with off i think rob touched on that we are okay with that i would say you know today we sit closer to almost ninety on an adjacent we have done a fair bit of adjacent as you kind of point out and and sometimes you know what you find is those are the ones that you know you can go in and target and get you know really get those assets more regularly and you know the on campus it is tough because you are waiting for those hospitals to let that go typically so we really like the dynamic though of on and on an adjacent and and i could see you know the off fluctuating i think we we maybe last year hit our peak of off 25 you know off so we are okay with that it is still going to skew that way towards on and on an adjacent though okay and then lastly like maybe for chris on the cap rates i have got the cash cap rates to i am kind of curious you mentioned the escalators on mercy can you give me the gap cap rate on that disposition and then i am just curious with the escalators and you got cap rates up on the acquisition yeah on on mersey the the gap and cash were pretty close to the same because we were about the midpoint of the of the lease term so they are they are kind of right on top of each other in terms of the the new acquisitions that we are that we are looking at the escalators as i mentioned are are pretty similar to what our existing portfolio is called you know that 28 to 29 range in terms of escalators ok so to clarify you know it varies on the impact of the gap based off of the term that is inside of our acquisitions but in general we typically say that the gap adds about 25 to fifty basis points to the to the cap rate on a gap basis in our acquisitions okay our next question will come from lucas hart hartrich with green street advisors please go ahead outside there as well thank you very much yeah if you really look at the change in our guidance on on the cash leasing spreads we did change it this quarter compared to last but that really was just kind of bringing it back more in line with what we had seen pre covid last quarter we we were taking we did not want to be overly aggressive you know not having a  lot of of leasing data in the midst of of what was going on so we had taken had taken down our expectations but as as we worked through releases during the quarter and continued our discussions you know things have really shown great you know resilience and so our expectations is that our cash leasing spreads will be able to kind of maintain what we had been seeing previously which long term we say we we expect three to four and and and so far we are seeing that those types of metrics are are holding up well the risk going forward of reinfection and certainly in many of the states that you traffic in we have seen some uptick but no no talk of sort of a reversal of you know elective surgery shutdowns and whatnot can you can you discuss that a little bit about how how you are seeing that play out i mean even though the availability or our states are allowing for it for now rich it is a very good question and i think we all sort of have that unease you know going into the fall and collectively that you know things can change and you know we have the flu season coming and things get worse typically in the winter so it is a very good question i do think you know yeah we should probably have another conversation about shutting it down i do not want to be gloomy about the optimism because you know it is it is a long road here and you know maybe the toughest time ahead of us the good news is i think as i think bethany pointed out and i pointed out and we have all seen there is just been a lot of improvement on treatments and how to deal with this and so i think we we all feared obviously in the front end that hospitals would just be totally overwhelmed and obviously that was tested in a couple of places including new york and and i think the good news is we came out on the better end of what we we saw and so you know you are seeing it as you said in hotspots you know houston went through it and you are seeing different places and and the good news is they they seem to be handling it and it is not creating these long lengthy shutdowns you know you did see in texas the governor trying to push you know some some again you know policies there but it really actually was a bit of a carve out for acos you know and some of the outpatient surgeries it was more about protecting that inpatient capacity so i do think you are going to see a little bit of that we do have the brace for that in terms of hotspots i do not think it is you know nationwide shut it all down the way it was early on it is going to be much more targeted and you know i am no expert anymore than anybody on the phone but as we watch this move around the country you know it is kind of it is the hot spot it is these you know fires that kind of come up and then burn out and i hope that continues to you know can you know be quelled you know and and contained but i think it is very encouraging what we are seeing and even though we might you know experience some i think we are encouraged i mean the public companies that report their surgery numbers have been really incredible so i do not think there is a big hesitation to come back and do it it will just be a matter of you know do public health officials continue to sort of treat this in a targeted way rather than a blanket way and and we think that will be the case okay my 2nd question and last question is what is your perspective of how the hospital industry looks like after this is all done i mean would you say the hospital in business not the medical office business for say but the hospital business is weakened by all this in the sense that you know we kind of went in over our heads over the hospital to begin with and and maybe this fast tracks some consolidation or closings that probably or maybe would have happened eventually i am just wondering if if i think sort of picking your your your relationships becomes even more important in the aftermath because the hospital industry overall is is probably a notch weaker because of everything that happened and and i think it is what you said you are going to it is it is the classic you know problem that these crises just like the financial crisis caused the strong are going to get stronger the weak are going to get weaker and there is different dynamics to that but in the hospital world that is very true and you know you are seeing an hca do extremely well you know coming through this and i think they they do a good job of figuring it out and and there is a lot of not for profit systems that are leaders in their markets i do think the strength and scale matters larger systems versus small independent systems obviously you know more more urban versus in suburban versus rural is going to be a huge trend i know the the trend of moving into the cities is everybody is questioning a little bit but i still think those strong you know population growth centers are going to be where you are going to see the success and so i do think you are correct that picking the right partners will matter more being a sharpshooter will will continue to be critical for success and i think that is something we have been sort of found that trend to be true from the financial crisis and even before so it is true i do think you are right hospitals probably taken you know sort of would have clearly taken a hit and were helped a lot by the cares act and cms in general but i do think we are encouraged that the strong ones i mean this is a demand need based business you know this is not just you know selling luxury items it is very much need based and and so there is a huge need for it in pa as i made my comments a remark i mean hospitals are proving that they are so critical and i think the acuity level of hospitals is only going to continue to climb and you are going to see acuity level at outpatient climb both on and off campus it is a continuum and i think you know all those innovations will continue and it will be a little bit more of a winter versus loser at game and and i think we are we are pretty well positioned to to follow that trend so way monetization of hospital and medical office will be you know more of a realistic outcome of this even for stronger hospitals that maybe you are now taking on you know more market share need more technological advances and so on is is that something that we can finally say we just have not seen it it is the real answer it has all the makings to suggest that would be possibly true we have a very contradicting data point here with the mercy transaction that we just did a little bit of a specific situation where they had a propensity you know to to want to own their assets so a little different but we have heard of a few other anecdotes just recently of some other hospitals doing similar things so you know hospital systems they strategically very differently they do not focus as they should they focus on providing care and and and all the things they need to do to expand their business and succeed they are not sitting around thinking about cap rates for rmbs but i think there is going to be there are going to be some more of those it may be a little bit more from your stressed systems and so then weeding through that back to your earlier question figuring out is it worth it is it the right systems to be with is the question for that alright like great like great thanks thanks rich the next question will come from john chen with bmo capital please go ahead thanks good morning in your opening remarks you know you mentioned saint joseph is and yale trading back to three which is certainly against recent trends of not only hr but other mob leads and i am just wondering if you could just discuss your confidence levels in that and if that is being driven by occupancy picking up or leasing spreads on on leases that you are negotiating now so is okay we we grew the revenue at that level and then at your right you you advance that ball a little bit with cashless lending spreads but that is a pretty small piece of the pie each you know quarter or year so you you do help that you do have a little bit of you know turnover as well that kind of hurts that but the revenue model is more of a you know high two is kind of number and then really it becomes you know what are your expenses doing and how much operating leverage do you have your margin and so that is the algorithm we see but it is really the big driver is is our revenue model of our escalators and and we continue to feel good about that the cashless releasing spreads help at the margin absolutely and as chris talked you know we are looking to try to drive absorption as we go into 21 and that will help also but even without that a lot of of increased absorption you can see same store in eye growth running you know around three and how does free rent cause i imagine you are offering more free rent or you have been more recently chris do you want to touch on that yeah i mean obviously free rent will go into it if if you have a larger percentage percentage of it versus what you had before but i will say generally no we are not adding a lot of free rent you know we really do not have much of any inside of our renewals if we are if we are doing it at all it it typically is inside of of new leasing and so when you have that it  with the newly seen it just kind of creates a little bit of a delay before you see the the revenue impact from that absorption but but overall no we have we have not seen a marked expansion of of free rent okay and then maybe i will ask nick joseph is question a little bit differently i think in gnp weight you mentioned $150000000 of acquisitions you had under contract and now you have closed $82000000 post quarter are you still on track to close that remaining 70000000 or so or have any of those deals fallen apart i would say that they are have certainly have physicians that are you know utilizing the facilities next door i think there is one where the hospital is is not a tenant but but all the others are are tenants by the hospital rob can you speak to the condition of those buildings i know historically you guys are prepared to put some redevelopment dollars into them but in the context of maybe todd what you were speaking to maybe tis come down maybe just getting some broader thoughts about how you guys are allocating capital thanks that is a significant amount of capital into any of them as  as a redevelopment play if that is if that is answering your question it is thank you and then then maybe for god did i hear that right maybe expectations of lower ti is coming down the road and all that is is is what we have heard some others say too we had slower tours and and new leasing activity with new perspective new tenants that create absorption which is where you have higher ti spend in in the 2nd quarter you know especially april and even a little in may and therefore you get this lag effect of when those tenants would normally take occupancy and that is probably a 3rd and 4th quarter phenomenon so it is really a back half issue and even a little bit you saw it in the 2nd quarter so you know that is all we are saying and then back to sort of normalized levels in 21 i would clarify that too of you know that that is a little bit on the prospective leasing front what ty is talking about of of and we do not know for sure what we were kind of run in different scenarios and so we are looking at one scenario that that yes we could see a little bit less absorption here in the next couple of quarters and then rebounding which could have an impact but then also as you look at it in terms of total spending you start looking at fad right now we are running at the low end and frankly a little below the low end of our guidance range is it relates to 2nd general ti and so there is just timing that is always related to that so that may you know pick up certainly we think will be in the range back to you know potentially near the midpoint of the range and so that is part of what what is playing into the guidance is as it relates to to fad and my prepared remarks i talked about you know right now we are are running significantly below where we are on  on a trailing twelve month basis but you know we do think that that that can pick up in the later half of the year and and what drives our our view that our fab payout ratio will will probably end up the year down in the in the low ninety s not in the the low eighty s that you saw this quarter so i just wanted to to clarify that point that helpful because that s where i was going ultimately with this is seeing that sad pay out ratio decline and and in the in the spirit of seeing maybe some dividend i think at some point it does not shake out that low okay that is helpful alright that is it for me thank you thanks a lot i think you mentioned in your comments earlier on that the you know hospitals in general and associated ambulatory care seem to be doing well when we kind of you know think about hca results and some of the other hospital operators but a lot of that is also kind of due to the massive amount of grants they have kind of received over this period as well could you just kind of talk about how you are thinking about kind of in a world where there are no grants or in a world where you know where that source of revenue is well it is you know it is all speculation obviously tyao but it is it is interesting you know i think we saw the most extreme thing hopefully that we will ever see in our lifetimes right but maybe not a month of that right right so you know april was just absolutely extreme and and clearly the government steps in and we just hope you know we do not see that again but i think we have as i mentioned we have learned a lot and i think we learned that hospitals you know good or bad you know hospitals and physicians they really make a lot of money on the elective procedure side and surgeries and when that was shut down i mean you are cutting off the it is a profitable segment of the business and you know healthcare it is it is a little cold to say that because obviously they are only doing they are only supposed to be doing what is necessary but it is necessary there is a ton of that need and so when you cut off that lifeblood if you will it really hurts the system so i think now if you go back to the discussions earlier where it is more of a targeted approach and maybe you know for a short period in houston they they asked you know for some elective procedures to be to be done you know reduced and in not even in all ascs but in hospitals so i think you are going to see a more targeted approach rather than the sort of absolute you know month long or more shut down so it should not therefore it should not be quite as financially difficult you know is it going to be tough yeah just like schools schools for a lot of us you know with kids and it is going to be tough you know as soon as they shut down the school for a week or two or something or even if you are lucky if they are open so there is going to be ebbs and flows as i mentioned but i think we are much better shaped today than we were when we knew very little in march so i do not think it is as dire as you know we could all fear but it you know it is never david emerson used to always say it is never as good or as bad as it may seem and that is probably very appropriate here it it will be not easy but i do not think it is going to be as bad as it was and it is not changing our outlook about hospitals and on campus and mob is we will watch that just like everybody but in my own experience you know personally if you have ever dealt with a family member or or a friend or loved one whatever it might be who is had a serious illness you do not think twice about going to the hospital or going to that you know high acuity specialist that might be near the hospital when it gets real this that is what this is about you know the light touch stuff and it is really cool that there is innovations that can do things you know in and lower costs you know off campus settings and that is fine that is a very real thing and and not so that trend is not real but you know we we think the dynamics of real estate and demand supply and demand are best where it is that high acuity sort of of nucleus if you will around the hospital and and as rich asked you know we got to watch that nucleus make sure it is healthy the hospitals that we are working with so that is that is our focus gotcha that is helpful thank you thanks doc",

continued to lead the way with 62 growth we drove mid single digit wholesale growth for the period as we continue to flex our supply chain and work to replenish channels inventories importantly sell through in the wholesale channel performed in line with our overall top line results leading to the aforementioned demand for channel replenishment our international business also performed very well

our adjusted sg a rate decreased to 200 basis points finally we ended the quarter with $235000000 in cash on the balance sheet following a voluntary debt payment of $50000000 overall we saw excellent demand for our products in all our channels importantly we are continuing to invest in evolving our business to support our long term growth ambitions now let us discuss our strategic growth priorities we continue to deepen the connection of our brand with our customers this is highlighted by our breadth and depth strategy where we extend it to new customers across diverse pursuits while also deepening ties within our existing active outdoor communities as we have discussed the pandemic has focused us on digitally relevant engagement and we have further supported this trend with accelerated investments to build out our in house content and creative teams we are seeing impact of this investment with our ability to drive geographic growth and the evolving diversity of our customer base when we are in our most effective we tell powerful brand stories that inspire our customers connect through product storytelling and extend a positive impact on our communities let me give you a few recent examples in august displaying the broadness of our appeal and audience culture aficionado highsnobiety published an article titled how yeti beat streetwear at the business of making things cool while driving awareness will continue to be a priority we also balance a focus on the depth of engagement with our longstanding customers which keeps us centered from a storytelling perspective the pandemic created a unique opportunity to launch our latest collection of yeti presents film after the pandemic caused us to cancel our in person yeti film tour in march this summer we released the eight new films through a youtube live premiere featuring video introductions from our ambassadors filmmakers and film subjects this event showcased the power and reach of the yeti community to complement youtube an extension of the virtual tour was aired in partnership with vice media and cbs in september we also launched a socially distanced drive in film tour across eight stops from la to montauk to central texas creating a safe uniquely yeti experience for our fans from the product introduction side we partnered with our ambassadors for our caffeine and cocktails campaign where our brand partners shared their favorite drink recipes to help introduce our newest tumbler the ten ounce rambler from conrad is anker is classic coffee pour over to hilary hutcheson is huckleberry whiskey the short social videos are a tremendous example of how we use our internal content creation ambassadors to showcase our product in real and engaging ways our efforts to positively impact the communities we reach often matters most when those communities face adversity as we mentioned on our last call in july we launched our one for the roadies campaign in partnership with crew nation to benefit out of work touring and venue workers after securing 37 music artists to customize 42 of our roadie 24 coolers for our online auction the program raised $135000 the campaign was an incredible success and attracted interest from additional top tier artists who were eager to support future efforts we have also focused on finding ways to ensure the wild is open welcoming and accessible to all we continue to support our relationships with both thrive outside and big city mountaineers two organizations committed to driving diversity in the outdoors we also launched a new partnership with black outside an incredible organization based out of san antonio texas which connects black youth to the outdoors moving to yeti innovation we continue to see sustained strength across drinkware coolers equipment the underlying demand for yeti was strong before the pandemic and we are now seeing the strength continued through the 3rd quarter as a result of more fully open channels +positive trends in digital engagement outdoor pursuits that focus on hygiene and individual use and people taking near home vacations these dynamics support the robust demand we are seeing across the product portfolio and particularly both hard and soft coolers in drinkware we have seen the success with the performance of our bottles business where we included the popular chug cap as a standard lid and our expanded colster can insulator line where we now offer broader products for hard seltzers and large cans while currently limited to dtc we are also encouraged by the early success of our rambler ten ounce tumbler which is mentioned earlier was supported by our caffeine and cocktails digital campaign color remains an important part of our innovation mix following the july launches of northwoods green in drinkware and sagebrush green in coolers we launched our 3rd 2nd half color ice pink in mid september demand for this extremely popular color extended into our breast cancer awareness initiatives throughout october we are excited to once again support boarding for breast cancer and casting for recovery our 4th year with both of these incredible organizations we also expanded our rambler elements metallic collection to the colster and lowball and extended sagebrush from coolers into drinkware i would like to take a moment to address the voluntary recall which was announced yesterday in partnership with the u s consumer product safety commission of the rambler twenty ounce travel mug with our stronghold lid we launched the travel mug on october 1st as our newest travel ready product however shortly after our limited initial launch on yeti com and in our retail stores we discovered a potential safety issue with a stronghold lid and out of an abundance of caution decided to pull the product from channels and voluntarily began work with the cpsc to date there have been no reports of injuries from customers to put this recall in perspective we sold less than 15000 units during the nine days it was available in these direct channels of the approximately 242000 total produced mugs mentioned in our release in addition we did not ship the product to our wholesale partners customer safety is our priority which is why we took such an aggressive stance addressing this issue we are actively engaged in working on an enhanced design that will continue to meet the high standards that our customers place on each and every product carrying the yeti brand this delay while disappointing in the near term is fully contemplated in our outlook and will continue to make us better in addition to our lineup of new products launched this year we are continuing to energize some of our existing categories as part of our marketing strategy to drive broadened awareness this includes the come hell or high water campaign in early july that showcased the versatility and performance of our panga fully submersible bags more recently our built for generations yeti v series film launched digitally on yeti social are centered around our innovative premium stainless steel cooler which is designed to be passed down through the generations expect continued targeted product storytelling through the holidays with our holiday gift guide and upcoming yeti dispatch magalog which will begin to drop mid november we also remain laser focused on working towards rebuilding in stock levels as a reminder to protect our balance sheet in late q one we initially reduced purchase orders at the start of the pandemic and as demand recovered we have worked to flex our supplier capacity to meet rising demand with demand accelerating in the 3rd quarter coupled with some pandemic driven supply disruptions through the summer and early fall production we expect inventory will remain tight through the holidays we have taken additional action to mitigate risk and increase visibility of our supply chain during the holidays but do expect our overall restocking initiatives will extend into early 202 as we look at the balance of the year we remain focused on driving deeper engagement across the yeti portfolio and executing in stocks across all channels looking at our omni channel efforts consumer dynamics are clearly accelerating the digital shift and building upon the activities we have been driving for the past five years along with the heightened focus of our brand team and delivering amazing highly relevant digital content we are taking additional action to drive greater consumer acquisition and conversion through our investments in incremental consumer insights and behavior work and enhanced product customization experience new digital tools and talent additions to our team this is work that will evolve as we match the speed of our customer is purchasing habits and the rapidly evolving consumer expectations the biggest proof point of our success here is our direct consumer business which grew 62 and reached 51 of total sales this period and year to date our strong 3rd quarter dtc performance was led by yeti com due to excellent traffic and conversion on the site we continue to see a great mix of new versus existing customers and have maintained great engagement as a result of our targeted and relevant content rounding out our online presence the amazon marketplace continued to post solid growth through the quarter on the corporate sales side revenues turned slightly positive for the quarter as healthy demand was limited by inventory availability increased capacity and delivery for customers is our focus as we ramp through the holiday season in yeti retail we added our 8th location in west palm beach in august we continue prioritizing operational excellence in all our stores while also monitoring the real estate environment for opportunity as we evaluate store expansion potential for 202 turning to wholesale demand and channel sell through remained robust retailers were able to support demand with in store inventory however they did in the quarter with inventory down double digits compared to the prior year we have opportunity to drive stronger in stocks particularly in high demand areas such as hard coolers and soft coolers which had significant sell through during the quarter as the wholesale business evolves we are working to support the expanded omni capabilities of our wholesale partners through their own e commerce curbside and in store which combined are expected to be an important part of this holiday season we had a very strong performance in our international business this quarter with international wholesale more than doubling while our international e commerce quadrupled in size still off a low base but showing great potential overall international grew 165 to reach seven of sales the highest mix yeti has registered today the biggest factor in the growth was the reopening of our canadian wholesale which delivered significant year over year growth this quarter importantly the dtc side of the canadian business including both e commerce and corporate sales also registered exponential growth during the period while canada still drives the majority of our current international business we continue to be highly encouraged with demand we see in other markets australia showed more than a threefold increase in both the wholesale and e commerce businesses due to the extraordinary performance and execution of our australian team as we hit the one year mark in our uk and europe expansion we are seeing this business build larger each quarter and we continue to see a meaningful opportunity to drive performance as retail reopens we remain highly focused on building the brand internationally in a thoughtful manner while developing the infrastructure to support smart sustainable growth outside of our strategic priorities we were excited to announce earlier this week the next step in our board evolution as our board of directors appointed alison dean former cfo of irobot as an independent director and a member of our audit committee alison brings over thirty years of financial leadership experience including fifteen years with irobot and seven years as the company is cfo before stepping down earlier in 202 alison is addition corresponds with the resignation of mike najjar who returns to his role managing cortec additionally our chair and cortec co president dave schnadig has informed the board that he intends to step down as chair of the board and the nominating and corporate governance committee effective at the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders dave has indicated that he would be willing to stand for reelection to the board if so nominated in may we appreciate the many contributions dave and mike have made to yeti through the years with these moves one of our nine current board members is affiliated with our original private equity sponsor seven are now independent directors and 13rd are women we are proud to continue adding diverse thought and incredible experience to our board as we further build out the long term opportunity for the brand as i pass the call over to paul i would again like to reiterate how thrilled we are with the holistic performance during the 3rd quarter and i would like to thank our yeti team for their exemplary efforts and ability to adapt and thrive so well against a very challenging backdrop through our customers and partners who have continued to show their confidence in our products and our brand thank you while challenges remain pervasive in the headlines we are fully focused on our people and what we do best driving passion for the yeti brand and delivering innovative product we look forward to building upon the strength of our 2020 to date performance with strong execution through the holiday season in q four paul thanks matt and good morning everyone i will begin with a review of our 3rd quarter results followed by some high level thoughts as we look at the business during the holiday period we will then open up the call for your questions starting with the 3rd quarter net sales increased 29 to $294600000 compared to $229100000 in the prior year period representing our highest growth rate as a public company the momentum that built throughout the 2nd quarter accelerated into the 3rd given what we believe is a sustainable shift in consumer behavior towards outdoor leisure activities and related products this trend was highlighted by balanced growth across our product categories and continued dt dtc momentum even as our wholesale channel returned to growth and experienced even stronger sell through during the quarter looking at our channels direct to consumer net sales grew 62 to $150400000 compared to $92900000 in the same period last year driven by strength in both coolers equipment and drinkware within dtc the yeti com business continued to lead the way the amazon marketplace posted strong growth and corporate sales increased slightly for the period overall dtc reached 51 of net sales for the period compared to 41 in last year is period wholesale net sales increased six to $144200000 compared to $136200000 last year strong gains in drinkware helped to offset declines in cooler equipment which were largely driven by inventory constraints channel sell through was up double digits for the quarter though channel inventories exited the quarter down double digits on a year over year basis by category drinkware returned to strong growth during the quarter with net sales increasing 31 to $165900000 compared to $126400000 last year we are very pleased with the continued strength of our original drinkware skus even as we introduce new products to address additional use cases for our customers our expanded colster lineup and updated bottle styles with chug caps remained big winners this year and we are also excited to see the early receptivity of our ten ounce rambler during the period coolers equipment net sales increased 27 to $124200000 compared to $97800000 during the same period last year our overall coolers business remains vibrant led by our new roadie 24 and the tundra haul in hard coolers and our flip and backflip lines in soft coolers we also saw strong results in our outdoor living category led by our trailhead camp chair which we believe supports the broader opportunity of the brand as we develop and expand deeper into new categories gross profit increased 45 to $174000000 or 59ten of net sales compared to $120100000 or 52forty of net sales during the same period last year the 670 basis points year over year expansion was driven by the following favorable impacts 290 basis points from channel mix 110 basis points from product cost improvements ninety basis points from lower tariffs seventy basis points from lower inbound freight seventy basis points from higher inventory reserves in the prior period and lower warranty expenses in the current period and lastly forty basis points from all other impacts adjusted sg a expenses for the 3rd quarter increased by 22 to $101600000 or 34fifty of net sales as compared to $83500000 or 36forty of net sales in the same period last year variable sg a expenses deleveraged 150 basis points driven by the significant shift in channel mix towards a faster growing dtc channel primarily with higher outbound freight non variable sg a expenses leveraged 350 basis points driven by the overall strength of the company is top line results we continue to invest prudently to grow our business with higher year over year spending across most key expense categories including marketing while we also resumed hiring more broadly across the organization adjusted operating income increased 98 to $72400000 or 24sixty of net sales compared to $36600000 or sixteen of net sales during the same period last year our effective tax rate was 24forty during the quarter compared to 24ninety in last year is 3rd quarter adjusted net income more than doubled to $53500000 or ¢61 per diluted share compared to $23200000 or ¢27 per diluted share during the prior year period adjusted ebitda increased 84 to $80200000 or 27twenty of net sales compared to $43700000 or nineteenten of net sales in the same quarter last year now turning to our balance sheet as of september 26th 2020 we had cash of $234800000 compared to $34600000 in the year ago period our strong cash balance in part reflects our lower inventory position as we ended the quarter with $134600000 in inventory compared to $209200000 during the same quarter last year inventory declined 36 year over year reflecting both the comparison to a 33 growth in the year ago period as well as ongoing efforts to match supply with the above forecasted demand we have seen across the business going forward our focus remains on flexing our supply chain to not only match the strong demand we have seen for the brand but also rebuild more consistent in stock levels across our channels as such we expect to be in a constrained inventory position across certain products as we work through the 4th quarter total debt excluding unamortized deferred financing fees and finance leases was $238800000 compared to $298000000 in last year is 3rd quarter during the quarter we made principal payments of $53800000 inclusive of a $50000000 voluntary pre payment with our strong cash position for the quarter the ratio of total net debt to adjusted ebitda for the trailing twelve month was essentially zero times compared to onesix times in the prior year quarter overall we could not be prouder of how our business and our team has responded since the beginning of the pandemic nonetheless we know there is more work to be done to navigate the ongoing uncertainties of the current environment to execute on our holiday plan and ultimately to continue our momentum into 202 given the incredible performance of our 3rd quarter let me give you some high level thoughts into how we see the balance of the year playing out we expect 4th quarter net sales to increase between fifteen and sixteen year over year on top of a strong 24 growth rate in last year is 4th quarter as a reminder the 4th quarter includes the impact of an extra week which extends the fiscal period to january two 2021 and is expected to benefit revenues by approximately $7000000 with a strong out performance in the 3rd quarter contributing to lean inventories across our channels we expect demand for the yeti brand will continue to exceed available supply during the 4th quarter as we focus on rebuilding our inventory position we are also actively and aggressively managing all aspects of our supply chain to navigate real and potential disruptions from supplier capacity to holiday logistics we expect our ongoing work here will provide opportunities for growth as we continue to restock the channel into early 202 turning to the bottom line gaap earnings per diluted share for the 4th quarter are expected to be between ¢55 and ¢58 compared to ¢five in the year ago period we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between ¢57 and ¢sixty reflecting a 31 to 38 year over year growth before turning the call over for q a i want to reinforce three themes that we are seeing in the business 1st we are seeing incredible demand for the yeti brand with growth evenly balanced between our two main product categories and supported by our omni channel evolution 2nd we are focused on delivering profitable growth highlighted by record gross margins and disciplined sg a management lastly we continue to build more financial flexibility to support strategic opportunities and drive future shareholder value we believe these themes of the hallmarks of a strong enduring brand and position the company incredibly well as we look to achieve our long term goals we will now like to open the call for questions operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key one moment please while we poll for questions your 1st question comes from the line of peter benedict with baird please proceed with your question zero hey guys good morning thanks for the questions 1st 1st just on the on the inventory paul i do not know if you can give us maybe a better sense of of where you hope to have this fitting at year end and then assuming the demand pace remains i guess similar when would you be realistically expected to be back kind of in the stock at levels that would allow you to kind of grow or sell through is that something that you think you could get early in 2021 or if this demand level continues well you are going to be chasing for for quite some time that is my 1st question matt i have one follow up great thanks peter and good morning so we expect to end the year still down on inventory but we will make sequential improvement from where we are in the 3rd quarter so while down year over year we we do expect to the percentage to lessen on a decrease year over year and then as we look into 2021 you know it is probably the 1st half of the year where we continue to you know ramp up our inventory and it is really it is all about demand and what we are seeing today is demand is very very strong and we hope that continues but we think as we go through 2021 we will get to a more normalized level okay that is that is helpful and then i guess related to that just matt maybe talk about the the the innovation cadence in the business and i i know you guys adjusted some of the new product introductions this year just in response to covid and whatnot but now we have got the supply constraint dynamic out there so maybe just how has the how has your planning evolved for for 2021 in terms of what maybe you were thinking a year ago you would introduce versus what now you think the cadence will look like peter thanks good morning i would say our planning and roadmap for 2021 as it relates to the product has not changed significantly so the the changes we made in 2020 early in the year when we did not have have great visibility on the back half of the year and as we have previously communicated shifted some things to the front half of 2021 we do not expect those to get caught up in the in the inventory rebuild in the the kind of capacity that we are putting on or the pressure that we are putting on our suppliers for capacity so we expect that that should not have a substantial impact on our product roadmap in the introduction of products next year it is really as paul indicated it is really rebuilding the current product portfolio or current inventory backup so i i feel i feel good about the innovation cadence being untapped in in the plan for innovation in 202 and in parallel we will be rebuilding and and ramping up our our supply capacity for our existing product portfolio okay now that is helpful i i if i can sneak one more and then i will turn it over i apologize just with respect to the recall i am not sure how much you can say about it but just curious what is different about that magslider on the travel mug versus the others and you have magsliders on a lot of different products so if you are at liberty to say and then you said any impact is in your 4th quarter plan paul i do not know if there is you could be little bit more specific behind what you think the impact is going to be thank you yeah peter i will take the the front of that we did a voluntary recall in in abundance of caution and and did not have any we had a report of a dislodging of our our magnetic lid and so we quickly moved you know nine days into the launch of this product through our own direct channels and and took a took a decisive action quickly to make sure we fully understood and fully wrapped this the the difference between the two products is in the legacy product there is one magnet on the top and on the new one there is a magnet on the bottom and a magnet on the top and that is what can they can dislodge from each other and so you know we put incredible importance on consumer safety and when we saw this reported we had an opportunity to quickly quickly wrap it and and get it off the market and put our team back to work on making sure that we had the product out in the market that we thought was deserving of the yeti brand and then peter on the sales impact while i will not share kind of what our plan was and as you can imagine there are a lot of puts and takes there as we introduce the new products how does that impact current products so when we pulled the travel mug you know the perceived cannibalization of other products goes away so as we said it is fully contemplated in the in the topline guidance that we gave in the fifteen to sixteen and you know we are excited to as the team is is reworking that lid and you know looking looking forward okay fair fair enough thanks thanks guys your next question comes from the line of camilo lyon with btig please proceed with your question thank you good morning guys and great job on the quarter i wanted to drill down a little bit more on the inventory comments you are making i think you had some inventory constraints also during the middle of the quarter and obviously in the 4th quarter maybe if you can help us understand what categories you are feeling particularly light on and how you are thinking about you know is there a favoring of a channel that you would prefer to to supply over one over the other so are you going to feed your dtc 1st when supply comes back or is coming through and also are you seeing where in the supply chain are you seeing the disruptions is it on the production side is it shipping times is it at the ports i am just curious to understand where the bottlenecks exist and where we could see some alleviation of that of that inventory flow sure so let me start with the kind of how how we got here or kind of just you know kind of going back a few months so if you remember back at the end of 1st quarter and this is this is where do we see the the bottleneck because there really are not true bottlenecks in the in the normal sense but if we go back to the 1st quarter the end of the 1st quarter last two weeks of the 1st quarter 1st two weeks of the 2nd quarter we cut back as we were seeing those demand signals we had some supply chain disruption there but it was really us cutting back looking at the current demand signals at that and then demand started to in the back half of 2nd quarter started to take off and we began placing forward orders and then as we came into q three so it is really about a lot of this impact is you know kind of going back to the end of 1st quarter beginning of 2nd quarter where we were not producing at a capacity or we were not producing at the level to support the 29 in q three and you know back then i never would have expected to to drive 29 top line growth in the 3rd quarter so it is really we have all our all our factories working you know full capacity in in producing so it is not a it is not a bottleneck in the sense of you know ports and things of that nature that being said you know and and you have seen it in the headlines the port coming into the into the u s on the west coast and then certainly just logistics in in getting the the goods to our dtcs but it really is about kind of the progression of rebuilding the inventory from an allocation you know here is how we think about it is we want to meet consumer demand across channels and if we think about our wholesale channel right so our selling was plus six and we talked about wholesale demand being close to what our topline was in line with what our topline was as a company so we knew we had inventory in the channel so we used that inventory to satisfy demand and then we used the inventory we had to satisfy our dtc so we are constantly looking at satisfying consumer demand and that is kind of how we allocate the inventory and we continue to do that into the 4th quarter got it okay great and then just on the categories is there a specific under inventoried position that is more that is more grave maybe that is too strong a word but that is that is that is of greater focus coolers versus drinkware or is it equally balanced in terms of where you would like to be yeah good good question i am going to come at it from the other angle of we have the benefit of all last year building up my drinkware inventory so even as i came into the 1st quarter 2nd quarter and i did the same thing there i cut forward pos but i had a lot of drinkware inventory in my dc so as demand came back i was able to you know put forward pos in so i i had the benefit of having a lot of drinkware inventory which again as we talked about was a tariff mitigation and turned into a a coronavirus mitigation so i was i benefited from that piece got it that is that is clear thank you and then maybe matt as you think about this you know the balance of the the excess supply excess demand demand outstripping supply with maintaining the brand heat that you are clearly benefiting from are you are you at all seeing anything on the competitive landscape where a customer is is leaving the brand just to fulfill some sort of purchase need and how are you trying to mitigate you know that potential lost sale or that lost customer that you know maybe organically coming to you but not not seeing that demand fulfilled camilo yeah we have seen through time and through different points in yeti is history when we get into supply constrained environments or where demand is is outstripping supply is we do not tend to see a lot of leakage of the of the customer and part is because we focus a lot on making sure we will continue to drive engagement and even if it is engagement in between purchases or it is engagement while someone is waiting for something to come back and stock or we present alternative alternative products that i think is our one of the benefits of our in house internal creative and content team combined with our e commerce team is that we are able to identify more smartly where consumers are and and where they are in the shopping journey and what we can put in front of them as an alternative so we tend to see we tend not to see that leakage and you know as a reminder this business pre mid march and pre the pandemic shut down here in the u s was growing twenty +percent we just grew 29 in in the 3rd quarter we provided some some outlook on on on the 4th quarter so we expect the back half of the year to to return to that twenty growth this is a business that was driving performance and consumer demand as we as we went through that time and and we are continuing to do it right now and and we will work hard to make sure we keep consumers engaged while while we get our in stocks back at the level both in wholesale and our own dtc channels in the way we want it fantastic good luck in holiday season thanks thanks camilo your next question comes from the line of alexandra walvis with goldman sachs please proceed with your question good morning thanks so much for taking the question here my 1st question is on e commerce e commerce of course growing very very strongly so in the quarter and you mentioned that was you saw growth across channels could you talk about the discrepancy in growth that you are seeing between yeti com and amazon marketplace you know what is the the mix of the e commerce business today between those channels and and how would you expect that to trend going forward hey alex good morning so yeti com and i may have said this in my prepared remarks yeti com definitely led the way so if i think about the dtc business yeti com was the leader then amazon and then corporate sales and i am leaving retail out just because of the year over year comparison with the new store it does not make the the percent growth relevant so yeti com is still the strongest you know we like what we are seeing across those channels and are really happy with the engagement we are driving with yeti com you know the amazon marketplace is an important business for us we saw you know this is going back to the end of end of q one slight you know disruption as people were really focused on more essentials but that has come back nicely and is growing very very well but clearly the the standout was yeti com great and any plans so you know which which of those you are prioritizing as you as you move forward in the coming quarters and years so prioritizing and i mean you can ask you can come back at me i am going to step away from prioritizing inventory but really if you think about the coming years we really like the yeti com business it is the fullest expression of our business it is where we get you know the most information from a customer and and being able to interact with the customer so you know if we can wave if i could wave a magic wand i would have everyone go to yeti com that being said you know the amazon marketplace is really important if people choose for now $119 a year if they are a prime member and they go to buy you know something and they want to put a a rambler twenty in their cart we want to be where the customer wants to shop so that is kind of how we think long term is and that goes as far as wholesale too is being where the customer wants to access the brand is the most important thing to us i appreciate you sharing thoughts on that maybe one more from me i wonder if you could update us on business with lowe is how many you are in now how that is trending and and what is the what is the the next stepping opportunity is there yeah alex matt i will i will take that one thanks thanks for the question and and good morning you know we continue to really enjoy the relationship that we built with lowe is and the partnership and and that is that is as important to us as we think about what a methodical pace rollout looks like we said that from the very beginning that the rationale for why we add additional wholesale is that they bring a a relatively new consumer a new buying occasion or they they augment support the rest of our existing wholesale and i i think lowe is has continued to do that and been and been a good partner as we have evolved and and learned together you know this year we are incredibly pleased with our partnership we made some decisions as the year paced on to moderate our rollout considering the environment and considering our inventory constraints and it gave us an opportunity to really focus on the execution and performance so what what we really like is we continue to see the incrementality of that relationship and and we look at it as a piece in the puzzle of our overall wholesale and our overall wholesale is a piece in the puzzle of our overall omni channel so we are we are pleased with with how that is performing and as we said at the in the prepared remarks and we will reiterate it here we are pleased with the overall performance in our wholesale and our job now is to to thoughtfully rebuild the channel inventory so that we continue to address more and more of the consumer demand fantastic thanks so much and all the best thanks alex your next question comes from line of randy konik with jefferies please proceed with your question yeah good morning everybody you know clearly the the strong revenue numbers the growth of revenue is indicated indicative of you know acceleration of new customer growth and existing customers you know buying more and i i remember i recall numbers a number of quarters ago you guys were starting to track the purchase behavior or kind of track customers on what they are doing so is there any kind of color you can give us when you analyze the dtc business of what proportion of the revenues are coming from you know new brand new customers versus existing customers right now randy good morning this is matt what i would say is we have not as you as you pointed out we have not shared the specific numbers it is something that we we continue to get smarter and have better insights to you know i made a comment a little bit earlier that you know we are we are focused on understanding those customer cohorts and how they perform and how they perform differently and as our product portfolio expands what that sequencing of purchases and and what that recurrence of purchase looks like what i can say is interestingly through this year to date as we have seen elevated demand and as channel shifts have have occurred during different points of shutdown and wholesale is our new to yeti com versus existing or repeat purchase on yeti com has all lifted and and that ratio between the two has not shifted materially and so we we we really like the new customer acquisition that we are seeing and the percent of new customers we are seeing and along with that we like the the returning customer and the repeat purchase rate and and what we are really focused on is you know what is their behavior after that 1st purchase within those 1st thirty days within those 1st ninety days and within that 1st 1st year and so those are all metrics we are we are paying a lot of attention to and then below that what does that what does that basket of expansion expansion look like so what we are reporting the numbers it is something we are paying a lot of attention to it is something we are taking action on and it is something we like the trend that we are seeing and it is it is a big area of investment for the business in 2020 and that will continue to be a big area of investment in 2021 as we drive deeper consumer insights and and behavior understandings to really target those distinct those distinct audiences that is great and then last question you mentioned i believe the international penetration is at seven of total i believe it was only four you know only a few quarters ago so can you give us some extra depth of color on you know what you think is happening in terms of ri rising awareness or or what have you just trying to get a sense of the acceleration you are seeing because it seems like that business is now starting to kind of really come into its own that that that geography if you will the international and just want to get some color on what you think is starting to really continue to accelerate that that business going that part of the sales geography going forward thank you yeah yeah we are we are randy we are super excited about the opportunity internationally we have been but what we are we are excited about now is our enthusiasm is being matched by the activity and results and i i say that fully knowing that wholesale or retail in europe and the uk and australia and canada until q three was was really disrupted by the pandemic and i would say disrupted in some cases even more than the u s wholesale market so what we saw in the quarter was a really strong recovery in our international business and it came back it came back alive what we liked was we saw strong performance out of our wholesale led by the canadian wholesale which is a market that we have been actively and directly with yeti employees operating in since 2017 but balanced with that wholesale is strong e commerce performance and and i think that is indicative of the rising awareness of the brand you know i think that things like social media the content we create that type of information has been more and more democratized globally and so the awareness of our brand and the awareness of our products in in many cases in some of the markets we enter internationally leads our official entry or leads the the distribution we have in those markets because social media is such a such a globally democratized and available so we continue to focus on we see the demand signals we believe the brand is bigger than the revenue our focus continues to be on building our brand in the right way so we are not rushing out just to taste short term placement or short term growth we really want the sustainable growth and we are seeing that in canada and australia in particular where we have been operating for three full years and we are seeing the early signs of it in the uk and europe and what we like about the uk and europe in the early days is even with the disruption through the summer in their in the wholesale channel that e commerce continues to be to be a strong opportunity so i think you would look for us to go into 2021 with a heavy focus around international focus a heavy focus around brand building and driving ultimately the question you asked which is driving the awareness which we think ultimately drives the consideration and the purchase very helpful thanks guys thanks randy your next question comes from the line of sharon zackfia with william blair please proceed with your question hi good morning so question on on the operating margin you have obviously had a couple of quarters in a row where operating margin has started with a two and it looks like the amputation is that that will continue in the 4th quarter and and it looks like for the full year i guess i would be interested in paul and and how 2020 has changed any of your thoughts about the longterm sustainable margin of the company and also if there are any any areas where you feel like you are over earning this year because you pull back on marketing or or travel or other dynamics if you could kind of dimensionalize those for us yeah good morning sharon so the performance in that the operating margin expansion and the performance has been fantastic so as i as i think about that and then thinking about going forward obviously that is driven by the significant increase in direct to consumer and the shift that we have seen both in the 2nd quarter and the 3rd quarter but even if we go back to the to the 1st quarter and and the whole algorithm of the company of dtc growing faster than wholesale so a lot of that margin expansion is driven by gross margin expansion because we look to the to the future i a couple of thoughts the 1st is we expect gross margin with mix shift in cost improvements to continue to expand i do not expect it to expand to the level it did this year because of the significant outperformance of dtc and then and as you know just the law of large numbers is my dtc becomes a bigger percent of the business every incremental one mix gives me less on the mix but we do believe gross margin will continue to benefit from mix shift cost improvements and then i will say we talk very often internally about where do we want to are there things we want to invest at the gross margin levels are there things we want to invest in in the product and i think you saw that and we have talked about this when we put the chug cup on the bottle and did not change the price so we delivered value to the consumer and held to the price and we used some of that gross margin expansion to fund them from over earning in the business i think the most obvious one and you called it out is t e right so we are still working remotely and and and not traveling so certainly t e is down you know we continue and and even though we saw significant leverage on non variable expenses you know we continue to invest in absolute dollars we continue to spend more in marketing we have resumed hiring so you know we continue to bring great talent into the business and things of that nature so the expense leverage is really about kind of the top line growth but other than t e you know we are running the business and investing in the business for the future so i do not feel like we are over earning to use your word based on you know cutting back on expenses thanks that is very helpful your next question comes from line of robby ohmes with bank of america securities please proceed with your question zero thanks guys so you know great quarter the actually just two quick questions you you mentioned you know sort of some new drivers and growth to the brand outdoor you know near home vacations things like that during the beginning of the call i guess matt is there any you know when you get beyond the the inventory constraints and you look out you know the next year or two are you looking at are there some new wholesale type customers that you guys are thinking about now because of these new drivers of demand for the brand that you maybe were not thinking about a year ago robby i would i would answer that and good morning a couple of different ways these the drivers that have become kind of the headlines through through the summer and some of the drivers we mentioned i would say for our brand have been dynamics that we have been experiencing for the last handful of years that that movement towards being active outdoors adventure based vacations you know car camping all those dynamics we think what is happened this summer is it is just it is accelerated exposure of the trend that we were seeing and obviously our benefit our business was was benefiting from strong growth pre pandemic and and as those trends get highlighted and people try those things we are we are right in that in that slipstream to to continue to sustain that momentum you know if it were different than we were zero growth in in realized growth because of a trend it would be a different dynamic and that is just not that is not the situation we are in i couple that with because we were we think we were well positioned pre pandemic and and pre trends being highlighted we believe we have got really good representation from a wholesale perspective domestically and we think that between the amazon marketplace and yeti com we have got good good representation that said as we have said in the past we constantly monitor the wholesale market we look for everything from independent partners who help us identify a certain region or a certain customer group that we may not be accessing all the way up to a larger national but as is as you know having followed us for a while we are really thoughtful when we bring on a big partner we were thoughtful when we added lowe is to the to the suite of of wholesale partners we have so we feel good where we are today but we also pay attention to to the market i think internationally is a different a different situation because that is a little more greenfield for us when it comes to to wholesale exposure and so far we have been following a similar playbook to the u s which is building strong relevant independent relationships and and identifying regional players or in some cases national players that we think will will represent the brand and and the business well that is that is helpful and then paul just quickly shipping surcharges anything any impact to you guys you see you know for the 4th quarter or next year so from a dollar perspective it is all we are seeing you know the surcharges that ups has announced all contemplated in the 4th quarter outlook and and robby what i would say is what we are really focused on and and not to play down the the dollar piece of it it is really the capacity and making sure you know that we secure and we work with ups i think our guys probably talk to them if not every day three times a week we have secured our capacity for the 4th quarter and that is really our biggest focus and again not to downplay the dollars but making sure we have the making sure they are coming to pick up the trailers is absolutely critical and we have a very good relationship with them and and our ops team is very focused on that terrific thanks so much thanks robby your next question comes from the line of peter keith with piper sandler please proceed with your question hey thanks good morning guys i want to follow up on a a prior question i think from camilo just regarding the the inventory out of stocks at wholesale so it seems like kind of a good news bad news situation remarkably strong sell through but inventory constrained and now you are going to the holiday season it seems like there could be some risk where your wholesale partners might bring in some alternative competitors to to fill in some of those cooler out of stocks what actions can you take in order to prevent that type of activity and do you see that as any risk in the coming months peter i would say a couple of things to that one we have great wholesale partnerships and that very open dialogs as we have as we have gone through this and as we have seen challenges to the supply disruption you know one of the things that we have worked very closely with our wholesale partners is how do we fill in either with other yeti products or make sure that we are we are represented as well as we can as we rebuild that space so one of the one of the conversations we have is you know as we rebuild that inventory we want to make sure that we have the right space to merchandise the products the right way and the way that we did pre pandemic and and the way we would expect all of our wholesale partners as at any point but as we rebuild that inventory so i would say the conversations have been great we are in full alignment with our partners so we do not see we do not see risk from something changing because of this moment in time but we also do not see risk as far as as i mentioned earlier on the call demand leakage you know we want to continue to drive demand for our products we continue to bring innovation to market we have started previewing our spring products with our wholesale partners and there is a lot of excitement about about what we continue to do with the brand and what we continue to do from an innovation perspective okay thanks matt i will ask the next question to paul just around the the structure of the guidance so with the the fifteen to sixteen growth it does imply a notable deceleration from q three and we know there is a lot of uncertainty in the economic environment but is there anything identifiable that you can see that would that would cause that slowdown and then maybe on a related note that the eps growth guidance of ¢31 to ¢38 is certainly above normal for sort of your your normal mid teens revenue growth so what are the the margin characteristics that driving that above average eps growth so a couple of things on the topline and as as we think about this if you step back to the end of 2nd quarter where we said the back half of the year would be fourteen to between ten and fifteen and now the back half of the year is going to be you know on if you look at what we have talked about for the 4th quarter call it twenty so if we look from where we were three months ago you know the business has certainly performed and it is really about a very strong q three so the the deceleration i i think about it a little bit differently of the back half of the year from where i thought about it three months ago is actually stronger than what i was taking three months ago you know as we think about the 4th quarter in particular you know a couple of a couple of things the 1st is you know we are up against our strongest comparison from last year to +23 in last year is 4th quarter you know we talked about the inventory constraints so those that is what kind of shaped our thinking on the current outlook but again as i think of the back half of the year strongly outperforming what we thought the back half of the year was going to be just three months ago from an eps perspective or a margin it is going to be and i am happy to say that much of the same we are going to see expanding gross margins now we are rolling over as 4th quarter always is our biggest dtc quarter every year so it you know the the hurdle certainly gets gets higher but but i think about gross margins i am going to expect some gross margin i am going to expect gross margin expansion from the channel mix shift costing improvements and then tariff tailwind and then if i think about sg a kind of come down the p l it is going to be a similar story overall of de leveraging on the variable because of the mix shift so really driven by mix shift and i expect the non variable to be roughly from a leverage perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leverage not not a dollar obviously the dollars will will increase so that is that is what is driving the operating margin down to you know if you talk about get down to eps obviously my lower interest both from a nice to be the last one that i hit the the balance of debt and then because i have a floating rate debt as you all know interest rates are just in my favor and as i delever my pricing i go down on the grid of less expensive spreads okay that is all very helpful keep up the good work guys and good luck with the holiday great thanks your final question comes from line of matt koranda with roch capital partners please proceed with your question hey guys thanks for sneaking me in here just wanted to touch on 2021 again if i could and that has been covered a little bit but wanted to see did we get any new categories that that add to growth as we look out into 2021 or is it still the existing drinkware in cooler categories and just replenishment and the wholesale and then sustain strengthen in dtc just wanted to to get your take on that 1st matt we have not matt we have not communicated any forward category expansion we we tend not to to talk about our four product roadmap what i would say is you know we continue to look for expansion opportunities within our existing products and in our existing product families and and if you look at our history of pacing over the last few years we continue to kind of push the edge of of new product families and i would expect as we go into 2021 that that is going to continue you know we want to keep reinvigorating our longest standing product families and introduce introduce new new families and and continue to expand underneath the the permission the yeti brand and the yeti consumers have given us to to bring more products to market got it and it sounded like paul did you want to add anything because it sounds like you are jumping in there as well nope that was it okay great good good very helpful and then just a lot of the other stuff has been answered but on the balance sheet what i was curious about is i mean as we sort of get into a very high quality situation where you have got essentially zero turns to leverage how do we think about cash deployment going forward obviously we are going to see plenty of investment and organic growth we understand that but when we think about sort of return of cash versus m a and the prioritization there just curious to get your thoughts going forward yeah matt it is really you know we think about it in three in three buckets right now for for what we would spend our cash on 1st and foremost is rebuilding our inventory to level that we believe is the right level to support the growth across our omni channel so number one is number one is inventory the 2nd one is capex investments and the capex investments fall within a couple different categories they fall within our the continued digitization of the business and our technology investments and they fall on the product side and the product side splits into two things it is investment in capacity as we continue to ramp legacy products and its investment in new product development and then the 3rd thing is and we communicate this in the past that as we contemplate strategic m a you know one of the things that i like to always say is we like the yeti brand a lot we think there is a lot of expansion opportunity underneath the yeti brand but as we look at m a we look at it across really 22 fronts one r d investment in technologies or materials that help accelerate our existing product roadmap or a strategic acquisition that helps accelerate entry into relevant categories and that that can bring a category expansion it could bring a customer base expansion it could bring geographic expansion and so that is really that is really the way we the way we look at it internally we also feel very fortunate to be sitting here with $235000000 in cash in a in a highly coming out of a highly uncertain summer so you know we feel good about the opportunities in front of us to return value to shareholders but 1st and foremost through growth great thanks for that matt i will jump back in queue ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to mister matt reintjes for closing remarks thanks everybody for joining today i just want to reiterate the incredible quarter we

roadies campaign in partnership with crew nation to benefit out of work touring and venue workers after securing 37 music artists to customize 42 of our roadie 24 coolers for our online auction the program raised $135000 the campaign was an incredible success and attracted additional top tier artists who were eager to support future efforts we have also focused on finding ways to ensure the wild is open we continue to support our relationships with both thrive outside and big city mountaineers two organizations committed to driving diversity in the outdoors we also launched a new partnership with black outside an incredible organization based out of san antonio texas which connects black youth to the outdoors moving to yeti innovation we continue to see sustained strength across drinkware coolers and equipment the underlying demand for yeti remains strong before the pandemic and we are now seeing the strength continue through the 3rd quarter as a result of more fully open channels +positive trends in digital engagement outdoor pursuits a focus on hygiene and individual use and people taking near home vacations these dynamics support the robust demand we are seeing across the product portfolio and particularly both hard and soft coolers in drinkware where we have seen the success with the performance of our bottles business where we included the popular following the july launches of northwoods green and drinkware and sagebrush green and coolers we launch our 3rd 2nd and 1st products demand for this extremely popular color extended into our breast cancer awareness initiative throughout october we are excited to once again support boarding for breast cancer and casting for recovery our 4th year with both of these incredible organizations we also expanded our rambler elements metallic collection to the cooler and lowball and extended sagebrush from coolers into drinkware we launched the travel mug on october 1st as our newest travel ready product however shortly after our limited initial launch on getty com and in our retail stores we discovered a potential safety issue with the strong gold lid and out of an abundance of caution decided to pull the product from these channels and voluntarily begin working with the cpsc to put this recall in perspective we sold less than 15000 units during the nine days it was available in these direct channels of the approximately 242000 total produced mugs mentioned in our release in addition we did not ship the product to our wholesale partners customer safety is our priority which is why we took such an aggressive stance addressing this issue we are actively engaged in working on an enhanced design that will continue to meet our customers needs this delay while disappointing in the near term is fully contemplated in our outlook and will continue to make us better in addition to our line up of new products launched this year we are continuing to energize some of our existing categories as part of our marketing strategy to drive broader awareness this includes the com hell or highwater campaign in early july that showcases the versatility and performance of our products we also remain laser focused on working towards rebuilding in stock levels as a reminder to protect our balance sheet in late q one we initially reduced purchase orders at the start of the pandemic and as demand recovered we have worked to flex our supplier capacity to meet rising demand with demand accelerating in the 3rd quarter coupled with some pandemic driven supply disruptions through the summer and early fall production we expect inventory will remain tight through the holidays we have taken additional action to mitigate risk and increase visibility of our supply chain during the holidays i would like to thank the speakers for their presentations and i would like to update everyone on our overall re stocking initiative i would like to expect that our overall re stocking initiative will extend into early 2021 as we look at the balance of the year we remain focused on driving deeper engagement across the entire edi portfolio and executing in stocks across all channels looking at our omnichannel efforts consumer dynamics are clearly accelerating the digital shift and building upon the activities we have been driving for the past five years along with the heightened focus of our brand we are confident that we will continue to drive growth and deliver value to our customers and delivering amazing highly relevant digital content we are taking additional action to drive greater consumer acquisition and conversion through our investments in incremental consumer insights and behavior work and enhanced product customization experience new digital tools and talent additions to our team this is work that will evolve as we match the speed of our customers purchasing habits and the rapidly evolving consumer expectations the biggest proof point of our success here is our direct to consumer business which grew 62 and reached 51 of total sales this period and year to date our strong 3rd quarter ddc performance was led by yeti dot com due to excellent traffic and conversion on the site we continue to see a great mix of new versus existing customers and have maintained great engagement as a result of our targeted and relevant content rounding out our online presence the amazon marketplace continues to post solid growth through the quarter on the corporate sales side revenues turned slightly positive for the quarter as healthy demand was limited by inventory availability increased capacity and delivery for custom is our focus as we ramp through the holiday season in yeti retail we added our 8th location in west palm beach in august we continue prioritizing operational excellence in all our stores while also monitoring the real estate environment for opportunities as we evaluate store expansion potential for 2021 as the wholesale business evolves we are working to support the expanded omnichannel capabilities of our wholesale partners through their expanded omnichannel capabilities we expect e commerce curbside and in store which combined are expected to be an important part of this holiday season we had a very strong performance in our international business quarter with international wholesale more than doubling while our international e commerce quadrupled in size still off a low base but showing great potential overall international group 165 to reach seven of sales the highest mix yet yeti has registered to date the biggest factor in the growth was the reopening of our canadian wholesale which delivered significant year over year growth this quarter importantly the d to c side of the canadian business including both ecommerce and corporate sales also registered exponential growth during the period while canada still drives the majority of our current international business we continue to be highly encouraged with demand we see in other markets australia showed more than a threefold increase in both the wholesale and ecommerce businesses due to the extraordinary performance and execution of our australian team as we hit the one year mark in our uk and europe expansion we are seeing this business build larger each quarter and we continue to see a meaningful opportunity to drive performance as retail reopens we remain highly focused on building the brand internationally in a thoughtful manner while developing the infrastructure to support smart sustainable growth outside of our strategic priorities we were excited to announce earlier this week the next step in our board evolution as our board of directors appointed alison dean former cfo of irobot as an independent director and a member of our audit committee

the brand as i pass the call over to paul i would again like to reiterate how thrilled we are with the holistic performance during the 3rd quarter and i would like to thank our yeti team for their exemplary efforts and ability to adapt and thrive so well against a very challenging backdrop to our customers and partners who have continued to show their confidence in our products and our brand thank you while challenges remain pervasive in the headlines we are fully focused on our people and what we do best driving passion for the yeti brand and delivering innovative products we look forward to building upon the strength of our twenty to twenty to date performance with strong execution through the holiday season and q four paul thanks man good morning everyone i will begin with a review of our 3rd quarter results followed by some high level thoughts as we look at the business during the holiday period we will then open up the call for your questions starting with the 3rd quarter net sales increased 29 to 294000000 compared to 229100000 in the prior year period representing our highest growth rate as a public company this trend was highlighted by balanced growth across our product categories and continued dtc momentum even as our wholesale channel returned to growth and experienced either even stronger sell through during the quarter looking at our channels direct to consumer net sales grew 62 to 150400000 compared to 92900000 in the same period last year driven by strength in both coolers and equipment and drinkware within dtc the yeti dot com business continued to lead the way the amazon marketplace posted strong growth and corporate sales increased slightly for the period overall dtc reached 51 of net sales for the period compared to 41 in last year is period wholesale net sales increased six to 144200000 compared to 136200000 last year strong gains in drinkware helped offset declines in cooler and equipment which were largely driven by inventory by category drinkware returned to strong growth during the quarter with net sales increasing 31 to 165900000 compared to 126400000 last year we are very pleased to please continued strength of our original drinkware skews even as we introduce new products to address additional use cases for our customers our expanded cooler lineup and updated bottle styles with chug caps remained big winners this year and we are also excited to see the early receptivity of our ten ounce rambler during the period coolers and equipment net sales increased 27 to 124200000 compared to 97800000 during the same period last year our overall coolers business remains vibrant led by our new roadster 24 in the tundra hall in hard coolers and our flip and backflip lines in soft coolers we also saw strong results in our outdoor living category led by our trailhead camp chair which we believe supports the broader opportunity of the brand as we develop and expand deeper into new categories gross profit increased 45 to 174000000 or 59 one of net sales compared to 120100000 or 52four of net sales during the same period last year the 670 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by a combination of increased sales volume and improved pricing 290 basis points from channel mix a 110 basis points from product cost improvements ninety basis points from lower tariffs seventy basis points from lower inbound freight rates seventy basis points from higher inventory reserves in the prior period and lower warranty expenses in the current period and lastly forty basis points from all other impacts adjusted sgna expenses for the 3rd quarter increased by 22 to 101600000 of 34five of net sales as compared to 83500000 or 36four of net sales in the same period last year variable sgna expenses deleveraged 150 basis points driven by the significant shift in channel mix towards faster growing dtc channel primarily with higher outbound freight we continue to invest prudently to grow our business with higher year over year spending across most key expense categories including marketing while we also resumed hiring more broadly across the organization adjusted operating income increased 98 to 72400000 or 24six of net sales compared to the prior year our net sales for the six months ended december 31 2007 were $36600000 or sixteen of net sales during the same period last year our effective tax rate was 24four during the quarter compared to 24nine in last year is 3rd quarter adjusted net income more than doubled to $53300000 or ¢61 per diluted share compared to 23200000 or ¢27 per diluted share during the prior year period adjusted ebitda increased 84 to 80200000 or 27two of net sales compared to 43700000 or nineteen one of net sales in the same quarter last year now turning to our balance sheet as of september 26 2020 we had cash of $200340000 compared to $34600000 in the year ago period our strong cash balance in part reflects our lower inventory position as we ended the quarter with $110900000 in inventory compared to $209900000 during the same quarter last year inventory decline 36 year over year reflecting both the comparison to a 33 growth in the year ago period as well as ongoing efforts to match supply with the above forecasted demand we have seen across the business going forward our focus remains on flexing our supply chain to not only match the strong demand we are seeing for the brand as such we expect to be in a constrained inventory position across certain products as we work through the 4th quarter total debt excluding unamortized deferred financing fees and finance leases was 238800000 compared to 298000000 during the quarter we made principal payments of 53800000 inclusive of a $50000000 voluntary prepayment and with our strong cash position for the quarter the ratio of total net debt to adjusted ebitda for the trailing twelve months was essentially zero times compared to onesix times in the prior year quarter overall we could not be prouder of how our business and our team has responded since the beginning of the pandemic nonetheless we know there is more work to be done to navigate the ongoing uncertainties of the current environment to execute on our holiday plan and ultimately to continue our momentum into 2021 given the incredible performance of our 3rd quarter we expect 4th quarter net sales to increase between fifteen and sixteen year over year on top of the strong 24 growth rate in last year is 4th quarter as a reminder the 4th quarter includes the impact of an extra week which extends the fiscal period to january 22021 it is expected to benefit revenues by approximately $7000000 with our strong outperformance in the 3rd quarter contributing to lean inventories across our channels we expect demand for the yeti brand will continue to exceed available supply during the 4th quarter as we focus on rebuilding our inventory position we are also actively and aggressively managing all aspects of our supply chain to navigate real and potential disruptions from supplier capacity to holiday logistics we expect our ongoing work here will provide opportunities for growth as we continue to restart the channel into early 2021 turning to the bottom line gap earnings per diluted share for the 4th quarter are expected to be between 55 and ¢58 compared to ¢five in the year ago period we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between 57 and ¢sixty reflecting a 31 to 38 year over year growth before turning the call over for q and a i want to reinforce three themes we are seeing in the business 1st we are seeing incredible demand for the yeti brand with growth we are well balanced between our two main product categories and supported by our omnichannel evolution secondly we are focused on delivering profitable growth highlighted by record gross margins and disciplined sg a management lastly we continue to build more financial flexibility to support strategic opportunities and drive future shareholder value we believe these themes are the hallmarks of our success good afternoon thank you for calling this is and we are pleased to present our brand and position the company incredibly well as we look to achieve our long term goals we would now like to open the call for questions operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue thank you for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handheld set before pressing the start key one moment please while we poll for questions peter benedict with baird please proceed with your question zero hey guys good morning thanks for the questions  1st 1st just on the on the inventory paul i do not know if you can give us maybe a better sense of of where you you where you hope to have this sitting at your end and then assuming that the demand pace remains similar when would you realistically expect to be be fully operational that kind of in the stock at levels that would allow you to kind of grow with yourself through is that something that you think you can get early in 201 or or if this demand level continues well you are going to be chasing for for quite some time that is my 1st question that one follow up great thanks peter and good morning so we expect to end the year still down on inventory but we will make sequential improvement from where we are in the 3rd quarter so while down year over year we expect to see sequential improvement we we do expect to the percentage to decrease on a decrease year over year and then as we look into 2021 you know it is probably the 1st half of the year where we continue to you know ramp up our inventory and it is really it is all about demand and what we are seeing today is demand is very very strong and and we hope that continues but we think as we go into the future we will get to a more normalized level okay that is helpful and then i guess related to that just matt maybe talk about the the innovation cadence in the business and i know you guys adjusted some of the new product introductions this year just in response to covid and whatnot but now we have got the supply constraint but dynamic out there so maybe just how is the how has your planning evolved for for 2022 2021 in terms of what maybe you were thinking a year ago you would introduce versus what now you think the cadence will look like 2021 we do not expect those to get caught up in the in the inventory rebuild in the the kind of capacity that we are putting on or the pressure we are putting on our suppliers for capacity so we expect that that should not have a substantial impact on our product roadmap and the introduction of products next year it is really as paul indicated it is really rebuilding the the current product portfolio or current inventory backup so i feel like good about the innovation cadence being intact in and the plan for innovation in 2020 and 2021 and in parallel we will be rebuilding and in ramping up our our supply capacity for our existing product portfolio you are at liberty to say and then you said you know any impact is in your 4th core plan panels of course you could pull a little more specific behind what you think the impact is going to be thank you yeah peter i will i will take the the front of that yeah we did a voluntary recall in an abundance of caution and did not have any we had a report of a dislodging of our our magnetic lid and so we quickly moved you know nine days into launch of this product through our own means channels and and took  took a decisive action quickly to make sure we fully understood and and fully wrap this the the difference between the two products is in the legacy product there is one magnet on the top and on the new one there is a magnet on the bottom and a magnet on the top and that is what can happen they can dislodge from each other and so you know we put incredible importance on consumer safety and when we saw this report of it we had an opportunity to quickly quickly wrap it and and get it off the market put our team back to work on making sure that we had the product out in the market that we thought was deserving of the eddie brand so as we said it is fully considered in the and the top line guidance that we gave in the fifteen to sixteen and you know excited too as the team is is reworking that lid and you know looking forward please proceed with your question thank you good morning guys and a great job on the quarter i wanted to drill down a little bit more on the inventory comments you are making but i think you have some inventory constraints also during the middle of the quarter and obviously continue here in the 4th quarter maybe if you can help us understand what categories you are feeling particularly light on and how you are thinking about you know is there a favoring of a channel are you prefer to supply over one over the other so are you going to feed your dtc 1st when supply comes back or is it coming through and also are you seeing where in the supply chain are you seeing the disruptions is it on the production side is it shipping times is it at the ports i am just curious to understand where the bottlenecks exist and where we could see some alleviation of that of that inventory flow the kind of how how we got here or kind of just you know kind of going back a few months so if you remember back at the end of the 1st quarter and this is this is where do we see the the bottlenecks cause there really are not true bottlenecks in the in the normal sense but if we go back to the 1st quarter the end of the 1st quarter last two weeks of the 1st quarter 1st two weeks of the 2nd quarter we cut back forward po is as as we were seeing those demand signals we had  some supply chain disruption there but it was really us cutting back looking at the current demand signals at that and then demand started to in the back half of the 2nd quarter started to take off and we began placing more forward orders and then as we came into q three so it is really about a lot of this impact is you know kind of going back to the end of 1st quarter beginning of 2nd quarter are where we were not producing at a capacity or we were not producing at the level to support the 29 and q three in you know back then i never would have expected to to drive 29 top line growth in the 3rd quarter so it is really we have all our all our factories working you know full capacity and in producing so it is not a it is not a bottleneck in the sense of you know ports and things of that nature that being said you know and and you have seen it in the headlines the port coming into the into the u s on the west coast and then certainly just logistics in in getting the the goods to our dcs but it really is about kind of the progression of rebuilding the inventory from an allocation yeah here is how we think about it is we want to meet consumer demand across channels and if we think about our wholesale channel so our sell in was +six and we talked about wholesale demand being close to what our top line was in line with what our top line was as a company so we knew we had inventory in the channel so we used that inventory to satisfy demand and then we used the inventory we had to satisfy our dtc so we are constantly looking at satisfying consumer demand and that is kind of how we allocate the inventory and we continue to do that into the 4th quarter got it okay great and then just on the categories is there a specific under inventory position that is more that is more grave maybe that is too strong a word but that is that is of greater focus for example fillers versus or for example fillers versus refrigerated versus frozen versus canned versus fresh versus non perishable versus other yeah good good question i am going to come at it from the other angle of we had the benefit of all last year building up my drinkware inventory so even as i came into the 1st quarter 2nd quarter i did the same thing there i cut forward po is but i had a lot of drinkware inventory in my dc so as demand came back i was able to you know put forward po is in i had the benefit of having a lot of drinkware inventory which again as we talked about was a tariff mitigation and turned into a coronavirus mitigation so that i benefited from that piece yeah got that cleared up thank you and then maybe matt as you think about this you know the balance of the the access supply access demand  demand outstripping supply with maintaining the brand heat that you are clearly benefiting from are you so are you at all seeing anything on the competitive landscape where a customer is is leaving the brand just to fulfill some sort of purchase need and then how are you trying to mitigate you know that potential loss sale or that lost customer that you know maybe organically coming to you but not not seeing that demand fulfilled seen through time and through different points in yeddas history when we get into supply constrained environments or where demand is is outstripping supply is that we we do not tend to see a lot of leakage of the of the customer and part of it is because we focus a lot on making sure we will continue to drive engagement and even if it is engagement in between purchases or it is engagement while someone is waiting for something to come back in stock or we present alternative products that i think is one of the benefits of our in house internal creative and content team combined with our ecommerce team is that we are able to identify more smartly where consumers are and and where they are in the shopping journey and what we can put in front of them as an alternative so we tend to see we tend not to see that leakage and yeah as a reminder this business pre mid march and pre the pandemic shutdown here in the us was growing twenty +percent we just grew 29 in in the 3rd quarter now we provided some some outlook on on the 4th quarter so we expect the back half of the year to to return to that twenty growth this is the business that was driving performance and consumer demand as we as we went through that time and and we will continue to do it right now and and we will work hard to make sure we keep consumers engaged while  while we get our in stocks back at the level both in wholesale and our own ddc channels in the way we want it fantastic good luck in the holiday season thanks alex your next question comes from line of alexandria waldes with goldman sachs please proceed with your question good morning thanks so much for taking the question here my 1st question is on e commerce e commerce of course growing very very strongly still in the quarter and you mentioned that that was growth across channels could you talk about the discrepancy in growth between e commerce and physical retail thank you hey alex good morning so yedzie dot com and i may have said this in my prepared remarks yedzie dot com definitely led the way so if i think about the dtc business yedzie dot com was the leader then amazon and then corporate sales and and i am leaving retail out just because of the year over year comparison with new stores does it make the the percent growth relevant so yeti com is still the strongest you know we like what we are seeing across those channels and are really happy with the engagement we are driving with yeti com you know the amazon marketplace is an important business for us we saw i think this is going back to the end of in this q one a slight you know disruption as people were really focused on more essentials but that has come back nicely and is growing very very well but clearly the the standout was yeti com well i mean you can ask you can come back at me and i am going to step away from prioritizing inventory but really if you think about the coming years we really like the yeti dot com business it is the fullest expression of our business it is where we get you know the most information from a customer and being able to interact with the customer so you know if we could wave if i could wave a magic wand i would have everyone go to yeti dot com that being said you know the amazon marketplace is great that is kind of how we think long term is and that goes as far as wholesale too being where the customer wants to access the brand is the most important thing to us it is super tight i appreciate you sharing your thoughts on that maybe one more from me i wonder if you guys have ever considered offering an in home service yeah alex matt i will take that one thanks thanks for the question and and good morning you know we continue to really enjoy the relationship that we built with lows and the partnership and and that is that is as important to us as we think about what a methodical pace role we are going to play it looks like we said that from the very beginning that the the rationale for why we add additional wholesale is that they bring  and a relatively new consumer and a new buying occasion or they they augment support for the rest of our existing wholesale and and i think gloe has continued to do that and been  and been a good partner as we have evolved and and learned together you know this year we were incredibly pleased with our partnership we made some decisions as the year progressed on to moderate our rollout considering the environment and considering our inventory constraints and it gave us an opportunity to really focus on the execution and performance so what we really like is we continue to see the incrementality of that relationship and and we look at it as a piece in the puzzle of our overall wholesale and our overall wholesale is a piece in the puzzle of our overall omni channel so we are  we are pleased with with how that is performing and as we continue to see the incrementality of that relationship we are pleased with the overall performance in our wholesale and our job now is to thoughtfully rebuild the channel inventories so that we continue to address more and more of the consumer demand yeah  you know clearly the the strong revenue numbers the growth of revenue is indicative of you know acceleration of new customer growth and existing customers you know buying more i remember i recall numbers a number of quarters ago you guys were starting to track the purchase behavior or kind of track customers on what they are doing so is there any update on that we have not as you as you pointed out we have not shared the specific numbers it is something that we we continue to get smarter and have better insights to yeah like i mean  comment a little bit earlier that you know we are we are focused on understanding those customer cohorts and how they perform and how they perform differently and as our product portfolio expands what that sequencing of purchases and and what that recurrence of purchase looks like what i can say is interestingly through this year to date as we have seen elevated demand and as channel shifts have  have occurred during different points of shutdown and wholesale is our new to yeti dot com versus existing or repeat purchase on yeti dot com has all lifted and in that ratio between the two has not shifted materially and so we we really like the new customer acquisition that we are seeing and the percent of new customers we are seeing and along with that we like the the returning customer and the repeat purchase rate and and what we are really focused on is you know what is their behavior after that 1st purchase within those 1st thirty days and then those we are paying a lot of attention to it and then below that what does that what does that basket of expansion expansion look like so while we are not reporting the numbers it is something we are paying a lot of attention to it is something we are taking action on and it is something we like the trend that we are seeing and it is it is a big area investment for the business in 2020 and that will continue to be a big area of investment in 2021 that is great and then last question you mentioned i believe the international penetration is at seven of total i believe it was only four you know only a few quarters ago so can you give us some extra depth of color on you know what you think is happening in terms of  rising awareness or what what have you just try and get a sense of the acceleration you are seeing because it seems like that business is now starting to kind of really come into its own that that geography if you will be international and just want to get some color on what you think is starting to really continue to accelerate that that business going that part of the sales geography going forward thank you but what we are we are excited about now is our enthusiasm is being matched by the activity and results and and i say that fully knowing that wholesale or or retail in europe and the uk in australia and in canada until q three was was really disrupted by the pandemic and i would say disrupted in some cases even more than the us wholesale market so what we saw in the quarter was a really strong recovery in our international business and it came back it came back what we liked was we saw strong performance out of our wholesale led by the canadian wholesale which is a market that we have been actively and directly with yeti employees operating in since 2017 but balanced with that wholesale is strong e commerce performance and and i think that is indicative of the rising awareness of the brand yeah i think that things like social media the content we create that type of information has been more and more democratized globally and so the awareness of our brand and the awareness of our products in in many cases in some of the markets we enter internationally leads our official entry or leads the the distribution we have in those markets because social media is such a such a globally democratized and available so we are not rushing out just to taste a short term placement or short term growth we really want the sustainable growth and we are seeing that in canada and australia in particular where we have been operating for three full years and we are seeing the early signs of it in the uk and europe and what we like about the uk and europe in the early days is even with the disruption through the summer in there in the wholesale channel that ecommerce continues to be to be a strong opportunity so thanks very helpful thanks dad thanks righty hi good morning so question on on the operating margin you have obviously had a couple quarters in a row where operating margin has started with the two and it looks like the imputation is that that will continue in the 4th quarter and and it looks like for the full year i guess i would be interested paul and and how 2020 has changed any of your thoughts about the long term sustainable margin of the company and also if there are any any areas where you are concerned you are over earning this year because you pulled back on marketing or or travel or other dynamics and you could kind of dimensionize those for us in the 2nd quarter and the 3rd quarter but even if we go back to the to the 1st quarter and in the whole algorithm of the company of dtc growing faster than wholesale so a lot of that margin expansion is driven by gross margin expansion as we look to the to the future a couple of thoughts the 1st is we expect gross margin with mix shift and cost improvements to continue to expand do not expect it to expand to the level it did this year because of the significant outperformance of dtc and then and as you know just the the law of large numbers as my dtc becomes a bigger percent of the business every incremental one mix gives me less on the mix but we do believe gross margin will continue to benefit from mix shift cost improvements and then i will say we talk very often internally so we delivered value to the consumer and held for the price and we used some of that gross margin expansion to fund that from an over earning in the business i think the most obvious one you called it out as t and e right so we are still working remotely and and not traveling so certainly t and e is down you know we continue and and even though we saw significant leverage on non variable expenses you know we continue to invest in in absolute dollars we continue to spend more in marketing we have resumed hiring so you know we continue to bring great talent into the business and things of that nature so the expense leverage is really about kind of the top line growth but other than t and e you know we are running the business and investing in the business for the future so i do not feel like we are over earning to use your words based on you know cutting back on expenses your next question comes from line of robby omms with bank of america securities please proceed with your question zero thanks guys so you know great quarter actually just two quick questions you you mentioned you know sort of some new drivers of growth to the brand outdoor or you know near home vacations things like that near the beginning of the call i guess not is there any when you get beyond the the inventory constraints and you look out you know the next year or two the are you looking at are there some new wholesale type customers that you guys are thinking about now because of these new drivers of demand for the brand that you maybe were not thinking about a year ago robby yeah i would i would answer that and good morning a couple different ways yeah the the drivers that have become kind of the headline through the through the summer and some of the drivers we mentioned i would say for our brand have been dynamics that we have been experiencing for the last handful of years that that movement towards being active outdoors adventure based vacations yeah know car camping all those dynamics we think what is happened this summer is it is just it is accelerated exposure of a trend that that we were seeing and obviously our benefit our business was was benefiting from strong growth pre pandemic and and as those trends get highlighted and so people try those things we were right in that in that slipstream to to continue to sustain that momentum you know if it were were different and we were zero growth and realized growth because of a trend it would be a different dynamic and that is just not that is not the situation we are in i couple that with because we were we think we were well positioned pre pandemic and in previous trends being highlighted we believe we are going to have a really good year from a wholesale perspective domestically and we think that between the amazon marketplace and yeti dot com we have got good good representation that said as we have said in the past we constantly monitor the wholesale market we look for everything from independent partners who help us identify a certain region or a certain customer group that we may not be accessing all the way up to larger national but is is you know having followed us for a while we are really thoughtful when we bring on a big partner we were thoughtful when we added lows to the to the suite of of wholesale partners we have so we feel good where we are today but we also pay attention to to the market i think internationally is a different a different situation because that is a little more greenfield for us when it comes to to wholesale exposure and so far we have been following a similar playbook to the us which is building strong relevant independent relationships and and identifying regional players we think national players that we think will will represent the brand and in the business well that is that is helpful and then paul just quickly shipping surcharges anything any impact to you guys you see you know for the 4th quarter or next year yes so from a dollar perspective it is all we are seeing you know the surcharges that ups has announced all contemplated in the 4th quarter outlook in in robby what i would say is what we are really focused on and and not to play down the the dollar piece of it it is really the capacity and making sure you know that we secure and we work with ups i think our guys probably talked to if not every day three times a week we have secured our capacity for the 4th quarter and that is really our biggest focus and again not to downplay the dollars making sure they are coming to pick up the trailers is absolutely critical and we have a very good relationship with them and our ops team is very focused on that terrific thanks so much thanks robby your next question comes from line of peter keith with piper sandler please proceed with your question just regarding the the inventory auto stocks at wholesale so it seems like kind of a good news bad news situation remarkably strong sell through but inventory constraint and now you are going into the holiday season this seems like there could be some risk where your wholesale partners might bring in some alternative competitors to to fill in some of those cooler auto stocks what actions can you take in order to prevent that type of a type of event peter i would say a couple things to that one we have great wholesale partnerships and and that very open dialog as we have gone through this and as we have seen challenges to the supply chain you know one of the things that we have worked very closely with our wholesale partners is how do we fill in either with other yeti products or make sure that we are represented as well as we can as we rebuild that space but one of the one of the conversations we have is you know as we rebuild that inventory we want to make sure that we have the right space to merchandise the products the right way in the way that we did pre pandemic and and the way we would expect of all of our whole supply partners as at any point but as we rebuild that inventory and so i would say the conversations have been great we are in full alignment with our partners so we do not see we do not see risk we also do not see risk as far as as i mentioned earlier on the call demand leakage you know we want to continue to drive demand for our product we continue to bring innovation to market we have started previewing our spring products with our wholesale partners and there is a lot of excitement about about what we continue to do with the brand and what we continue to do from an innovation perspective thanks matt i mean  i will ask a next question to you just around the the structure of the guidance so with the the fifteen to sixteen growth it does imply a notable acceleration from q three and we know there is a lot of uncertainty in the economic environment but is there anything identifiable that you can see that would that would cause that slowdown and then maybe on a related note that the eps growth guidance of 31 to 38 is certainly above normal for sort of your your normal mid teens what are the marginal characteristics that are driving that above average eps growth so as we look from where we were three months ago you know the business has certainly performed and it is really about a very strong q three so the the deceleration i i think about it a little bit differently of the back half of the year from where i thought about it three months ago is actually stronger than what i was thinking three months ago you know is we think about the 4th quarter in particular you know a couple of the 1st is you know we are up against our strongest comparison from last year to +23 in last year is 4th quarter you know we talked about the inventory constraints so those that is what kind of shaped our thinking on the current outlook but again as i think of the back half of the year strongly outperforming what we thought the back half of the year was going to be just three months ago from an eps perspective or a margin perspective it is going to be and i am happy to say it much of the savings we are going to see expanding gross margins now we are rolling over as 4th quarter always is our biggest dtc quarter every year so it you know the hurdle certainly gets gets higher but if i think about gross margins i am going to expect some gross margin i am going to expect gross margin expansion from the channel mix shift cost improvements and then tariff tailwind and then if i think about gross margins i am going to expect some gross margin i am going to expect gross margin expansion from the channel mix shift cost improvements and then tariff tailwind i am going to come down the p and l it is going to be a similar story overall of de leveraging on the variable because of the mix shift so really driven by mix shift and then i expect the non variable to be roughly  from a leverage perspective be roughly flatish year over year from a leverage perspective not a dollar obviously the dollars will will increase so that is that is what is driving it operating margin down to you know if you talk about but get down to eps obviously my lower interest both from a and that is to be the last one that i hit the the balance of debt and then because i have a floating floating rate debt as you all know interest rates are just in my favor and as i delever my pricing i go down on the grid of less expensive spreads ok that is all very helpful keep up the good work guys and good luck with the holiday great thanks your final question comes from line of matt carandang with rock capital partners please proceed with your question yeah hey guys thanks for sneaking me in here i just wanted to touch on 2221 again if i could and that has been covered a little bit but i wanted to see did we get any new categories that that add to growth as we look at into 2020 or is it still the existing drinkware and cooler categories and just replenishment into wholesale and then sustained strength in dtc i just wanted to to get your take on that 1st you look for expansion opportunities within our existing products and in our existing product families and and if you look at our history of pacing over the last few years we continue to kind of push the edge of of new product families and i would expect as we go into 2021 that that is going to continue yeah we will want to keep reinvigorating our longest standing product families and introduce introduce new new families and and continue to expand underneath the the permission the yeddi brand and the yeddi consumers have given us to to bring more products to market well we think about cash deployment going forward obviously we are going to see plenty of investment in organic growth we understand that but when we think about sort of return of cash versus m and a and the prioritization there i am just curious to get your thoughts going forward across our omni channel so number one number one is inventory the 2nd one is capex investments and the capex investments fall within a couple different categories that fall within our the continued digitization of the business and our technology investments and they fall on the product side and the product side splits into two things its investment in capacity as we continue to ramp legacy products and its investment in new product development and then the 3rd thing is and we communicate this in the past that we can contemplate strategic m and a you know one of the things that i like to always say is we like the eddie brand a lot we think there is a lot of expansion opportunity underneath the eddie brand but as we look at m and a we look at it across really 22 fronts one r and d investment in technologies or materials that help accelerate our existing product roadmap or strategic acquisition that helps accelerate entry into relevant categories and that that that can i think it could bring customer based expansion it could bring geographic expansion so that is really it is really the way with the way we look at it internally we also feel very fortunate to be sitting here with $235000000 in cash and a highly  coming out of a highly uncertain summer so you know we feel good about the opportunities in front of us to return value to shareholders but 1st and foremost through growth ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to mister matt ranjes for closing remarks thanks everybody for joining us today i just want to reiterate the incredible quarter we had at yeti the demand continues to be strong for the brand we love the receptivity we are seeing to our continued innovation you know the brand was strong and the business was strong before the pandemic so we are looking forward to getting back to business as usual we re thrilled to be sitting here at the end of the 3rd quarter and and looking out at the 4th quarter with  with a business that continues to to perform and deliver i wish everybody is safe and and happy

balance sheet and commitment to our markets and employees i am proud to say that nexstar has kept our employee roster intact and our record quarterly results again reflect our team is commitment to flexibility throughout this time as always our chief financial officer tom carter is on the call with me this morning nexstar is industry leading scale and diversification our solid execution such as our new business strategies and our rapid adoption of cost containment programs at the onset of the pandemic resulted in record 2nd quarter results with all of our cash flow metrics well above consensus expectations the 41 rise in 2nd quarter net revenue reflects growth in total television advertising revenue because we drove year over year increases in same station news television business and strong shares of political spending in our markets as well as the 71 year over year increase in distribution fee re revenues as such despite the economic pressures related to the pandemic nexstar is top line growth in operating and expense management disciplines resulted in a 38seven increase in net income and record 2nd quarter broadcast cashflow adjusted ebitda and free cash flow with those net metrics growing 28 49 and 127 respectively on a year over year basis as the world continues to address the health and economic challenges brought on by the pandemic the strength of our business model and enterprise wide focus on managing operations for free cashflow enabled us to br bring about 21 of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line in the year to date period nexstar is generated approximately $631000000 of free cash flow before one time transaction expenses by way of comparison we generated a total of $521000000 of free cash flow in all of 201 so our growth momentum remained strong even before the upcoming benefit of political spending in the back half of the year reflecting repurchases made in q one we have re we have reduced our share count to approximately 45500000 shares outstanding so 2020 year to date free cash flow per share amounts to about $thirteen86 per share and we remain confident in our unique positioning in this environment to again generate significant free cash flow in the current quarter and again in q four of this year speaking of the full year 2020 it is important to remember that approximately sixty of our annual revenue is expected to be derived from contractual distribution fee and political advertising revenue which is not expected to be materially impacted by the pandemic specifically nexstar has solid visibility in terms of our contractual distribution economics through december of 2022 as we complete to do multi year retention mission consent agreements representing approximately seventy of our subscribers at year end 2019 as well as new long term network affiliation contracts with cbs fox and nbc at the same time nexstar has a strong balance sheet including approximately 665000000 in cash as of june thirty with an access to another 180 $140000000 under our revolving credit facility we continually successfully navigate through the evolving challenges presented by the pandemic based on our core value of serving communities where we operate by delivering leading local news and other critical information and content to viewers whether on air or online in this regard nexstar stations have produced 41 separate town hall meetings addressing state and regional responses to the virus additionally nexstar has has generated over thirty different programs related to re recent civil unrest and race relations in our communities with local news and information while it is never been more essential for americans the pandemic has changed consumers media consumption habits in ways that showcase the inherent strength of local broadcast television our content in nexstar is leading local brands as the most powerful and trusted voice in the country more people are turning into their stations local newscasts than ever before according to nielsen data even as states and localities began to reopen in the 2nd quarter local broadcast television evening news viewership among adults aged eighteen to 34 remained impressively high with year over year increases in average cumulative weekly impressions in april may and june of 151 83 and 89 respectively similarly on the digital front nexstar is websites and mobile apps grew year over year page views by 250 to 1100000000 in april with total monthly monthly users up 133 to 96000000 we continue to generate strong digital audiences throughout the quarter with weekday and weekend page view traffic across our local websites up fifty and sixty respectively during the month of june compared to the prior year additionally in terms of unique users nexstar is digital properties ranked number one in the country in local news number twelve in all of news and information and we are the number 33 site overall domestically in june as measured by comscore as the nation is largest producer of local news programming nexstar is proprietary content provides essential news and information to users and viewers that is unique and relevant to each of the local communities we serve across the united states now more than ever viewers rely on television news to stay informed about everything from the latest pandemic developments the reopening of the economy to the upcoming election with nexstar is market leading stations and sites deep local and national reach and local broadcast record of being the most influential and effective medium for both brands and politicians we expect to see advertisers continuing to allocate increased spending to our broadcast and digital platforms as the threat resolves turning back to some 2nd quarter highlights total television advertising revenue increased eighteenten to 319800000 including political revenue of 21600000 and core advertising revenue of 298200000 while local and national advertisers adapted their media plans during the 2nd quarter we saw sequential month over month improvement in our same station core advertising revenue performance from april to may from may to june and this trend continuing in july notwithstanding marketplace challenges nexstar is local sales initiatives continue to generate healthy levels of new business with 2nd quarter new to television ad revenue rising on both a quarterly sequential and year over year basis in total our sales teams generated $20700000 of 2nd quarter new to television revenues marking an eleventhirty rise over the 1st quarter and a fourfive rise over the comparable 2019 period as i mentioned at the outset of our call our new business strategies ongoing sales training education and deployment of performance focused initiatives combined with our sharing of best practices have proven very effective in our ability to capture ad spend share in both broadcast and digital locally we recorded healthy levels of q two spending by political action committees and from candidates with 2022nd quarter political revenue of 21600000 e exceeding our expectations from early in the quarter despite the cancellation of some primaries both presidential campaigns recently generated record levels of fundraising which bodes well for our upcoming political revenue trajectory as such our full year 2020 expectation for net political revenue in the low 400000000 range remains unchanged recent distribution agreement renewals and the inclusion of wgn america resulted in a 21 i am sorry a 71 rise in 2nd quarter distribution revenue to 536500000 representing nearly 59 of total net revenue 2nd quarter 2020 total digital revenue declined by approximately $9600000 or seventeen reflecting our focus on higher margin profitable operations while digital profitability was up substantially over the comparable comparable prior year period as our website and mobile app engagement also rose significantly total combined 2nd quarter digital and distribution fee revenue of $583200000 rose approximately 57ten over the prior year period and 64 of quarterly revenues up from 57 in the year ago period the year over year increase in 2nd quarter distribution revenue reflects the new agreements reached in the 2nd half of 2019 and a realization of trivial media revenue revenue synergies related to the after acquired clauses in our retransmission consent contracts and as noted the inclusion of wgn america our expectations for net retrans growth remain unchanged for the balance of the year in the mid teens percentage range reflecting new long term network affiliation agreements with cbs fox and nbc completed in the 2nd half of 201 and as a result over eighty of our big four affiliations are contracted through december 31 of 2021 and over seventy of our big four affiliations are contracted through december 31 of 202 with our successful 2019 renewal of retransmission consent agreements representing approximately seventy of our subscriber base with approximately seventeen of the base to be renewed this year our significant net retrans revenue growth in 2020 will complement the strong political growth and spending that we are seeing taking together the affiliation renewals which also include ott agreements our new retrans contracts and sub levels that remain in line with our forecast we have pretty clear visibility for our net retrans revenue growth expectations in 2020 and beyond as we discussed on the last call at the onset of the pandemic we took immediate action to adapt our business to address the economic impact on the use us commercial advertising market we implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings in excess of $40000000 from budgeted 2nd quarter levels looking ahead the 3rd quarter while the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising we are seeing the same pattern of month over month improvement in our pacing data and expect to benefit from significantly increased levels of political ad spending and in fact our july political billing exceeded that of all of q two overall we are encouraged by continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint and by key economic indicators including employment data and consumer spending and at present we are constantly cautiously optimistic about the return of live sports as live news and sports programs continues to generate the strongest le strongest levels of viewership across our all demographics additionally preparations for the september one launch of wgn america as primetime national news cast newsnation which will reach approximately 75000000 households across the country are proceeding on schedule and on budget we are in rehearsals now and my 1st impressions of the product are very positive newsnation will air daily from eight zero pm to eleven zero pm eet and will draw on the local regional and national expertise of nexstar is 5400 journalists and 110 local newsrooms across the country and during the quarter we announced the anchor teams and correspondents for our live three hour primetime national newscasts were already attracting strong interest from leading national advertisers at much higher than normal cost per points for wgn america broadcasts will deliver news reporting that is fact based impactful and unbiased and we are confident that there are more americans than ever before who are seeking just that in addition to the live nightly newscasts newsnation is team of reporters and producers will deliver news 24 hours a day online through newsnation soon to be launched app newsnation now which will create another opportunity for monetization and revenue diversification as always we remain committed to regenerating free cashflow actively managing our capital structure our cost of capital and our liquidity position to provide the financial flexibility to support our business and enhance shareholder returns as we emerge from the pandemic during the ha 1st half of 2020 we allocated approximately 594000000 in cash from operations and investments towards debt reduction opportunistic share repurchases and cash dividends additionally as i mentioned before nexstar continues to maintain a strong balance sheet including 665000000 cash on hand at june thirty with access to additional 140000000 under our revolving credit facility on the return of capital front in late june we declared our 3rd quarterly cash dividend at a the new ¢56 per share level which was 24 ahead of last year is payoff with our 191 year to date free cash flow growth our contractual distribution fee revenues our food network distributions are historically low libor rates which have reduced our interest expense and what is projected to be the biggest presidential election cycle in the company is history we remain confident in our positioning to be free cashflow positive in every quarter of 202 and we continue to expect nexstar is net leverage to decline to approximately four times by year end in summary while the pandemic has presented challenges for almost every industry nexstar is leading local platforms are well positioned to continue building the top line maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet over time our disciplines in these areas have strengthened the resiliency of our business and our business model and created an unrivaled local marketing platform while supporting increasing growing and growing returns for our shareholders with that said let me turn the call over to tom carter for our financial review and update tom thanks perry and good morning everybody as outlined in this morning is press release the actual results for the three and six months ended june thirty 2020 reflect the company is legacy nexstar operations res and results from tribune media stations which were acquired on september 19th 2012nd quarter 2020 revenue from wgn america also acquired in the tribune transaction is included in core television advertising revenue and distribution fee revenue contribution from nexstar is 31thirty ownership stake in television food network and other investments acquired in this room tribune transaction is included in the full income segment under income or loss on equity investments net and in the cash flow statement under distributions from equity investments the comparable three and six month period ended june thirty 2019 reflects legacy nexstar operations during that period all actual results also reflect the impact of one time transaction expenses incurred in the quarters both in the quarters and the six month period ending june thirty 2020 and june thirty 201 without a with a review of nexstar is q two income statement and balance sheet data after which i will provide an update on our capital structure and some points of guidance on a combined company basis and pro forma for the divested station 2nd quarter same station net total revenue was down six due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately 35 reflecting a sharp decline in april due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month improvement from april to may from may to june change station distribution fe fee revenue was up 28 and continuing digital revenues were down eighteentwo reflecting local agency services revenue growth of approximately eight while station website revenue was down approximately thirty due to software lo local customer buying trends related to the pandemic to offset the anticipated impact of covid nineteen on commercial advertising revenue late in the 1st quarter nexstar implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings in excess of $40000000 from budgeted levels in the 2nd quarter of 2022nd quarter station direct operating expenses net operating expense were approximately 414000000 up from 292000000 in the prior year primarily reflecting the full quarter of incremental expenses associated with the tribune operations and the budgeted growth in network affiliation expense as a partial offset to our rising distribution revenue 2nd quarter station sg a was approximately 158000000 inclusive of the tribune operations change station pro forma fixed expenses excluding programming expenses were down eighteen over the year over year period due to synergies related from the tribune acquisition and the previously mentioned expense reduction activities in response to the pandemic corporate expenses were 35000000 inclusive of 13000000 of stock based comp and approximately 5400000 in one time transaction expenses when excluding non cash comp and one time transaction expenses recurring corporate expenses were approximately 17000000 which came in better than the guidance we had provided in the 1st quarter call of approximately 21500000 by the end of april the vast majority of the initial operating synergies of the transa tribune transaction have been realized 2nd quarter operating cash taxes were approximately $6000000 substantially lower than our guidance of 45 to 50000000 due to a timing difference that forty to forty to $45000000 variance will now be paid into three ongoing capex and transaction capex total $40000000000 spectrum repack capex total 13000000 and received approximately 26000000 of reimbursements from the fcc during the quarter as a reminder we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all spectrum related capex over the course of the year 2nd quarter total interest expense amounted to 82000000 up from 51000000 in the same period in 2019 while cash interest expense was 78000000 compared to 49000000 last year with increases due to obviously the increased debt associated with the tribune funding partially offset by lower interest rates 2nd quarter broadcast cashflow of 291000000 as well as the adjusted ebitda 298000000 and free cash flow of 200000000 all pre transaction expenses exceeded consensus expectations and primarily reflect the realization of synergies and growth related to the tribune transaction distribution free distribution agreement renewals executed in the 2nd half of the year ended with per tax cash taxes as i mentioned before adjusted ebitda on free cash flow reflect approximately $27000000 in distributions from equity investments related to our 31 ownership in the tv food network as a reminder we received cash di distributions from tv food on a quarterly basis with the largest payment recorded during the 1st quarter of each year for the 3rd quarter of 2020 we anticipate recording approximately $12000000 in tv food network distributions we expect cost savings in q three to approximately $25000000 relative to the originally budgeted levels as variable costs and discretionary expenditures are prudently brought back online with the expected strengthening of the economy and the broadcasting advertising environment for the 3rd quarter we project recurring cash corporate overhead exclusive of stock comp and transactions costs will be approximately $23000000 and we will easily meet our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance of approximately $120000000 for the entire year non cash comp is projected to be approximately $13000000 for the quarter and $48000000 for the full year transaction expenses will approximately $3000000 for the quarter and will decline for the remainder part of the year 3rd quarter operating cash taxes are now estimated to be approximately $150000000 and operating cash taxes for the entire year will now come in at approximately $250000000 in total non operating cash taxes associated with the gains on the asset sales and legal settlements in q three will be approximately 83000003rd quarter capex should come in at approximately 40000000 and we are still expecting approximately $160000000 for the entire year we are proceeding on budget with our investment related to the launch of wgn america is primetime national newscast newsnation on september 1st and prioritize capital expenditures to main to maintain maximum flexibility in the current environment meaning the timing of certain capex can be delayed until later quarters if required finally we expect nexstar is cash interest expense to approximately 78000000 for the 3rd quarter and 325 to 350000000 for the full year reflecting interest expense savings related to the decline in libor rates turning to the balance sheet nexstar is outstanding debt at june thirty was approximately $8000000000 and consisted of 5400000000 of term loans and two series of senior subordinated notes one at approximately $900000000 and the other at $1800000000 with maturities of 2024 and 2027 respectively total net debt approximated 7400000000 at june thirty compared to 7600000000 at march 31st and 8300000000 at twelve 31 201 net debt for 1st lien covenant purposes is 5200000000 with net debt net cash limited to a $200000000 amount our 1st lien covenant ratio at june 30th was approximately threeeleven compared to three52 at year end which is well below our 1st lien covenant for the quarter as a reminder our 1st lien covenant limits cash net income was approximately 200000000 our total net leverage at quarter end was four47 compared to fiveeighteen at year end and as a reminder nexstar is only covenant is our 1st lien debt covenant which is the formation for the quarter at the onset of the pandemic nexstar took immediate action to adapt our business to the en current environment and to preserve liquidity in order to best position the company for longterm success as we return to normalized operations in this regard we continue to prioritize cash retention and a add approximately 231000000 to our 1st quarter cash position for a total cash balance of 665000000 at june 30th with an additional $140000000 available under our revolving credit facility at the same time during the 2nd quarter we returned approximately $25000000 to shareholders through the quarterly cash dividend and made $13000000 in payments on our debt during the 1st half of 2020 we have accurately managed our capital stru structure cost of capital and liquidity position to support our business in this challenging environment while we while enhancing shareholder returns year to date we have allocated approximately 594000000 towards shareholder value creating initiatives including $473000000 in debt reduction $51000000 in dividend payments and $73000000 in share repurchase in the near time while preliminary data suggests ongoing sequential improvement in economic trends and the commercial advertising environment we continue to focus on cash preservation in order to optimize our financial flexibility as we move through the 3rd quarter looking ahead with continued double digit year over year growth in distribution revenue and what are expected to be robust spending levels related to the upcoming presidential election which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus we have excellent visibility on over fifty of our annual revenue in 202 as such we expect to be free cash flow positive in the 3rd and 4th quarters in addition to continuing our dividend payments we remain committed to allocating the vast majority of our free cashflow towards leverage adoption and confident in reaching our target level for the reduced level of having that leverage to four times by year end 202 nexstar has already made significant progress on our leverage reduction plan and we enjoy a strong cash position with additional capacity under our revolver in addition the reduction of in interest rate expense related to the favorable libor rates operating expense savings on our capital allocation prioritization will also serve as well in the 2nd half of 202 as a result we are confident in our liquidity position and ability to service our debt through these challenging times and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues as we move through the year in summary despite the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic our scale leadership flexibility synergy realization and operation plans are generating results our capital structure is in great shape from a cost of capital maturity and ability to quickly address the leverage in addition our service to our local communities and local and national advertisers has never been stronger our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth as well as consistency and visibility to our results and we remain confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value in the near term and on the other side of the pandemic that concludes the financial review for the call i will now turn it over back to perry for some closing remarks before q a thanks very much tom in summary i hope that our comments today reinforced the fact that we remain confident in the strength and the resilience of nexstar is scale and diversified business model nexstar is leading local platform is well positioned to withstand this environment through the several factors including our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs the continued growth of our distribution revenue stream and what are projected to be record levels of political spending here in 202 in terms of capital allocation we believe that our free cash flow combined with the active management of both our cost structure and our balance sheet will provide us with financial flexibility to continue supporting our shareholder value creation initiatives as a result nexstar is well positioned to fully participate in the recovery and we remain highly confident in our core strategies in terms of serving the communities where we have operations and building the top line maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet this focus combined with our time proven operating strategies is enabling nexstar to overcome the near term challenges and extend our longterm record of growth and shareholder value creation we look forward very much to catching up with you with another positive report just after election day and on behalf of the entire nexstar nation our board and our management team thank you for your continued interest support and for joining us today so now let us open the call to q a to address your specific areas of interest operator yes and thank you now and if you would like to ask a question please by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to again that is star one if you would like to ask any question and we will take our 1st question from john kennedy with wolf research thank you perry i have two for you one is you talked about local news and viewership what are you seeing in terms of advertisers and news in terms of you so spoke to and then i guess the sub levels in line with expectations is it really true that there has been no noticeable impacts from the pandemic or is that well as as it relates to local news you know through the 1st six months of this year 51 of our total advertising revenue came from local news and that is up over the prior years cumulative totals which indicates obviously advertisers you know are putting their money in into that product in increasing with increasing frequency obviously the the demand is where the audience is and that is where the audience is for us right now and so we do see continued read through and and we are hopeful that the audience gains at least some of them will be sticky when you know and i hate to use this term when when the new normal settles in as to whatever that is but so far through this normal people in all age groups are tuning to our local news broadcast in in increasing numbers i will say that i mean obviously mvpds have reported sub counts and attrition for the quarter you know those are are factored into into our projections and analysis and and our our retrans revenue is again we we forecast attrition into our budgeting process and and we are we are at budget on retrans revenue and our projections through through the end of this year so we have seen no significant decline beyond what we had forecasted so we think it is it is business as usual from a distribution revenue standpoint thank you very much our next question will come from that steven call with wells fargo thanks i am wondering if you could talk a little bit about your reverse compensation agreements as the declines are accelerating i was wondering if that is changing the tone of those at all and also does it make you think about moving from like a per sub basis sorry to a per sub basis from a fixed programming fee where you can and and relatedly we have more broadcast content going direct to consumer like cbs all access and peacock so how do you think about monetizing those households that may not be subscribing through the traditional process sure you know i would say you know the the current relationships with the networks are a mix of you know fixed fee and and percentages of of distribution revenue so there are some that that are fungible and others that that are not and those conversations are continuing what is in the best interest of of both parties to get a deal done so there is some some hedge there at this and we are you know we are not ready to call the ball as to what the the most preferable preferable term is there based on our negotiating ability as it relates to cbs all access we participate in that we are paid to be a part of that service and our local stream is a part of that offering peacock we are not affiliate local news affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast offering and we are not sure if at any point they will be but you know we do have this thing called over the air which you know we we reach you know a a much larger universe potentially than the wired and pay cable universe already where you know sixteen of our viewers already use that as their as their reception device without the aid of a paywall and and that is available to to those who want to quote three months that way if you will and the the good news about that is there are far few competitors for eyeballs in a in an over the air world than there are in a 500 plus cable or satellite universe so a again we we we are in flux we have a lot of our agreements nailed down through 21 and two we do have some that will be up end of this year and early next year and and that is where those conversations will will center around what is the best type of agreement for for both companies to enter into great and then just one on political four years ago we kind of got a head take at the last minute from the trump campaign in terms of not spending what was expected i do not think any of us expect that to happen this time but when do you feel comfortable that there is not going to be any negative surprises on the political spending side zero i am pretty comfortable in that right now i mean look at the amount of money that both camps have raised that the attendance packs and special interest groups have raised supporting those candidates as well as down down valid candidates you know there are no guarantees in this business but as close to a guarantee as i will make you is there will be no negative surprise on political advertising that is a pretty good guarantee thank you well and i will take our next question from zach silver with okay great thanks for hearing the question the 1st one is just if you can quantify the sequential improvement for core in july versus a total of q two twenty or even the pro forma year over year change so far in july and then more broadly and i think it is a little bit related to steven is question you know the narrative out there has been that the macro environment and growth in streaming has is going to accelerate the shift of ad dollars from linear tv to connected tv and streaming can you talk about how well positioned you are to address that if that narrative does turn out to play out tom i let you addressed the how how linear you want to get on on guidance obviously we saw a substantial sequential improvement in core ad trends in july versus not only june but the entire quarter tom i do not know if you want to add any more details for that but i will let you speak to that sure well i think what i will say about july is obviously july was substantially better than the 2nd quarter as a whole and july was better than the last month of the 2nd quarter so sequentially things have gotten better and that trend continues into early q three got it as it relates to traditional streaming services you know there a at some point there becomes ki kind of a sameness to them and and you know it is it is all about the content if you have the content that people want they will find a way to consume you whether that is over the year or whether that is through a pay service or through a streaming service that we are paid to be on and without our services you have an inferior offering to the viewing public it is obviously demonstrated that local news is a product that people want and are willing to pay for and so i think we will just stand by that you know it is it is a lot less noisy at the operating level than it is perhaps at the investor level about these streaming services you know is it a fragmenting universe but are they just taking from a from a wire you know from a from a a traditional pay tv universe into a virtual pay tv universe and if so and we are on both sides of that transaction it is not you know it is not nearly the the noise that that it appears to be in the investment community so we are somewhat sanguine about it you know we are we we have a product that people want we are the largest producer of it in the country it is called local news and and and we believe that product will stand the test of time as it has for the last forty years test of time yeah i think that makes sense and when we are if if i could does the this is i guess for tom does the target leverage ratio for this year contemplate any buybacks in the 2nd half and can you remind us of where we are in resuming a repurchase program thanks it does i will not say how much of it is allocated to stock repurchases the way we think we we have an authorization left from the board we are currently not buying stock but i would anticipate that to get revisited here in the not too distant future the way we think about it is really starting on labor day and and quite honestly that is probably not doing service to the fact that it is fairly mentioned july political revenue was very strong and we think august will be as well we are rapidly transitioning out of this being a story during the pandemic just about poor advertising revenue and what is happening there the the other leg two legs to the stool from our perspective distribution revenue has been strong continues to be strong as perry mentioned we are on budget for the year we are on budget for the 2nd we were on we were actually above budget for the 2nd quarter we are on budget for the 3rd quarter with regards to retransmission revenues and then the 3rd le leg of the stool is political and that is really going that candle is going to get lit here right around labor day and run really hard for the two months of september october and the 1st week of november so the free cash flow of the company will continue to go along nicely and then get turbocharged by free cash flow from political beginning around labor day as i have said to other people i fully expect our our capital allocation attitude to change from playing defense to playing offense sometime right around labor day we are not there yet but i can see there from here and when that happens then i would imagine we would not sit here with an unnatural $600000000 of cash on our balance sheet we deploy that by actually repaying debt and looking at stock repurchases but that is a multi variable equation tell me what the stock is around that time and i will tell you what our appetite is right is that responsive zach yeah that is helpful thank you both i just want to add to tom is comment about political view most folks woke up this morning reading about the you know biden is buy that he is placing starting on september 1st in fifteen states well we we operate substantial operations in twelve of those fifteen states so just to point out that you know political will reach a crescendo around labor day that will continue on through the 1st week of november and and again with july results being above all of 2nd quarter for political you know that is a pretty good pretty good measure i think of of what is yet to come and so we remain competent in our political guidance and as that story continues to prove then i think you will see tom exercise more optionality around our cash forward that currently exists on the balance sheet got it thanks perry well now we have a question aaron watts with deutsche bank hi guys thanks for having me on a couple of questions on the ad environment i gu i guess 1st there has been some fits and starts in terms of covid cases in pockets of the country what behavior in the market that have been affected by that and i and i guess on a related note in terms of categories just given the importance of the auto category anything you can give us in terms of how that rebound i is shaping up and what you are expecting from auto in the next couple months yeah auto has rebounded you know we are seeing better better pacing and better results in q three than we did in q two when dealers were shut down we are certain of the oems move money around from market to market based on where they have cars and that is primarily affected some of the foreign name plates but on the whole i think the our expectations for auto are that it will be less down sequentially going forward as will most of core advertising as it related to covid i did not know if you meant how it affected the company or or what what we are seeing in our markets but i can give you a little color on both we have had 145 confirmed cases in the company since the beginning of the pandemic remarkably out of a workforce of about 13000 that that is you know that our people that are out in the community we have only had one hospitalization and that person has fully recovered about sixty of our employees are working from the facility to which they are assigned we have another twenty that are reporting to work but not necessarily in the facility reporters meeting their crews in the field to go to their 1st assignment and things of that sort and we have another twenty that are that are are working remotely and you know i used the example with our board that you know everybody in topeka is reporting to work however nobody is populating our new york offices because of the the public transportation requirements and and they do not feel safe and there is certainly no mandate to do that and and so that is kind of a proxy for the country you know we keep tabs by every market as to you know various stages of reopening i would say that all of our markets have have some degree of reopening some more than others there have been some pauses in california in texas and others on on further reopening areas have been rolled back you know bars and and restaurants are not necessarily big advertising categories with us to begin with hospitality continues to be a category where we see no spend to speak of there is some interest state tourism ads that are going on like if you are in texas come to arkansas and vice versa in oklahoma we have we are seeing some of that but hospitality for us is a sub two category that you know i is not materially driving our our top line so aaron i do not know if that is the kind of flavor you are looking for but i am happy to answer any more specific follow up no that is cool one last one for me and i i appreciate the time again you you spoke to the importance of local news and the ad revenues that come in attest to that to the overall revenue pie if if we are thinking about the potential that maybe nfl football is delayed or college football does not happen in the fall how do we think about the flow through of that potential and what it could mean to your revenue pie sure i am i am glad you asked that it it is interesting at the local station level which is where we live all sports comprises about ten of our advertising revenue and and of that the nfl comprises about sixty of that ten so it lets just in real round numbers say that ad revenue support is half of our revenue and nfl is six of ten of that so we are talking about three points of revenue so from an advertising perspective because of the limited avails that the local stations get in in all of local sports or all of televised sports that is not local you know it it is it is not that big of a contributor but obviously it has an outsized effect on viewership on promotional ability and i would say on on the national psyche and on on people is morale obviously distributors are are very interested in in live sports because they know live sports and live news drive viewership but from a pure financial advertising point of view it is it is not all that material to our our top or bottom line okay perfect that is exactly what i was looking for very well done thank you our next question will be from brian with deutsche bank hi i had two questions 1st wondering if you could give us some color on what you are seeing in terms of subscriber declines in your markets two is how they compare to the overall industry and any color on advertising and distributor reception to newsnation and any expectations for when you might see you know some incremental revenue lift from newsnation thanks tom i will let perry i yeah subscriber and then i will talk about gm how is that sure i would say our experience with subscribers is not materially different than that of the the mvpds obviously we are still getting an uplift from the virtual mvpd so that the the traditional mvpd subscriber loss is somewhat recouped but certainly not all are recouped by by the the virtual mvpds and as perry had mentioned obviously we factor in in our budgeting process and in our guidance process you know an attrition rate for subscribers and a a unit rate for our for our revenue and as we mentioned that was basically in line for the 2nd quarter and early returns for the 3rd quarter are consistent with that expectation so not getting into specific subscriber decline numbers et cetera i would say that we we see and feel the same thing that the you know the the distributors do it is just that our you know our economics are a little bit different because we have got you know rate that helps us offset that but it is consistent with our expectations as it relates to wgn america we have had and you know dana zimmer and her team have been out presenting wgn america to every mvpd with which we already do business and also those that do not carry wgn wgn america and that is primarily in legacy nexstar markets and and we have an opportunity with renewals between now and the end of the year for an incremental approximately 200 to 250000 subs that could add wgn america now these are smaller systems again where nexstar has a relationship but there was no tribune relationship that would have included wgn america so there was upside there and and i would say that the reception from distributors has been positive particularly from those who have existing contracts and realize there is going to be additional value add for no additional costs du during the term of the the current agreement we are distributed on at t now as the the only virtual mvpd syst service that is offering wgn america we are efforting to to get distribution at the launch or or shortly thereafter on other ott services and that will be a value add where wgn america is not currently distributed but the reception for both the advertising community and the distribution community has been positive because we are investing in a product that will add value to their businesses as well great thanks thanks perry thanks tom we will take our next question from dan with benchmark thanks good morning slim pickings left here after the strong points and all the questions but i guess i will ask you one follow up to the prior perry i do not know if you are willing to sort of you know good color on on sub carriage incremental opportunity is there any way for us to think about sort of timing and higher thinking about the newsnation impact itself relative to either advertising or or i guess ancillary with that your comment on carriage we know it is going to be self funding obviously you have plans to kind of expand it so just any help kind of framing your thoughts on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity and then separately you know obviously there has been a lot of noise lately in the digital world facebook twitter ad boycotts all of that fun stuff you guys are the largest you guys have a pretty big network effect and a pretty strong digital portfolio yourselves is there any accrued benefits you guys or do you think that stays mostly in the digital bucket thanks i will speak 1st to wgn america the we we have i am very impressed with the job that dave rotem and his sales team have done in assembling advertisers for for the premiere premiere week of wgn america is newsnation blue chip names and and at cost per points that are in excess of i am sorry i should say cost per 1000s that are in excess of fifty greater than what standard programming was generating al alone so that is a very positive initial indication we are trying to rework some of the existing buys into the newsnation primetime offering and and so what we could really use is you know an upfront or a 4th quarter scatter market to break but all of that said we do anticipate an incremental let us call it low eight figure revenue contribution to wgn is ad revenue in the four months of the of the end of this year and again given the size and scope of the operation that would not be deemed to be material but we do even in these conditions expect you know a low a low eight figure uplift in in gross revenue there and and and distribution that will mostly come at the end of the year so it will impact 2021 more than this year there have been some incremental deals done already that will launch wgn america you know between now and the end of the year but i would say the vast majority of that impact would be felt in in in 202 and again you are talking a potential uplift of you know a quarter of a 1000000 subscribers on you know nielsen reported i think 75000000 subscriber base so even that is incremental but it but it is all incremental and that is what we are going to do is drive the incremental growth out of the assets that we own and and then the thoughts on either facebook twitter as it relates to core political if that stays in the digital bucket or if you could pick some of that up yeah li listen i i think the most direct transfer could be in political if people you know if certain platforms are refusing those ads that money has to go somewhere and you know with without conventions to fund and without rallies to fund the the the one way to reach people is through broadcast television i think we are seeing an evidence of that right now so i think that would be probably the the direct transfer you know with all the boycotts and all of that i i do not think we have seen a a substantial decline in in in digital revenue performance on those platforms so at this point the damage is more reputational than financial and we will see you know how deep the government wants to get involved in taking a look at potent potentially regulating these companies more symmetrically with the way we are regulated but at this point i i i think the financial transfer outside of political to the best of our knowledge is is minimal got it super helpful thanks for the color in the next quarter thanks our next question will come from greg harbor with harbor research partners yes good morning thank you few questions last quarter on your on your conference call i believe you guys said your retrans subs were down 44five year over year as you guys may know sinclair on the whole right before yours said their 2nd quarter subs were down about seven clean up the benefits in the 1st side should i assume that you guys were down roughly about seven for the 2nd quarter for yourself is that reasonable slightly worse than the 1st quarter no no so i assume it is a so it is a little bit better than that then or can you just help me understand your i w i w i would say it is more consistent with the 2nd quarter the 2nd quarter yeah so you mean more consistent with the 1st quarter down 44fifty i am sorry with with with what we announced the 1st quarter you are right 1st quarter so so so but no i would not say it is down four greg i am not going to give the exact number i have already said that it is not down seven but it is closer to the previous quarter is results okay i appreciate that can you just help us your tv advertising pacings for the month of august would you say that those are tracking better than rated for the core advertising or that is tracking better than than what you th or or what july turned out to be i think it is a little we had very you know few days in august here i am i am thinking you know it is a little too early to be making any comments with regard to that okay can you help us and maybe just i am trying to understand then what your sort of budgeting or thinking that the rate of decline for your core advertising could be down in the 3rd quarter i think maybe i think that is why we are not that is why we are not giving guidance right i do i it is going to be down again well tell us what july was how much july was down if you would i think i told you it was down less again i am not going to give specific numbers but it july was down less than june and june was obviously if it is just math if the entire quarter was down 35 and every quar every month within the 2nd quarter got better then clearly june was down less than 35 and july was down less than june that is kind of the extent of the forward looking guidance that we are going to give as it relates to specific advertising revenue okay maybe let me ask another question then in this on this virus situation that is going out there in the states where the virus cases have gotten dramatically worse here in the last several weeks have you guys seen a material change in the core tv advertising in those markets has there been any significant change where you can talk talk about that no and a and again you know cases in texas have gone to i mean you know you you have to we do not operate just in eleven area that you are in that you might be hearing that news from right so you have got to look across 114 markets and look at you know those states and you know cases might be reported to be up thirty which could be 100 cases in a in a state i mean you have got to put all of these numbers into context but i would say no the evidence is in you know in in our results in july and our pacing in august and our pacing in september all substantially better than where we exited 2nd quarter and then we performed in 2nd quarter so you know the proof is in the numbers as tom says it is just math but you know we have not seen any and i think i just said this you know hospitality continues to be down auto is improving we do not get a lot of money from restaurants unless it is qsr and they are making mints through their drive through so you know things are we are seeing steadily imp steady improvements and even we are you know pausing and opening is better than not being open at all and that is that is kind of our worst case scenario in some of our markets and and others we do not have that you know this morning we are dealing with the aftermath of storms up the east coast from the carolinas into virginia and up into pennsylvania and new york and flooding and those kinds of things and those are going to be more you know temporary disruptors to businesses until they they can reopen them then the pandemic and so it is it is situational and we deal in 38 states across the country and you have got to add it all together but there is you know nothing other than business as usual is the way we deal with things and i think the results speak for themselves and my last question guys on on the cost front you guys talked about pro forma cost in the 2nd quarter down eighteen can you give us a little bit more to how we should we think about your costs trends for the 3rd quarter i know you gave a figure there versus your budget for the the 3rd quarter in december one for the 2nd quarter but just what sort of costs if you can help help us a little bit think about that that may not repeat the cost savings in the 3rd quarter you benefit from in the 2nd thank you i really do not understand the question other than the fact that obviously we had guided to $40000000 in cost takeouts in the 2nd quarter which we believe you know which we over performed on that same number for the 3rd quarter is 25000000 as we obviously some of those are variable costs as advertising starts to return those costs go up some of them were discretionary that we will add back in we will travel more in the 3rd quarter than we did in the 2nd quarter we basically could not have traveled any less in the 2nd quarter than we did so some of the discretionary costs will get added back in but that will be more than offset by higher advertising revenues in the 2nd quarter but specifically as it relates to you know if you are looking year over year the majority of the synergies taken out of the tribune transaction have occurred so that will not change materially sequentially q two q three over q two and you will have some added expense coming back in but that is the ex the extent of some of the the pushes and the pulls on expenses if you you answered that well thank you i appreciate that guys and i will take our next question from john with jk media i hope you can hear me like a lot of people in the neighborhood two quickies tom i think the 24 bonds were called about two days ago and i heard nothing does that mean that it is likely to be closed well again john i think that is consistent with our message that you know in the next thirty to 45 days i think we will have a better feel on actual political revenue coming in you know labor day and obviously same with another month of core and we will be able to start making more aggressive decisions with regard to capital allocation in that you know obviously in the last 120 days and probably the next thirty days we are still going to continue to take a pretty conservative view on that but hopefully be able to flip the switch and become a little bit more aggressive in the in the near term secondly did i hear correctly that you are on track for a mid teens net retrans net retrans growth this year and you mentioned that the growth the growth retrans is up high 20s pro forma did i hear that correctly gross high 20s net mid teens so far this year our our retrans revenue growth has exceeded twenty that is correct we have budgeted for i think it was 28 yeah mid teens yes well 28 in the 2nd quarter that is right i forget what exactly the 1st quarter is we budgeted for mid teens growth in net retrans for the entire year but so far we have exceeded that okay so net the net margins are down you know more than a little bit for this year is that correct no i i would say that they are actually up a little bit because we are we have included a fair amount of per viewing subscribers that are not big four affiliates where our net retrans okay margin you know is existentially an excess of fifty got it thank you very much and we will now take our next question from jim gauss with barrington research thanks during the early days of the pandemic there seemed to be a surge in or a proven increase at least in usage and even sampling of broadcast and other video in categories that did not take that did not tend to can be requested if you would like to handle this request please press star zero again i am not sure what happened there so but i was wondering if any of that has proven sustainable or your request has been canceled if you would like to cancel this request please press star zero again i am sorry man you heard go ahead jim i think somebody is trying to either record or exit the call okay sorry but anyway i was wondering if any of the increased usage and sampling has proven sustainable or has has it mostly dissipated and did any of that play a role in your retrans negotiations during that period we had precious few retrans negotiations done in the 1st half of the year we had one top ten that we were you know we are pleased with the results on i would say you know in my in my comments earlier i did report that you know our our viewership and i i highlighted the eighteen to 34 demographic you know obviously it was up in april 151 83 in may and 89 in june over the prior year our digital page views which were in excess of 2300000000 for the quarter were 1100000000 in april that was up 133 and then in the month of june just by comparison our local websites were up sixty compared to the prior year so you know there is there is some covid fatigue i think but i also think there is increased interest in local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news with the diminution of newspaper and radio local coverage and content so you know we do think that that there is stickiness to this you know the long tail will determine how much but but people continue to turn to our newscasts and record numbers and it is amazing you know just ktla in los angeles and wgn in chicago independent stations by and large by producing copious amounts of local news are ranking number one in all day parts beating all of the network 00 is in in virtually every newscast and that just speaks to the power of localism that you are not dependent on network lead in or lead out to to generate your audience you are doing it on your own and and we are particularly gratified by by that kind of execution producing those kinds of results okay and one last thing the i was wondering about the promotion efforts to create visibility for newsnation as that is you know coming to the floor and also it it seems like cnn tended to fill a similar similar role to that which you are targeting where they tended to be unbiased or maybe it is a little less so these days and it during in that era it would tend to be the place to go when something as an event occurred but it to some of the other news more appointed newscasts were politically would sort of gather the their base in more normal times so i am wondering if if there is a way for you to position yourself to you know sort of gather at least that role and maybe you know maybe have something more sustainable and if this proves successful do you think you would broaden it beyond the three hour original timeframe well thanks jim there there is a lot in there to unpack i will i will try and do my best with it here you know obviously you know that is how cnn started i do not think anyone listening to this call thinks cnn is in that same place today from an unbiased political lean we as as i have said before we have a staff of rhetoricians and two full time staff that do nothing but check scripts and reporting for unconscious bias and bias in our writing and and we have had very spirited discussions about that even in in the rehearsals you know we we we do think we will be that place to go for news that does not make a you know 22 minute news hole in a network evening news broadcast or much news on the the opinion based you know talk networks you know for example last night in our rehearsals we did a story on the 1st woman police chief in colorado springs and that is not a story you would see every place else but again we have got our we have got the country divided up into six zones and we have zone producers and their their job is to know exactly what is going on in those zones in all of those newsrooms and what might be of interest to a national audience in addition to the 150 people we hired in chicago correspondents that are also based in miami new york dallas los angeles and dc that report exclusively for the network as well as all the behind the scenes production folks that that that we think we can give a a more representative view of america than perhaps what is seen inside the new york dc beltway so we think there is a purpose for that and there is a reason for that and the acceptance of that concept now is has been very enthusiastic it is now just on us to deliver as it relates to promotion we have secured something that none of the other networks news networks i think are able to compete with and that is to harness the power of 196 television stations across the nexstar nation to promote this newscast on a day to day specific basis beginning later this month and if you look at the annualized promotion value that the stations will be contributing on a dedicated basis it is something approaching a $100000000 we are layering on top of that on an annualized basis approximately $20000000 of outside promotion expense which primarily goes for advertising on other cable networks because we are just a a channel change away at that point on national and syndicated radio we are also you know investing heavily in social media not only because of the app but to try and drive a younger demographic to an alternative newscast and so we we think our promotion spending you know all taken together you know a nine figure amount of both cash and in in kind contributions for the company are are another asset that will will hopefully drive success for this this effort and again it is you know it is a counter programming opportunity in prime time and we are going to do our best to succeed there obviously we if we are successful we would look at other day parts but we are taking very much of a crawl walk run approach to this we want to get it right and and you know we will grow as fast as our success would allow us to grow so i think i i would leave it at that but you know we are we are very excited about the prospect of of introducing an alternative in prime time to entertainment sports and opinion programming and that the product will will reach a will will will strike a chord and and resonate with the audience and then you know audience growth and advertiser growth will continue so tune in it it launches on september 1st thanks well and that does conclude our question and answer session for today i would like to turn the conference back over to mister sook for any additional or

commitment to flexibility throughout this time as always our chief financial officer tom carter is on the call with me this morning nextera is industry leading in scale and diversification and our solid financial position allows us to continue to invest in our business and our employees the rapid adoption of cost containment programs at the onset of the pandemic resulted in record 2nd quarter results with all of our cash flow metrics well above consensus expectations the 41 rise in 2nd quarter net revenue reflects growth in total television advertising revenue as we drive year over year increases in the same station new television business and strong shares of political spending in our markets as well as the 71 year over year increase in political spending we are confident in our ability to deliver continued growth and strong financial performance in the future despite the economic pressures related to the pandemic our top line growth and expense management disciplines resulted in a 38seven increase in net income and record 2nd quarter broadcast cash flow adjusted ebitda and free cash flow with those net metrics growing 28 49 and 112seven respectively on a year over year basis as the world continues to address the health crisis we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong financial results and continue to drive growth the challenges brought on by the pandemic the strength of our business model and enterprise wide focus on managing operations for free cash flow enabled us to bring about 21 of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line in the year to date period next there has generated approximately $631000000 of free cash flow before one time transaction expenses by way of comparison we generated a total of $521000000 of free cash flow in all of nineteen strong momentum remains even before the upcoming benefit of political spending in the back half of the year reflecting re purchases made in q one we have reduced our share count to approximately 45500000 shares outstanding so 2020 year to date free cash flow per share amounts to about $thirteen86 per share and we remain confident in our unique positioning in this environment to again generate significant free cash flow in the current quarter and again in q four of this year speaking of the full year 2020 it is important to remember that approximately sixty of our annual revenue is expected to be derived from contractual distribution fee and political advertising revenue which is not expected to be materially impacted by the pandemic specifically next year we have solid visibility in terms of our contractual distribution economics through december of 2022 as we completed do multi year retainer mission consent agreements representing approximately seventy of our subscribers at year end as well as new long term network affiliation contracts with cbs fox and nbc at the same time next era has a strong balance sheet including approximately 655000000 in cash as of june 30th with access to another $180000000 or $140000000 under our revolving credit facility we continually successfully navigate through the evolving challenges presented by the pandemic based on our core value of serving communities where we operate with local news and information while it is never been more essential for americans the pandemic has changed consumer is media consumption habits in ways that showcase the inherent strength of local broadcast television our content and next our is leading local brands as the most powerful and trusted voice in the country more people are turning into their stations local newscasts than ever before according to nielsen data even as states and localities began to reopen in the 2nd quarter local broadcast television evening news viewership among adults aged eighteen to 34 remained impressively high with year over year increases in average cumulative weekly impressions in april may and june similarly on the digital front nextel is websites and mobile apps grew year over year page views by 250 to 1100000000 in april with total monthly users up 133 to 96000000 we continue to generate strong digital audiences throughout the quarter with weekday and weekend page view traffic across our local websites up fifty and sixty respectively during the month of june additionally in terms of unique users nextar is digital properties rank number one in the country in local news number twelve in all of news and information and with the number 33 site overall domestically in june as measured by comscore as the nation is largest producer of local news programming nextar is proprietary content provides essential news and information to users and viewers that is unique and relevant to each of the local communities we serve across the united states with viewers relying on television news to stay informed about everything from the latest pandemic developments to the reopening of the economy to the upcoming election with next generation market leading stations and sites deep local and national reach and local broadcast record of being the most influential and effective medium for both brands and politicians we expect to see advertisers continuing to allocate increased spending to our broadcast and digital platforms as the threat resolves turning back to some 2nd quarter results total television advertising revenue increased eighteen one to 319800000 including political revenue of 21000000 and core advertising revenue of 298200000 while local and national advertisers adapted their media plans during the 2nd quarter we saw sequential month over month improvement in our same station core advertising revenue performance from april to may from may to june and this trend continuing in july notwithstanding marketplace conditions as i mentioned at the outset of our call our new business strategies ongoing sales training our focus on performance based initiatives combined with our sharing of best practices have proven very effective in our ability to capture ad spend and share in both broadcast and digital locally we recorded healthy levels of q two spending by political action committees and from candidates with 222nd quarter political revenue of $21600000 exceeding our expectations from early in the quarter despite the cancellation of some primaries both presidential campaigns recently generated record breaking levels of spending our full year 2020 expectations for net political revenue in the low 400000000 range remains unchanged recent distribution agreement renewals and the inclusion of wgg in america resulted in a 21 i am sorry a 71 rise in 2nd quarter distribution revenue to 536000000 representing nearly 59 of total net revenue total digital revenue decline by approximately $9600000 or seventeen reflecting our focus on higher margin profitable operations while digital profitability was up substantially over the comparable prior year period as our website and mobile app engagement also rose significantly total combined 2nd quarter digital and distribution fee revenue of $583200000 rose approximately 57 one over the prior year period and provides 64 growth up from 57 in the year ago period the year over year increase in 2nd quarter distribution revenue reflects the new agreements reached in the 2nd half of 2019 and our realization of tribune media revenue synergies related to the after acquired clauses in our retransmission consent contracts and as noted the inclusion of wgn america our expectations for net retrans growth remain unchanged for the balance of the year in the mid teens percentage range reflecting new long term network affiliation agreements was cbs fox and as a result over eighty of our big four affiliations are contracted through december 31st of 2019 and over seventy of our big four affiliations are contracted through december 31st of 2022 with our successful 2019 renewal of retransmission consent agreements representing approximately seventy of our subscriber base with approximately seventeen of the base to be renewed this year our significant net revenue growth in 2020 will complement our growth in 2022 we have pretty clear visibility for net retransmission revenue growth expectations in 2020 and beyond as we discussed on the last call at the onset of the pandemic we took immediate action to adapt our business to address the economic impact on the us commercial advertising market we implemented a range of cost cutting measures good morning i am pleased to report that our operating expense savings for the 1st quarter of 1995 exceeded $40000000 exceeding budgeted 2nd quarter levels looking ahead to the 3rd quarter while the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising we are seeing the same pattern of month over month improvement in our pacing data and expect to benefit from significantly increased levels of political ad spending and in fact our july political billing exceeded that of all of q two overall we are encouraged by continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint additionally preparations for the september one launch of wgn america is primetime national newscast newsnation which will reach approximately 75000000 households across the country are proceeding on schedule and on budget we are my 1st impressions of the product are very positive newsnation will air daily from eight pm to eleven pm et and will draw on the local regional and national expertise of netscouts 500 journalists and 100 local newsrooms across the country and during the quarter we announced the anchor teams and correspondents for our live three hour primetime national newscast we are already attracting strong interest from leading national advertisers at much higher than normal cost per points for wgn america newsnet will deliver news reporting that is fact based impactful and unbiased and we are confident that there are more americans than ever before who are seeking just that in addition to the live nightly newscast newsnet is team of reporters and producers will deliver news 24 hours a day online through newsnet soon to be launched at newsnet now which will create another opportunity for monetization and revenue diversification as always we remain committed to generating free cash flow actively our capital structure our cost of capital and our liquidity position to provide the financial flexibility to support our business and enhance shareholder returns as we emerge from the pandemic during the 1st half of 2020 we allocated approximately $594000000 in cash from operations and investments toward debt reduction opportunistic share purchases and cash dividends additionally as i mentioned before nextera continues to maintain a strong balance sheet including $665000000 in cash on hand at june 30th we have authorized an additional $140000000 under our revolving credit facility on the return of capital in late june we declared our 3rd quarterly cash dividend at a new ¢56 per share level which was 24 ahead of last year is payout with our 191 year to date free cash flow growth our contractual distribution fees revenues our food network distribution revenues are historically low libor rates which have reduced our interest expense and what is projected to be the biggest presidential election in summary while the pandemic has presented challenges for most every industry nextera is leading local platforms are well positioned to continue building the top line maintaining close control of fixed variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet over time our disciplines in these areas have strengthened our resiliency as outlined in this morning is press release the actual results for the three and six month ended june thirty 2020 reflect the company is legacy nextstar operations and results from tribune media stations which were required 2nd quarter 2020 revenue from wgg in america also acquired in the tribune transaction is included in core television advertising revenue and distribution fee revenue contribution from next star is 31three ownership stake in the television food network and other investments acquired in the tribune transaction is included in the full income statement under income or loss on equity investments net and in the cash flow nextstar is q two income statement and balance sheet data after which i will provide a review on a combined company basis and performer for the divested station 2nd quarter same station net total revenue was down six due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately 35 reflecting a sharp decline in april due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month improvement from april to may from may to june distribution fee revenue was up 28 and continuing digital revenues were down eighteentwo reflecting local agency services revenue growth of approximately eight while station website revenue was down approximately thirty due to softer local customer buying trends related to the pandemic to offset the anticipated impact of covid nineteen on commercial advertising revenue late in the 1st quarter we expect to take a one time impairment charge of approximately $10000000 we have implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings in excess of $40000000 from budgeted levels in the 2nd quarter of 2022nd quarter station direct operating expenses net of trade expense were approximately 414000000 up from 292000000 in the prior year primarily reflecting the full quarter of incremental expenses associated with the tribune operations and the budgeted growth in network affiliation expense as a partial our rising distribution revenue in the 2nd quarter of station scna was approximately 158000000 inclusive of the tribune operations same station pro forma fixed expenses excluding programming expenses were down eighteen over the year over year period due to synergies related from the tribune acquisition and the previously mentioned expense reduction activities in response to the pandemic corporate expenses were 30000000 and approximately 13000000 of stock based compensation and approximately 5400000 of one time transaction expenses when excluding non cash comp and one time transaction expenses recurring corporate expenses were approximately 17000000 which came in better than the guidance we had provided in the 1st quarter call of approximately 21500000 by the end of april the vast majority of the initial operating synergies of the tribune transaction have been realized 2nd quarter operating cash taxes were approximately $6000000 substantially lower than our guidance of 45 to $50000000 due to a timing difference that forty to $45000000 variance will now be paid in q three ongoing capex and transaction capex total $40000000 spectrum repack capex total $13000000 and received approximately 26000000 of reimbursements from the fcc during the quarter as a reminder we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all spectrum related capx over the course of the year 2nd quarter total interest expense amounted to 82000000 up from 51000000 in the same period in 2019 while cash interest expense was 78000000 compared to 49000000 last year with increases due to obviously the increased debt associated with the tribune funding partially offset by lower interest rates 2nd quarter broadcast cash flow was 2000000 adjusted ebitda of 298000000 free cash flow of 200000000 all pre transaction expenses exceeded consensus expectations and primarily reflect the realization of synergies and growth related to the terajune transaction distribution free distribution agreement renewals executed in the 2nd half of the year and the deferred tax cash taxes as i mentioned before approximately $27000000 in distributions from equity investments related to our 31 ownership in the tv food network as a reminder we received cash distributions from tv food on a quarterly basis with the largest payment recorded during the 1st quarter of each year for the 3rd quarter of 2020 we anticipate recording approximately $12000000 in tv food network distributions we expect cost savings in q three to approximately $25000000 as originally budgeted levels as variable costs and discretionary expenditures are prudently brought back online with the expected strengthening of the economy and the broadcasting advertising environment for the 3rd quarter we project recurring cash corporate overhead exclusive of stock compensation and transactions costs to be approximately $23000000 and we will easily meet our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance of approximately $120000000 for the 4th quarter the non cash compensation projected to be approximately $13000000 for the quarter and $48000000 for the full year transaction expenses will approximate $3000000 for the quarter and will decline for the remainder of the year 3rd quarter operating cash taxes are now estimated to be approximately $150000000 and operating cash taxes for the entire year will now come in at approximately $250000000 in total in the 3rd quarter cash taxes associated with the gains on the asset sales and legal settlements in 23 will be approximately 83000003rd quarter capex should come in at approximately 40000000 and we are still expecting approximately $160000000 for the entire year we are proceeding on budget with our investment related to the launch of wgg in america is primetime national newscast news nation on september 1st and prioritized capital expenditures to maintain maximum flexibility finally we expect nextera energy is cash interest expense to approximately $78000000 for the 3rd quarter and $325000000 to $350000000 for the full year reflecting interest expense savings related to the decline in libor rates turning to the balance sheet nextera energy is outstanding debt as of june thirty was approximately $8000000000 and consisted of $5400000000 of term loans and two series of senior subordinated notes one at approximately $900000000 and the other at $1800000000 with maturities of 2024 and 2027 respectively total net debt that approximated $7400000000 at june thirty compared to 7600000000 at march 31st and 8300000000 at 12312019 net debt for 1st lien covenant purposes is 5200000000 with a yield of approximately sixthree net cash limited to a $200000000 amount our 1st lien covenant ratio at june thirty was approximately threeeleven compared to three52 at year end which is well below our 1st lien covenant of four in a quarter as a reminder our 1st lien covenant limits cash netting to approximately $200000000 our total net leverage at quarter end was four47 compared to fiveeighteen at year end and as a reminder next our is only covenant is our at the onset of the pandemic nextera took immediate actions to adopt our business to the current environment and to preserve liquidity in order to best position the company for long term success as we returned to normalized operations in this regard we continue to prioritize cash retention and have added approximately 231000000 to our 1st quarter cash position for a total cash balance of 665000000 at june thirty we have approximately $140000000 available under our evolving credit facility at the same time during the 2nd quarter we returned approximately $25000000 to shareholders through the quarterly cash dividend and made $13000000 in payments on our debt during the 1st half of 2020 we have accurately managed our capital structure cost of capital and liquidity position to support our business in the challenging environment while enhancing shareholder returns year to date we have allocated approximately $1300000000 to our growth initiatives on the order of 594000000 towards shareholder value creating initiatives including $473000000 in debt reduction $51000000 in dividend payments and $73000000 in share repurchases in the near term while preliminary data suggests ongoing sequential improvement in economic trends and the commercial advertising environment we continue to focus on cash preservation in order to optimize our financial flexibility as we move through the 3rd quarter looking ahead with continued focus on these initiatives we remain confident in our ability to create value for our shareholders year over year growth in distribution revenue and what are expected to be robust spending levels related to the upcoming presidential election which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus we have excellent disability on over fifty of our annual revenue in 2020 as such we expect to receive free cash flow positive in the 3rd and 4th quarters in addition to continuing our dividend payments we remain committed to allocating the vast majority of our free cash flow towards leverage reduction and share repurchases next year we will reach our target level for the reduced level of total leverage to four times by year end 2020 nextel has already made significant progress in our leverage reduction plan and we enjoy a strong cash position with additional capacity under our revolver in addition the reduction in interest rates expense related to the favorable libor rates operating expense savings and our capital allocation prioritization will also serve us well in the 2nd half of 2020 we are confident in our liquidity position and ability to service our debt through these challenging times and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues as we move through the year in summary despite the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic our scale leadership flexibility synergy realization and operation plans are generating results our capital structure is in great shape from a cost of capital maturity and ability to quickly address leverage in addition our service to our local communities is strong our national advertisers has never been stronger our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth as well as consistency and visibility to our results and we remain confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value in the near term and on the other side of the pandemic that concludes the financial review for the call i will now turn it over back to perry for some closing remarks before q a thanks very much tom in summary i hope that our comments today reinforce the fact that we remain confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value in the near term and on the other side of the pandemic we are confident in the strength and the resilience of nextar is scaled and diversified business model nextar is leading local platform is well positioned to withstand this environment through several factors including our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs the continued growth of our distribution revenue stream and what are projected to be record levels of political spending here in 2020 in terms of capital allocation we believe that our free cash flow combined with the active management of both our cost structure and our balance sheet will provide us with the flexibility to capitalize on strategic opportunities as they arise nextel is well positioned to fully participate in the recovery and we remain highly confident in our core strategies in terms of serving the communities where we have operations in building the top line maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet this focus combined with our time proven operating strategies is enabling nextel to overcome the near term challenges and extend our long term record we look forward very much to catching up with you with another positive report just after election day and on behalf of the entire next our nation our board and our management team thank you for your continued interest support and for joining us today so now let us open the call to q and a to address your specific areas of interest operator please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again that is star one if you would like to ask any questions and we will take our 1st question from john janetics with wolf research thank you thank you thank you area two for you one is you talked about local news and your audience what are you seeing in terms of advertiser demand and growth in news relative to the day parts given the radio stations you have spoken to as it relates to local news you know through the 1st six months of this year 51 of our total advertising revenue came from local news and that is up over the prior years cumulative totals which indicates obviously advertisers are putting their money into that product and increasing with increasing frequency obviously the demand is where the audience is and that is where the audience is for us right now and so we do see continued read through and and we are hopeful that the audience gains at least some of them will be sticky when you know and i hate to use this term when the new normal settles in as to whatever that is but so far through this normal people in all age groups are tuning to our local news broadcasts in increasing numbers i will say that i mean obviously mvdps have reported subcounts and attrition for the quarter you know those are are factored into into our projections and analyzes and and our our retrans revenue is again we we forecast attrition into our budgeting process and we are we are at budget on retrans revenue in our projections through through the end of this year so we have seen no significant decline beyond what we had forecasted so we think it is business as usual from a distribution revenue standpoint thanks very much i am wondering if you could talk a little bit about your reverse compensation agreements as some of the clients are accelerating i was wondering if that is changing the tone of those at all and also does it make you think about moving from like a pura basis sorry to a per subscriber basis from a fixed programming fee where you can and relatedly we have more broadcast content going direct to consumer like cbs all access and peacock so how do you think about monetizing those households that may not be subscribing through the traditional process of distribution revenue so there are some that that are fungible and others that that are not and those conversations are continuing what is in the best interest of of both parties to get a deal done so there is some some hedge there at this and we are you know we are not ready to call the ball as to what the the most preferable  term is there based on our negotiating ability as it relates to cbsl access we participate in that we are paid to be a part of that service and our local stream is a part of that offering peacock we are not an affiliate of local news affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast offering and we are not sure if at any point they will be but you know we do have this thing called over the air which you know we reach you know a much larger universe potentially than the wired and pay cable universe already where you know sixteen of our viewers already use that we are a three g network without the aid of a paywall and that is available to those who want to quote stream us that way if you will and the good news about that is there are far fewer competitors for eyeballs in an over the air world than there are in a 500 plus cable or satellite universe so again we are in flux we have a lot of our agreements nailed down through 21 and 22 we do have some and that is where those conversations will center around what is the best type of agreement for for both companies to enter into great and then just one on political four years ago we kind of got a head fake at the last minute from the trump campaign in terms of not spending what was expected i do not think any of us expect that to happen this time but when do you feel comfortable that there is not going to be any negative surprises on the political spending side i am pretty comfortable in that right now i mean look at the amount of money that both camps have raised that the attendant packs and special interest groups have raised supporting those candidates as well as down ballot candidates you know there are no guarantees in this business but as close to guarantees as i will make you is there will be no negative surprise on political advertising that is a pretty good guarantee thank you well now i will take our next question from zach silver with b riley ok great thanks for hearing the question the 1st one is just if you can quantify the sequential improvement for core in july versus total two q 220 or even the performer year over year change so far in july and then more broadly and i think it is a little bit related to steven is question you know the narrative out there has been at the macro environment and growth in streaming has is going to accelerate the shift of ad dollars from linear tv to connected tv and streaming can you talk about how well positioned you are i will address that if that narrative does try to play out i will let you address how how linear you want to get on guidance obviously we saw substantial sequential improvement in core ad trends in july versus not only june but the entire quarter i do not know if you want to add any more details to that but i will let you speak to that sure well i think what i will say about july is obviously well as far as the 2nd quarter as a whole in july was better than the last month of the 2nd quarter so sequentially things have gotten better and that trend continues into early q three but as it relates to additional streaming services you know at some point there becomes not kind of a sameness to them and you know it is it is all about the content if you have good content if you have good programming people will come so you know it is all about the content i think people want content that people want they will find a way to consume you whether that is over the air or whether that is through a pay service or through a streaming service that we are paid to be on and without our services you have an inferior offering to the viewing public it is obviously demonstrated that local news is a product that people want and are willing to pay for and so i think we will just stand by that you know it is it is a lot less noisy at the operating level than it is perhaps at the investor level about these streaming services you know is it a fragmenting universe but are they just taking from a from a wire you know from a from a traditional pay tv universe into a virtual pay tv universe and if so and we are on both sides of that transaction it is not you know it is not nearly the the noise that that it appears to be in the investment community so we are somewhat sanguine about it you know we we have a product that people want we are the largest producer of it in the country it is called local we believe that product will stand the test of time as it has for the last forty years of testing yeah i think that makes sense and one more if i could does the i guess for tom does the target leverage ratio for this year contemplate any buybacks in the 2nd half can you remind us of where we are in resuming the repurchase program thanks the way we think we have an authorization left from the board we are currently not buying stock but i would anticipate that to get revisited here in the not too distant future the way we think about it is really starting on labor day and quite honestly that is probably not doing service to the fact that as peter mentioned july political revenue was very strong and we think we are in a good position we will be as well we are rapidly transitioning out of this being a story during the pandemic just about poor advertising revenue and what is happening there the the other leg two legs to the stool from our perspective distribution revenue has been strong continues to be strong as perry mentioned we are on budget for the year we are on budget for the 2nd we were on we were actually above budget for the 2nd quarter we are on budget for the 3rd quarter now with regard to retransmission revenues and then the 3rd leg of the stool is political and that is really going to get lit here right around labor day and run really hard for the two months of september october in the 1st week of november so the free cash flow of the company will continue to go along nicely and then get turbocharged by free cash flow from political beginning around labor day i have said to other people i fully expect our our capital allocation attitude to change from playing defense to playing offense sometime right around labor day we are not there yet but i can see there from here and when that happens then i would imagine we would not sit here with an unnatural $600000000 of cash on our balance sheet we deploy that by actually repaying debt i just want to add to tom is comment about political of you most folks woke up this morning reading about the you know biden is buy that he is placing starting on september 1st in fifteen states we operate substantial operations in twelve of those fifteen states so just to point out that you know political will reach a crescendo around labor day that will continue on through the 1st week of november and and again with july results being above all of 2nd quarter for political you know that is a pretty good pretty good measure i think of of what is yet to come and so we remain confident in our political guidance and as that story continues to prove then i think you will see i exercise more optionality around our cash flow that currently exists on the balance sheet got it thanks gary well now i will take our next question from aaron watson with deutsche bank hi guys thanks for having me on a couple questions on the ad environment i guess 1st there has been some fits and starts in terms of covid cases in pockets of the country how are you guys managing that yeah auto has rebounded you know we are seeing better pacing and better results in q three than we did in q two we are seeing certain of the oes move money around from market to market based on where they have cars and that is primarily affected some of the foreign nameplates but on the whole i think our expectations for auto are that it will be less down sequentially going forward as will most of core advertising we have had 145 confirmed cases in the company since the beginning of the pandemic remarkably out of a workforce of about 13000 people that are out in the community we have only had one hospitalization and that person has fully recovered about sixty of our employees are working remotely we have another twenty that are working from the facility to which they are assigned we have another twenty that are reporting to work but not necessarily in the facility reporters meeting their crews in the field to go to their 1st assignment and things of that sort and we have another twenty that are working remotely and you know i used the example with our board that you know everybody in topeka is reporting to work however nobody is populating our new york offices because of the the public transportation strike there are certainly requirements that they do not feel safe and there is certainly no mandate to do that and so that is kind of a proxy for the country you know we keep tabs by every market as to you know various stages of reopening i would say that all of our markets have had some degree of reopening some more than others there have been some pauses in california texas and others on further reopening areas that have been rolled back you know bars and restaurants are not necessarily advertising categories with us to begin with hospitality continues to be a category where we see no spend to speak of there is some intrastate tourism ads that are going on like if you are in texas come to arkansas and vice versa oklahoma we have seen some of that but hospitality for us is a sub two category that you know is not materially driving our top line so aaron i do not know if that is the kind of thing you are looking for we were looking for a flavor you were looking for but i am happy to answer any more specific follow up one last one for me and i appreciate the time again you spoke to the important local news and the ad revenues that come in and that is passed to that to the overall revenue pie if we are thinking about the potential that maybe nfl football is delayed or college football does not happen in the fall how do we think about the flow through of that potential and then all sports comprises about ten of our advertising revenue and of that the nfl comprises about sixty of that ten so let us just in real round numbers say that ad revenue support is half of our revenue and nfl is six of that ten so from an advertising perspective because of the limited availabilities that the local stations get in all of local sports or all of televised sports that is not local you know it is it is not that big of a contributor but obviously it has an outsized effect on viewership on promotional ability and i would say on on the national psyche and on people is morale obviously distributors are are very very important perfect that is exactly what i was looking for stay well guys thank you thanks i will let you know some color on what you are seeing in terms of subscriber declines in your markets curious how they compare to the overall industry and any color on advertising and distributor reception to newsnation and any expectations for when you might see some incremental revenue lift from newsnation thanks i would say our experience with subscribers is not materially different than that of the the mvpds obviously we are still getting an uplift from the virtual mvpds so that the the traditional mvpd subscriber loss is somewhat recouped but certainly not all recouped by by the the virtual mvpds and as perry had mentioned obviously we we have a significant number of mvpd subscribers who are not taking advantage of the virtual mvpd option and then we have an attrition rate for subscribers and a unit rate for our revenue and as we mentioned that was basically inline for the 2nd quarter and early returns for the 3rd quarter are consistent with that expectation so not getting into specific subscriber decline numbers etc we see and feel the same thing that the distributors do it is just that our you know our economics are a little bit different because we have got you know rate that helps us offset that but it is consistent with our expectations as relates to wgg in america we have had and you know dena zimmer and her team have been out presenting i think it is important to note that this proposal would apply to every mbpd with which we already do business and also those that do not carry wgan america and that is primarily in legacy nextstar markets and we have an opportunity with renewals between now and the end of the year for an incremental approximately 200 to 250000 subs that could add wgan america now these are smaller systems again where nextstar has a relationship but there are some areas where we do not have a relationship and we would like to explore the opportunity to add wgan america i have no personal relationship that would have included wgg in america so there was an upside there and i would say that the reception from distributors has been positive particularly from those who have existing contracts and realize there is going to be additional value add for no additional cost during the term of the the current agreement we are distributed on atn now as the the only virtual mbedd service that is offering wgg in america we are endeavoring to get distribution at the launch or shortly thereafter on other ott services and that will be a value add where wgn america is not currently distributed but the reception from both the advertising community and the distribution community has been positive because we are investing in a product that will add value to their businesses as well great thanks thanks very much thanks tom we will take our next question from dan the critic with benchmark thanks good morning slim pickens left here after the strong prints and all the questions but i guess i will ask you one followup to the prior perry i do not know if you are willing to sort of you know good color on on subcarriage incremental opportunity is there any way for us to think about sort of timing and higher thinking about the news nation impact itself relative to you know either advertising or i guess ancillary would that your comments on carriers we know it is going to be self funding obviously you have plans to kind of expand it so just any help kind of framing your thoughts on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity and then separately you know obviously there has been a lot of noise lately in the digital world facebook twitter ad boycotts all of that fun stuff you guys are the largest you guys have a pretty big network is there any accured benefit to you guys or do you think that stays mostly in the digital bucket thanks that are in excess of i am sorry i should say costs for 1000s that are in excess of fifty greater than what standard programming was generating alone so that is a very positive initial indication we are trying to rework some of the existing buys into the newsnation primetime offering and and so what we could really use is you know an upfront or a 4th quarter scatter market but all of that said we do anticipate an incremental let us call it low eight figure revenue contribution to wgn is ad revenue in the four months of the of the end of this year and again given the science and scope of the operation that would not be deemed to be material but we do even in these conditions expect you know a low eight figure uplift in in gross revenue there that will mostly come at the end of the year so will impact 2021 more than this year there have been some incremental deals done already that will launch wgn america you know between now and the end of the year but i would say the vast majority of that impact would be felt in 2021 and again you are talking a potential uplift of you know a quarter of a 1000000 subscribers on a you know nielsen reported i think 75000000 subscriber base so even that is incremental but it is all incremental and that is what we are going to do is drive incremental growth out of the assets that we own without rallies to fund the one way to reach people is through broadcast television i think we are seeing an evidence of that right now so i think that would be probably the direct transfer you know with all the boy cats and all of that i do not think you have seen a substantial decline in digital revenue performance on those platforms so at this point the damage is more reputational than financial and we will see you know how that plays out we want to get involved in taking a look and potentially regulating these companies more symmetrically with the way we are regulated but at this point i think the financial transfer outside of political to the best of our knowledge is minimal got it super helpful thanks for the coloring the next order thanks yes good morning thank you a few questions last quarter on your conference call i believe you guys said your retrans subs were down four for fourfive year over year as you guys may know sinclair on the call right before yours said their 2nd quarter subs were down about seven including the bit benefit in the virtual side should i assume that you guys were down roughly about seven for the 2nd quarter for yourselves is that reasonable slightly worse in the 1st no should i assume so it is a little bit better than that then or can you just help me understand your i would say it is more consistent with the 2nd quarter the 2nd quarter sorry you mean more consistent with the 1st quarter of down for fourfifty i am sorry with what we announced the 1st quarter you are right 1st quarter so but no i would not say it is down for craig i am not going to get the exact number i have already said that ok i appreciate that can you help us your tv advertising pay scenes for the month of august would you say that those are tracking better the rate of decline of your core advertising that that is tracking better than what you are what july turned out to be ok i appreciate that can you help us your tv advertising pay scenes for the month of august would you say that those are tracking better the rate of decline of your core advertising that that is tracking better than what you are what july turned out to be ok so we have very you know few days in august here i am thinking you know it is a little too early to be making any comments with regard to that ok can you help us then maybe i am trying to understand what you are sort of budgeting or thinking that the rate of decline for your core advertising could be down in the 3rd quarter maybe help us understand that that is why we are not giving you guys a budget i think i told you it was down less again i am not going to give specific numbers but july was down less than june and june was obviously it is just math if the entire quarter was down 35 and every quarter every month within the 2nd quarter got better then clearly june was down less than 35 ok let me ask another question and on this virus situation that is going on there in the states where the virus cases have gotten dramatically worse here in the last several weeks if you guys have any thoughts on how to help with that i would appreciate hearing them yes there has been a material change in the core tv advertising in those markets is there any significant change that you can talk about no and again you know cases in texas have gone to i mean you know you have to we do not operate just in eleven area that you are in that you might be hearing that news from right so you have got to look across a 114 markets and look at you know those states and you know you know i am going to be up thirty which could be a 100 cases in a state i mean you have got to put all of these numbers into context but i would say no the evidence is in you know in our results in july and our pacing in august and our pacing in september all substantially better than where we exited 2nd quarter and then we performed in 2nd quarter so you know the proof is in the numbers is tom says it is just math but we have you know we have not seen any and i think i just said this you know hospitality continues to be down autos we do not get a lot of money from restaurants unless it is qsr and they are making mint through their drive through so you know things are we are seeing steadily steady improvements and even we are you know pausing and opening is better than not being open at all and that is kind of our worst case scenario in some of our markets and then others we do not have that you know this morning we are dealing with the aftermath of it is storms up the east coast from the carolinas into virginia and up into pennsylvania it is going to be more you know temporary disruptors to businesses until they can reopen then the pandemic and so it is situational and we deal in 38 states across the country and you have got to add it all together but there is you know nothing other than business as usual is the way we deal with things and i think the results speak for themselves last question guys on the cost front you guys talked about pull forward costs in the 2nd quarter down eighteen can we i really do not understand the question other than the fact obviously we had guided to $40000000 in cost takeouts in the 2nd quarter which we believe you know which we overperformed on that same number for the 3rd quarter is 25000000 as we obviously some of those are variable costs as advertising starts to return those costs go up some of them are discretionary that we will add back in we will travel more in the 3rd quarter than we did in the 2nd quarter we basically could not have traveled any less in the 2nd quarter than we did so some of the discretionary costs will get added back in but it will be more than offset by higher advertising revenues in the 2nd quarter but specifically as it relates to you know if you are looking year over year the majority of the synergies taken out of the tribune transaction have occurred so that will not change materially sequentially q two to q three over q two to two and you will have some added expense coming back in but that is the the extent of some of the hello this is tom from jk media you answered the polls on expenses you answered it well thank you appreciate that guys well again john i think that is consistent with our message that you know in the next thirty to 45 days i think we will have a better feel on actual political revenue coming in in a labor day and obviously same with another month of core and we will be able to start making more aggressive decisions with regard to capital allocation in the you know obviously in the last 120 days and probably the next thirty days we are still going to continue to take a pretty conservative view on that but hopefully be able to flip the switch and become a little bit more aggressive in the near term secondly did i hear correctly that your own track for mid teens net retrans net retrans growth this year and you mentioned that the growth gross retransmission revenue growth has exceeded twenty that is correct we have budgeted for midteens for the midteens yes well 28 in the 2nd quarter i forget with exactly the 1st quarter we have budgeted for midteens growth in net retrans for the entire year but so far we have exceeded that right so net but net retrans margins are down you know more than a little bit for this year that correct no i would say that they are actually up a little bit because we have included a fair amount of tribune subscribers that are non big four affiliates where our net retrans is it substantially in excess of fifty if you would like to cancel this request please press star zero again i m sorry i may have heard go ahead jim i think somebody s trying to either record or exit the call ok sorry but anyway i was wondering if any of the increased usage and sampling has proven sustainable as has it mostly dissipated and did any of that play a role in your retrans negotiations during that period we had fresh pressure a few retrans negotiations done in the 1st half of the year we had one top ten that we are you know we are pleased with the results on i would say you know in my in my comments earlier i did report that you know our our viewership and i highlighted the eighteen to 34 demographic you know obviously was up in april 151 83 in may and 89 in june over the prior year our digital page views which were in excess of 2300000000 for the quarter were 1100000000 in april that was up 133 and then in the month of june just by comparison our local websites were up sixty compared to the prior year so you know there is there is some covid fatigue i think but i also think there is increased interest in local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news the diminution of newspaper and radio local coverage and content so you know we do think that there is sticky stuff to this you know the long tail will determine how much but but people continue to turn to our newscasts and record numbers and it is amazing you see atla in los angeles and wgn in chicago independent stations by and large but producing copious amounts of local news are ranking number one in their markets i was wondering about the promotion efforts to create visibility for newsnation well i mean you know you are coming to the fore and also it seems like cnn tended to fill a similar role to that which you are targeting where it tended to be unbiased to maybe it is a little less so these days and it during that era it would tend to be the place to go when something an event occurred but some of the other news organizations more so you know the newscast would politically would sort of gather their base in more normal times so i am wondering if there is a way for you to position yourself to you know sort of gather at least that role and maybe have something more sustainable and if this proves successful do you think you have broadened it beyond the three hour original timeframe i will i will try and do my best with it here obviously you know that is how cnn started i do not think anyone listening to this call thinks cnn is in that same place today from an unbiased political lean we as as i have said before we have a staff of rhetoricians and two full time staff that do nothing but check scripts and reporting for unconscious bias and bias in our writing and and we have had very spirited discussions about that even in in the rehearsals you know we we do think we will be that place to go for news that does not make a you know 22 minute news hole in a network evening news broadcast or much news on the the opinion based you know talk networks you know for example last night on our rehearsals we did a story on the 1st woman police chief in colorado springs and that is not a story you would see every place else but again we have got our we have got the country divided up into six zones and we have zone producers and they are there that is their job is to know exactly what is going on in those zones in all of those newsrooms and what might be of interest to a national audience in addition to the 150 people we hired in chicago correspondents that are also based in miami new york dallas los angeles and dc that report exclusively for the network as well as all the behind the scenes production folks that we think we can give a more representative view of america than perhaps what is on perhaps what is on cable as it relates to promotion we have secured something that none of the other networks news networks i think are able to compete with and that is to harness the power of 196 television stations hello next week is nation to promote this newscast on a day by day specific basis beginning later this month and if you look at the annualized promotion value that the stations will be contributing on a dedicated basis it is something approaching a $100000000 we are layering on top of that on an annualized basis approximately $20000000 of outside promotion expense which primarily goes for advertising on television and radio because we are just a channel change away at that point on national and syndicated radio we are also you know investing heavily in social media not only because of the app but to try and drive a younger demographic to an alternative newscast and so we think our promotion spending you know all taken together you know a nine figure amount to both cash and in kind contributions for the company are are another asset that will hopefully drive success for this this effort and again it is you know it is a counterprogramming opportunity in prime time and we are going to do our best to succeed there obviously if we are successful we would look at other day parts but we are taking very much of a crawl walk run approach to this we want to get it right and and you know we will grow as fast as our success would allow us to grow so i think i would leave it at that but you know we are we are very excited about the prospect of introducing an alternative in primetime to entertainment sports and opinion programming and that the product will reach a will we will strike a chord and resonate with the audience and then you know audience growth and advertiser growth will continue so tune in it launches on september 1st thank you capture it well thank you operator again we are very pleased at our progress and we are pleased at our strong financial position and we are excited about the launch of wgg in america and the advent of the political spending season that will all be upon us before our next call so we look forward to reporting back to you shortly after election day with the the early results on all of those efforts and thank you very much for your time this morning thanks for joining us and once again that concludes today is conference and we thank you all for your participation you may now disconnect",

listen only mode after the companies complete their prepared remarks the lines will be open to take your questions your host for today is call is laura gannon vice president investors relations of the mosaic company miss gannon you may begin thank you and welcome to our 2nd quarter and 2020 earnings call the today will be joc zero rourke president and chief executive officer clint freeland senior vice president and chief financial officer and rich mclellan senior vice president commercial we will host the prepared question and answer session addressing the questions to see last night followed by a short live q a session time permitting all of our earnings materials released yesterday after market close are available on our website at mosaicco com we will be making forward looking statements during this conference call the statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results they are based on management is beliefs and expectations as of today date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties actual results may differ materially from projected results factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission we will also be presenting certain non gap financial measures our 2nd quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday is form ak filings as well as our commentary on the quarter posted to our website also contain information important on these non gap measures so now i would like to turn the call over to jack good morning thank you for joining us today i will start with very brief comments then we will get straight on to your questions this was a very good call i know momentum is increasing the people are into cashflow generation is the result of the past five years of your to transform or cross structure and strengthen a franchise we are succeeding even earlier than we expected we have already achieved five about seven 2021 cross targets living with realized prices down $twenty to times from the 1st quarter and realized prices so that is just $thirteen to turn in the quarter we generated over 800000000 in cash from operations so adjust to that a good job 25 higher than consensus expectations even before adjusted ebitda definition change we paid down $500000000 we short term debt and structured variables in the quarters while we turned cash on the balance sheet above $1000000000 we continue to invest in accelerated k three project hitting a major milestone with connecting the k three shafts to the k one mill we continue to reduce our brine management costs and we achieved the lowest cash cost per ton of production in over a decade mosaic had an excellent quarter we are hitting both based cost targets and achieving further cost benefits from the weekend as well as realizing over eighty of our targeted full year transformation benefits phosphates drove the cash costs of rock below the target and lower than last year despite increasing distances from mining to beneficiation and with all of these we have reaffirmed our commitment to you to our shareholders our employees our customers and our communities to act responsibly we announced new aggressive broad based environmental social and governance targets and we will use these targets to drive performance across the business we are continuing to transform the quarter is accelerating earnings and cashflow clearly reflect our efforts today and we are driving additional future savings we expect to deliver another $700000000 in savings above the 2019 days as we continue to execute our strategy mosaic is more competitive than ever before and with fertilizer markets improving we have significant earnings leverage to the future now we will take your questions joc i am going to start with some questions you received on costs adam samuelson from goldman sachs in the 2nd quarter mosaic was ahead of its 2021 targets and a number of its key cost kpis how much incremental opportunity to see on each key metric to further reduce costs and if so what level of incremental capital spends would be necessary to achieve those outcomes thanks for your question adam as we have said earlier we have new targets that include $700000000 of additional improvements across the company 200000000 of those coming from our brazil operation and 500 coming from our north american and and administrative some of the areas where we believe we can make big gains as we go forward obviously are in brazil where we continue to improve that business in north america where automation is allowing us to drive efficiencies in both phosphates and potash and then of course our k three operation which as we ramp it up will eliminate a lot of costs and improve our grind management costs so as we look forward we see a lot of opportunities still and importantly in september when we bring our all of this to our ambulance day we expect to be able to give you more color and detail on what that is going to look like joc chris parkinson from credit swiss asks you are clearly comfortably ahead on numerous cost initiatives including your k three chats info phosphate rock costs in the us and brazil and for the platform but when you take a step back how are you thinking about your structural cost space in a normalized environment and how much more could actually be done especially in phosphate yeah thank you chris it is important to keep in mind that these costs improvement certainly are somewhat driven by high utilization we have had a good quarter where we are able to use our assets fully a and we have had some benefits from exchange rate particularly in brazil but also in canada over the longterm though the real differences have been structural and those are going to stay with us and those are going to continue and we are going to continue to improve those so if we look at you know our major projects which include esterhazy k three next general mining and the brazil transformation those are not temporary differences those are true structural changes that will be delivering value for the long term joc michael piken from cleveland research asks you mentioned that you were on track to exceed your 225000000 and non market growth in 2020 which segments are exceeding your expectations of how much higher can this number go for 2020 hello michael let me clarify our $225000000 were actual items that we spent in 2019 that we did not expect to repeat in 202 so on those some of the key items to plant t to the island that is happened and now is outside of our cost structure our brazilian dams we have completed the work now and that $80000000 of cost is now behind us equally the ramp up of esterhazy which has gotten better than we expected we now are delivering 1000000 tons a year from the k three project so that benefit is already flowed through to us and then of our $50000000 of transformation in brazil we are part of that 225000000 we are already at over 40000000 so we see that as pretty much complete and ongoing savings will be above and beyond that original 225 we talked about joc the largest number of questions seek a better understanding of our countervailing duties petition seth scene from morning side chris parkinson from credit suisse asked for an update on potential regulation changes of the us import duties on morocco and russian supply and if the outcome is successful in our favor what should they expect in changes to their landed us class in other words what are the potential outcomes in terms of leveling the playing field thank you gentlemen let me start by saying we believe in free and fair trade however the reason we filed this petition in the 1st place was to address and balances associated with unfair government subsidies on inputs and to highlight on equal requirements on environmental standards we believe our competitors benefit from access to artificially low lock costs and energy while not having to meet adequate and proper environmental standards we also will say that what we have done is put this forward to the department of commerce and the international trade commission they will judge on the merits and as such determine what level of duties if any need to be put in place to create a fair trade situation and quinn do you have anything to add to that yeah no jack i think you are right we we certainly are ahead of schedule on the realization of the $225000000 in non market benefit this year you know keep in mind that the $80000000 that we spent on on dam remediation last year with spread really through the 2nd quarter so we realized about $36000000 in benefit in the 2nd quarter and should realize the balance throughout the rest of the year joc john roberts from ubs would like to know can you review the basis for your prostate countervailing duties position and have you had any response from customers or competitors thank you john our basis for the petition is clearly laid out in the public documents and i would ask that you go to those also the comments from any of our competitors for customers or the other concern groups is clearly laid out in those public documents so i would suggest you go there our position is clearly that the department of commerce and the international trade commission really are the ones that will decide what are the merits of this case now clearly as we talk to our customers some are concerned mostly about how they are going to get their supply we believe that this has opened up new opportunities for outside competitors to come in and make up some of that supply but in the end i think all people understand why we put it forward and you know we will have to wait to see what the itc says in terms of this mess joc we received several questions asking about trade flows and implications to other markets specifically adam samuelson and seven others over the next six to twelve months how do we think about the net impact of potential trade flow impacts of potential us countervailing duties on morocco and russian phosphate do you see risk of market share competition rising in other major import markets notably brazil thanks mike and joel let us answer the last question 1st no we do not think this will impact global supply and demand all we will do is probably change trade flow the current market and resolving pricing is reflective of a tight market and if anything the countervailing duties only highlighted to people that this market was tight so what is causing the tight market favorable farm economics and lower supply which began to take shape well before we filed the petition however it is reasonable to assume that the trade flows will be altered and some product will be shifted to other jurisdictions including new suppliers coming into the us and the moroccan and russian suppliers focusing on other markets which could be brazil or wherever jonas oscar from bernstein asked two more technical questions with respect to the petition namely if the mosaic trade complaint is upheld will there be a retroactive benefit to mosaic and what is the timeline for final decision on the complaint so look thank you jonas let me 1st clarify whether duties are applied retroactively will depend upon the level of imports from these two countries from the filing of the case until the doc preliminary ruling we expect the case to be finalized in q one 202 and at that point if there has been excessive imports they will look at assessing a retroactive duty joc i am now going to move on to questions about phosphate operations ben isaacson said from scotia asked on the cash cost of mine ross in florida fallen to $36 per ton from $forty year over year how much of that was due to transformational efforts versus favorable geology and how much more wiggle room is there to bring that down and how sustainable are these costs improvements thank you ben certainly our cost improvements are a combination of several factors we certainly have been running our assets at a elevated utilization rates and that is helped but our efforts to centralize mining operations streamlined processes and automate have also helped reduce our costs as previously mentioned the establishment of a central control center for our mining and all of our mining operations basically into one large operation which should be begin operation by the end of the year we will release further and house costings and as we introduce new management structures incorporate automation for certain mining functions and accel accelerate savings from adjustments to transportation we start to see real long term improvements in our cost structure joc pj also asked with the recent rise of over $fifty per time in dap pricing have you ramped up your production at the mine and what could be the benefit of better cost absorption from higher times in the 3rd quarter thanks for the question pj high utilization rates on a beneficial impact but that is really only part of the story as we have mentioned but i will say that as we look out 23 going forward we can expect those tonage high tonnage and higher utilization rates to continue so we do expect to see better costs throughout the rest of the year both structurally and because of high utilization joc we also have a question from adam samuelson from goldman sachs the specialty percentage rose to 48 of shipments and marked the new quarterly high in phosphate coincident with microessentials shipments to being substantially above recent quarters is this sustainable why or why not thank you adam the sales of microessentials and aspire hit record highs and kamen came in close to the record in quarter 22 202 among these growth microessentials shipments to brazil has been a major driver now we believe that the growth of microessentials will continue over the next quarter driven by mosaic for and also north america i have to reemphasize the value that microessentials brings to the growers is showing positive returns for them on their investments so these are bringing real value to the growers and to our customers the distributors so we do believe that as more people start using microessentials this is very sustainable and they are going to see the benefit and they are going to keep using that product joc three analysts submitted multi part questions related to our potash operations so 1st chris parkinson is asks the demand environment in potash continues to be modestly improving well spot prices are well off their 1st half load can you talk about your thought process for the 2nd half of 21 operating rate assumptions and how that may drive changes in your mining thanks chris as you know we have accelerated the development of k three and this has an obvious impact on costs so now with declining management spending and in the future as the mine ramps up beyond k three we continue to see strong results from belle pleine which recorded his lowest cost position in more than a decade as we move forward we are going to take advantage of owning two of only seven mines in the world with annual production capacity of over 3000000 tons and with some of the lowest costs in the industry so as we look to the future we intend to optimize the production coming from k three and from our belle pleine operation and only see running higher cost mines like if the market really requires it in the future joc another question comes to you from jonas oscar of bernstein in part as you lowered your cost per ton of fair bit but how much of that was simply spreading fixed costs over a twenty larger volume on a fixed volume basis what would your cost reductions be good question jonas there is no question that the larger volume helps spread out our costs however we believe there are structural changes that are fundamentally changing our scr our costs over the long term we think one area of clear savings is the accelerated reduction of brine management classes we shift to k three k one underground mining will be completed this year fly management accounted for $eight a ton in q two and that will continue to decline as we move into 2021 and will be eliminated completely by 202 so as you can see a lot of our costs reduction is actually structural and should be with us for the longterm joc pj asks what kind of savings do you expect from sending k three potash to the k one mill and what is the updated timeline now to shut down k one and k two thank you pj we expect to be sending potash to k one and actually be shutting down our k one shouts from a production perspective early in 2021 that will start meaning we are only going to be operating two shafts and then by the end of 2022 only operating the one big k three shaft at that point the project will be complete we will eliminate inflow and that really will be the end of our k one and k two path mine is from a production perspective vincent andrews is interested in how he should think about our potash shipments in the 2nd half of this year given how strong shipments were in 2nd quarter also can you remind him of the accounting for the chinese contract shipments that were already in a bonded warehouse prior to contract agreement thank you vincent yes we did have strong shipments in quarter one and if i would refer to our discussions with competence i think they have a fairly for the book for q three and even going well into q four so i believe the shipments internationally will be strong in the 2nd half and domestically we are expecting a good fall in north america so we are expecting strong shipments there as well so from our perspective a 2nd half is looking pretty strong from a product perspective in terms of the shipments in the 1st half i just like to throw it over to clint to explain a little bit about our china shipments to bonded warehouse that we in the 1st half of the year clint can you discuss that sure joc and good morning vincent so to start with on a consolidated basis we do not recognize revenue until that product is sold to a 3rd party however we do on a segment level basis we do recognize a revenue when campa techs sells products to our distribution business in china and when they sent that product to our distribution business in china the segment recognized revenue but that was based on an estimate of pricing since the contract had not been completed once the contract was completed and the price for that transaction was set that gave rise to the adjustment but again that is an adjustment on the potash segment only because we will not recognize revenue on that product on a consolidated basis until it is finally sold to a 3rd party thanks for that clarification clint joc i am now going to move on to questions about mosaic we have four analysts including john roberts from ubs and mark conley from stevens ask similar questions about the timing of volumes in brazil brazilian farmers are having an outstanding year so far and have been widely reported to the buying inputs well ahead of last year schedule how much do you think has been borrowed from the 3rd quarter and are we likely to see an offsetting reduction in 3rd quarter margin to reflect those lower volumes next quarter and specifically within the quarter april and may were significantly higher than the prior year month well june appeared to be much closer to a year ago is that just timing or are the trends decelerating into july great question the strong volumes in the 1st half of the year did reflect some forward input purchases as a result of generally favorable farm economics so year over year demand is expected to be up slightly but 37000000 tons and in that figure we believe we are beginning to take market share as farmers gravitate towards higher analysis products and high value products such as our microessentials joc mark connolly at stevens asked how did the dramatic improvement in cost in brazil breakout between volume driven cost improvement and operational structural cost change but should repeat with normal volumes thank you mark let me start by saying last year operations were negatively impacted by the change in regulations that required us to shut down a couple of operations for dam improvements that reduced volume and impact of our raw materials access this year we are we are benefiting from running a full operations rate and this also has allowed us to have more access to our own rock supplies so overall that has helped a little bit so about a 3rd of those costs are probably volume related the others are improvements to our freight our inventory management our overall planning and of course structural changes to our stru to our cost structures i think overall though we are we are seeing the long term changes to how the brazil business is running and we are starting to see full benefit of the $330000000 or so of integration benefit that we announced at the end of last year joc pj microessentials has a question about currency so brazilian versus a usl was down significantly year over year in the 2nd quarter of 202 how did that volatility impact you and what specifically was the impact in the quarter and mosaic thanks pj i would like to talk about two aspects of the brazilian real that really has changed things and the 1st of those of all of course is the impact on farmer economics i think that is actually the bigger improvement their ability to buy fertilizers and the continuous growth of the brazilian agriculture segment is largely driven by great economics for the farmer and so you know that is the 1st place we want to talk about where the brazilian real has helped us in terms of our cost performance you will see that we tend to put our targets in real base so that allows us to understand what is the real underlying improvement obviously there was some positive impact i think we saw definite improvements in our overall costs because of the reality but i would say we focus more on what is the real based cost because that tells us where they were really improving the business or just taking advantage of currency zero in the back you will notice sorry pj i would also like to point out that if you look at the back of our stuff you will see basically our sensitivities and a one a ¢ten move in the real amounts to about $20000000 a year unhedged so if we think about us as being about fifty it is fairly easy to do the reconciliation to last year real cost joc we have another question from ben isaacson with respect to mosaic summer branches mosaic branches sales volumes have been notably higher year over year can you walk through this strategic strength of this business and how it relates to your mix between commodity and microessentials thanks ben you know again i have said this before but i will i will repeat you know the the volume growth really was a result of improvement in farm economics in brazil the strengthening of the us dollar versus the real excellent bar the ratios and anticipation about a strong summer crop demand so both both commodity and performance products have shown robust increases in q q two quarter two of 2020 versus a year ago joc chris parkinson asked for a covid nineteen update his question is in the midst of a fairly complex covid nineteen outbreak which has periodically been affecting the port and logistics system can you give us an update on the demand environment as well as any logistical headwinds you proceed during the peak fertilizer application season thanks chris look let us start tomorrow for operations in brazil and although we have had a number of cases because of the high level of community transmission we have not been impacted on our operations to this and we have instituted a number of procedures to make sure we mitigate the spread s sorry and then from an overall country logistics perspective we believe that in general we have been uneffected by covid now obviously there is going to be local places where that impacts us but in general we have been able to work around that and kept the product moving to the end customer and from a demand perspective despite covid we have continued to see strong demand again driven by favorable farm economics and we have got our product to our customers with relatively little impact the last question we received on mosaic comes from joel jackson says the 2nd quarter gross margin was more than double the results from the prior two years how much of that game was market conditions versus foreign exchange tailwinds versus share gain in the market this is a pull forward of q three because of covid related logistics concerns thanks joel i would summarize our results in the 2nd quarter of in brazil as an a couple of factors 1st of all if we looked at the exchange rate it is probably offset almost perfectly the change in pricing so what we see in actual results is almost solely the result of our own actions and the reversal of some of the down costs that we saw last year joc we received a handful of questions on the balance sheet primarily focused on uses of pre castable john roberts asked what are the capital allocation priorities moving forward and can you please discuss your growth debt level dividends and potential share repurchases and pj you have asked beyond paying down some debt what could be uses of cash especially with improved free cashflow in the 2nd half of 2020 would buy back the approved use of cash over the countervailing duty decision prevent you from buying back stock joc can you talk about capital priorities to address both of these questions yeah thank you gentlemen our capital priorities are unsh changed and they continue to be what we have said in the past right sorry you know our 1st priority is to maintain the business next priority maintain investment grade metrics and to do that you know we have to continue our normal capital plan as we have had we expect to lower debt by about a $1000000000 over the next few years doing so when our bonds come due in the next couple of years and then continue some of the key projects like the esterhazy acceleration k three acceleration and then what we have after that returning capital to shareholders all these are dependent on future cash flow generations and capital allocation will not be impacted in any way by the countervailing duties we have also had a couple of questions from a buy side analyst and they include can you describe what is included in the 610000000 of short term debts that you indicated will be paid in 2020 and does mosaic still plan to keep about a $1000000000 cash balance and paid on its 2021 maturity thanks for the question at the start of this year we did increase our cash balance to a $1000000000 by 1st of all taking out some money from our revolver and executing on some of our inventory financing debt since that time we have paid down the revolver and we will continue to pay down the rest of the $600000000 in short term debt throughout the rest of this year before we move on to market related questions ben isaacson asked about our tax rate outlook why is your effective tax rate expected to be in the mid to high 60s and how should we think about this rate under a trump or biden presidency thank you ben let me start by saying the 1st part of this is and the reason for the tax rate being higher is our income mix between our three jurisdictions canada brazil and the us the details of that i am going to actually hand it over to clint to explain why the negative earnings in the us will create a higher tax rate overall yeah thanks joc and that is right it it really comes down to an earnings mix phenomenon for us if you recall the the tax rate is is is based on gap results by jurisdiction and when you look at the united states not only is our phosphate business incorporated into that but also our corporate dna our interest expense and so forth so there are times when that pre tax income in the us turns and that can begin to skew the rate when you then start to factor in things like some of the foreign currency moves that we have seen and how it affects our our mark to market and some of the notable items that that we have on our schedule that begins to scale it and then you know as you have seen brazil improved this year that is our highest rate tax jurisdiction so so that begins to influence that rate as well so really the combination of all of those things that resulting in an unusually high tax rate for this year and then i would had two things one on a longer term basis we would expect that effective tax rate to be somewhere in the mid to high 20s but then i would also call to your attention that our cash tax rates and payments are much different than that matter of fact this year we expect to end up with a a small cash tax refund so very different than the the effective tax rate in our financial statements now let us move on to related questions mike asked if he could comment on our summer fill programs in the us and where we see downstream inventories in the us at this point thank you michael i think we have had fairly successful fill programs in both phosphates and potash here in the us recent discussions that we have had with our customers suggested they are probably in the range of sixty full for the fall season so there will be increased mind towards the fall season but for the most part our customers are in reasonably healthy shape going into that fall steve barnes is looking for insight into teacher volume how are you trending in each of the segments through the month of july on a year over year basis do you see volumes higher in the 3rd quarter any expectation for volumes for the rest of the year thanks steve i would characterize q three as largely having our order books full for both phosphate and potash and so it will be a matter of delivery and revenue recognition that will determine where we are for q three but we expect a reasonably good fall in the us and global markets are running low so for both phosphates and potash we expect relatively normal 23 volumes and bold and then for the rest of the year we should also see a good stable volume john mark connelly would like insight into grading royalty presentations how important to mosaics earnings outlook are higher grain and ilt prices if the current price of corn is the same through 2020 and soybean stay at or near their current prices do you think there is any material room for higher p k prices in the market thank you mark clearly oil seed and grain prices do have implications for us but in general the farmers tend to work a lot more on their needs to plant so what is a lot more important to us as planting intentions number of acres planted and remember also the grain and oil seeds are just a few of the products that we fertilized so it really depends on what does the whole global market look like and what is the demand for p k and what supply balance there as opposed to something on the grain and oil seed it has an indirect impact but i would say no direct impact on our pricing for morgan stanley wants to know about our market forecast given that the last ten years of p k shipments show some pattern lumpiness of potash more than phosphates why not forecast lumpiness going forward rather than just keggers thanks vincent we tend to forecast on annual growth simply because some of the other factors that go into the lumpiness of our business are impossible to forecast and those are really inventory movements globally and of course weather you saw in 2019 the weather impacts in the us made a fundamental difference to the growth rate of both phosphate and potash on a on a global scale so we really have to look at it on averages but recognize that there will be lumpiness as we go forward we are going to move on to some questions on phosphate this one is from ben isaacson the benchmark mip selling price fell by $sixteen to $314 per ton yes mosaic average finished product downsides fell by almost three times that amount almost $44 to 308 from 35 why how could we think this so how should we think about this relationship going forward thanks ben the answer here is simply that the average selling price and or lavon phase is based on all the components we sell including urea and potash and the blends both of which are down significantly so when you look at that relationship going forward you have to take into account all three products that would be in our blends that we sell ben also asked that stripping margins has started to improve in july after remaining largely fat throughout the 2nd quarter are you seeing this flows through to the phosphate segments margins thank you ben again doc is trivia margin is we track that because that really is what do we get after the cost of raw materials and transport as as revenue so of course this flows directly into our margins an improvement in stripping margin really is almost directly related to our overall profitability adam samuelson we would like to know what does mosaic see as the equilibrium prices of us nola dap and map versus key offshore benchmarks thank you adam all i can really say there is if you look at it historically other than the last say three years where there has been a real increase in imports we have seen nola prices being similar to other global prices and i would expect that under a more fair trade market that is what you would see is you would see the nola price being equal to what the price is and other markets are adjusted for the transport cost and that is exactly what we expect will happen after a countervailing duty case if they readjust that market joc steve barnes would like more insight into our global soft rate demand outlook and its relationship to inventories swings specifically what is your estimate of underlying global consumption of phosphate in and liver below the shipment but £71000000 did it reflect thank you steve if we look at 2019 there was no question that there was buildup of global inventory particularly in the us i mean in the us there was at poor season and the imports in particularly kept coming in we shut down our louisiana operation for a number of months last year and and still the inventory build in the us was was very high likewise the the brazilian inventory was probably slightly above normal coming into this year for maybe some of the same reasons but what i will say is in the 1st and 2nd quarter of this year we have largely cleared out all of that inventory and probably have moved from an area of high inventory to very low inventory in phosphates as we move into the 3rd quarter of this year joc in a related question he also asked are normal inventory level for the interest certainly forecast in 202 thanks steve yeah in terms of 2021 what we really see is the inventory levels should be pretty much leveled off and we expect normal growth in the market as per any other year so that two type annual growth in 202 vincent andrews would like our opinion on timer economics he asks given the recent run up in dap prices are you at all concerned about your farmers defering application thanks vincent look our experience has been and if you look even at this spring with the covid uncertainty that farmers will put fertilizer on their fields according to their needs and and you know frankly today with precision agriculture they are more likely to put the right amount of fertilizers on every year so you know and phosphate prices frankly also are a very small piece of the overall cost of running a farm so i do not believe that most farmers will look at phosphate pricing and have it changed their application but i would also highlight the falsely prices are still very affordable when you look at where grain and oil seed prices are so as with most fall seasons we would expect that whether it will be a m the main arbitrator of demand and you know with expecting an early crop maturity this year we expect we should have a good fall joc we have the three questions related to china and phosphate 1st vincent andrews asks what do you anticipate would be the chinese dap exports in the 2nd half of 2020 and what 2nd half 2020 that price does that assume that prices are higher or lower than your essentially what would happen to chinese exports thanks vincent chinese exports over the 1st half of the year were lower by about 800000 tons from last year now our base forecast calls for chinese exports to end the year about 600000 times lower in other words we expect that international pricing is a little higher world sent a few extra tons coming out of china in the 2nd half and if prices are higher than our expectations there might be a little bit more upside but we do not see significant upside and part of the reason for this is domestic demand is coming in fairly strong as we move into fall and i think the biggest sh there will be export availability limitations now obviously if our prices are lower than expectations you know the volumes could be even lower than what they are now goldstein and steve barnes both asked about productions specifically what is the status and outlook for reduced phosphate production at specific facilities in china and tunisia and do you expect as lower exports over the next several years well let me hit china 1st you know there has been a a well known shift towards shutting down some of the higher polluting plants particularly along the nc river and we have seen some of your that have resulted in production declines in the 1st half of the year in terms of chinese export volume over the next years we maintain the chinese exports will trend trend lower and we will establish a new normal i mean we have now seen what we think is the bottoming of chinese domestic demand and we are seeing a lowering of production so with that we will have to come a lowering of exports as they meet domestic demand for tunisia it would appear that expectations for plant research and resurgence of production in 2020 were somewhat overstated but it is also important to put tunisian context they have produced an average of about 750000 tons of dap and tsp over last five years per protests will certainly lead to shoveling of the rock production the business plagued them for over a decade so which means we would expect them to stay about the same run rate as we go forward as well joc the last section of questions really to potash global markets asked about the impact of palm oil demand on products what is the typical lag between movements and palm oil prices and changes in potus demand to southeast asia and hence the rebound in palm oil pricing resulted in increased products demand in thank you gentlemen the palm oil demand is important for potash and what we have seen recently is an improvement in palm oil prices and we know for production reasons they will be adding potash to their palm oil plantation so so we see that as a fairly direct relationship i would not say we see increased demand but we see demand that is getting back to its normal levels in terms of a longer term export demand and domestic demand for biofuels is helping in terms of optimism for recovery so all of these things mean that we should see a better demand for potash in the southeast asia region particularly malaysia and indonesia joel jackson and ben isaacson both asked to understand where global potash in in the various regions particularly in china thank you gentlemen if if we look at china there is there is sort of a bifurcation of inventory we know there is about 3500000 tons of the port but we believe there is relatively low inventories as we moved on the lab and so as we are now seeing a strong demand for npk is in the domestic market we do expect with the movements out of the port to those mpk clowns will start bringing down inventory levels assuming that the arrivals are about at normal levels compared to last year mark connelly and steve barnes are both interested in potash demand group what is driving the acceleration in potash demand in your podcast and other specific geography thanks i would not say we are actually forecasting an acceleration of potash demand our potash demand growth from a longterm trend is saying fairly steady at what we believe to be around three and if you take 2019 out of it i think we still have stay just on that trend and a related question if demand ends up toward the high end of your r range can you see increased supply balance in the market or would you expect the market to tighten well i guess this requires two things one the w w success of production ramp ups on the new projects particularly i guess but given the delays we have seen in rec recent years on these ramp ups it would see that the market should tighten actually if demand comes in buy and the bar expectation and the last related question also what is the bull case for potash pricing over a three to five year period thanks there is a number of factors that could create a bull run in potash prices and the 1st i have already mentioned which is slower around top of the projects particularly the ones in russia and bella russia but what we would really expect is probably a higher utilization rate of the north american assets over the next say three to five years and and a more modest rise in prices that would suggest prices appreciate slightly to where they were maybe in 2018 and utilization of assets goes off at the same time another i promised to they are both asking about the disconnect between pricing trends between brazilian that rallied off close in the 2nd quarter versus you asked themselves these asian mop prices that have continued to be some of the growers are strong resilient economics i am not so offset this week that is another region thanks brazilian farm economics are really outstanding at present which is certainly helping to underpin pricing in that market and we expect that to continue for the us and southeast asian markets i think it is important that we remember that this is a seasonally slow period for potash demand and that will impact prices i would also like to highlight that our summer field program was extremely well received and it is typical of commodity markets to necessarily see 1st a rebound in demand and then prices falling after that we have now completed our pre submitted questions and so now i would like to do is open it up to the audience for live q a operator thank you that is your reminder to ask a question you will need to dial star one on your telephone keypad to withdraw your question please press the pound key we will limit the question to one per participant to allow the other is questions to be addressed thank you 1st question comes from the line of adam samuelson from goldman sachs your line is open yes thanks good morning everyone so i guess i wanted to just follow up on on the affordability questions joc zero on phosphates and on your own kind of affordability metric that you publish we are now above long term average and just trying to think about where where you would see an upper limit to that and especially if if you think about next year and farmer income risks fr from governor government support programs in the us or lack thereof given kind of the big farmer support payments that have been serious both this year and last thanks adam welcome you know there is certainly a relationship between crop places and how people feel about the imports but as you say you know support payments from governments and whatnot have done a lot to keep farmers income at least stable and yes while we are pushing phosphate and potash prices probably not potash much but certainly phosphates a little bit closer to that ratio two things on this i would say is 1st of all you have got to look at december 21 prices and if you look at december of 21 prices i think we i think we would be looking at what 360 and nine 360 for corn and nine bucks for for being so they are they are going to see some reasonable prices on there if they sold forward into that market so there would be incentive to get a good crop and and use the fertilizer but in terms of the direct relationship between the two i would say you could easily go a standard deviation above that ratio and not have it materially affect demand thank you next question comes from the line of steve barnes with bank of america your line is open yeah just wondering if here whether or not you saw any impact on phosphate imports during during the month of july following the countervailing duty petition and just ask for an update on your your gypsum sales out of the euro gyp stacks in brazil any any update on that sure thanks steve 1st of all yeah in july i believe the imports were lower in july i i would have to get an exact number and get somebody to get back to you on on how much that was down but our understanding and we we did talk to a lot of customers and our understanding is certainly the the importers who were importing either the ocp or the russian products i definitely took a step back to understand what the risks might be in terms of them picking up some sort of countervailing duty risks so we we did see a step back in july whether they will come back into the market in the next couple of months i do not know what we have seen however is new products coming in from places like egypt and australia and mexico so it does say there is some some change i got out somebody to give me what was the 2nd part of your question there steve i missed the i missed my writing",
            "prediction": "good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the mossad company is 2nd quarter 2020 earnings conference call at this time all participants have been placed on listen

our 2nd quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday is form eight k filing as well as our commentary on the quarter posted to our website also contain information important on these non gap measures now i would like to turn the call over to jock good morning thank you for joining us today i will start with very brief comments then we will get straight onto your questions very good quarter for mesa and our momentum is increasing the key points about our performance are our cash flow generation this quarter is the result of the past five years of work by our team to transform our cost structure and strengthen our franchise we are succeeding even earlier than we expected we have already achieved five of our 7221 cost targets even with realized potash prices down $twenty per ton from the 1st quarter we have seen a significant increase in natural gas prices up just $thirteen per ton in the quarter we generated over 800000000 in cash from operations we delivered adjusted ebitda of 25 higher than consensus expectations even before our adjusted ebitda definition change we paid down $500000000 in short term debt and structured payables in the quarter while retaining cash on the balance sheet above $1000000000 in potash we continue to invest in the accelerated case project hitting a major milestone of connecting the k three shafts to the k one mill we continue to reduce our brownfield management costs and we achieve the lowest cash cost per ton of production in over a decade moses fiterman had an excellent quarter hitting both rial based cost targets and achieving further cost benefits from the weakening rial as well as realizing over eighty of our targeted full year transformation benefits phosphates drove the cash costs of rock below the target and lower than last year despite increasing distances from mining to beneficiation and with all of these efforts we have reaffirmed our commitment to you to our shareholders our employees our customers and our communities to act responsibly we announced new aggressive broad based environmental social and governance targets and we will use these targets to drive performance across the business we are continuing to trend i am going to give you an update on our 1st quarter accelerating earnings and cash flow clearly reflect our efforts to date and we are driving additional future savings we expect to deliver another $700000000 in savings above the 2019 base as we continue to execute our strategy mosaic is more competitive than ever before and with fertilizer markets improving we have significant earnings leverage to the future now we will take your questions i am going to start with some questions we received on costs adam samuelson from golden sachs asked in the 2nd quarter with a head of its 202021 targets and a number of its key cost kpis how much incremental opportunity do you see on each key metric to further reduce costs and if so what level of incremental capital spend would be necessary to achieve those outcomes thanks for your question adam as we said earlier we have new targets that include $700000000 of additional improvements across the company 200000000 of those coming from our brazil operation and 500 coming from our north american and and administrative some of the areas where we believe we can make big gains as we go forward obviously are in brazil where we continue to improve that business in north america where automation is allowing us to drive efficiencies in both fuses and so as we look forward we see a lot of opportunities still and importantly in september when we bring all of this to our analyst day we expect to be able to give you more color and detail on what that is going to look like chris parvinson from credit suisse asks you are clearly comfortably ahead on numerous cost initiatives including your k three shafts brian info frac site rock costs in the us and brazil and siderazanche is platform but when you take a step back how are you thinking about your structural cost base in a normalized environment and how much more could actually be done especially in frac site yes thank you chris it is important to keep in mind that these cost improvements certainly are somewhat driven by high utilization we have had a good quarter where we are able to use our assets fully and we have had some benefits from exchange rate particularly in brazil but also in canada over the long term though the real differences have been structural and those are going to stay with us and those are going to continue and we are going to continue to improve those so if we look at you know our major projects which include nextgen mining brasil transformation those are not temporary differences those are true structural changes that will be delivering value for the long term doctor michael pyke from cleveland research asks you mentioned that you were on track to exceed your 225000000 in non market growth in 2020 which segments are exceeding your expectations and how much higher can this number go for 2020 hello michael let me clarify our $225000000 were actual items that we spent in 2019 that we did not expect to repeat in 2020 so on those some of the key items the planet city like city islanding that is happened and now is outside of our cost structure our brazilians dams we have completed the work now and that $80000000 of cost is now behind us equally the ramp up of estero haze which has gotten better than we expected we now are delivering 1000000 tons a year from the k three project so that benefit has already flowed through to us and then of our $50000000 of transformation in brazil that we are part of that 225000000 we are already at over 40000000 so we see that as pretty much complete and ongoing savings will be above and beyond that original 225000000 i would like to address the larger number of questions that seek a better understanding of our countervailing duties petition death goldstein from morningside chris parkinson from credit suisse asked for an update on potential regulation changes of the us import duties on morocco and russian supply and if the outcome is successful in our favor what should they expect in changes to their landed us costs in other words thank you gentlemen let me start by saying we believe in free and fair trade however the reason we filed this petition in the 1st place was to address imbalances associated with unfair government subsidies on imports and to highlight unequal requirements on environmental standards we believe our competitors benefit from access to artificially low rock costs and energy while not having to meet our environmental standards we also will say that what we have done is put this forward to the department of commerce and the international trade commission they will judge on the merits and as such determine what level of duties if any need to be put in place to create a fair trade situation and quin do you have anything to add to this yeah no jock i think you are right we we certainly are ahead of schedule on the realization of the $225000000 in non market benefit this year you know keep in mind that the $80000000 that we spent on on dam remediation last year was spread really through the 2nd through 4th quarters so we realized about $36000000 in benefit in the 2nd quarter and should realize the balance throughout the rest of the year doctor john roberts from ubs would like to know can you review the basis for your phosphate counterbalancing duties position and have you had any response from customers or competitors thank you john our basis for the petition is clearly laid out in the public documents and i would ask that you go to those also the comments from any of our competitors or customers or the public thank you other concern groups is clearly laid out in those public documents so i would suggest you go there our position is clearly that the department of commerce and the international trade commission really are the ones that will decide what are the merits of this case now clearly as we talk to our customers some are concerned mostly about how they are going to get their supply we believe that this has opened up new opportunities for us well we have competitors coming in and making up some of that supply but in the end i think all people understand why we put it forward and you know we will have to wait to see what the itc says in terms of its merit so you know we received several questions asking about trade flows and implications to other markets specifically adam samuelson and seven others over the next six to twelve months how do we think about the net impact of potential changes in trade flows the trade flow impacts of potential us countervailing duties on morocco and russian federation do you see risk of market share competition rising in other major import markets notably brazil thanks mike and joell let us answer their last question 1st no we do not think this will impact global supply and demand all we will do is probably change trade flow the current market and resulting pricing is reflective of i think the tight market and if anything the countervailing duties only highlighted to people that this market was tight so what is causing the tight market favorable farm economics and lower supply which began to take shape well before we filed the petition however it is reasonable to assume that the trade flows will be altered and some product will be shifted to other jurisdictions including new suppliers coming into the us and the moroccan and i am a telephone supplier focusing on other markets which could be brazil or wherever jonathan oscard from bernstein asked two more technical questions with respect to the petition namely if the mosaic trade complaint is upheld will there be a retroactive benefit to mosaic and what is the timeline for final decision on the complaint so look thank you jonathan let me know so that is all i have to say clarify whether duties are applied retroactively will depend upon the level of imports from these two countries from the filing of the case until the doc preliminary ruling we expect the case to be finalized in q 1221 and at that point if there has been excessive imports they will look at assessing a retroactive duty ben isaacson from socio act on the cash costs of mine production in florida falling to $36 per ton from $forty year over year how much of that was due to transformational efforts versus favorable geology and how much more wiggle room is there to bring that down and how sustainable are these cost improvements we have certainly been running our assets at  elevated utilization rates and that is helped but our efforts to centralize mining operations streamline processes and automate have also helped reduce our costs as previously mentioned the establishment of a central control center for our mining and collapsing all of our mining operations basically into one large operation which should begin operation by the end of the year will really further enhance cost savings and as we introduce new management structures incorporate automation for certain mining functions and accelerate savings from adjustments to transportation we start to see real long term improvements in our cost structure dos pk jubakar from city also asks with the recent rise of over $fifty per ton in dapt pricing have you ramped up your production at the mine and what could be the benefits we can expect both tonnage high tonnage and high utilization rates to continue so we do expect to see better costs throughout the rest of the year both structurally and because of the changes in the 3rd quarter we also have a question from adam samuelson from golden gate press the specialty percentage rose to 48 of shipments and marks a new quarterly high in phosphates coincident with micro central shipments to peru being substantially above recent quarters is this sustainable why or why not thank you adam the sales of micros in aspire hit record highs and kmag we are close to the record in quarter 222020 among these growths microsencial shipments to brazil has been a major driver now we believe that the growth of microsencial will continue over the next quarter driven by mosaic forlarante and also north america i have to reemphasize the value that microsencial brings to the growers is showing positive returns for them on their investments so these are bringing real value to the growers and to our customers so we do believe that as more people start using micro essentials this is very sustainable and they are going to see the benefits and they are going to keep using that product so three analysts submitted multi part questions related to our potash operations so 1st chris parkinson asks the demand environment in potash appears to be modestly improving while spot prices are well off their 1st half low can you talk about your stock process thanks chris as you know we have accelerated the development of k three and this has an obvious impact on costs both now with declining brownfield management spending and in the future as the mine ramps up beyond k three we continue to see strong results from bell plain which recorded its lowest cost position as we move forward we are going to take advantage of owning two of only seven mines in the world with annual production capacity of over 3000000 tons and with some of the lowest costs in the industry so as we look to the future we intend to optimize the production coming from k three and from our bell plane operation and only see running higher cost mines like colomze if the market really requires it in the future another question comes to you from jonas oskar of burnstein in potash you lowered your cost per ton of fair bit but how much of that was simply spreading fixed costs over a twenty larger volume on a fixed volume basis what would your cost reduction be good question jonas there is no question that the larger volume helps spread out our costs however we believe there are structural changes that are fundamentally changing our costs over the long term we think one area of clear savings is the accelerated reduction of brine management costs as we shift to k three k one underground mining will be completed this year brine management accounted for $eight a ton in q two and that will continue to decline as we move into 2021 and will be eliminated completely by 2022 so as you can see a lot of our cost reduction is actually structural and should be with us for the long term jack p juubelcar from city asks what kind of savings we expect from sending k three pottash to the k one mill and what is the updated timeline now to shut down k one and k two thank you jack we expect to be sending pottash to k one and actually be shutting down our k one shafts from a production perspective early in 2021 that will start meaning we are only going to be operating one shaft two shafts and then by the end of 20222 only operating the one big k three shaft at that point the project will be complete we will eliminate bryan inflow and that really will be the end of our k one and k two plant mines from a production perspective doctor vincent andrews is interested in how he should think about our potash shipments in the 2nd half of this year given how strong shipments were in the 2nd quarter can you remind him of the accounting for the chinese contract shipments that were already in a bonded warehouse prior to contract agreement thank you vincent yes we did have strong shipments in quarter one and if i refer to our discussions with capitex i think they have a fairly full order book for q three and even going well into q four so i believe the shipments internationally will be strong in the 2nd half we are expecting a good fall in north america so we are expecting strong shipments there as well so from our perspective our 2nd half is looking pretty strong from a pottash perspective in terms of the shipments in the 1st half i would i would just like to throw it over to clint to explain a little bit about our china shipments to bonded warehouse that we rebroke in the 1st half of the year clint can you discuss that sure john and good morning vincent so to start with on a consolidated basis we do not recognize revenue until that product is sold to a 3rd party however we do on a segment level basis we do recognize revenue when camptech sells product to our distribution business in china and when they since the segment recognized revenue but that was based on an estimate of pricing since the contract had not been completed once the contract was completed and the price for that transaction was set that gave rise to the adjustment but again that is an adjustment on the potash segment only because we will not recognize revenue on that product on a consolidated basis until it is sold thanks for that clarification quin jack i am now going to move on to questions about mate for lazance we have four analysts including john roberts from ubs and mark connolly from steven who asked similar questions about the timing of volumes in brazil brazilian farmers are having an outstanding year so far and have been widely reported to be buying inputs well ahead of last year is schedule how much do you think the prices of soybeans will increase in the next six months i have been borrowed from the 3rd quarter and are we likely to see an offsetting reduction in 3rd quarter margins to reflect those lower volumes next quarter and specifically within the quarter april and may were significantly higher than the prior year month while june appeared to be much closer to a year ago is that just timing or are the trends decelerating into july great question the strong volumes in the 1st half of the year did reflect some forward input purchases as a result of generally favorable farm economics but year over year demand is expected to be up slightly to 37000000 tons and in that figure we believe we are beginning to take market share as farmers gravitate towards higher analysis products and high value products such as our micro essentials between volume driven cost improvement and operational structural cost change that should repeat with normal volumes thank you mark let me start by saying last year our operations were negatively impacted by the change in regulations that required us to shut down a couple of operations for dam improvements that reduced volume and impacted our raw materials access this year we were were benefiting running at full operations rates and this also has allowed us to have more access to our own rock supply so overall that has helped a little bit so about a 3rd of those costs are probably volume related the others are improvements to our freight our inventory management our overall planning and of course structural changes to our so to our cost structures i think overall though we are we are seeing long term changes how is the brazil business running we are starting to see full benefit of the $330000000 or so of integration benefit that we announced at the end of last year joss p j juvinac has a question about currency the brazilian real against the us dollar has fallen significantly year over year in the 2nd quarter of 2020 how did that volatility impact you and what specifically was the impact in the quarter on mesa for lavanca thanks p j i would like to talk about two aspects of the brazilian rei that really has changed things and the 1st of those of course is the impact on farmer economics i think that is actually the bigger improvement their ability to buy fertilizers and the continuous growth of the brazilian agriculture segment is largely driven by great economics for the farmer and so so that allows us to understand what is the real underlying improvement obviously there was some positive impact i think we saw definite improvements in our overall cost because of the rei and but i would say we focus more on what is so in the back you will notice sorry p j i would also like to point out that if you look at the back of our stuff you will see basically our sensitivities and  a one at ¢ten move in the rei amounts to about $20000000 a year unhedged so if we think about it as being about fifty hedged so it is fairly easy to do the reconciliation to last year is revenues for aiic you know again i have said this before but i will repeat you know the volume growth really was a result of improvement in farm economics in brazil the strengthening of the us dollar versus the real excellent barter ratios and anticipation of a strong summer crop demand so both both commodity and performance products have shown robust increases in quarter two of 2020 versus a year ago thanks chris look let us start from our own operations in brazil and then we can move on to the demand environment as well as any logistical headwinds you perceive during the peak fertilizer application season we have had a number of cases because of the high level of community transmission and we have not been impacted on our operations to this and we have then instituted a number of procedures to make sure we mitigate the spread now obviously there is going to be local places where that impacts us but in general we have been able to work around that and kept the product moving to the end customer and from a demand perspective despite covid we have continued to see strong demand again driven by favorable farm economics and we have got our product to our customers with relatively little impact the last question we received from joel jackson comes from joel jackson pedrolezante is 2nd quarter gross margin was more than double the results from the prior two years how much of that gain was market conditions versus foreign exchange tailwinds versus share gain in the market versus a pull forward of q three because of covid related logistics concerns thanks joel i would summarize our results in the 2nd quarter in brazil as a couple of factors 1st of all if we looked at the exchange rate it is probably offset almost perfectly the change in pricing so what we see in actual results is almost solely the result of our own actions and the reversal of some of the dam costs that we saw last year john roberts asks what are the capital allocation priorities moving forward and can you please discuss your growth debt level dividend and potential share repurchases and t j juvinacar asks beyond paying down some debt what could be uses of cash especially with improved free cash flow in the 2nd half of 2020 would buybacks be approved uses of cash thank you gentlemen our capital priorities are unchanged and they continue to be what we said in the past our you know our 1st priority is to maintain the business next priority maintain investment grade metrics and to do that you know we have to continue our normal capital plan as we have had we expect to lower debt by about a $1000000000 over the next few years doing so when our bonds come due in the next couple of years and then continue some of the key projects like the estherhazy acceleration k three acceleration and then what we have after that returning capital to shareholders we have also had a couple of questions from a by side analyst and they include can you describe what is included in the 610000000 of short term debts that you indicated will be paid in 2020 and does mesa still plan to keep about a $1000000000 in cash our cash balance and paydown is 221 maturity thanks for the question at the start of this year we did increase our cash balance to a $1000000000 by 1st of all taking out some money from our revolver and executing on some of our inventory financing debt since that time we have paid down the revolver and we will continue to pay down the rest of the revolver thank you doctor isaacson asks about our tax rate outlook why is your effective tax rate expected to be in the mid to high 50s and how should we think about this rate under a trump or biden presidency thank you ben let me start by saying the 1st part of this is and the reason for the tax rate being higher is our income mix between our three jurisdictions canada brazil and the u s at the details of that i am going to actually hand it over to clint to explain why the negative earnings in the u s will create a higher tax rate overall yeah thanks jock and and that is right it really comes down to and the tax rate is is is based on gap results by jurisdiction and when you look at the united states not only is our phosphate business incorporated into that but also our corporate dna our interest expense and so forth so there are times when that pre tax income in the us turns and that can begin to skew the rate when you then start to factor in things like some of the foreign currency moves that we have seen and how it affects our our mark to market and and some of the notable items that that we have on our schedule that begins to skew it and then you know as you have seen brazil improved this year that is our highest rate tax jurisdiction so so that begins to influence that rate as well so really it is the combination of all of those things that resulting in an unusually high tax rate for this year and then i would add two things one on on a longer term basis we would expect that effective tax rate to be somewhere in the mid to high 20s but then i would also call to your attention that our cash tax rates and payments are much different than that matter of fact this year we expect to  end up with a  small cash tax refund so very different than the the effective tax rate in our  financial statements now let us move on to market related questions mike pike asked if we could comment on our summer fill programs in the us and where we see downstream inventories in the us at this point thank you michael i think we have had fairly successful fill programs in both phosphate and potash here in the us recent discussions that we have had with our customers suggest that we are not alone in our concerns about supply chain disruptions they are probably in the range of sixty full for the fall season so there will be increased buying towards the fall season but for the most part our customers are in reasonably healthy shape going into that fall volume higher in the 3rd quarter any expectation for volumes for the rest of the year thanks steve i would characterize q three as largely having our order books full for both phosphate and potash and so it will be a matter of delivery and revenue recognition that will determine where we are for quarter three but we expect a reasonably good fall in the us and global markets are running well so so it will be a matter of delivery and revenue recognition that will determine where we are for quarter three but we expect a reasonably good fall in the us and global markets are running well so both phosphates and potash we expect relatively normal two to three volumes in both and then for the rest of the year we should also see a good stable volume joash mark connelly would like insight into greater oilseed price implications how important to molasses earnings outlook are higher greater oilseed prices if the current price of corn is sustained through 2020 and soybeans stay at or near their current prices do you think there is any material for higher p and k prices in the market thank you mark clearly oilseed and grain prices do have implications for us but in general the farmers tend to work a lot more on their needs to plant so what is a lot more important to us is planting intentions number of acres planted and remember also the grain and oilseeds are just a few of the products that we fertilize so it really depends what does the whole global market look like and what is the demand for pnk and what is the supply balance there as opposed to something on the grain and oilseed it has an indirect impact but i would say no direct impact on our pricing vincent andrews from morgan stanley wants to know about our market forecast given that the last ten years of pnk shipments show some pattern lumpiness potash more than phosphate we tend to forecast on annual growth simply because some of the other factors that go into the lumpiness of our business are impossible to forecast and those are you know really inventory movements globally and of course weather you saw in 2019 the weather impacts in the eu i think that the application of the method made a fundamental difference to the growth rate of both phosphates and potash on a global scale so we really have to look at it on averages but recognize that there will be lumpiness as we go forward thanks ben the answer here is simply that the average selling price in portezuela case is based on all the components we sell including urea and platts both of which are down significantly so when you look at that relationship going forward you have to take into account all three products that could be in our blends that we sell doppler serving margin is we track that because that really is what do we get after the cost of raw materials and transport as as revenue so of course this flows directly into our margins an improvement in stripping margin that really is almost directly related to our overall profitability all i can really say there is if you look at it historically other than the last say three years where there has been a real increase in imports we have seen nola prices being similar to nola prices to other global prices and i would expect that under a more fair trade market that is what you would see is you would see the nola price being equal to what the prices are in other markets adjusted for the transport costs and that is exactly what we expect will happen after a countervailing duty case if they re adjust that market jock seed byrne would like more insight into our global phosphate demand outlook and its relationship to inventory swings specifically what is your estimate of underlying global consumption of phosphate in 2019 and was it below the shipment for 71000000 funds did it reflect channel inventory builds thank you steve if we look at 2019 there was no question that there was buildup of global inventory particularly in the us i mean in the us there was a poor season and the imports in particular kept coming in we shut down our louisiana operation for a number of months last year and and still the inventory build in the us was was very high likewise the brazilian inventory i was probably slightly above normal coming into this year for maybe some of the same reasons but what i will say is in the 1st and 2nd quarter of this year we have largely cleared out all of that inventory and probably have moved from an area of high inventory in phosphates as we move into the 3rd quarter of this year thanks steve yeah in terms of 2021 what we really see is the inventory levels should be pretty much leveled off and we expect normal growth in the market as per any other year so that is a two type annual growth in 2021 vincent andrus would like our opinion on farmer economics he asks given the recent run up in dapt prices are you all concerned about us farmers deferring fall applications put fertilizer on their fields according to their needs and and you know frankly today with precision agriculture they are more likely to put the right amount of fertilizer on every year so you know and phosphorus prices frankly also are a very small piece of the overall cost of running a farm so i do not believe that most farmers will look at i would also highlight that phosphate prices are still very affordable when you look at where grain and oilseed prices are so as with most fall seasons we would expect that weather will be the main arbitrator of demand and you know with expecting an early crop maturity this year we expect we should have a good fall joss we have three questions related to china and fosfate 1st vincent andrews asks what do you anticipate will be the chinese dap exports in the 2nd half of 2020 and what is the 2nd half of 2020 dap price does that assume that the dap prices are higher or lower than your assumption if the dap prices are higher or lower than your assumption what would happen to chinese exports 1st half of the year were lower by about 800000 tons from last year now our base forecast calls for chinese exports to end the year about 600000 tons lower in other words we expect that international pricing is a little higher we will incur a few extra tons coming out of china in the 2nd half and if prices are higher than our expectations there might be a little bit more upside but we do not see significant upside now obviously if our prices are lower than expectations yeah the volumes could be even lower than what they are now des goldstein and steve byrnes both asked about production specifically what is the status and outlook for reduced phosphate production at specific facilities in china and tunisia and do you expect lower exports over the next several years well let me hit china 1st you know there has been a well known shift towards shutting down some of the higher polluting plants particularly along the yenisei river and we have seen some of that here that have resulted in production declines in the 1st half of the year in terms of chinese export volume over the next years we maintain that chinese exports will trend trend lower and we will establish a new normal i mean we have now seen what we think is the bottoming of chinese domestic demand and we are seeing a lowering of production so with that will have to come a lowering of exports as they meet domestic demand for tunisia it would appear that expectations for a plant restart and resurgence of production in 2020 were somewhat overstated but it is also important to put tunisia in context they have produced an average of about 750000 tons of dap and tsp over the last five years current protests will certainly lead to shuddering of their rock production but this has plagued them for over a decade so which means we would expect them to stay about the same rand rate as we go thank you for the forward as well just a quick follow up on the last section of questions relates to pottash global markets as steve byrn and seth goldstein asked about the impact of palm oil demand on pottash what is the typical lag between movements in palm oil prices and changes in pottash demand in southeast asia and has the rebound in palm oil pricing resulted in increased pottash demand in southeast asia thank you gentlemen the palm oil demand is important for pottash and what we have seen recently is an improvement in palm oil prices and we know that for production reasons they will be adding pottash to their palm oil plantations so so we see that as a fairly direct relationship i would not say we see increased demand but we see an improved demand thank you so export demand and domestic demand for biofuels is helping in terms of optimism for recovery so all of these things mean that we should see a better demand for pod ash in the southeast asia region particularly malaysia and indonesia we have a global product inventory stand in the various regions particularly in china thank you gentlemen if we look at china there is there is sort of a bifurcation of of inventory we know there is about 3500000 tons at the port but we believe there is relatively low inventories as we move inland and so as we are now seeing a strong demand to npk is we have a significant opportunity to fill that gap mark connolly and steve byrn are both interested in potters demand group what is driving the acceleration in potters demand in your forecast thanks i would not say we are actually forecasting an acceleration of potash demand our potash demand growth from a long term trend is staying fairly steady at what we believe to be around three and if you take 2019 out of it i think we still stay just on that trend in a related call well i guess this risk requires two things one it was the success of production ramp ups on the new projects particularly i guess yurakom is valakomy and yousalsky but given the delays we have seen in recent years on these ramp ups it would seem that the market should tighten actually if demand comes in behind our expectations projects particularly the ones in russia and belarus but what we would really expect is probably a higher utilization rate of the north american assets over the next say three to five years and and a more modest rise in prices that would suggest prices appreciate slightly to where they were maybe in 2018 and utilization of assets goes up at the same time another of our product related questions from adam samuelson and ben isaacson they are both asking about the disconnect between pricing trends between brazilian mop that rallied off lows in the 2nd quarter versus us and southeast asian mop prices that have continued to week lower are strong brazilian economics enough to offset this weakness in other regions which is certainly helping to underpin pricing in that market and we expect that to continue for the us and southeast asian markets i think it is important that we remember that this is a so seasonally slow period for podash demand and that will impact prices i would also like to highlight that our summer fill program was extremely well received and it is typical of commodity markets to necessarily see 1st a rebound in demand and then prices following after that we have now completed our pre submitted questions and so now i would like to do is open it up to the audience for live q a operator thank you as a reminder to ask a question you will need to press star one on your telephone keypad to retrieve a question please press the pound key we will limit the questions to one per participant to allow others questions we stand by while we compile the q a we are now above long term average and just try to think about where you would see an upper limit to that and especially if you think about next year and farmer income risks from government support programs in the us or lack thereof given kind of the big farmer support payments that have been experienced both this year and last there is certainly a relationship between crop prices and how people feel about the imports but as you say you know support payments from governments and whatnot have done a lot to keep farmer incomes at least stable and yes while we are pushing phosphate and potash prices probably not potash so much but certainly phosphate is a little bit closer to that ratio the two things on this are on this 1st of all you got to look at december 21 prices and if you look at december 21 prices i think we i think we would be looking at what 360 and not 360 for corn and nine bucks for for beans so they are they are going to see some reasonable prices on their if they sold forward into that market so they would be incentivized to get a good crop and and use the fertilizer in terms of the direct relationship between the two i would say you could easily go a standard deviation above that ratio and not have it materially affect demand during the month of july following the countering vessel duty petition and just asked for an update on your your  gemstone sales out of your  gipstax in brazil any any update on that sure thanks dave 1st of all yeah in july i believe the imports were lower in july i i have to get an exact number and get somebody to call me back thanks dave but our understanding and we we did talk to a lot of customers and our understanding is certainly the the importers who were importing either the ocp or the russian products i definitely took a step back to understand what the risks might be in terms of them picking up some sort of countervailing duty risk so we did see a step back in july whether they will come back into the market in the next couple of months i do not know what we have seen however is new products coming in from places like egypt and australia and mexico so it does say there is some some change  i got to ask somebody to give me what was the 2nd part of your question there steve i missed the missed in my writing",

            "reference": "token good morning and welcome to the 1st quarter 2020 general electric company earnings conference call my name is brandon and i will be your operator for today at this time all participants are in a listen only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session during which you can dial star one if you have a question please note this conference is being recorded and i will now turn it over to steve whitaker vice president of investor communications you may begin sir thanks brandon good morning and welcome to ge is 1st quarter 2020 earnings call i am joined by our chairman and ceo larry culp and cfo carolina dybeck happe before we start i would like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available on our website note that some of the statements we are making are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today as described in our scc filings and on our website those elements can change as the world changes with that i will hand the call over to larry steve thanks good morning everyone we hope you and your families are healthy and safe our thoughts are with all of those affected this global pandemic we recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone on behalf of ge i want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical community many of whom we are privileged to call our customers working tirelessly to protect all of us thank you when we last spoke during our outlook call in march we were encouraged by the continued strength and aviation in healthcare and the progress made in power renewables in the eight week since the world has fundamentally changed as we all know the covid nineteen pandemic evolved rapidly hitting hard and hitting fast while this is an earnings call our goal today is to provide you with the most current and relevant information we have and as always to be as open and transparent as we possibly can so forgive us if we run a little long today the covid nineteen dynamics at ge like the economy at large are fluid and still evolving but clearly challenging in the near term with that i will start with our response to covid nineteen carolina who is joining our earnings call for the 1st time will cover the financials then i will wrap with a more in depth view of our current operations moving to slide two during this unprecedented time we will focus on three areas 1st the health and safety of our employees and our communities we established a covid nineteen taskforce that are working to ensure we are doing everything in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with the various government directives and medical advisories in real time to that end we have encouraged those employees who are not directly performing customer facing essential jobs to work from home wherever possible but given the mission critical work we do at ge not everyone can stay home i would like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers supporting essential services like hospitals power generation airlines and national defense we are ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely this includes temperature screenings face coverings and gloves as necessary and physical distancing all keeping with national state and local guidelines i am also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other we recently established an employee relief fund and more than 75 senior leaders across ge have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis our 2nd priority is continuing to serve our customers in healthcare we are ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose and treat covid nineteen patients including respiratory ct monitoring solutions x ray anesthesia and point of care ultrasound product lines already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the end of june healthcare is digital and ai solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients at once and automate road tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused on life saving work across all of our businesses we are in constant communication with employees customers suppliers and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption our 3rd priority is preserving our strength 1st and foremost sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains a key focus with the recent closing of the biopharma transaction we received $20000000000 of net proceeds this provides ge with optionality t to protect our company and remain flexible and importantly we retained a $17000000000 leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem striving for precision health preserving our strength in a time like this also requires a different operating model here i draw on my experiences as ceo managing through 911 and the global financial crisis there are three steps in this model embrace reality redefine winning and execute the plan easy to say hard to do starting with embrace reality this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed and remains uncertain for us it means recognizing that we are facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may be for awhile we wish it were otherwise but that is not our reality next redefine winning we came into 2020 with a plan to define winning as profitable growth margin expansion and cash generation now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team let me share some ways we are doing this while safety has always been a top priority for ge covid nineteen has reshaped our safety agenda in terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and decremental margins in the 2nd half are key focus areas and in healthcare we clearly did not come into the year expecting to increase our ventilator production fourfold but we will and finally execute the plan we are moving with speed discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure it is already more than 2000000000 of cost actions and more than 3000000000 of cash actions and this is where lean is particularly relevant from daily management to traditional kanban systems which help reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools we are rolling out across ge let me share a recent example from gas power in our greenville facility the team use lean to cut the distance that a single part travels during production from three miles yes three miles to a mere 165 feet slashing the time it took to make that part by 42 these are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this environment so that is our approach here we are facing the pandemic head on while continuing to execute our longterm strategy for ge moving to slide three you will find a snapshot of our 1st quarter results and carolina will take you through this in detail but 1st a few top line thoughts as i noted we entered the year with momentum however as covid nineteen continued to spread globally and i am not going to sugar coat this we got hit hard in some of our highest margin parts of our best performing businesses this is especially true at aviation services where covid nineteen costs are rapid decline in commercial aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the 2nd half of march a similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions caused by covid nineteen impacted our field personnel and across all of our businesses we started to see some project fulfillment and execution issues at the same time healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used in the fight against covid nineteen taking a step back about eighty of our roughly $100000000000 backlog is in services which have a long time horizon and while services have been hurt in the near term those capabilities remain one of our greatest strengths they keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships especially through periods of volatility so in the spirit embracing reality let me frame for you what we are seeing right now at a high level and then i will do a deeper dive after carolina reviews the 1st quarter in aviation and at gecas airlines are conserving cash not flying the planes they have limiting maintenance spare spend where they can and all the while deferring orders in many places no one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume but the reality is likely it is not soon so we are redefining winning for margin expansion in 2020 to improving our detrimental margins this year which re requires we aggressively adjust our cost structure that is what winning looks like for aviation and they are moving forward with a comprehensive plan to be clear we will get back to targeting those twenty operating margins post pandemic in healthcare we have been on the front line combating covid nineteen since the early days in wuhan this is fundamental to our mission while we have seen demand surge for certain products other products including those in our high margin pharmaceutical diagnostics business have been negatively impacted as multiple procedures are deferred healthcare is likely to rebound faster than aviation but we are still fast tracking additional cost out actions targeting an incremental $700000000 since kieran and the team spoke with you in december in power and renewable energy the impact of covid nineteen has been more limited to date specifically at power we are experiencing outage delays and restrictions and field service travel and we are monitoring new unit orders and services to offset this we are further rightsizing the cost structure and in power we already reduce head count by 700 in the 1st quarter now clearly across ge there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point including the full duration magnitude and pace of rec recovery across our end markets operations and supply chains we are also monitoring how the resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations and our run off insurance business so let me tell you what we do know the 2nd quarter will be the 1st full quarter with pressure from covid nineteen and we expect that our financial results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year the bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead but this too shall pass i am confident the underlying reset we took over the last eighteen months to focus ge is portfolio and instill a greater focus on customers and lean give us a running start for what we face today moreover i see in our response to covid nineteen signs of how we are moving faster to change ge for the good more lean work to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges in aviation travel restrictions spurring on the use of remote digital technology to complete field work and renewables and more capital discipline across the board with new leaders assimilating faster and with real impact healthcare comes to mind so all of this in combination with the planned actions we will discuss later are accelerating our transformation of ge with that i will turn it over to carolina but before i do let me say how pleased i am to have her on board in two short months it is clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and operational bias for action and executing with speed thank you larry i am proud to join my 1st call as cfo of ge and help lead this company forward as you are noted we are operating in unprecedented times and we are focused on 1st keeping our financial position strong and safe with a keen eye on leverage and liquidity as well as cashflow and capital discipline while ge is actions over the last couple of years have put us on a stronger footing ahead of this situation we will do more 2nd working with our businesses to take the right action not only to help mitigate the impact of covid nineteen but to serve customers better operate smarter and more efficiently and integrated lean more holistically while larry and i are focused on the near term we are also managing for the long term we are working together to reduce complexity at ge adding a lean culture that delivers sustainable earnings and cashflow generation today my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that help you see what i see across the businesses with that let us turn to slide four this was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated taking it from the top 1st quarter orders were down three organically or down four ex biopharma growth in power and healthcare was effect by double digit decline in aviation and renewables both equipment and service orders were down below single digit i will cover this by business shortly industrial revenue was down five organically or down six ex bio pharma is equipment revenue flat and services down nine both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to covid nineteen adjusted industrial profit margins were down 450 basis points organically most of the came from aviation or renewable with aviation impact mostly driven by covid nineteen now let us discuss starting at continuing etf of ¢zero72 there was a ¢zero75 gain primarily related to the 11500000000 after tax gain can from the biopharma side which also included one of tax benefit in ge capital this was partially affect by a 4600000000 after tax loss on our remaining baker hughes which will measure at fair value each quarter on restructuring and other items we incurred ¢two of charges is this principally related to the reduction of aviation is us workforce lastly non operating pension and other benefit plans were ¢six headwind in the quarter excluding this item adjusted tax was ¢five as described earlier our earnings performance was materially impacted by covid nineteen and other market dynamics this was primarily in aviation and ge capital line with negative marks and impairment in both gecas and insurance as well as higher credit costs we estimates the 1st quarter industrial operating profit impact from covid nineteen roughly 700000000 drivers included lower aftermarket sales project delays and supply chain constraints this impact is higher than anticipated at the march outlook call reflecting the rapid global progression of the pandemic but our prior forecast largely reflected the slowdown in china our focus on addressing this pandemic is global we are targeting more than 2000000000 of cost out this year while this may not affect the full impact we are rapidly addressing both costs and cash to making our businesses more agile and customer focused over time i can tell you from my experience that as this program builds momentum and the company leaders begin to see how powerful results can be they tend to extend beyond their stated goals with just what i have seen so far i am encouraged that we can have some of that same experience at ge moving to cash as many of you know the 1st quarter is typically low for our free cashflow this year we are impacted by our usual seasonality but also covid nineteen especially in aviation industrial free cashflow flow was use of 3200000000 worse than prior year that is notably excluding aviation each industrial business improved free cashflow versus last year turning to the key drivers in the quarter starting with net earnings if you exclude the bio pharma and the mark to market on our baker hughes investment income depreciation and amortization total 700000000 that is down 900000000 versus prior year next working capital 2600000000 asa significant use of cash down 1100000000 let me take you through the main factors 1st we had the net inflow in accounts receivable driven by seasonally lower volume in gas power and renewables 2nd we had an outflow in accounts payable driven by lower volume in aviation and higher disbursements related to primary end material buys in renewables 3rd the increased inventory to support an expected 2nd and 3rd quarter volume run in onshore wind and shop output declined aviation 4th progress collections there were a use of cash as new orders and milestone payments were more than effect by burndown of prior progress payments in power and renewables lastly we also spent about 600000000 in gross capex we are on track now to reduce 25 of our capex spend this year for cashflow in total we estimate the 1st quarter impact from covid nineteen of around 1000000000 the majority of which was health and aviation as we look forward we expect continued free cashflow pressure retargeting more than 3000000000 in cash action however over time we know that each business can be a better cash generator as we improve execution moving to slide six we continue to strengthen our balance sheet largest in the quarter was closing bio pharma the 20000000000 we ended the quarter with 33800000000 of industrial cash up approximately 16000000000 sequentially ge capital and with the 13500000000 of cash down approximately 5300000000 sequentially driven by contractual maturity we continue to hold a liquidity balance covering twelve months of ge debt maturity the risk that we take in action to enhance and expand our liquidity and pay down debt on april seventeen ge entered into a three year 15000000000 syndicated revolving credit facility this was the planned refinancing of ge is prior 20000000000 syndicated revolver credit facility including bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of 20000000000 in total credit line access going forward following the sale of bio pharma we also improved our liquidity profile in april we reduced our near term debt maturities by issuing 6000000000 in ge debt in april and subsequently tendering for 4200000000 of debt the plan to use the remaining 1800000000 of proceeds to further debt reduction and the combination of transaction will therefore be leverage neutral following this ge cap ge industrial has no debt maturities in 2021 1900000000 of maturity in 2022 and 900000000 in 2023 as ge industrial will reduce debt by approximately 7000000000 we reduced commercial paper use by 1100000000 in the quarter and repaid 6000000000 of the intercompany loan from ge to ge capital in april using proceeds from bio pharma at ge capital we reduce debt by 4000000000 but we reduced external debt by 10000000000 year to date including 4700000000 of maturities in the quarter and an additional 5400000000 of 2020 majorities tendered in april offset by ge is 6000000000 repayment for the intercompany loan our financial policy goals remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than twofive times net debt ge industrial and less than four times debt to equity at ge capital our credit rating in the single a range and reinstating a dividend in line with peers over time we remain committed to achieving our leverage targets but we now expect to achieve those targets over a longer period than previously not due to the impact of covid nineteen next on slide seven we will discuss industrial segments results starting with aviation as you have noted our 1st quarter results were materially impacted orders are down thirteen organically with both equipment and service orders down equipment orders were down 27 primarily driven by commercial ngs business due to the max grounding and the covid impact services orders were down four primarily driven by commercial services partially offset by military which one you fighter helicopter service orders from the us dod service orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders which were up sixty year over year backlog of 273000000000 was flat sequentially and up 22 versus prior year primarily driven by long term service agreement this included roughly 201 day unit order cancellations in the quarter revenue was down eleven organically equipment revenue was down seventeen we shipped 472 commercial installed and spare engine units this quarter down 37 versus prior year sale of 272 one a and one b units were down 152 and cfm 56 units were down 98 units service revenue was down eight due to commercial services down eleven this was driven by lower spare part shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of covid nineteen total military revenue was down seven with 146 engine unit shipments down nine and this was driven by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound material is partly offset by the enhanced programs gross operating profit was down 39 organically primarily on lower volume and negative mix pressure in commercial services from the impact of covid nineteen and low spare engin units segment margin contracted 650 basis points organically this was primarily due to covid nineteen impacting our commercial businesses in both engines and services the continued 737 max grounding the non repeat of prior year favorable contract adjustment and the 1st full quarter of revenues from our aero derivative business now that we have de consolidated big issues add a bit more color covid nineteen represents just over half of the year over year margin difference 7737 max timing considering install and spare engine volumes and supply chain exact costs represent additional twenty of the world moving to healthcare which performed well orders were up nine organically equipment orders put up forty and up one healthcare order excluding were up six driven by a surge demand related to covid nineteen this was partially offset by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related to covid nineteen examples like mister and intervention in healthcare systems as well as contracting their nuclear tracers in pharmaceutical diagnostics life sciences orders were up ten backlog was 17400000000 down six sequentially and down three versus prior year due to the sale of marijuana so excluding biopharma battler was up one sequentially and four versus prior year revenue was up two organically and one excluding biopharma healthcare systems revenue was up two with services and three with equipment flat life sciences was up four operating profit was up ten organically segment margin expanded 140 basis points organically or thirty basis points excluding biopharma this was driven by volume and cost productivity offset by price and logistics pressures from covid nineteen next on power we had mixed results with equipment top line strength offset by challenges in services orders were up fourteen organically gas power orders were up eight with equipment orders up 37 largely due to one turnkey order you booked twotwo gigawatt of orders for nine gas turbines gas power service orders were down three with contractual services down and transactional upgrades roughly flat power portfolio orders up 27 with strong equipment and services orders instant and power conversion backlog tilted 85000000000 flat sequentially and down one versus prior year backlog was 71000000000 of that sequentially revenue was down twelve organically largely driven by services in gas power revenue was down twelve gas power equipment revenue was up four organically on higher hitch turbine mix we shipped nine gas turbines versus zero sorry we shipped seven gas turbines versus nine gas turbines in the 1st quarter of nineteen we helped our customers it is a promotional brazen over 32 units translating to almost fourseven gigawatts of new power added to the grid gas power services revenue was down nineteen strategy outages this and transactional sales pushed out of the quarter due to covid nineteen and we had no revenue on higher margin upgrades despite this services would still have been down in quarter this was driven by supply based constraints on hot gas path parts and outage costs overall pressuring our suicide margin rate power portfolio revenue was down twelve this was driven by lower volumes across the sub segments and still we had lower services back low convertibility in nuclear the decline was driven by outage timing and in power conversion we find our sales permitted focused on higher margin market segments operating profit was down 239000000 and segment margin contracted 570 basis points organically the gas power fixed costs were down nine sequentially and versus prior year this was more than offset by lower service volume and additional costs from covid nineteen disruption next are renewables continued revenue growth was more than offset by fulfillment and execution issues impacting profitability orders were down eleven organically equipment was down eleven as we cycle a stronger and services were down 23 a positive spot in the quarter was international orders which were up eleven backlog of 26500000000 were down four sequentially but up five versus prior year revenue was up 28 organically this was mainly driven by onshore wind up sixty onshore equipment revenue was up 81 with the new unit turbine deliveries of 731 more than double prior year and repower kit deliveries of 219 up forty on shore services revenue excluding the power kits was up fifteen on short order pricing index continues to stabilize at one in line with recent trump grid revenue was down eight mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones driven by covid nineteen operating losses was down 115000000 this was driven by the supply chain disruptions due to covid nineteen for delays and the non recurrence of the non gain non cash gain from an offshore wind contract termination in the prior year this was partially offset by higher onshore wind volume segment margin contracted 210 basis points mainly driven by the same items mentioned above and during range of execution issues with fixing at grid and hydro moving to slide eight starting with the capita in the quarter adjusted continue operations generated a net loss of 118000000 this excludes the impact of the capital loss tax benefit utilized against biopharma gain resulting in 88000000 of earnings compared to prior year which excludes excludes the tax reform benefit continuing net earnings was unfavorable by 154000000 this was due to negative mark and impairment at and insurance lower gain and lower earnings from a smaller asset base this was partially offset by lower excess interest costs and as we ended the quarter with 101000000000 of assets excluding liquidity this was down 1000000000 sequentially primarily driven by due to asset sales depreciation and collection partially offset by new volume insurance assets were flat sequentially as the decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily by higher market rates with effect the annual issuance and the capital contribution supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continue to migrate to mufg as noted earlier capital ended the quarter with 13500000000 of liquidity capital also ended with 54500000000 of debt which was down 4500000000 sequentially driven by death majority discontinued operations generated a net loss of 164000000 which was unfavorable versus prior year by 200000000 if they plan to provide the required support to ge capital in line with insurance statutory funding next just like our businesses corporate needs to adjust our new realities and we are continuing to take additional structural action to rationalize costs and reduce the size at corporate looking at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were 374000000 eight higher but that is primarily due to higher inter company profit elimination which was partially offset by better digital performance from continuing cost reduction actions sanctions and operations were 25 lower primarily driven by ge digital improvement you can see from digital is performance that the focus cost reduction programs are getting traction they continue to right size our function costs across ge and push more accountability into the division larry and i are conducting costs and cash reviews of each of the businesses with fresh eyes in the current environment so you can expect that there will be more to come stay tuned i have spent most of my career in leadership at many decentralized companies fundamentally i believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers businesses to take the right actions quickly this type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with covid nineteen but also to be prepared to be able to grow we are working toward this goal and there will be more to come with that back to you larry thank you there is no question that covid nineteen is putting real pressure on our businesses given that so much has changed and this quarter will be our 1st full quarter with pressure from covid nineteen i would like to spend some time here discussing 2nd quarter trending based on what we are seeing through the month of april so starting with aviation on slide nine of all of our industrial segments this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely the rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets we will cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail but on the other end of the spectrum demand for our military business remains strong to that end we have re rebalanced some of our capacity to meet this increased demand to offset some pressure in the commercial business we are taking several steps that while painful preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve we have previously announced 500 to 1000000000 in cost in cash actions and we have now increased this targeting more than 1000000000 in cost actions and more than 2000000000 in cash actions this will be achieved through different initiatives some of which have been completed others in flight as we speak these include a ten reduction in aviation is total us workforce and furloughs impacting fifty of its us maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufa will continue to monitor and potentially extend as required we are also focused on reducing the discretionary and capex spend and optimizing working capital i know aviation is detrimental margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors and karolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter while we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the 2nd quarter our expectations are that the cost actions we are undertaking will improve detrimental margins in the back half of the year while there are many uncertainties i expect that we will exit the year with a much lower detrimental margin than what you saw in the 1st quarter so make no mistake driving improvement here is our number one focus as we think about the full year we are tracking travel restrictions carrier and passenger behavior disease countermeasures and freight demand all of which will impact aircraft departures and revenue passenger kilometers while we are seeing an unprecedented decline in 2020 we are taking action and david and the team are working proactively with our customers to navigate through this crisis so spending a little more time on commercial services which represented $3300000000 of revenue in the 1st quarter let us go to slide ten as you can see on the left side departures across the full industry were strong in the 1st quarter before rapidly declining in mid march as we look at it this week focused on the ge and cfm fleet global departures are down approximately 75 roughly sixty of the cfm fleet is parked today in line with this we are also seeing significant headwinds in global shop visits which were down low double digits in the 1st quarter as airlines to 1st short term maintenance and we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better with some potential to moderate in the latter half of the year depending on the variables just outlined based on what we are seeing through the month of april in the 2nd quarter we are seeing shop visits down roughly sixty and csa billings down roughly fifty additionally we expect this significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure our csa margins that said when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time ge is well positioned with the largest and youngest installed base of all engine manufacturers additionally roughly 62 of our ge cfm fleet has she has seen one shop visit or less and this will generate demand upon recovery we have more narrow bodies that are ten years or younger than than the narrow body installed base of the rest of the industry and when we see a pickup in air travel demand we expect narrow bodies will recover most quickly overall it was a challenging quarter and we are expecting additional pressure here in the 2nd but our cost actions will alleviate some of the pressure in the 2nd half of 2020 moving to commercial engines which represented $1500000000 of revenue in the 1st quarter in light of covid nineteen airframers are producing at a lower rate based on what we are seeing through the month of april in the 2nd quarter we see installed engines down roughly 45 and spare engines down roughly sixty year on year attributable to the delivery deferrals in addition to the already planned lower production rate on the 737 max in the near term we are right sizing production capacity and actively managing the supply base we have very strong relationships with the airframers and an attractive value proposition is evidenced by a multi year backlog as you will see on the right we have strong positions sole source on two of the biggest new engine entrance and a 65 win rate on the other while we acknowledge that there is pressure on near term demand for new aircraft these stats demonstrate the customers see the value of ge technology we are taking the right actions to be well positioned for the post pandemic world moving to healthcare which consists of healthcare systems and pdx in the 2nd quarter to date we are seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment and the diagnosis and treatment of covid nineteen within healthcare systems now these product orders including ventilators have increased onefive to two times versus pre pandemic levels but at the same time we are seeing reduced demand for other diagnostic products as certain procedures are deferred or canceled around the world to be clear these other diagnostics are still essential and often associated with saving lives in areas including oncology and cardiology but are currently deprioritized pdx is a similar story this is a high margin business made up of contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with procedures that are being deferred or canceled right now several hcs product lines and most of pdx is down as much as fifty versus pre pandemic levels while these dynamics vary by country there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies experience different stages of the virus taking china for example as hospitals come back online we are seeing a ramp in previously deferred procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables healthcare is accelerating its plan transformation to ex to expand margins post biopharma by reducing headcount fixed costs discretionary spend and marketing spend prioritizing r d differing capex and optimizing working capital looking forward we are most focused on the following indicators for healthcare hospital admission and and occupancy rates and increase in non covid nineteen procedures changes in hospital capex budgets government spending on healthcare broadly and development of covid nineteen tests treatments and vaccines based on our experience in china and the market in april we expect to be down in the 2nd quarter with potential recovery afterwards covid nineteen has highlighted the need to build and truly invest and and scale a new digitized infrastructure and quickly we are committed to our investments in our digital edison platform and solutions like mural virtual care solution which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous ventilated patients simultaneously helping to expand their capacity while reducing their risk of exposure as our digital healthcare journey continues we are at the center of an ecosystem striving for precision health i am very proud of the work our team is doing to combat covid nineteen moving to power on slide nine on slide thirteen we will talk to the current trending in the 2nd quarter to date and dynamics at gas power and power portfolio starting with gas power equipment while we are monitoring and managing supply chain disruptions as of today we still see a path to 45 to fifty gas turbine deliveries this year but our orders profile and therefore cash down payments were several $100000000 or likely weaker due to ipp pressures in the us and mexico as we expect that deal financing will become harder through the year additionally with oil price pressure impacting middle east and ssa investment including demand for new lng we are expecting a longer road to normalization ultimately we are sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin of creative backlog with disciplined execution in services approximately twenty of planned averages are shifting from the 1st half of this year due to covid nineteen field labor constraints we are also seeing pressure on upgrades primarily in the middle east where low oil prices are impacting customer budgets we are seeing ge gas turbine utilization in the us up mid single digits due to low gas prices and the shift from coal but utilization globally is down low double digits due to lower electricity demand within power portfolio our steam business is most impacted factory closures pressured our steam operations including one facility in move on which was closed for approximately eight weeks in the 1st quarter today we are back up to more than seventy of capacity the global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in india driven by government restrictions overall we are seeing about thirty of outages shift from the 1st half of this year to the 2nd half with another ten fifteen pushing into next year our power businesses are taking several measures to offset these pressures in the 1st quarter where we reduced head count by 700 notified approximately 1300 contractors implemented a hiring freeze and in line with the demand profile we are taking even further actions this was serve to reduce six costs in 2020 and drive benefits in 2021 looking forward we are tracking a number of items including timing of our gas turbine new order closure service outages and volume leak utilization in the energy mix and fuel prices are impacting each region differently supplier impacts and project execution billing milestones and customer collections we are targeting to have our accelerated cost out measures drive organic margin expansion despite these demand changes moving to slide fourteen on renewables there was a limited impact of covid nineteen in the 1st quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution as we have said we think about renewables in three distinct operating pools starting with onshore wind while we continue to deliver at record levels in the americas we are seeing supply chain disruption at our lm wind facilities and we are monitoring key commercial milestones such as permitting and financing which could potentially cause timing delays in offshore wind certification for our industry leading turbine the haliade x remains on track we are also on plan to start delivering on our eighty unit six megawatt commitments to edf after completion of this project in 2021 we expect to start shifting production to the haliade x we are also monitoring financial closure of 2020 deals grid and hydro are two turnarounds are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half of our grid facilities now operating below full capacity and a grid automation were also impacted by lower book to bill order conversion across all three of these pools we are increasing cost down in restructuring and we have identified several $100000000 of additional actions longer term a lower cost structure will benefit renewables relating to the global supply chain we are focused on the safe reopening of our plants globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels looking forward we are expecting a larger impact of covid nineteen in the 2nd quarter and by business we are tracking twenty and 21 demand impact on progress collections and potential site delays in onshore wind the risk of financing delays associated with deals at offshore project site delays at grid and hydro and the backlog at grid on slide fifteen within ge capital our and insurance businesses are where we were feeling the largest impacts so i will keep my comments focused there 1st g cas is better positioned today than in previous downturns with better asset quality less customer concentration and more geographic diversity that said we are preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments as well as lease restructurings and we have had approximately eighty of our customers seek short term deferrals as you may have seen we agreed with going on a rebalancing of our 737 max order book 2nd at insurance market and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment portfolio and reinvestment yields therefore we are deploying capital to capture market dislocation investment opportunities we are closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year and similar to the industrial segments we are implementing incremental cost and cash actions looking forward we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales at g cas and insurance our seasoned teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period so to close our priorities are clear we rapidly mobilized our team in the face of covid nineteen with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees and overall the priorities we reviewed with you at the outlook call remain intact we are into our near term realities while continuing to manage ge for the long term when the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century our team is rising to the challenge with humility transparency and focus we continue to deliver value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential goods supplying vital healthcare equipment and keeping the lights on and while there are many unknowns there will be another side planes will fly again healthcare will normalize and modernize and the world still needs more efficient resilient energy at the same time we are embracing this new reality we are redefining winning and we are executing our plan the cost and cash we have taken you through this morning are a major result these moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multi year transformation to make ge a stronger nimbler and more valuable company and i am confident that ge will emerge stronger with that steve let us go to questions great before we open the line i would ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts again and ask one question and a follow up so we can get to as many people as possible brandon can you please open the line yes thank you sir we will now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press one on your telephone keypad if you would like to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key if you are on a speakerphone please pick up your handset 1st before dialing once again if you have a question please press one on your telephone keypad and from vertical research we have jeff sprague please go ahead thank you good morning everyone hope everyone is well thanks for all the the great details good morning jeff good morning i was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on how you you know kind of view the kind of the asset quality of the you know the contractual service agreements and the like right there is a lot of assets there obviously there is at least a temporary impairment of cash flows how does that test work have you done it yet and are are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should be thinking about jeff i i think if if we look at the th the service backlog right broadly just under $325000000000 for the company the vast majority of that $234000000000 is in aviation i suspect that is that is where you are most focused we we go through those those backlog reviews and the csa reviews on a regular basis what we have done here over the last call it the last 78 weeks is really tighten and quicken the review process that we do with the the businesses both at aviation and at gecas what we are trying to do is make sure we have got the latest and if you will most most accurate information possible with respect to customer risk given given everything that is that is going on so we we we do that on a regular basis we did that at the f at the end of the 1st quarter in in in closing much as we do every quarter clearly we have got a we we have got a fluid situation and i think the the modest charges that we took the modest changes in the 1st quarter clearly are going to play out as we go through the course of the year we can not really scope that for you today if you look at the csa book and aviation for example as we went through the the mechanics of the future billings the future costs related to those billings based on the information at the time it was really just 100000000000 d $100000000 adjustment non cash of course which is why you see a little bit of the earnings cash dynamic certainly as we go forward we are going to be updating those those adjustments and again w we would expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines are doing with with their planes but i think it is important to keep in mind again you know these these are ten to fifteen year agreements as you know and those adjustments are take taken in the context of that particularly extended time period great thanks for that and just as a followup if i could i know you do not want to get real precise on guidance but you know you you are pointing us to a further decline in cashflow in q two which is not surprising quite quite frankly but could you bracket that at all for us what we should expect for for q two and you know any high level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint yeah jeff i i think that we we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and did not want to take a an attempt at at at framing formal guidance here today in light of all that is fluid and all that is is still evolving here and i think that the tack we took was really to try to to to share as much with you as as we possibly could in terms of the the april detail business by business and acknowledge that we are going to see a a more challenging 2nd quarter here given the full impact of of covid and the like but beyond that i think that is that is really where we are we we we know we have got to to get to work on the cost and the cash actions that is why you see us doubling that activity in aviation stepping it up elsewhere around the company so the the $2000000000 of costs the $3000000000 of cash will clearly help us later on in the year if those those actions take take root but for today i think that is really what we are that is what we know and that is what we are comfortable sharing great thanks best of luck larry thanks from morgan stanley we have josh pokrzywinski thanks jeff please go ahead josh your line is open josh you might be on mute josh you might be on mute josh josh are you there why do not we w brandon let us move on and come back to josh okay sure next question we have from bank of america we have andrew obin please go ahead yes good morning can you hear me good morning andrew yep yeah i can i can hear you yeah just a question on thank you so much and good luck to everybody so run rate minus sixty in terms of shop visits fifty in csa do you think you will continue to trend at this level in the 2nd quarter or is there a more downside andrew the i think you are referring to to page nine in the slide deck yeah there it is yeah i think this is what you know what we are seeing here yeah i i think this is what we are what we are seeing right now right and given given what the carriers have have said publicly what they are doing and we think these are these are good likely year end run rates to share with you we are again we are not trying to offer up a definitive view as to the next several quarters but this is you know this is what we are seeing right now in the 2nd quarter for sure and my my follow up question on engine sales i think minus sixty have we lost these or will these come back when the situation normalizes maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over the next couple of years thank you so much andrew we were we were ramping spares with with both the the leap one a a and the leap one b as the narrow body market was taking off typical early in the life of an engine activity w we are clearly seeing that soften not necessarily going to zero as preparations are being made for the return to service of the max right i do not think that that that opportunity is lost but i think like much of what we are seeing in aviation broadly it will be it will be pushed out for a few years and again i do not think we are taking a definitive view as to what year what quarter things get back to if you will a normalized 2019 level but we recognize the the discussions out there about this being a multi year recovery gradual slow like we are embracing that reality and that applies really across the portfolio both on the oe side as well as the aftermarket spares included thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe thank you likewise andrew thank you from melius research we have from melius research we have scott davis please go ahead hey good morning guys and welcome carolina thank you larry any good morning larry any any way to think about the cost actions as it relates to kind of structural versus more kind of pandemic short term related sure well i i would i would say scott as you well know that when we are in a we are in a mode like this you are you are you are moving as quickly as you possibly can almost anywhere that you can so if you look at what we have announced at aviation the doubling of those activities today the the the broadening across the company if you look at the the tally today there is a decidedly short term bias there that carolina and i are going to be working with the ceos over the coming weeks to transition to a more permanent action right if you look at what we did in aviation for example example in terms of the temporary lack of works that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure in that business on a variable basis to these shockingly fast changes in demand you might categorize that as as temporary we need to work through the changes on a more permanent basis that are required in in light of the the length of the recovery that we are looking at so we have confidence in these in these numbers that we are sharing today the $2000000000 of costs the $3000000000 of cash there is a bit of tactical bias today just given how fresh this is but we will be leaning in toward making more of them permanent recognizing that at the end of the day there will be a a bit of a mix be it be it headcount related discretionary spend on the cost side in addition to some of the working capital and certainly the the the capex reduction that carolina referenced the 25 reduction year on year so a lot going on and by no means is this these headlines today the the end it is very much a work in in progress okay that is helpful larry and we think you know that the $20000000000 kind of came to you pretty much about perfect timing but you know does that money just sit on the balance does that have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as is for the for the year can you or is it just such a big number you can start to parse some of it out to think of in terms of whittling down some of the you know debt that you can you can manage well we it it it it did come at a at a at a good time there is there is no question that is why we put the emphasis in in the biopharma set up on on on certainty right we want to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the the healthcare options carolina anything you want to add relative to kind of managing liquidity versus leverage right here i think that is yeah i i think it is it is important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared to like before covid and it is very important for us of course leverage is important but liquidity is very important and we end the quarter with $47000000000 cash right and that is really to cover $13000000000 of ge and ge capital long term debt maturities now through 21 and actually after the april actions we are down to $13000000000 of maturities for twenty and 21 almost all of that in in capital and i would also say that we expect to have around $20000000000 in total credit lines going forward and that is really in line with our risk appetite we have the new $15000000003 year rcf that i mentioned and $5000000000 either will be on 20000000000 credit lines i think we are just so that you know we we really intend to maintain a high level of cash i would say to maximize flexibility and that is why we are taking these actions also to de risk our balance sheet and basically prudently manage our liquidity in these very challenging external environment and time that that makes sense and thank you and good luck to you guys thank you thanks scott be well yeah let us try josh pokrzywinski again from morgan stanley please go ahead sir hi there can you hear me this time yes yes clearly josh good morning awesome and and hope everyone is is well to echo earlier comments w larry can you just give us a sense and i i know you guys have data going back eons in in aviation how the impact of of retirements and cannibalizations you know kind of make more of a a u shape versus you know what you know the the air traffic may look like is is there a natural lag between when folks start flying again and when when shop visits can happen just as a function of kind of using up some of the runtime on on otherwise idled assets well josh you know certainly we have we have revisited the history the team is is well versed in in what we have seen in years past i am not sure we have we have seen anything kind of on par with with this but there is there is no question that there is there is going to be a bias on the part of some as some of these fleet reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft and that will factor into the to the aftermarket much like some of the dynamics around green time and how you are in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash in in in their business so i am not sure that there is necessarily an exact model that captures what all the carriers in aggregate are going to do here a model that offers great precision i think we do know that this that the combination of these factors is going to create pressure for us a force here in the short term i think what is most important for our business really is is cycles much more so than reverend revenue passenger miles and as we see schedules come back as we work our way through the pandemic that will that will put us back on i think better footing but here in the short term i think we are acknowledging that we are going to see shop visits and csa billings take on some real pressure due to the downturn understood thanks i will leave it there from jp morgan we have steve tusa please go ahead thanks josh hey guys good morning hey steve good morning good morning in in in early march you guys had that slide that showed you know $two to $4000000000 in you know free cash flow guidance which is obviously off the table but you also talked about things growing in you know 21 and 22 and you know off that kind of $3000000000 base i think you know most research and numbers i saw were kind of in that you know $6000000000 range of of free cash flows to kind of growth off of that level are are we still like is is are the iata numbers still at all legit or is that you know are are you kind of withdrawing that long term outlook as well steve i think we have admittedly been on taking the right actions both the costs the cash the the balance sheet actions here in the short term in the face of this this unprecedented dyna pandemic we have taken guidance off for the year we are not putting it back on today just given the given the undue un uncertainty of it all right so i i do not i do not think we are trying to get out any further than than that i appreciate the question but i think for purposes of today we are really just trying to frame for folks what what we are seeing but that said however long it takes us to work through this i think we feel very good about our ability to come out stronger and get back on a on a positive cashflow growth trajectory got got it and carolina anything you would add to that well no i think it is important to to acknowledge that by taking out cost now and part of it being structural that gives us sort of self mitigating the decremental that helps improving the incremental the the the outer years i mean that would depend on the recovery on the industries as well so so that is that is i would say almost impossible to to speak to today r right and and i guess how much on that is structural costs side yeah yeah steve yeah go ahead yeah no i am just just eleven other point i think worth mentioning i mean i think what we are acknowledging here is that assistance played out in march and and what we are seeing already in april right it it really is hitting hitting us from a mix a mix perspective hard our highest margin businesses are really feeling it here i would think that on the on the recovery we would see we would see it swing the other way when we get back and come off a bottom we should have positive mixed effect really across the across the board particularly in aviation and healthcare yeah y your your 2nd question steve is relative to the cost actions and how much permanent how much not permanent yeah i i know i guess how much is that going to cost you i mean like you know to come up with two to $3000000000 of of cost and cash you know you have done you you cut your restructuring last year pretty significantly needed a couple 100000000 in the 1st quarter i mean most companies kind of one for one what how much is this stuff going to cost you this year on a cash basis yeah i i think what we have said previously we were going to be down off of last year from a from an expense and from a cash perspective i think we are we are probably going to end up more or less in line right keep in mind that some of the cost actions like furloughs do not carry a restructuring charge with that right because they are not permanent so part of what we are trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary costs but all the while if we can we can make more structural moves we want to make sure we have got room to do that but i would say right now assume that it be relatively flat year on year but as carolina indicated in her remarks we want to try to do more if we can great all right thanks all that that is all i have guys thanks steve from ubs we have markus mittermaier please go ahead all right good morning larry carolina and steve let me maybe follow up on the on the aviation marcus good morning hey good morning within the year so in your q ten q you have referenced the iata numbers of 48 rpk reduction if if and i know obviously fly dollars and rpks are are two different stories but is that sort of a a kind of scenario that you are playing through internally and and i am just trying to get a sense of what that would mean if we look at our sort of like nineteen aviation cash as a baseline sort of like where you know on on that type of scenario we could end up particularly you know looking at sort of what you have mentioned in your prepared re remarks that you have i think 62 of of engines still ahead of shop visits one which arguably are the engines that are on the narrow bodies coming back 1st because they are probably the youngest the youngest in the fleet right right and so i am just trying to get a sense for within the year how you are thinking about that well i i i think that given what we what we highlighted relative to the the the april experience and the near term projection of that there is no question that we are going to continue to see the pressure on on cash at aviation that we have seen here of late right and that that will be our undoubtedly our our biggest headwind no sure sure sure but you know the the you know sh shop visits we heard sort of the the numbers that you that you said but did you do sort of internal internal stress test around w where you could end up or is that is that just something that you say it is it is too early to comment no no no there is there is there is plenty there is plenty of of of planning for again a an extended slowdown here we are we are we are embracing this reality to the fullest extent possible we are not expecting this to bounce back in in the near term so we we we flag in the queue the iata numbers we also reference others you see it in our own departure data here in april right we are we are we are way down that has a direct feed into shop visits csa billings and the like so we are we are we are adapting to this new environment confident that it will recover so we are marcus we are we are simply not trying to assume that that the the pressure abates anytime soon witness the the cost and the cash actions that we are taking sure okay no i appreciate that and may maybe as a followup quickly on on the capital side do you anticipate any change in the in the capital support there for for insurance in particular you you you referenced that a little bit in the prepared remarks i think 2000000000 is sort of the current number how are you thinking about that at the moment on the current support to capital yeah on the insurance yeah let us yeah let us take a step back then so in nineteen the capital had an infusion from ge of 4000000000 right and the estimate for for this year is 2000000000 on the insurance funding and those 2000000000 you know they are significantly lower than the year before we estimated that the will need to support roughly variables are still open and that depends on ge capital itself right ge capital earnings the the the capital and the asset liquidity levels but basically it is about 2000000000 as it looks now and i would also say going forward followup we do continue to to anticipate further funding and that will be again through a combination of ge capital itself through their asset liquidity and their future earnings and on top of that possible capital contributions from ge thank you from cohen and company we have please go ahead yeah thank you good morning guys good morning two question two questions so morning at at aviation it sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up the spares business the aftermarket the $15000000000 commercial aftermarket business will lag asm growth because of you know a younger fleet emerging you know a surge of used serviceable material and the like part outs and obviously lower spares provisioning as the oe rates come down thirty to fifty i guess 1st question is when do you anticipate aviation free cashflow getting to break even is it even possible before calendar 22 in that in ty type of environment and then i have a followup i am not i am not sure we would buy into the premise per say right i mean we we we are a cycles business much more so than than any other indicator and those cycles are going to have to come back before the passengers do a as you indicated the age of the fleet will will help us over time there could be some short term headwinds but we will we will we will see how that plays out i think i think what we are acknowledging here is that we have been hit from a free cash perspective in our kind of our our our biggest and best cash generator at at aviation but we are really not getting into much more much more in terms of the the the pre cash forecast on on a multi year basis it is just too soon there is just too many moving pieces for us to to be that forward leaning at this point we wish we could be it is just it is just not where we are okay and just a followup you know obviously 2020 is a tough year we are going to have some cash burn 2021 unclear but certainly does not seem like in aviation we are going to have a strong recovery any so so as we emerge from this we are going to have you know more leverage and i i guess the question is you guys have made some asset sales to de leverage what else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore that is different than what you have done over the past year thank you well i would i am not sure i would say that there is a lot that is no please carolina i i was i was going to say that to do things that we have not done well i i i would say in the last couple of years yeah well i i would just i would just say at at at a high level we we are committed to our de leveraging target of less than twofive times on the industrial side and i think you have seen us make a lot of progress year to date which i hope underscores the seriousness of of of that objective both on the ge side right i think it is 7000000000 of of debt reductions in the quarter and capital i think it is up to ten on on a year to date business given given some of the things we did in april clearly it is going to take us a a a while longer here to hit those targets like i i suspect most most companies but in terms of doing anything new or different i think we are going to continue to try to run these businesses as as best we can be as disciplined as we can on the capital front be be be smart and thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations like like pension as you have seen us relative to the plan design and and some of the settlement options so i am not sure they are necessarily new plays per se but we will continue to to look at at every and and every option available to continue to strengthen the company strengthen the balance sheet bring those leverage levels down in the face of of covid nineteen carolina i am sorry i jumped in there anything to add there i would just add that to the leverage comment also the liquidity that at times like this you know you do look at the liquidity and i think it is important to say that you really want to maintain a high level of trust to maximize the flexibility and you have the de risking activities that we have made to sort of push out the debt and for the year so thank you yeah and i and i i but i but i think to that i mean it is just important for us all to remember we we ended the quarter with 47000000000 of liquidity on the back of the bio pharma action and some of the other things that we have done so we will we will continue to be nimble and and flexible mindful of of of our obligations and our reality okay and from barclays we have julian mitchell please go ahead hi good morning maybe just a question around good morning julian good morning maybe just a 1st question around the the working capital dynamics and the free cashflow at aviation i guess yeah there is a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales down draft you get a working capital cash offset to an extent and then it reverses whenever the sales come back could you just update us on how you see the working capital cash impacts at ge aviation sort of in the early stages now in this downturn what you would expect to happen to working capital when things recover and if there is ma any major difference on the cash dynamics of the power by the hour type service relative to the ad hoc spares activity at aviation julian i would say what working capital part yeah on on with respect to working capital i i think our our our primary challenge is really inventory at aviation right we we came into this year knowing we were going to have to adjust to a different schedule with the max chasing the the step up at at airbus with the 320 neo while dealing with a good bit of of of past due on the commercial side both both oe and aftermarket while having pretty good military demand to to to contend with that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from a from a cashflow perspective was in inventory at aviation in in the quarter so that that is where we are going to be most focused trying to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies adjust to th these production schedules the lower aftermarket requirements while continuing to take care of a military business it that that is a that is a complex supply chain undertaking but the team as you can imagine is keenly focused on using some of the lean tools working with our supply base to make sure that we not only take the cost out of the business but bring those inventory levels down in in in light of current current demand but should we expect so i guess i i understand yeah is there a 2nd part to your question i i may have missed that i think we are on a little bit of a delay here yeah so i was trying to understand i guess you know in aviation you have the the you have the drop in ebitda in a downturn and the recovery in ebitda in the in the early part of the upturn i was just trying to understand on capital is that cash impact counter cyclical or is it pro cyclical so you are you are getting the working capital outflow through the downturn as well as the ebitda decline i understand the the the the high level dynamic there that you are alluding to i i think right now the the simple reality at aviation given the pressures and the cross currents is that it is a and we need to work to improve it how much of a a tailwind could it be kind of at this point in the cycle i think it is too early to tell we we we have we have got to get on the improvement path 1st julian to be able to take that potential and and deliver it in the financials as a reality thank you and then my 2nd question was just around the the operational issues so i think it sounds like the cost out tailwind should build through the year but in q one you had some operational issues in in power on the on the service side you know steep decrementals even with the fixed cost down sixteen renewables the margins were down despite a big revenue increase so i guess what is the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of these cost savings over the balance of the year well i think you have to take it business by business right if if you look at what happened in power clearly the the push out by customers because of their own site restrictions and by us on the back of the travel restrictions really pushed a lot of high margin revenue out of the quarter and probably out of the 1st half that was on top of some cost pressures of of our own making which we need to we need to improve upon but i think in in in power i believe that the team is doing a very nice job working off the the the so called inheritance taxes driving real cost improvements you see that in the head count reductions here in the 1st quarter and as we get to a more normalize service environment i think you will continue to see that that turnaround continue to to take flight i think in renewables julian it is a it is a different dynamic yes we had phenomenal revenue growth in the quarter doubled the the on shore turbine deliveries here in the u s got a little bit of a little bit better price got a better point of price which is encouraging to see but it is by nature a a very low growth margin business so the growth is not high calorie unfortunately we had a a a a few what we think are one offs but they are not one offs until they go away permanently cost and execution issues all the while the the turnarounds in hydro and grid are are i think moving forward but it is early days and they have a a number of inheritance taxes that will take a few years to to work through so i i think the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate those turnarounds in power and renewables they are dealing with different dynamics in the respective businesses and that is really why i think i have the the the confidence to say that you should expect the decremental margin sequentially to improve that the restructuring and cost actions should present themselves in in in pro in improved decrementals in the back half but we have got work to do to to make that to make that happen great thank you from wolf research we have nigel please go ahead thanks julian hi good morning everyone and carolina great to see you on board so look we appreciate all the color and and slides and you bet additional color in in the in the queue so is is larry is it now a base case that industrial free cashflow will be and maybe just address the risk of significant you know cash burn this year or you know is there enough on the on the cost out and and the working capital side to maybe mitigate some of that pressure and keep the industrial free cash relatively steady yeah i i i think what i think what we are trying to to share this morning nigel is that probably three things one we we have we have been very we have been hit hard and fast here right in some of our most important highest margin businesses be it aviation in services particularly gas power services pdx and and healthcare we think that that gets gets worse before it gets better particularly here in the 2nd quarter with a full a a full effect it is uncertain as to how things play out from from here we are going to acknowledge that uncertainty hence the the the the the pulling of the guide but we are not going to sit back and hope that it all passes we are not going to take the view that we have got a sharp v bounce coming hence the the 2000000000 of of cost actions we have talked about and the 3000000000 of of cash actions we are going to do everything we possibly can to to control our destiny here without impairing the the long term value and the long term trajectory of our company so we are telling you what we know today we wish we we knew more but that is really the state of play right now and and the approach the headset that we are taking to it okay i appreciate that larry thanks and then you know i thought one of the one of the real highlights of the quarter was the underlying strength of the healthcare margins you know ex even ex biopharma you know especially given some of the headwinds you face in there so we are seeing strength in small equipment and and pressure in big iron how does that mix look though when when you look at the the the the mix on smaller you know patient monitoring equipment et cetera versus the big iron how does that equipment mix play out to the margins well we we we certainly i i think the the key thing to keep in mind nigel is the the big iron certainly got hit the the the lower the lower ticket the the lower price points be it patient monitors ventilators and the like certainly got quite quite a boost but it is a sm it is a small part of the of the of the business so there was a little bit of mix there but but not a lot it was really more a function you know frankly of of the team doing a nice job more broadly recognizing that absent biopharma we needed to tend to the core cost structure in all its form in the hcs business right we we have been growing healthcare biopharma leading the way we got some good margin support from that business the last several years well now as we think about the $17000000000 core the team is really i think put their sights the last couple of quarters on growing that business growing it with a creed of margins and it is really the cumulative effect that that i think you see a bit here in the 1st quarter before we we we got hit we got hit a little bit later not as much you will see more of that unfortunately here in the 2nd quarter but i think you have got a team who thinks that like many other med tech companies they can grow mid or low to mid single digits over time and put more digital into the mix better cost that should give us the opportunity to grow with a creed of margins along the lines of what laid out in december and i i have no less conviction about their ability to do that today than than we did when we made that presentation again mindful that we have got some gyrations here in the in the near term to deal with right okay thanks larry good luck hey thanks nigel hey brandon thanks nigel we we are at the bottom of the hour so brandon we are at the bottom of the hour so we can just take one more question sure from rbc capital markets we have dean please go ahead thank you good morning everyone wishing everyone good health and add my welcome to carolina thank you hey just good morning dean good good morning just two questions both aviation lot of discussion about structural cost out and larry would be interested in how have you balanced the the structural cost out in aviation with rifts and and balancing the rifts and furloughs versus how you might be compromising the ability to bounce back when it does ramp back up so that is the 1st question and then the 2nd one just to make sure i heard it correctly were there did you quantify the lead cancellations in the quarter i know there was delivery deferrals our experience in 2008 was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations because customers would lose that non refundable deposit so what is the expectation here in terms of engine cancellations that is it for me thank you d dean maybe i will take the 1st part of that and and perhaps carolina can take the 2nd i i think we are mindful ever mindful that there will be a recovery right and we and we want to be well positioned for it because it is going to be very good business for ge for for decades but i i think we are really trying to again embrace our reality and take the the cost actions in the aftermarket business and more broadly at aviation mindful that we have got a period of time here of an unknown duration but it is it is not going to be measured in months right where that business is going to be under considerable pressure so after a period of time as as the aftermarket has has grown as it has the last the last decade this is going to give us an opportunity to to rethink to re to to consolidate all the while mindful of our obligations to customers the nature of how the footprint has changed the changes that are probably still still still coming so there there are a number of variables it is it is very much a a work in progress as well but i think we have got line of sight to build on some of the temporary actions to to take permanent action to make sure that we we have a lean cost structure with adequate capacity to to come out of the the downturn here well positioned to perform both for customers and for investors thank you we will now turn it back to steve for closing remarks well do you want me to answer the question on yeah yeah 2nd question go ahead carolina sorry go ahead yep yeah go ahead go ahead carolina yeah you were right because i actually mentioned that in my in my notes that i left in our backlog which was flat sequentially and up 22 versus prior year that did include roughly 200 order cancellations in the quarter but i would say the progress refunds are very small so far but on top of that we also saw right so we have g cast cancellation in april so that will be reflected in the 2nd quarter aviation backlog great th thanks everybody i know i know it is a long call and a busy day so if you need more just reach out to us and and best of luck thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference thank you for joining and you may now disconnect",
            "prediction": "good morning and welcome to the 1st quarter 2020 general electric company earnings conference call my name is brandon and i will be your operator for today at this time all participants are in listen only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session during which you can ask questions please note that this conference is being recorded and i will not turn it over to steve winneker vice president of investor communications you may begin thanks brandon good morning and welcome to ge s 1st quarter 2020 earnings call i m joined by our chairman and ceo larry culp and cfo carolina diebold before we start i d like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available on our website note that some of the statements we re making are forward looking and are based in our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today as described in our secc filings and on our website those elements can change as the world changes with that i will hand the call over to larry thanks steve good morning everyone we hope you and your families are healthy and safe our thoughts are with all of those affected by this global pandemic we recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone on behalf of ge i want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical community many of whom were privileged to call our customers thank you when we last spoke during our outlook call in march we were encouraged by the continued strength in aviation and healthcare and the progress made in power and renewables in the eight weeks since the world has fundamentally changed as we all know the covid nineteen pandemic has evolved rapidly hitting hard and hitting fast while this is an earnings call our goal today is to provide you with with a comprehensive update on our progress so forgive us if we run a little long today the covid nineteen dynamics at ge like the economy at large are fluid and still evolving but clearly challenging in the near term with that i will start with our response to covid nineteen carolena who is joining our earnings call for the 1st time will cover the financials then i will wrap with a more in depth view moving to slide two during this unprecedented time we are focused on three areas 1st the health and safety of our employees and our communities we established a covid nineteen task force that is working to ensure we are doing everything in our ability to protect the health and safety and in aligning with the various government directives and medical advisories in real time to that end we have encouraged those employees who were not directly performing customer facing essential jobs to stay home we are encouraging work from home wherever possible but given the mission critical work we do at ge not everyone can stay home i would like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers supporting essential services like hospitals power generation airlines and national defense we are ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely we are asking all employees to wear temperature screenings face coverings and gloves as necessary and physical distancing all keeping with national state and local guidelines i am also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other we recently established an employee relief fund and more than 75 senior leaders across ge have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis our 2nd priority is continuing to serve our customers in healthcare we are ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose and treat covid nineteen patients including respiratory ct monitoring solutions x ray anesthesia and point of care ultrasound product lines already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the end of june healthcare is digital and ai solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients at once and automate routine tasks i would like to speak to you today about the importance of preserving our strength 1st and foremost sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains a key focus with the recent closing of the biopharma transaction we have received many inquiries from our stakeholders i want to assure everyone that we are focused on life saving work and across all of our businesses we are in constant communication with employees customers suppliers and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption our 3rd priority is preserving our strength 1st and foremost sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains a key focus with the recent closing of the biopharma transaction we have received many inquiries from our stakeholders i want to assure everyone that we are focused on life saving work and across all of our businesses we are in constant communication with employees customers suppliers and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption this provides ge with an optionality to protect our company and remain flexible and importantly we retain the $17000000000 leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem striving for precision health preserving our strength in a time like this also requires a different operating model here i draw on my experiences as a ceo managing through 911 and the global financial crisis there are three steps to preserving our strength in a time like this embrace reality redefine winning and execute the plan easy to say hard to do starting with embrace reality this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed and remains uncertain for us it means recognizing that we are facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may be for a while we wish it were otherwise but that is not our reality next redefine winning winning is not just about achieving financial targets winning is about delivering value to our customers shareholders and communities finally execute the plan we need to execute the plan with discipline focus and determination we need to take calculated risks and embrace change we need to work together leverage our strengths and overcome our weaknesses thank you we came into 2020 with a plan that defined winning as profitable growth margin expansion and cash generation now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team let me share some ways we are doing this while safety has always been a top priority for ge covid nineteen has reshaped our safety agenda in terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and decorative margins in the 2nd half are key focus areas and in healthcare we are working to ensure our facilities are safe and our patients are protected we clearly did not come into the year expecting to increase our ventilator production fourfold but we will and finally execute the plan we are moving with speed discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure targeting more than 2000000000 of cost actions and more than 3000000000 of cash actions and this is where lean is particularly relevant from daily management to traditional kanban systems which help reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools we are rolling out across the globe let me share a recent example from gas power in our greenville facility the team used lean to cut the distance that a single part travels during production from three miles yes three miles to a mere 165 feet slashing the time it took to make that part by 42 these are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this environment so that is our approach here we are facing the pandemic head on while keeping the lines of production moving moving to slide three you will find a snapshot of our 1st quarter results and carolina will take you through this in detail but 1st a few top line thoughts as i noted we entered the year with momentum however as covid nineteen continued to spread globally and i am not going to sugarcoat this we got hit hard and some of our highest margin parts of our best performing businesses this is especially true at aviation services also covid nineteen caused a rapid decline in commercial aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the 2nd half of march a similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions caused by covid nineteen impacted our field personnel and across all of our businesses we started to see some project fulfillment and execution issues at the same time healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used in the fight against covid nineteen taking a step back about eighty of our roughly $400000000000 backlog is in services which have a long term horizon and while services have been hurt in the near term those capabilities remain one of our greatest strengths they keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships especially through periods of volatility so in the spirit of embracing reality let me frame for you what we are seeing right now at a high level in aviation in at gca airlines are conserving cash not flying the planes they have limiting maintenance there spend where they can and all the while deferring orders in many places no one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume but the reality is likely it is not soon so we are redefining winning from margin expansion in 2020 to improving our decorative margins this year virtual we aggressively adjust our cost structure that is what winning looks like for aviation and they are moving forward with a comprehensive plan to be clear we will get back to targeting those twenty operating margins post pandemic in healthcare we have been on the front lines combating covid nineteen since the early days in wuhan this is fundamental to our mission while we have seen demand surge for certain products other products including those in our high margin pharmaceuticals we have seen a decline in demand as a result of the covid nineteen pandemic our business has been negatively impacted as multiple procedures are deferred healthcare is likely to rebound faster than aviation but we are still fast tracking additional cost out actions targeting an incremental $700000000 since karen and the team spoke with you in december in power and renewable energy the impact of covid nineteen has been more limited to date specifically at power we are experiencing outage delays we are monitoring new unit orders and services to offset this we are further right sizing the cost structure and in power we already reduced headcount by 700 in the 1st quarter now clearly across ge there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point including the full duration magnitude and pace of recovery across our industrial markets operations and supply chains we are also monitoring the situation closely the interest rate environment will impact pension obligations and our runoff insurance business so let me tell you what we do know the 2nd quarter will be the 1st full quarter with pressure from covid nineteen and we expect that our financial results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year the bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead but this too shall pass i am confident the underlying reset we took over the last eighteen months has been positive i see in our response to covid nineteen signs of how we are moving faster to change ge for the good more lean work to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges in aviation travel restrictions spurring on the use of remote digital technology to complete field work in renewables and more capital across the board with new leaders assimilating faster and with real impact healthcare comes to mind so all of this in combination with the planned actions we will discuss later are accelerating our transformation of ge with that i will turn it over to carolina but before i do let me say how pleased i am to have her on board and in two short months it is clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and operational bias reaction and executing with speed thank you larry i am proud to join my 1st earning call as the cfo of ge and help lead this company until we move forward as you noted we are operating in unprecedented times i will focus on 1st keeping our financial position strong and safe with a keen eye on leverage and liquidity as well as cash flow and capital discipline while ge is actions over the last couple of years have put us on a stronger footing we will do more 2nd working with our businesses to take the right actions not only to help mitigate the impact of covid nineteen but to serve customers better operate smarter and more efficiently and integrate loom more holistically while larry and i are focused on the near term we are also managing for the long term we are working together to reduce complexity at ge to be a lean culture that delivers sustainable earnings and cash flow generation today my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that help you see what i see across the businesses with that let us turn to slide four this was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated taking it from the top 1st quarter orders were down three organically or down four ex pharma growth in power and healthcare was offset by double digit decline in aviation and renewables both equipment and service orders were down low single digits i will cover this by business shortly industrial revenue was down five organically were down six x bio pharma with equipment revenue flat and services down nine both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to covid nineteen adjusted industrial profit margins were down 450 basis points organically most of the dilution came from aviation and renewable aviation impact mostly driven by covid nineteen now let us discuss the eps work starting at continuing eps of ¢72 there was a ¢75 gain primarily related to the 11900000000 of the tax gain from the biopharmaceutical which also included one of tax benefit in gilead this was partially offset by a 4600000000 after tax loss on our remaining baker hughes stake which we measure at fair value on restructuring and other items we incurred ¢two of charges this is primarily related to the reduction of aviation us workforce lastly non operating pension and other benefit plans were ¢six ahead within the quarter excluding these items adjusted ebit was ¢five the negative marks and impairments in both credit cards and insurance as well as higher credit costs we estimate the 1st quarter industrial operating profit impact from covid nineteen roughly 700000000 drivers included lower after market sales project delays and supply chain constraints this impact is higher than anticipated at the march outlook call reflecting the rapid global progression of the pandemic but our prior forecasts largely affected our focus on addressing this pandemic is global retargeting more than 2000000000 of cost out this year but this may not affect the full impact we are rapidly addressing both cost and cash and making our businesses more agile and customer focused over time i can tell you from my experience that as this program builds momentum and the company leaders begin to see how powerful results can be they tend to extend beyond their stated goals so with just that said i think that we can make a real difference in the world i am encouraged that we can have some of that same experience at ge moving to cash as many of you know the 1st quarter is typically low for our free cash flow this year we were impacted by our usual seasonality but also covid nineteen especially in aviation industrial free cash flow was a use of 3200000000 worse than prior year but notably excluding aviation each industrial business improved free cash flow versus lost yet turning to the key drivers in the quarter starting with net earnings if you exclude the biopharmaceuticals and the market to market on our bakery business huge investment income depreciation and amortization total 700000000 that is down 900000000 versus prior year next working capital 2600000000 for the significant use of cash down 1100000000 let me take it through the main factors 1st we had the net inflow 3rd we increased inventory to support an expected 2nd and 3rd quarter volume ramp in onshore wind and shop output declined in aviation 4th progress collections they were used or cash as new orders and milestones were reached we were more than affected by the burn down of prior progress payments in power and renewables lastly we also spent about 600000000 in gross capex this year we are on track now to reduce 25 of our capex spend this year for cash flow in total we estimate the 1st quarter impact from covid nineteen was around 1000000000 the majority of which was felt in aviation as we look forward we expect continued free cash flow pressure however over time we know that each business can be a better cash generator as we improve execution moving to slide six we continue to strengthen our balance sheet the largest milestone in the quarter was closing biopharma the 20000000000 of the quarter we ended the quarter with 33800000000 of industrial cash up approximately 16000000000 sequentially g a capital and ended we have recently taken actions to enhance and extend our liquidity and pay down debt on april 17th ge entered into a three year $15000000000 syndicated revolving credit facility this was a planned refinancing of ge is prior $20000000000 syndicated revolver credit facility including bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of 20000000000 in total credit lines access going forward following the sale of biofarmah we also improved our liquidity profile in april we reduced our near term debt maturity by issuing 6000000000 in ge debt in april and subsequently tendering for 4200000000 of debt we plan to use the remaining 1800000000 of proceeds to further debt reduction and the combination of transaction will therefore be leveraged following this gecap the industrial has no debt matures in 2021900000000 of matures in 2022 and 900000000 in 2023 at gecap we reduced debt by approximately 7000000000 we reduced commercial paper used by 1100000000 in the quarter and we paid 6000000000 of the intercompany loan from gecap to gecap in april using proceeds from biopharma our financial policy goals remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than twofive times net debt to ebitda and optimizing our cost structure next on slide seven we will discuss industrial segment results starting with aviation as we have noted our 1st quarter results were materially impacted orders were down thirteen organically with both equipment and service orders down equipment orders were down 27 primarily driven by commercial engines business due to the max grounding and the covid impact services orders were down four primarily driven by commercial services partially offset by military which won new fighter and helicopter service orders from the us dod revenue was stronger than revenues due to the military orders which were up sixty year over year a backlog of 273000000000 was flat sequentially and up 22 versus prior year primarily driven by long term service agreements this included roughly 201000000000 unit order cancellations in the quarter revenue was found eleven organically equipment revenue was found seventeen we shipped $472000000 install and spare engine units this quarter down 37 versus prior year sales of 272 lep one a and one b units were down 100 and fifty respectively service revenue was down eight due to commercial services down eleven this was driven by lower spare part shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of covid nineteen total military revenue was down operating profit was down 39 organically primarily on lower volume and negative mix pressure in commercial services from the impact of covid nineteen and lower spare engine units segment margin contracted 650 basis points organically this was primarily due to covid nineteen impacting our commercial businesses in both engines and services they continued 737 max grounding the non repairs of prior year favorable contract adjustments and the 1st full quarter of revenue from our aerodynamic business now that we have deconsolidated baker hughes add a bit more color covid nineteen represents just over half of the year over year margin difference 737 max timing considering the ongoing pandemic is expected to be later than previously announced costs for spare engine volume and supply chain excess costs represent additional twenty of the value moving to healthcare which performed well orders were up nine organically equipment orders were up fourteen and services were up one healthcare orders excluding via formula were up six driven by a surge demand related to covid nineteen this was partially offset by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related to covid nineteen examples like and mister and intervention in healthcare systems as well as contrast media and nuclear tracers in pharmaceutical diagnostics life sciences orders were up ten backlog was 17400000000 down six sequentially and down three versus prior year due to the sale of biowaah so excluding biopharma backlog was up one sequentially and four versus prior year revenue was up two organically and one excluding biopharma healthcare systems revenue was up two with services and three with equipment flat life sciences was up four operating profit was up ten organically segment margin expanded 140 basis points organically or thirty basis points excluding biofarma this was driven by volume and cost productivity offset by price and logistics pressures from covid nineteen next on power we had mixed results with equipment our top line strength offset by challenges in services orders were up fourteen organically gas power orders were up eight with equipment orders up 37 largely due to one turn to order we booked twotwo gigawatts of orders for nine gas turbines gas power service orders were down three with contractual services down and transactional upgrades roughly flat our portfolio orders were up 27 with strong equipment orders revenues in steam and power conversion were close to 85000000000 flat sequentially and down one versus prior year jack backlog was 71000000000 of flat sequentially revenue was down twelve organically largely driven by services in gas power revenue was down twelve gas power equipment revenue was up four organically on higher higher he edge turbine mix we shipped nine gas turbines versus zero sorry we shipped nine gas turbines versus the prior year we had seven gas turbines versus nine gas turbines in the 1st quarter of nineteen we helped our customers achieve commercial operations on over 32 units translating for almost fourseven gigawatts of new power added to the grid gas power services revenue was down nineteen strategy as outages and transaction sales pushed out of the quarter due to covid nineteen and we had lower revenue on higher margin upgrades despite this services would still have been down in the quarter this was driven by supply based constraints on hot gas path parts and outage cost overall pressuring our csa margin rate power portfolio revenue was down twelve this was driven by lower volumes across the sub segments instead we had lower services backlog convertibility in nuclear the decline was driven by outage timing and in power conversion we refined our sales perimeter focused on higher margin market segments operating profit was down 200 revenue growth was more than offset by fulfillment and execution issues impacting profitability orders were down eleven organically equipment were down eleven as we cycle a stronger usppt and services were down 23 a positive spot in the quarter was international orders which were up eleven backlog of 26500000000 was down four sequentially but up five versus prior year revenue was up 28 organically this was mainly driven by on shore wind up sixty on shore equipment revenue was up 81 with the new unit turbine deliveries of 700 and 31 more than double prior year and repair kit deliveries of 200 and nineteen up forty onshore services revenue excluding repair kits was up fifteen onshore order pricing index continues to stabilize at one inline with industry trends grid revenue was down eight mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones driven by covid nineteen this was down 115000000 this was driven by the supply chain disruptions due to covid nineteen fulfillment delays and the non returns of non cash gains from an offshore wind contract termination in the prior year this was partially offset by higher onshore wind volume segment margin contracted 210 basis points mainly driven by the same items mentioned above and the range of execution issues we are fixing at gri and hydro moving to slide eight starting with ga capital in the quarter adjusted continue operations generated a net loss of 180000000 this excludes the impact of the capital loss tax benefit utilized against biopharma gain resulting in 88000000 of earnings compared to prior year which excludes excludes the us tax reform benefit continuing net earnings was unfavorable by 154000000 this was due to a negative mark to market adjustment the company is impairment at gcc and insurance lower gains and lower earnings from a smaller asset base this was partially offset by lower excess interest costs and sgen they ended the quarter with 101000000000 of assets excluding liquidity this was done 1000000000 sequentially primarily driven by gcc due to asset sales depreciation and collections partially offset by new volume insurance assets were flat sequentially as a decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily by primarily driven by realized gains higher market rates was affected by the annual insurance capital contribution supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continue to migrate to mufg as noted earlier capital ended the quarter with 13500000000 of liquidity capital also ended with 54500000000 of deaths which was down 4500000000 sequentially driven by deaths majors these continued operations generated a net loss next just like our businesses corporate needs to adjust to our new reality and we are continuing to take additional structural actions to rationalize costs and reduce the size at corporate looking at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were 374000000 i would like to add a couple of comments on the financial results for the quarter ended december 31 2005 as previously reported the company experienced a net loss of $23600000 or ¢37 per diluted share primarily due to higher intercompany profit eliminations which were partially offset by better digital performance from our digital operations functions and operations were 25 lower primarily driven by geodis improvement you can see from digital is performance that the focus cost reduction programs are gaining traction we continue to right size our functional costs across geodis and push more accountability into the division i have spent most of my career in leadership at lean decentralized companies fundamentally i believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers businesses to take the right actions quickly this type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with covid nineteen we are working toward this goal and there will be more to come with that back to you larry thank you there is no question that covid nineteen is putting real pressure on our businesses given that so much has changed in this quarter and this will be our 1st full quarter with pressure from covid nineteen i would like to spend some time here discussing now let me move on to commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail but on the other hand we have seen a rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets we will cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail but on the other hand we have seen a rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets to that end we rebalanced some of our capacity to meet this increased demand to offset some pressure in the commercial business we are taking several steps that while painful preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve we have previously announced 500 to $1000000000 in cost and cash actions and we have now increased this targeting more than 1000000000 in cost actions and more than 1000000000 in cash actions this will be achieved through different initiatives some of which have been completed others in flight as we speak these include a ten reduction in aviation is total us workforce and furloughs impacting fifty of its us maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufacturing will continue to monitor and potentially extend as required we are also focused on reducing discretionary spending and capex spend and optimizing working capital i know aviation is discretionary margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors and carolyn touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter while we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the 2nd quarter our expectations are that the cost actions we are undertaking will improve discretionary margins in the back half of the year while there are many uncertainties i expect that we will exit the year with a stronger balance sheet we are seeing an unprecedented decline in 2020 we are taking action and david and the team are working proactively with our carriers to address this challenge so spending a little more time on commercial services which represented $3300000000 of revenue in the 1st quarter let us go to slide ten as you can see on the left side departures across the full industry were strong in the 1st quarter before rapidly declining in mid march as we look at it this week focused on the ge and cfm fleet global departures are down approximately 75 roughly sixty of the cfm fleet is grounded is parked today in line with this we are also seeing a significant headwinds in global shop visits which were down double digits in the 1st quarter as airlines defer short term maintenance and we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better with some potential to moderate in the latter half of the year depending on the variables just outlined based on what we are seeing through the month of april in the 2nd quarter we are seeing shop visits down roughly sixty and csa billings down additionally we expect the significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure our csa margins that said when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time gecf is well positioned with the largest and youngest installed base of all engine manufacturers additionally roughly 62 of our gecf fleet has seen one shop visit or less and this is expected to continue we have more narrow bodies that are ten years or younger than the narrow body installed base of the rest of the industry and when we see a pickup in air travel demand we expect narrow bodies will recover most quickly overall it was a challenging quarter and we are expecting additional pressure here in the 2nd but our cost actions will alleviate some of the pressure in the 2nd half of 2020 commercial engines moving to commercial engines which represented $1500000000 of revenue in the 1st quarter in light of covid nineteen airframers are producing at a lower rate based on what we are seeing through the month of april in the 2nd quarter we see installed engines down roughly 45 and spare engines down roughly sixty year on year attributeable to the delivery deferals in addition to the already planned lower production rate on the 737 max in the near term we are right sizing production capacity and actively we have very strong relationships with the airframers and an attractive value proposition is evidenced by a multi year backlog as you will see on the right we have strong positions sole source on two of the biggest new engine entrances and a 65 win rate on the other while we acknowledge there is pressure on near term demand for new aircraft these stats demonstrate to the customer the value of ge technology we are in the 2nd quarter of the year and we are seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment including ventilators that have increased onefive to two times versus pre pandemic levels but at the same time we are seeing reduced demand for other diagnostic equipment this is a high margin this is made of contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with procedures that are being deferred or canceled right now several hcs product lines and most to date is down as much as fifty versus pre pandemic levels while these dynamics vary by country there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies experience different stages of the virus taking china for example as hospitals come back online we are seeing a rampant previously deferred procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables healthcare is accelerating its planned transformation to expand margins post biopharma by reducing headcount fixed costs discretionary spend and marketing spend prioritizing r and d deferring capex and optimizing working capital looking forward we were most focused on the following indicators for healthcare hospital admission and occupancy rates and increase in non covid nineteen procedures changes in hospital capex budgets government spending on healthcare broadly and development of covid nineteen tests treatments and vaccines based on our experience we are confident that our strategic priorities will drive growth and enhance our long term value we expect to be down in the 2nd quarter with potential recovery afterwards covid nineteen has highlighted the need to build and truly invest and and scale a new digitized infrastructure and quickly we are committed to our investments in our digital edison platform and solutions like neural virtual care solution which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous ventilated patients simultaneously helping to expand their capabilities as our digital healthcare journey continues with the center of an ecosystem striving for precision health i am very proud of the work our team is doing to combat covid nineteen moving to power on slide like on slide thirteen we will talk to the current trends in the 2nd quarter to date in dynamics at gas power and power portfolio starting with gas power we are monitoring and managing supply chain disruptions as of today we still see a path to 45 to fifty gas turbine deliveries this year but our orders profile and therefore cash down payments where several $100000000 are likely weaker due to ipp pressures in the us and mexico is we expect deal financing will become harder through the year additionally with oil price pressure impacting middle east and ssa investment including demand for new lng we are expecting a longer road to normalization ultimately we are sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin accretive backlog with disciplined execution in services approximately twenty of planned averages are shifting from the 1st half of this year due to covid nineteen field labor constraints we are also seeing pressure on upgrades primarily in the middle east where low oil prices are impacting customer budgets we are seeing ge gas turbine utilization in the us up mid single digits due to low gas prices and the shift from coal but utilization globally is down low double digits due to lower electricity demand within power portfolio our steam business is most impacted factory closures pressured our steam operations including one facility in wuan which was closed for approximately eight weeks in the 1st quarter today we are back to full capacity we are seeing about seventy of capacity the global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in india driven by government restrictions overall we are seeing about thirty of availability shift from the 1st half of this year to the 2nd half with another ten to fifteen pushing into next year our power businesses are taking several measures to offset these pressures in the 1st quarter we reduced headcount by 700 notified approximately 1300 contractors we implemented a hiring freeze and in line with the demand profile we are taking even further actions this will serve to reduce fixed costs in 2020 and drive benefits in 2021 looking forward we are tracking a number of items including timing of our gas turbine new order closure service outages in volume fleet utilization is the energy mix and fuel prices are impacting each region differently supplier impacts and project execution we are targeting to have our accelerated cost out measures drive organic margin expansion despite these demand changes moving to slide fourteen on renewables there was a limited impact of covid nineteen in the 1st quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution as we have said we think about renewables and three distinct operating pools starting with onshore wind while we continue to deliver at record levels in the americas we are seeing supply chain disruption at our lm wind facilities and we are monitoring key commercial milestones such as permits and financing which could potentially cause timing delays in offshore wind certification for our industry leading turbine the haliotixx remains on track we are also on plan to start delivering on our eighty unit six megawatt commitments to edf after completion this project in 2021 we expect to start shifting production to the hollyood facility we are also monitoring financial closure of 2020 deals grid and hydro are two turnarounds are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half of our grid facilities now operating below capacity and at grid automation we are also impacted by lower book to bill order conversion across all three of these pools we are increasing costs down and restructuring we have identified several $100000000 of additional actions longer term a lower cost structure will benefit renewables relating to the global supply chain we are focused on the safe reopening of our plants globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels looking forward we are expecting a larger impact from covid nineteen in the 2nd quarter and by business we are tracking twenty and 21 demand impact on progress collections and potential site delays in onshore wind on slide fifteen within ge capital our gca and insurance businesses are where we are feeling the but largest impacts so i will keep my comments focused there 1st gca is better positioned today than in previous downturns with better asset quality less customer concentration and more geographic diverse that said we are preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments as well as lease restructurings and we have had approximately eighty of our customers seek short term deferals as you may have seen we have agreed with boeing on a rebalancing of our 737 max order book 2nd at insurance marketing and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment portfolio and reinvestment yields therefore we are deploying capital our capital market dislocation investment opportunities will closely monitor how this volatility will impact insurance this year and similar to the industrial segments we are implementing equalization cost and cash actions looking forward we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales at gcp and insurance our seasoned teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period so to close our priorities are clear we rapidly respond to market changes we have mobilized our team in the face of covid nineteen with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees and overall the priorities we reviewed with you at the outreach call remain intact we are facing into our near term realities while continuing to manage ge for the long term when the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century our team is rising to the challenge with humility transparency and focus we continue to deliver value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential goods supplying vital healthcare equipment and keeping the lights on and while there are many unknowns there will be another side planes will fly again healthcare will normalize and modernize and the world still needs more efficient resilient energy at the same time we are embracing this new reality we are redefining winning and we are executing our plan the costs and cash actions we have taken you through this morning are a major result these moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multi year transformation to make ge a stronger nimbler and more valuable company and i am confident that ge will emerge stronger with that steve let us go to questions great before we open the line i would ask everyone and anyone who has a question to please hold on please consider your fellow analysts again and ask one question in a follow up so we can get to as many people as possible brandon can you please open the line yes thank you sir we will now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press star one under telephone keypad if you would like to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key if you are on a speakerphone please pick up your handset 1st before dialing once again if you have a question please press star one under telephone keypad and from vertical research we have jeff sprague please go ahead thank you good morning everyone help everyone as well thanks for all the the great details good morning jeff very early good morning i was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on how you you know kind of view the kind of the asset quality of the you know the contractual service agreements and the like like there is a lot of assets there obviously there is at least a temporary how does that test work have you done it yet and are are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should be thinking about is in aviation i suspect that is that is where you are most focused we we go through those those backlog reviews in the csa reviews on a regular basis what we have done here over the last call it the last 78 weeks is really tighten and quicken the review process that we do with the the businesses both at aviation and what we are trying to do is make sure we have got the latest and if you will most accurate information possible with respect to customer risk given everything that is going on so we we do that on a regular basis we did that at the at the end of the 1st quarter in in closing much as we do every quarter clearly we have got a we have we have got a fluid situation and i think the the modest charges that we took the modest changes in the 1st quarter clearly are going to play out as we go through the course of the year we can not really scope that for you today if you look at the csa book in aviation for example as we went through the the mechanics of the future billings the future costs related to those billings based on the information at the time it was really just a 100000000 but a $100000000 adjustment of course which is why you see a little bit of the earnings cash dynamic certainly as we go forward we are going to be updating those those adjustments and again and i mean we would expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines are doing with with their planes but i think it is important to keep in mind again these these are ten to fifteen year agreements as you know and those adjustments are taken taken in the context of at a particularly extended time period great thanks for that and just as a follow up if i could i know you do not want to get real precise on guidance but you know you you are pointing us to a further decline in cash flow in q two which is not surprising quite frankly but could you bracket that at all for us what we should expect for for q two and you know any high level thoughts on how the year plays out from a cash standpoint yeah jeff i think that we we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and did not want to take an attempt at at framing formal guidance here today in light of all that is fluid and all that is is still evolving here and i think that the task we took was really to try to to share as much with you as we possibly could in terms of the the april detailed business by business and acknowledge that we are going to see a more challenging 2nd quarter here given the full impact of of covid and the like but beyond that i think that is that is really where we are we we know we have got to to get to work on the cost and the cash actions that is why you see it is doubling that activity in aviation stepping it up elsewhere around the company so the the 2000000000 of cost the 3000000000 of cash will clearly help us later on i think that is really what we know and that is what we are comfortable sharing great thanks best of luck claire thanks from morgan stanley we have josh porges please go ahead hey josh you might be on your way there brandon let us move on and come back to josh sure next question we have from bank of america we have andrew obin please go ahead hi yes good morning can you hear me yeah hi andrew very well yeah just a question for you one thank you so much and good luck to everybody so run rate sixty in terms of shop visits five on csas do you think you continue to trend at this level in the 2nd quarter or is there more downside andrew the i think you are referring to to page nine in the slide deck yeah i think that is what what we are seeing here it yeah i think this is what we are what we are seeing right now right and given given what the carriers have have said publicly what they are doing and we think these are these are good likely near in run rates to share with you we are again we are not trying to offer up a definitive view as to the next several quarters but this is you know this is what we are seeing right now in the 2nd quarter for sure and and my my follow up question on spare engine sales i think sixty have we lost these or will these come back when the situation normalizes maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over the next couple of years thank you so much the leap one a and the leap one b as the narrow body market was taking off typical early in the life of an engine activity we are clearly seeing that soften not necessarily going to zero as preparations are being made for the return to service of the max right i do not think that that that opportunity is lost but i think like much of what we are seeing in aviation broad it will be it will be pushed out for a few years and again i do not think we are taking a definitive view as to what year what quarter things get back to if you will  a normalized 2019 level but we recognize the the discussions out there about this being a multiyear recovery gradual slow i think we are embracing that reality and that applies really across the portfolio thank you very much for the detail and stay safe thank you from beall is research we have scott davis please go ahead hey good morning guys and welcome carolina thank you i am got larry and any way to think about the cost actions it relates to kind of structural versus more kind of pandemic short term related across the company if you look at the the tally today there is a decidedly short term bias there that carolena and i are going to be working with the ceos over the coming weeks to transition to a more permanent action right if you look at what we did in aviation for example example in terms of the temporary lack of work that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure in that business on a variable basis to these shockingly fast changes in demand you might categorize that as is temporary we need to work through the changes on a more permanent basis that are required in and light of the yeah the length of the recovery that we are looking at so we have confidence in these in these numbers that we are sharing today the 2000000000 of costs the 3000000000 of cash there is a bit of a  tactical element to that day just given how fresh this is but we will be leaning in toward making more of them permanent recognizing that at the end of the day there will be a yeah a bit of a mix be it be it headcount related discretionary spend on the cost side in addition to some of the working capital certainly the the capex reduction the carolina referenced the 25 reduction year on year so a lot going on and by no means is this these headlines today the the end it is very much at work in in progress okay that is helpful larry and when you think you know the the $20000000000 kind of came to you pretty much about perfect timing but you know does that money just sit on the balance sheet does that have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as is for the for the year can you yeah or is it just such a big number you can start to part some of it out to you know thinking in terms of of whittling down you know debt that you can you can manage carolina anything you want to add relative to kind of managing liquidity versus leverage right here i think this is yeah i think it is it is important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared to before covid and it is very important for us of course leverage is important but liquidity is very important and we end the quarter with 47000000000 cash right and that is really to cover 18000000000 of d a capital and term debt maturities now through 21 and actually after the april action we are down to 13000000000 of maturities for twenty and 21 almost all of that in in capital and i would also say and you know we expect to have around 20000000000 in total credit lines going forward and that is really in line with our risk appetite we have the new 15000000003 year rcf that i mentioned and 5000000000 in capital and we will be on a 20000000000 credit line and i think we will just so that you know we really intend to maintain a high level of cash i would say to maximize flexibility and that is why we are taking these actions also to do risk assessment balancing and basically prudently manage our liquidity in this very challenging external environment and time that makes sense and thank you and good luck to you guys thank you thanks scott be well and let us try jess porke is win斯基 again from morgan stanley hello everyone can you hear me this time yes yes clearly josh good morning awesome  and and hope everyone is as well to echo earlier comments larry can you just give us this sense and i know you guys have data going back yons and in aviation how the impact of of retirements and cannibalizations you know kind of make more of a  u shape versus you know what you know the the air traffic may look like i think there is a natural lag between when folks start flying again and when shop visits can happen just as a function of kind of using up some of the run time on otherwise idle assets with with this but there s there s no question that there s there s going to be a bias on the part of some as some of these fleet reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft and that will factor into the to the aftermarket much like some of the dynamics around green time and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash so i am not sure that there is necessarily an exact model that captures what all the carriers and aggregate are going to do here a model that offers great precision i think we do know that this that the combination of these factors is going to create pressure for us for us here in the short term i think what is most important for our business really is is cycles much more so than revenue passenger miles as we see schedules come back as we work our way through the pandemic that will that will put us back on i think better footing but here in the short term i think we are acknowledging that we are going to see shop visits and csa billings take on some real pressure due to the downturn thanks i will leave it there from jp morgan we have steve tousa please thank you josh hey guys good morning hey steve good morning in in early march you guys had that slide that showed you know two to 4000000000 in you know free cash flow guidance which was obviously off the table but you also talked about things growing and you know 21 and 22 and you know off that kind of $3000000000 base i think you know most research and numbers i saw were kind of in that you know $6000000000 range of a free cash flow are we still like is the out here numbers still at all legit or is that you know are you kind of withdrawing that long term outlook as well we have taken guidance off for the year we are not putting it back on today just given the yeah given the undue and uncertainty of it all right so i do not i do not think we are trying to get out any further than than that i appreciate the question but i think for purposes of today we are really just trying to frame for folks what what we are seeing but that said however long it takes us to work through this we are going to do our best to get through it i think we feel very good about our ability to come out stronger and get back on a positive cash flow growth trajectory got it carolena you would add to that no i think it is important to to acknowledge that by taking out costs now and part of it being structural that gives us sort of as well as mitigating the detriments that helps improving the bottom line i mean i think that will depend on the recovery on the industry as well so so that is that is i would say was impossible to speak to today right and i guess how much on that structural broadside yeah good i think that from a mixed perspective hard our highest margin businesses are really feeling it here i would think that on the on the recovery we would see we would see it swing the other way so when we get back and come off the bottom we should have positive mixed effect really across the across the board particularly in aviation and healthcare your your 2nd question steve is relative to what yeah i do not know i guess how much is that going to cost you i mean like you know to come up with two to $3000000000 of a cost in cash you know you have done you have you cut your restructuring last year pretty significantly i think you know a couple 100000000 in the 1st quarter i mean most companies are kind of one for one how much is this stuff going to cost you this year on a cash basis yeah i think what we have said previously we were going to be down off of last year from a yeah from an expense and from a cash perspective i think we are probably going to end up more or less in line right keep in mind that some of the cost actions like furloughs do not carry a restructuring charge with that right because they are not permanent so part of what we are trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary costs but all the while if we can we can make more structural moves we want to make sure we have got room to do that but i would say right now assume that it is relatively flat year on year but as carollena indicated in her remarks we want to try to do more if we can great all right thanks a lot that is the best of luck guys thanks steve from ubs we have marcus smith please go ahead yeah hi good morning larry carollena and steve let me maybe follow up on the on the  case good morning hey good morning within the year so in your ten q you referenced the yata numbers of 48 rpk reduction is is and i know obviously  flight hours and rpk is are two different stories but is that sort of a  kind of scenario that you are playing through internally and and i am just trying to get a sense of what that would mean if we look at our sort of like nineteen aviation cash as a baseline sort of like where you know on on that type of scenario we could end up particularly you know looking at sort of what you have mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have i think 62 of of engines still ahead of shop visit one which arguably are the engines that are on the narrow bodies coming back 1st because they are probably the youngest the youngest in the fleet right just trying to get a sense for within the year how you are thinking about that there is no question that we are going to continue to see the pressure on on cash at aviation that we have seen  here of late right and that that will be our undoubtedly our our biggest headwind no no no there is plenty of of of planning for again an extended slowdown here we are we are embracing this reality to the fullest extent possible we are not expecting this to bounce back in in the near term so we we flag in the queue the iowa numbers we also reference others you see it in our own  departure data here in april right we are we are we are way down that has a direct feed into the shop visits cfsa billings and the like we are we are we are adapting to this new environment confident that it will recover but we are mark we are we are simply not trying to assume that the the pressure abates anytime soon witness the the cost and the cash actions that we are taking yes sure okay and i appreciate that and maybe i will follow up quickly on on the capital side do you anticipate any change in the capital support there for for insurance in particular you you referenced that a little bit in the prepared remarks i think 2000000000 is sort of the current number how are you thinking about that at the moment on the parent support to capital yeah on the insurance let us yeah let us take a step back then so  in nineteen the capital had an infusion from  two or 4000000000 the estimate for for this year is 2000000000 on insurance funding and those 2000000000 you know that is significantly lower than the  before we estimate that the parent will need to support roughly in line with this with some variables are still open and that depends on g capital itself right the j capital earnings the l r two the capital ending assets liquidity level but basically it is about 2000000000 it looks now and i would also say going forward anticipating and following up we do continue to anticipate further funding and that will be again through a combination of g capital itself with their asset sales liquidity and their future earnings and on top of that possible capital contributions from g yeah thank you good morning guys good morning two questions  two questions so at at aviation it sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up the spares business the aftermarket the $15000000000 commercial aftermarket business will lag asm growth because of you know a younger fleet emerging you know a surge of used serviceable material and the like heartaches and obviously lower spares provisioning as the oe rates come down thirty to fifty i guess 1st question is when do you anticipate aviation free cash flow getting to break even is it even possible before calendar 22 in that and type of environment and then i have a follow up not sure if we would buy into the premise per se right i mean we are a cycles business much more so than than any other indicator and those cycles are going to have to come back before the passengers do as you indicate the age of the fleet will will help us over time there could be some short term headwinds but we will  we will see we will see how that plays out i think what we are acknowledging here is that we have been hit from a free cash perspective in our our our biggest and best cash generator at at aviation but we are really not getting into much more much more in terms of the yeah the the pre cash forecast on  on a multi year basis it is just too soon there is just too many moving pieces for us and just to follow up you know obviously 2020 is a tough year we are going to have some cash burn 2021 uncertain but certainly does not seem like an aviation we are going to have a strong recovery so as so as we emerge from this we are going to have you know more leverage and i guess the question is i have made some asset sales to deleverage what else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore that is different than what you have done over the past year thank you i am not sure i would say that there is a lot that is and i think you have seen us make a lot of progress here to date which i hope underscores the seriousness of of that objective both on the ge side right like it is 7000000000 of of debt reductions in the quarter and that capital i think it is up to ten on it on a year to day basis given given some of the things we did in april clearly it is going to take us so   a while longer here to hit those targets like i suspect most most companies but in terms of doing anything new or different i think we are going to continue to try to run these businesses as as best we can be as disciplined as we can on the capital front be be smart and thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations like like pension as you have seen us relative to the plan design and and some of the settlement options so i am not sure they are necessarily new plays per se but we will continue to to look at at every and and every option i am sorry i jumped in there anything to add there i would just add to the leverage comment also the liquidity that at times like this you know you do look at the liquidity and i think it is important to say that we really want to maintain a high level of cash to maximize the flexibility and you have seen the de risking activities that we have been doing we to sort of push out the death in the further years so we keep option open hey good morning maybe just the 1st question around the working capital dynamics and the free cash flow at aviation i guess yeah there is a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales downturn it just kind of derails everything so i am just curious to hear your thoughts on that could you just update us on how you see the working capital cash impact at gaviation sort of in the early stages now in this downturn what you would expect to happen to working capital when things recover and if there is any major difference on the cash dynamics of the power by the hour type service relative to other services yeah on with respect to working capital i think our our primary challenge is really inventory at aviation right we we came into this year we were going to have to adjust to a different schedule with the macs chasing the the step up at at airbus with the the 320 neo while dealing with a good bit of of a pass through on the commercial side both both oe and after market while having pretty good military demand to to contend with that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from a macs from a cash flow perspective was an inventory at aviation in in the quarter so that s that s where we re going to be most focused trying to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies adjust to these production schedules the lower after market requirements while continuing to take care of the military business it you know that that s  that s a complex supply chain undertaking but the team as you can imagine is keenly focused on using some of the lean tools working with our supply base to make sure that we not only take the cost out of the business but bring those inventory levels down in in light of current current demand you know in aviation you have the drop in ebitdar in the downturn then the recovery in ebitdar in the early part of the uptrend i was just trying to understand on working capital is that cash impact countercyclical or is it pro cyclical so you are getting a working capital outflow through the downturn as well as the ebitdar decline i understand the the high level dynamic there that you are alluding to i think right now the the simple reality of aviation given the pressures and the cross currents is that it is a and we need to work to improve it how much of a yeah tailwind could it be kind of at this point in the cycle i think it is too early to tell we have we have got to get on the improvement path 1st julian to be able to take that potential and and deliver it in the financials as a reality thank you and then my 2nd question was just around the operational issues so i think it sounds like the cost out tailwind should build through the year but in q one you had some operational issues in in power on the on the service side you know steep decrementals even with the fixed cost down sixteen renewables the margins were down so i guess what is the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of these cost savings over the balance of the year that was on top of some cost pressures of of our own making which we need to we need to improve upon but i think in in power i believe that the team is doing a very nice job working off of the travel restrictions really pushed a lot of high margin revenue out of the quarter and probably out of the 1st half that was on top of some cost pressures of of our own making which we need to we need to improve upon the the so called inheritance taxes driving real cost improvements you see that in the headcount reductions here in the 1st quarter and as we get to a more normalized service environment i think you will continue to see that that turnaround continue to to take flight i think of renewables julian it is  it is a different dynamic yes we had phenomenal revenue growth in the quarter doubled the the on shore turbine deliveries here in the uss better price better point of price which is encouraging to see but it is by nature a very low growth margin business so the growth is not high calorie unfortunately we had a   few what we think are one offs but they are not one offs until they go away permanently cost and execution issues all the while the the turnarounds and hydro and grid are are i think moving forward but it is really delicate and they have a number of inheritance taxes that will take a few years to to work through so i i think the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate those turnarounds in power renewables they are dealing with different dynamics in the respective businesses and that is really why i think i have the the confidence to say that you should expect the decremental margins sequentially to improve the restructuring and the cost actions we should present ourselves in improved demographics in the back half but we have got work to do to to make that to make that happen great thank you from wolf research we have nigel covey please go ahead thanks julian good morning everyone and karan great to see you on board so look we appreciate all the color in the slides and in the queue so is it larry is it now a base case that industrial free cash flow will be and maybe just address the risk of significant you know cash burn this year or you know is there enough on the on the cost out and on the working capital side to maybe mitigate some of that pressure and keep industrial free cash flow relatively steady probably three things one we have we have been very we have been hit hard and fast here right in some of our most important highest margin businesses be it aviation and services particularly gas power services pdx and in healthcare we think that that gets gets worse before it gets better particularly here in the 2nd quarter with a full  full effect we are going to acknowledge that uncertainty hence the the polling of the guide but we are not going to sit back and hope that it all passes we are not going to take the view that we have got a sharp v bounce coming hence the the 2000000000 of of cost actions we have talked about and the 3000000000 of of cash actions we are going to do everything we possibly can to control our destiny here the long term value the long term trajectory of our company so we are telling you what we know today we wish we knew more but that is really the state of play right now and and the approach the headset that we are taking to it okay i appreciate that larry thanks then you know i thought one of the when the real highlights of the quarter were the underlying strength of the healthcare margins you know ex even ex biopharma and especially given some of the headwinds you face in there so that is the key takeaways from the call so what is the key thing to keep in mind nigel is the big iron certainly got hit the the lower lower ticket the the lower price points be patient monitors ventilators and the like certainly got quite quite a boost but it is a small it is a small part of the of the business so there was a little bit of mix there but but not a lot it was really more a function you know frankly of of the team doing a nice job more broadly recognized we needed to tend to the core cost structure in all its form in the hcs business right we have we have been growing healthcare biopharma leading the way we have got some good margin support from that business the last several years well now as we think about the $17000000000 core the teams really i think put their sights the last couple of quarters on growing that business growing it with us and it is really the cumulative effect that that i think you see a bit here in the 1st quarter before we yeah we we got hit they got hit a little bit later not as much you will see more of that unfortunately here in the 2nd quarter but i think you have got a team who thinks that like many other medtech companies they can grow mid or load a mid single digits over time and put more digital into the mix better costs that should give us the opportunity to grow so margins along the lines of what karen laid out in december and i have no less conviction about their ability to do that today than we did when we made that presentation again mindful that we have got some gyrations here in the near term to deal with ok thanks very much larry hey thanks neyel hey thanks neyel we are at the bottom of the hour so we can just take one more question recognize the verbal content in the speech and transcribe it into text ok this is the transcript hbc capital markets we have dean dray please go ahead thank you good morning everyone wishing everyone good health and have my welcome to carolena thank you just morning dean good morning just two questions both aviation a lot of discussion about structural cost out and larry be interested in how have you balanced the the structural cost out in aviation with risk then balancing the risks and furloughs versus how you might be compromising the ability to bounce back when it does ramp back up so that s the 1st question and then the 2nd one just to make sure i heard it correctly were there did you quantify the leap cancellations in the quarter i know there s delivery deferrals our experience in 2008 was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations because customers would lose that so what is the expectation here in terms of engine cancellations that is it for me thank you by the way maybe i will take the 1st part of that and perhaps carollena can take the 2nd i think we are mindful ever mindful that there will be a recovery right and we want to be well positioned for that i think we are really trying to again embrace our reality and take the the cost actions in the after market business and more broadly at aviation mindful that we have got a period of time here of an unknown duration but it is it is not going to be measured in months right where that business is going to be under considerable pressure so after   a period of time is is the after market has has grown as it has the last the last decade this is going to give us an opportunity to  to rethink to re to consolidate all the while mindful of our obligations to customers the nature of how the footprint has changed the changes that are probably still so so coming so there there are a number of variables it is it is very much a work in progress as well but i think we have got line of sight to build on some of the temporary actions to to take permanent action to make sure that we we have a lean cost structure with adequate capacity to to come out of the downturn here well positioned to perform both for customers and for investors thank you we will now turn it back to steve winiker for closing remarks zero do you want me to answer the question on yeah 2nd question go ahead carol yeah i was yeah go ahead go ahead carol yeah you were right because i actually mentioned that in my notes that in our backlog which was flat sequentially an up 22 versus per year that did include roughly 200 luke one b unit order translations in the quarter i think we fund a very small so far but on top of that we also saw gca right so we have gca cancellation of 69 aircraft in april so that will be reflected in the 2nd quarter aviation backlog thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today is conference thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect",

telephone keypad you will be limited to one question if you require any further assistance please press star zero thank you and i would like to hand the conference over to your moderator for today jacquie ross vp of investor relations please go ahead good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on such short notice to discuss the definitive agreement for illumina to acquire grail if you have not had a chance to review today is release it can be found in the investor relations section of our website at illumina com participating for illumina today will be francis desouza president and chief executive officer and sam samad chief financial officer we are also pleased to welcome hans bishop grail is chief executive officer francis hans and sam we will share some prepared remarks and then we will open the call for some questions this call is being recorded and the audio portion will be archived in the investor section of our website today is presentation contains estimates projections and other forward looking statements these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those projected or discussed please review the cautionary statements and other important information for investors and stockholders on slide two with that i will turn the call over to francis thanks jacquie good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on such short notice i am excited to share that earlier this morning we announced an agreement to acquire grail and to work together to launch a new era in cancer detection before we start i want to acknowledge the grail team for what they have accomplished we spun out grail four years ago to focus on an ambitious goal to revolutionize the way we detect cancer by developing a blood test that could find cancer earlier than is possible today their innovation and results since then have exceeded even our lofty expectations setting the stage for early cancer detection to likely be the largest genomic application over the next fifteen years by far this combination will be transformative for cancer detection the acquisition will enable grail to leverage illumina is global commercial clinical and operations capabilities accelerating their mission and allowing us to impact more people faster than they might have done alone illumina is next generation sequencers will continue to support genomic medicine to become standard of care across clinical applications and with this acquisition we will accelerate and participate more fully indirectly in the highest value clinical opportunity enabled by our technology specifically the acquisition positions illumina to participate in what we expect will be a $75000000000 market for ngs based oncology tests by 2035 60000000000 higher than our oncology tam excluding grail cancer is one of the greatest threats to human health despite the significant investments made and the important medical advancements achieved so far when we diagnose cancer too late when it is metastatic less than twenty of patients will survive more than five years in contrast if we diagnose cancer early approximately ninety of patients are expected to survive beyond five years about 71 of cancer related deaths are attributable to cancers with no recommended screening tests and with limited screening tests cancer is more likely to be detected in the late stages and or more often than not too late this is both a human tragedy and an enormous burden on the healthcare system each year there are over 600000 cancer related deaths in the us and approximately 10000000 deaths worldwide making it the 2nd leading cause of death we spend approximately $250000000000 per year on cancer in the us and globally the econo the annual economic impact is more than $1200000000000 and now for the 1st time there is a technology platform that enables us to address this burden starting with grail is multi cancer detection test galleri which aims to reduce cancer deaths by transforming how and when cancer is detected grails technology characterizes the dna that cancer cells shed into the blood detecting unique signatures that identify both the presence and often the tissue of origin of the cancer earlier this year grail shared positive results from it is circulating cell free genome atlas or cpga study that has enrolled 15000 participants the study found that the 1st version of galleri reported sensitivity of 44 for stage one through three tumors for fifty different cancers and 67 sensitivity for the twelve deadliest cancers and in 93 of the positive results the test correctly identified the tissue of origin all with a specificity of greater than 99 and from a single blood drop arguably one of the most important performance measures for doctors and payers is the positive predictive value or ppv which is the percentage of positive tests that cancers for galleri we predict a ppv 43 this represents the very significant step forward compared to today is most commonly used screening tests which often have a ppv in the range of three to five the grail team is preparing to launch galleri as a lab developed test or ldt in 202 we believe that this is a remarkable advance in the ability to detect cancer earlier which can transform cancer care and improve population health as noted earlier most cancers are currently diagnosed in late stages as shown by the gray bars in the chart on the left half of slide six the limitations of current screening methods lead to only 31 of cancers being identified in stages one and two when they are the most treatable based on grail is studies this could increase to 82 with broad adoption of galleri is blood tests complimenting today is recommended cancer screening this matters because if we mentioned earlier survival rates are directly correlated with how early cancer is detected broad adoption of galleri could avert nearly forty of the five year cancer mortality on around 100000 deaths annually in the us my apologies for the technical issues we will pick up again from slide six as noted earlier most cancers are currently diagnosed in late stages as shown by the gray bars and the charts on the left half of slide six the limitations of current screening methods lead to only 31 of cancers being identified in stages one and two when they are most treatable based on grail is studies this could increase to 82 with broad adoption of galleri is blood tests complimenting today is recommended screening this matters because as we mentioned earlier survival rates are directly correlated with how early cancer is detected broader adoption of galleri could avert nearly forty of the five year cancer mortality or around 100000 deaths annually in the us to put this in perspective it roughly matches the number of deaths prevented by all current screening testing treatment and surgery standards combined once available we are confident that galleri will enable screening for more cancers than ever before while screening has improved for some cancers including lung breast colorectal and cervical we know that roughly six in ten cancers diagnosed in 12000000 cases and 5000000 deaths a year are associated with cancers with no recommended treating requirements since galleri will help discover cancer earlier we believe that galleri can help detect three times as many cancers when added to recommend single cancer screenings there is significant opportunity to improve outcomes for patients and the potential impact on families and communities highlights the importance of grail is work we will also be able to better meet the needs of healthcare providers and delivery systems by improving the overall efficiency as cancer detection payers will be able to realize the lower costs associated with the treatment of cancer at earlier stages based on grail is estimates the adoption of galleri alongside existing screening guidelines could help reduce diagnostic workup costs by up to 65 these benefits are key drivers in the market potential which we anticipate reflects an addressable market for ngs based oncology testing of $75000000000 today we are seeing rapid adoption of ngs is based therapy selection tests many based on illumina is technology over the next fifteen years we expect this market to grow in the cagr of about sixteen to $14000000000 to an annual 7000000 test opportunity at approximate asd of $1300 to $2300 illumina participates in the therapy selection market with our tso 500 tests currently available for research use only and making its way through regulatory approval for commercial launch in early 202 as the reimbursement landscape continues to strengthen and drives utilization of therapy selection tests we are seeing more companies working on monitoring tests that will assess the activity of a patient is cancer this can optimize the disease management and determine the effectiveness of cancer therapies for individual patients these assays can also act as surveillance tests for cancer patients who have completed therapy and are in remission we expect this market to grow with a cagr of about 27 to 15000000000 in 203 the test opportunity here is expected to grow to about 20000000 tests per year with an expected asp of $700 to $1000 the cancers screening opportunity it is significantly larger in therapy selection and monitoring combined this market is expected to grow quickly to about 150000000 tests in 2035 a 75 cagr to approximately $46000000000 let us assume that asp that starts around $1200 and trends to about $300 in 2035 as we scale and drive adoption with increasingly accessible pricing with regards to the market for galleri specifically there is a sizable addressable market of over 100000000000 people between the age of fifty to 79 in the us we believe approximately half of this addressable market is accessible with galleri prior to reimbursement the grail go to market strategy next year will consist of three core channels health symptoms self insured employers and concierge medicine given the cost improvement potential we feel that health system and self insured employers will recognize the compelling value propositions and drive adoption of the 1st multi cancer detection ldt available there is also an opportunity in concierge medicine segment that typically caters to health conscious members that like to be on the forefront of new medical technologies who could be early adopters of galleri we expect that grail will launch galleri is 2021 we will look forward to additional results next year from the ccga stuff study three and pathfinder to further support the clinical validation of galleri additionally grail will continue to work on its diagnostic aid for cancer tests or dac which is intended for symptomatic patients and is designed to speed up the time to diagnosis when cancer is suspected and grail also has the minimal residual disease or mrd test in development intended for patients who have been diagnosed and treated to detect persistent disease following definitive therapy on that note i would like to invite hans the ceo of grail to say a few words thank you francis i am excited to be here today let me start by recognizing the accomplishments of the grail team we are a mission driven company focused on detecting cancer early when it can be cured we believe our early cancer detection tele technology could substantially reduce the burden of cancer worldwide and it developed unique technology that preferentially targets the most informative regions of the genome and uses machine learning algorithms to detect the presence of cancer and identify the tumor tissue of origin we believe by joining forces with illumina we will achieve scales faster preventing more late stage cancer diagnoses we are strongly positioned with our 1st two conventional product launches expected in 202 and once our deal closes we will be able to leverage the global scale and reach of illumina through relationships and in country infrastructure to further our commercialization efforts simply put sales mission and focus will not change but illumina is international footprint and expertise across market access regulatory government affairs and manufacturing will accelerate our ability to realize our mission and goals of improve patient outcomes we built a world class team of data and computer scientists at the forefront of applying ai to genomics and were better to serve or leverage those capabilities for the benefit of human health in the process we have also established an impressive ip portfolio with more than 230 patents granted globally and another 170 pending patent applications with 115000 participants enrolled and another 30000 plans grail has built one of the largest population scale clinical trial programs ever pursued in genomic medicine grail is genomic database continues to grow with each task and additional clinical trial participant and today stands at over twelvesix petabytes worth of genomic data the comparison which is five times larger than the cancer genome atlas illumina remains the most innovative company in sequencing and grails ability to keep pushing the boundaries of what possible is what is possible to keep finding more and more cancers earlier stages will be further strengthened as a result of this combination having spent time with francis and the illumina team i am confident we all share the same goal and we are committed to accelerating our mission and delivering on our promise faster than could be done alone we both believe this is a case where one +one will equal well over two and with that i would like to hand the call back to francis thanks han i could not be more excited about the opportunity to work with the grail team to accelerate adoption of their life saving products by leveraging our global commercial clinical and operations capability on global commercial organization market sales and supports 6600 customers in 115 countries including a number of national population scale genomics program powered by illumina sequencing technology illumina 1st established our clinical lab in 200 and since then have added two more including one in the uk to support genomics england and the nhs this certified and accredited labs are staff by more than 250 team members including board certified pathologists medical geneticists genetic counselors and phd scientists over the last five years our lab has processed more than 17000000 or rass and almost 1000000 clinical samples we have also expanded our clinical capabilities and built out world class marching access government affairs and regulatory functions in addition our clinical grade development and manufacturing team delivered systems and kits registered for ivd use in more than 35 countries around the world and at the same time we have been extending our reach into the clinical market through partnerships with leading clinical companies including bms celgene and roche as illumina and grail come together we accelerate adoption of clinical ngs based testing this will have a positive impact on our business over time more of our revenue will reflect the clinical value of our ngs products and not only the underlying sequencing output as a result illumina will play a direct role in accelerating the adoption of genomic medicine in addition to enabling it as we evolve illumina remains committed to all of our customers and partners we are dedicated to delivering the most innovative sequeing sequencing systems as consumables to our customers and partners there is still so much important research to be done and we know this will be enabled in part by continued innovation in sequencing and on the clinical side our mission has always been improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome we will continue to enable our clinical customers to scale as they do work towards the shared goal with that let me hand things over to sam for a quick review of financial terms and impact thanks francis as announced earlier today we have agreed to acquire grail for total cash and stock consideration of $8000000000 with additional payments linked with certain product sales over the 1st twelve years this acquisition expands the illumina is market opportunity by more than $60000000000 it allows us to participate in the clinical markets more fully and it will contribute to revenue growth starting modestly in 2021 and meaningfully accelerate over time we expect the transaction flows in the 2nd half of 2021 and we will share more detailed expectations about revenue growth and impact on eps when that happens cash and stock consideration is $8000000000 since illumina currently owns twelve of grail is equity on a fully excluded basis the purchase price is approximately $7000000000 to grail is other shareholders as part of the transaction illumina will pay grail is shareholders approximately $4000000000 in common stock which is subject to a collar the number of shares issued be based on penetrate volume weighted average price of illumina common stock ten days prior to close moreover the stock consideration collar ensures the final number of shares the grail shareholders received is derived from a price that will be within a share price band of $295 and $399 the remaining $3100000000 cash consideration is expected to be funded with balance sheet cash and up to an additional $1000000000 raised either through equity or debt we have a $1000000000 fully committed bridge file with goldman sachs and sure funding availability the last component of the deal includes contingent payment rights to grail is shareholders based on grail related revenues for a twelve year period specifically a twofifty payment right is applied to the 1st $1000000000 of revenue each year and all revenue above that would be subject to a nine payment right to grail is shareholders with that back to francis thank you sam when we created grail in 2016 we knew that its mission was a moonshot but an important eleven that would have significant ramifications for the detection of cancer successful positively impacting 1000000s of lives and opening a massive market opportunity we wanted to see the technology progress as fast as possible create the largest political trials and get it to patients in years not decades it was clear that the best way to do this and capitalize the effort was as a separate company with this singular focus and an extraordinary team that could execute quickly illumina has set it up for success by seeding it with technology and some of our best and brightest four years later grail has proven the skeptics wrong and is now at the pre commercial stage it was a big bet and it paid off over the last fourfive years grail has raised almost $2000000000 to fund its mission during the same period illumina generated about $4000000000 in ebitda grail is mission is no longer a moonshot and we believe that it is poised to transform cancer detection our mission at illumina is to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome this has not changed in over the last 22 years we began our journey by launching our micro array based services and products our breakthrough arrays offered higher throughput lower costs more flexibility and higher quality than existing technologies and we became the leading micro array vendor by 2006 more than doubling revenues from the previous year while we enjoyed the success we saw the opportunity to take the next step forward towards our mission through sequencing going away and in 2020 we still have an array business but we saw the potential for enormous and very elastic research market fired by high quality lower cost sequencing so in 2006 we acquired solexa sequencing technology company with no revenue for $600000000 a 3rd of our market cap at the time the market was initially skeptical but we began the race to the $1000 genome and over the last fourteen years the vision has proved right we reduced the cost of high quality sequencing of a genome from $150000 in 2007 to $600 today enabling groundbreaking genomic discoveries including circulating fetal dna in maternal blood and the impact of rare variants on cancer therapy response by 2014 when we delivered the industry is 1st $1000 genome our research sequencing business was thriving and once again we sense we were entering a new era of genomics entering the clinic in 2013 we acquired verinata a provider of non invasive prenatal testing in december of 2013 we received the 1st ever fda authorization for our next generation sequencer we embarked on our own multi year clinical transformation building out the capabilities i referenced earlier today our clinical business therapy selection and oncology and idt and genetic disease testing account for half of our sequencing consumable revenues we are now entering the next phase of genomics sequencing to the standard of care early cancer detection represents the largest genomic application by far we believe over the next decade because cancer screening impacts a very large part of the population is in an era where regular genomic testing is the norm for a population we accelerate this vision by acquiring grail before we open up to q and a i want to summarize a few things 1st excluding grail for a moment we remain confident in our business and excited by the opportunity ahead we expect to continue as the leading innovator in sequencing supporting both research and clinical customers grail is not replacing anything and as such the acquisition will be additive to illumina is opportunity and growth we consider early cancer detection to be one of the largest clinical opportunities for the next fifteen years and we believe we will accelerate global adoption by participating more directly 2nd this acquisition is consistent with our strategy to extend it to the clinical market the fastest growing opportunity in sequencing we will continue to deliver sequencing systems and consumables and remain committed to the relentless pursuit of sequencing innovation to democratize access and realize the potential of this technology to positively impact human health 3rd we spun out grail four years ago on a moonshot mission the terrific progress they made has de risked the mission over time now that they stand poised to bring products to market in 2021 we believe this is the right time to bring the grail team into illumina so that we can help to commercialize and accelerate its adoption in closing our mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome and grail is mission in detect cancer early when it can be cured could not be more consistent we look forward to accelerating the age of genomic medicine together with that i will invite the operator to begin the q and a certainly at this time if you would like to ask a question please press star one again you will be limited to one question doug schenkel with cowen your line is open morning so so grail is clearly a a really exciting and promising asset and and you did a great job this morning outlining a lot of that and you were very comprehensive in explaining why you want to do this deal i am i am actually hoping that you could address how you got comfortable overcoming some of the reasons not to do the deal these include three things that would be really helpful for you to address the 1st is the challenge of competing with customers which has been an issue for you in the past and something you talked about avoidance so 1st off wondering how you expect to manage that and why the change why the pivot there 2nd the the dilution associated with this deal which could create a potential internal p and l conflict when it comes to incentive structure not to mention an issue with investor valuation methodologies i think this is part of the reason your stock got hit so much last week in anticipation of this announcement so how do you handle potential p and l conflict internal and externally moving forward and then 3rd so the lack of clear clinical operating synergies and and how you plan to succeed as a clinical development company in a way that you have not in the past we know that illumina is great at certain things that especially developing leading genetic tools platforms and having an amazing commercial team in place to support not just the placement of these platforms but how users use them that said while you have been great as an arms dealer to clinical customers your track record is not as strong when it comes to developing and selling assays and getting them through regulatory and reimbursement pathways so so what are the clinical synergies and how do you quantify them again one how do you manage the competing with customers two how do you manage the p and l conflict internal and externally and 3rd why should we get excited about this given the lack of clear clinical operating synergies thank you sure thank you doug so let us go through each of those the 1st one is how do we manage the challenge of competing with our customers and our strategy there continues to be that in the vast majority of applications in the market that we serve we will look to our customers and our partners to develop the applications and our sequencers and consumables and that is going to be to the vast majority of applications what we have said however is that for a very small set of applications where where we felt the market was large and we felt that there was a differentiated offering that we could put into the market and we would we would enter that market directly in those markets we still enable our customers and partners to create a competing offering so we continue to support everybody but we said in the very large markets where we felt we had a differentiated capability to bring into the market we would enter those and you have seen us do that for example in the nipt space where we brought innovations and intellectual property into that market and i have put together an end to end solution you saw us do that in the large cancer panels like the 500 gene panel tso fifty and now you are seeing us do that here in this case we feel that the criteria we use have been met this is a very large application for us we think that over the next fifteen years it could potentially be the largest genomics application in the market in terms of addressable market size and the grail team has put together a very differentiated offering there is a lot of innovation a lot of ip that was created hans talked about the 230 applications of patents that have been granted and 170 more that have been filed so there is a very differentiated offering and in this case you know with grail pioneering the market you know they are sort of leading the way in creating that market and so as we looked at the market we felt it meets the criteria for one of the very small set of markets that we would get into directly we are going to continue though to to enable our customers and partners to create their own offerings in this market too so that is how we thought about you know that question the next question was around dilution and how we got comfortable with that and how we to manage p and l costs and so the thinking here is that we are going to manage grail as a as a separate division and we get a report really transparent about the p and l of grail and we manage that differently and separately from the p and l for the rest of the business and we understand the profile of what it will take to get grail successful in the market going forward and so we will be very transparent about what that looks like now we expect that to be dilutive for the next few years but then because of the size of the opportunity we expect it to be highly accretive as this as we start to scale the offering in the later years and and again we will be very transparent about sharing what that looks like longterm we have a high confidence in the the p and l attractiveness of this business but we do know it takes investment in the 1st few years and the next question was about you know clinical synergy so what are the synergies that you know grail will enjoy coming into illumina and as you know we have been building out our clinical capabilities since 2000 201 and so today for example you know we have a number of places where we think gra grail can benefit you know as soon as they come in some of the things we talked about on the call one for example that we are engaged with over fifty population sequencing efforts around the world today we are talking to them about oncology therapy selection genetic disease diagnosis we think it is a very natural add to expand the conversation to include you know cancer screening and early detection we think it would be very valuable in conversations we are in so we will be able to immediately scale up a number of conversations that grail is having around the world we talked about our clinical lab we have among the largest clinical genomics labs in the world we have two in the us one in the uk those labs have already processed over a 1000000 clinical samples and build the workflows and expertise necessary to do that and then we have also built you know the regulatory capabilities the market access capabilities in country surveillance capabilities to support clinical offerings around the world today we have ives that are cleared in 35 countries around the world leveraging relationships we build with the regulatory bodies in those countries as well as having a market sur surveillance capability from those countries and you can see that playing out in the success of products that we have bought on the market like our veriseq nipt product which is ce ivd marked and doing really well in emea so those are some of the clinical capabilities and frankly we spend the last five plus years building that grail plugs into immediately your next question comes from tycho peterson with jp morgan your line is open hey thanks a couple of quick ones so you know your your stock lost 20000000000 in market cap list last week because alluded to you know did that influence your thinking and what is it that you think the street does not fully understand here you know especially given this as a pretty significant i think about a $4000000000 step up since the last round grail did in may and why is buying it all now the right approach given that you could have taken your equity stake up higher maybe to forty fifty healthy ipo and then you know had a call option to buy it later so that is the 1st question 2nd on margins can you give us a sense of where cogs can go you know we know you have off the shelf technology for $100 genome so how much of this is about driving down cogs quickly and then where do you think they can go and then how much do you think grail needs to spend on r d and the sales force ramp to to really scale up 3rd you know francis you talked about you know competence in in the core business you know i think one of the things investor is going to worry about is is you know you know concerns about growth in the core business or maybe you know you are doing this deal to to diversify and cover up you know continued to slow down so can you maybe talk to what you think about the core business for next year a little bit more quantitatively and then lastly you know either for francis or hans you know why is a 44 sensitivity for a screen test you know of clinical value especially at the price that has been been talked about thank you thank you tycho all right a lot of ground to cover so i am going to start by talking about your 1st question which is the why now question and then sam i am going to turn it over to you to talk about the margins question and then i will come back and talk about our core business and then and then i will look to to you hans maybe also to comment a little bit around the the screening tests and the clinical value so let us start so why now and and and was there any sort of reaction in our mind you are asking around the stock drop so the reason for why now and and frankly we took a longer term view so the events of last week did not really impact our why now decision and i will i will talk about that a little bit the the reason for why now is frankly the terrific progress that the grail team has made over the last few years and where they stand right now when we spun out grail four years ago you will remember how this idea got started right so we were processing samples for nipt and our clinical labs and although we were seeing normal you know fetal dna we noticed abnormalities in the mother is dna and so we reported that to the doctor and in all of those cases it turned out that the mother had cancer and did not know about it and so we incubated so there was a there was an idea that you could get signals for cancer in the blood and we incubated that idea without a team for a couple of years to feel like there was something there but there was a lot of unknowns it was unclear whether there was enough signal to detect early stage cancer it was unclear whether you could just detect only certain types of cancer it was unclear if the approach we were thinking about was the right approach and so what we wanted was to to create a company that was going after this this this moonshot mission that could be focused on that move quickly on that so we also wanted to know maybe other approaches in the market would would be more fruitful the team has done a fantastic job over the last four years and sort of a lot of the questions the the technology they put together the team they have assembled and then probably most importantly the results they are demonstrating from their large scale clinical studies have put to bed a lot of the questions that we had you know the the galleri results i talked about based on the ccga samples show that you know they are able to identify over fifty fifty types of cancer that they have a specificity that that means the false of 99 that the false positive rate of less than one they will not flood you know health care systems with false positives and they have high sensitivity especially for the deadliest cancers and so they stand today on the precipice of commercializing a product next year and so now now it makes a lot of sense for us to to acquire them and so why a part of you are asking why not just increase our investment and the reason to acquire them is because we have very clear line of sight into how we can accelerate a plan that they are on today and we can only do that if they are part of illumina plugging them into our commercial conversations with population sequencing efforts for example standing them up in our clinical labs around the world rather than waiting for them to build out their own clinical labs plugging into our regulatory expertise in countries around the world all of those things are things that we can do with their part of illumina and frankly we would not be able to do as well even if we were a thirty forty owner off of grail and so you know they are you know they they talk about launching the product next year so they are close to ma commercialization so it is exactly the right time we felt where there is a product you know the value has been demonstrated and they are ready to scale and that is where we can help from an operational perspective from a clinical perspective from a commercial perspective in terms of the stock drop you know we have seen before and i mentioned this in my prepared remarks that this is a big step i understand that this is also a big amount i understand that and you know we have we have had this happened to us before when we were in the array business and we wanted to get into sequencing and we announced that we were acquiring the solexa to get into the sequencing business our stock dropped that day too and and it took a while for us to work with with the market to explain where we were going and why we thought that was a big opportunity and of course you know today that has been enormously successful story and sequencing is the vast majority of our revenues and so you know we anticipated that there would be work for us to do and explaining this step and explaining the opportunity and explaining why grail and why grail and illumina and that is the work we have in front of us but we are very confident that it is the right next step in terms of fulfilling our mission with that i am going to turn it over to sam for you to talk about margins and the questions tycho had yeah so i will tackle a couple of things here margins and i think you had a question on operating expenses as well tycho so you know from an overall cogs standpoint the cogs will initially start out you know obviously much higher than our average cost driven by the fact that you know volumes are ramping up so initially you are going to see a higher cost profile for the business as the volume start ramping up though and twofive to three years post launch of galleri the cogs starts to get to a level which is commensurate with our overall services business and slightly below our overall cogs profile and obviously as we introduce more innovations and you know lower the cost of sequencing to your question the cogs will benefit from that as well just like our all of our customers will benefit from that in terms of operating expenses you know if you look at what what the grail invested last year or or this year i should for the 1st month it was roughly $135000000 if you extrapolate that for the full year let us say it is you know it is exactly double that it is about 270000000 for the full year as we look forward obviously that number is going to grow because we are going to be ramping and launching products we are going to be accelerating the commercialization efforts and building out a sales force and there is going to be continuing r d as well so you know opex especially in three years there is going to be you know i have backed on dilution you know but let me remind you of the just the attractiveness of this opportunity longer term and eventually as the volume scale the the opportunity is significant on the top line and even though it requires investments in terms of commercial efforts in r d you know we will definitely after a few years start to see accretion on p l and then maybe hans you comment on the the clinical value and the questions around this screening test and where we are sure so so as you as you noted tycho the sensitivity for fifty cancers is 44 so le let me explain why we think this is quite through performance francis touched on the fact that when we pre specified a basket of twelve cancers we have sensitivity of just under seventy and those twelve cancers by the way account for about two thirds of the mortality what you are observing is when you stop looking for more cancers in those twelve and you start adding in cancers where the test has lower sensitivity the sensitivity does drop but here is what matters even though the sensitivity drops as you expand the absolute number of cancers you look for the total number of cancers you detect goes up so a test looking for fifty cancers at 44 sensitivity in aggregate detect many more cancers and a test looking for twelve cancers at a 67 sensitivity and when you think about medical need we all have you know seventy of deaths in this country from cancer occurring cancers where there is no screening this test will detect the vast majority of those so so that that is why it is the right thing to have a test that can really detect the maximum number of cancers possible thank you hans and then your last question tycho was you know is is this move any reflection of how we think about the core market and is that what is driving this and i think not at all are we remain confident in our core market you know obviously this year the last couple of quarters we have seen a slow down because of people is sheltering in place as a result of the pandemic but we thought we have talked about how that is slowly been been building since the end of of q one and you know next year certainly as we start to see a number of initiatives kick back up we feel very good about where we are with the core business we talked about the population efforts that all of us is going to be starting in the back half of this year in the us but we will be wrapping up next year similarity that uk biobank project has been going on it paused for a little bit but it is starting to scale up again and then at the nhs effort which this year has been sideline to focus on on covid is going to be kicking back up next year so as we we are optimistic about where population sequencing efforts are going to be starting into next year we have seen good news in terms of guideline changes for nipt and continued growth in nipt around the world we are seeing continued adoption of our tso 500 products and we expect that to continue to drive growth and then obviously we launched the nextseq 2000 this year and so we expect to continue to see that upgrade cycle play out certainly as we get into next year this move is really about our strategy and our strategy has been guided by our mission to improve human health by unlocking the part of the genome our strategy is to provide sequencers and consumables to to abroad raf markets and then to pick very specific applications where we want to provide the sol solution ourselves we want to pick the largest market opportunities where we can provide a differentiated offering and frankly if you look at that criteria there probably is no other criteria no other space that meets that criteria as well as early cancer detection it is the largest of the genomic applications that we can imagine over the next fifteen years and grail has built a a a very innovation rich portfolio with good ip around it and so we will have a differentiated offering in that market and so the price again the strategy is you know horizontally provide sequencers and everywhere and then be very surgical and that is very common for platform companies certainly if you look at you are in technology whether it is apple or amazon or microsoft they provide the platform but then there are specific applications that they provide directly themselves typically the largest application and having an application actually gives you access to insights that have you created a better platform too so having specific application also help you helps you have the best platforms in the market so with that we will go to the next question certainly and as a reminder please limit yourself to one question to allow others an opportunity derik de bruin with bank of america your line is open hi good morning so a couple of questions i guess the 1st one how much illumina is revenues in 2019 and estimated revenues for 2028 were tied to sales to grail number one number two i a number of questions from investors this morning just wanting to get some better clarity on the eps solution is a twenty to thirty eps dilution a reasonable number for the ma investors to sort of do their models and number three what do you expect from the pathfinder trial readouts and and what would be a what would be a good readout to enable the ldt launch and just some initial thoughts on the early commercialization efforts and and what conversations grail has had with potential self insured employers and sort of the other members that you have talked about thank you sure so three questions i will take the 1st one around grail revenue to illumina in the last couple of years maybe sam you can talk about eps solutions and then hans you can answer the question around the pathfinder readout so 1st one sort of short in 2019 and 2020 grail was a very very very very small part of our overall revenue in fact i typically look at our top twenty customers on a daily and weekly basis i do not think i ever saw them in either of those two years on those lists so since a very small part of our revenue for 2019 or two sam maybe eps yeah so as i talked about earlier the the ramp of off in the 1st few years is significant driven by the commercialization of galleri so our expectations right now is that in the 1st full year post close of the deal that there would be eps dilution of somewhere in the 325 to $375 range and then hans could you talk a little bit about pathfinder and and the upcoming readouts and place that in context a little bit sure and and folks that are not familiar pathfinder is a 6000 patient clinical trial that is enrolling as we speak it is a return of results study so patients in this trial getting the grail test when the test detects the cancer they are getting worked up obviously the results returned to them so our expectation is that that real world trial will wi will confirm the performance we have seen in other studies that we have reported to you and covered on the call this morning the the other thing that this study is very important for is it will help us understand the service components of the test that we will provide to help make sure that the workup process post a positive test is is is simple and good to use for primary care doctors thank you all right next question patrick donnelly with citi your line is open great thanks guys maybe just to follow up on derik there just give him the dilution number a a little bit bigger than we were modeling so just as the news came out last week sam can you just talk about maybe the opex trajectory over the next twelve months again to get to that 350 375 number you noted should we expect that number to really take a big jump up from what we saw on the s one from the from the the grail opex numbers and then maybe just quickly after that you guys were obviously participating with some upside from grail and royalty as a customer et cetera so can you just expand a little more francis on on i guess why you guys wanted to bring it in house and then also give the royalty almost back to them with a nine over a 1000000000 they are just kind of flush that out a little bit thanks guys yeah so i can start on the on the opex trajectory and maybe expanding on this solution to some extent and i will remind everybody that we will be providing more refined financial estimates as we as we get closer to close of the acquisition so at this point we are giving you know directional numbers just to give you a sense of of what to expect in your models but to to answer your question around the opex investments patrick yes obviously there will be an increase from what you saw in the s one and what you saw last year or this year sorry i keep saying last year but what you saw this year in terms of investment by grail you know the investment has been focused on r d and as i said you know the investment that was disclosed was 135000000 so if you expect that that is going to you know be a full year worth of investment that is closer to 270 but as you look forward kind of the galleri launches there is going to be investments around a number of factors you know it is going to be r d is going to be commercial it is going to be market access government affairs you know dna to support the business there are a number of factors that drive that opex in the 1st you know in the in the 1st few years and until the revenue start to scale that is going to be significantly diluted so the number that i mentioned earlier which is the 325 to 375 in the 1st full year post launch so i think you know i was also though mention that we are at a $6000000000 tam that is gotten added to our business you know the the revenue opportunity is quite attractive as we as we look at the long term yeah and then thirdly let me pick up on your question around royalties so as you pointed out you know those the arrangement we have you know have pre acquisition was that they buy sequencers and consumables from us but we also get a royalty on on the grail revenue and you know as we have thought through you know we modeled what that looks like over the next fifteen years you know it is clear to us that you know we participate more fully so we get more revenue more margin dollars in you know if we acquired grail so just financially this is a much better way of capturing the the value in the market than continuing to be a supplier to grail with the royalty and as sam pointed out there is a $60000000000 market opportunity you know we we are able to sort of capture the value better in the current agreement in terms of the royalty back to grail shareholders and just as a point there as you heard in the prepared remarks we are twelve currently with the grail shareholding so you know the royalty by the way adjusted to the twelve that that we own ourselves and the thinking here was look we were working with the grail investors now this is one area where you know clearly they see the opportunity in front of them and there was a gap and i think they saw us and we were a little bit more conservative and so this was a nice way to sort of bridge doctors to say look we want to make sure that we participate if the opportunity is much bigger than we think that everybody wins otherwise we all share if it is if it is a little bit less than we thought so this was the way to structure it over the next twelve years where we could you know align on you know benefiting as the market ends up being much bigger than we than we thought steve beuchaw with wolfe research your line is open hi good morning thanks for the time i will ask just to one i actually want to follow up on a point that that tycho raised and it is about you know how you want to articulate right now what you think about the the core business i appreciate the points that all of us biobank nhs all coming on the next next year i am away to do the pipeline but i wonder would you be comfortable you know taking a view that the the core business the ex grail business is a double digit grower as far as you can see out into the future and then my 2nd one is as you think about the landscape of providers you know out five or or ten years ago from now rather five or ten years from now what does it look like in terms of how many different cancer detection assays you you think are out there having illumina involved in in this particular way it means that there is going to be one you know obviously very large scale player the ways to to come at this particular market can you talk about how you you see that looking and what is the importance of the rather substantial ip portfolio that you had flagged francis and hans as you think about what that landscape looks like thank you very much thank you steve so a couple of questions one is how do we think about the the core business and the 2nd one is how do we think the landscape for cancer detection assays will play out would there be a a significant single winner or would there be multiple players so let me go to the 1st one you know the i absolutely am comfortable you know saying that we expect our core business over a multi year period you know to generate double digit growth you know we are still as we said in the very early stages of understanding from a research perspective even how genomics translates into you know health and disease but from a clinical perspective we are also in the very early stages of penetrating some of the markets we talked about like oncology therapy selection and genetic disease testing genetic disease testing we are less than one penetration so i am comfortable that over a multi year period you should be seeing double digit growth from the core business and that you know the acquisition of grail is intended to accelerate that even further but even without it it is a double digit growth in terms of how we expect the cancer detection market to play out now this is a very very large market and you know we talked about a $60000000000 market and so we expect that there will be multiple approaches for this market that you know some will focus on single cancers or small set of cancers some will be pan cancer and and finally that is how we have modeled you know sort of the revenues for us that we expect there to be multiple players in are trying multiple different approaches serving different segments of the market and and again with a market this big and and this important we we expect it to play out that way and this is all the time we have for questions the illumina team thanks you all for your participation in today is conference this concludes today is call you may now disconnect",
            "prediction": "ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the conference call to discuss the definitive agreement for illumina to acquire grail at this time all participants are in a listen only mode after the speaker is presentation there will be a question and answer session to ask a question during the session you will need to press star one on your telephone keypad you will be limited to one question if you require any further assistance please press star zero thank you good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on such short notice to discuss the acquisition agreement for iuma to acquire grael if you have not had a chance to review today is release it can be found in the investor relations section of our website at iuma dot com participating for iuma today will be francis desouza president and chief executive officer and sam sumana chief financial officer we are also pleased to welcome our new colleagues from grael we look forward to working together as one team thank you good morning everyone frances hands and sam will share some prepared remarks and then we will open the call for some questions this call is being recorded and the audio portion will be archived in the investor section of our website today is presentation contains estimates projections and other forward looking statements these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties actually events or results may differ materially from those projected or discussed please review the cautionary statement i will turn the call over to france thanks jackie good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on such short notice i am excited to share that earlier this morning we announced an agreement to acquire grail and to work together to launch a new era in cancer detection before we start i want to acknowledge the grail team for what they have accomplished we spent out grail four years ago setting the stage for early cancer detection to likely be the largest genomic application over the next fifteen years by far this combination will be transformative for cancer detection leveraging illumina is global commercial clinical and operations capabilities accelerating their mission and allowing us to impact more people faster than they might have done alone illumina is next generation sequencers will continue to support genomic medicine to become the standard of care across clinical applications and with this acquisition we will accelerate and participate more fully and directly in the highest value clinical opportunities enabled by our technology specifically the acquisition position of aluna to participate in what we expect will be a $75000000000 market for ngs based oncology tests by 203560000000000 higher than our oncology tan excluding gray the 1st point i want to make is that less than twenty of patients will survive more than five years in contrast if we diagnose cancer early approximately ninety of patients are expected to survive beyond five years about 71 of cancer related deaths are attributed to cancers with no recommended screening tests and with limited screening tests cancer is more likely to be detected in the late stages and or more often than not too late this is both a human tragedy and an enormous burden on the healthcare system each year there are over 600000 cancer related deaths in the us and approximately 10000000 deaths worldwide making it the 2nd leading cause of death we spend approximately $250000000000 per year on cancer in the us and globally the annual economic impact is more than $1200000000000 and now for the 1st time ever the american cancer society has released a comprehensive report on the burden of cancer in the united states there is a technology platform that enables us to address this burden starting with grail is multi cancer detection test gallery which aims to reduce cancer deaths by transforming how and when cancer is detected grail is technology characterizes the dna that cancer cells shed into the blood detecting unique signatures that identify both the presence and often the tissue of origin of the cancer grail shared positive results from its circulating cell free genome atlas or ccga study that has enrolled 15000 participants the study found that the 1st version of grail reported sensitivity of 44 for stage one through three tumors for fifty different cancers and 67 sensitivity for the twelve deadliest cancers and in 93 of the positive results the test correctly identified the tissue of origin all with a specificity of greater than 99 and from a single blood draw arguably one of the most important performance measures for doctors and payers is the positive predictive value for ppp which is the percentage of positive tests that actually cancers for gallery we predict a ppp of 43 this represents we believe that this is a remarkable advance in the ability to detect cancer earlier which can transform cancer care and improve population health as noted earlier the greyhound team is preparing to launch gallery as a lab developed test or ldt in 2021 most cancers are currently diagnosed in late stages as shown by the gray bars in the chart on the left half of the slide check the limitations of current screening methods lead to only 31 of cancers being identified in stages one and two when they are the most treatable based on grail studies this could increase to 82 with broad adoption of galleries blood test complementing today is recommended cancer screening my apologies for the technical issues we will pick up again from five six most cancers are currently diagnosed in late stages as shown by the gray bars in the chart on the left half of slide six the limitations of current screening methods lead to only 31 of cancers being identified in stages one and two when they are most treatable based on grill studies this could increase to 82 with broad adoption of gallery blood tests complementing today is recommended screening this matters because as we mentioned earlier this matters because as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we

mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier survival rates are directly correlated with how early cancer is detected a broader option of gallery could avert nearly forty of the five year cancer mortality or around 100000 deaths annually in the us to put this in perspective this roughly matches the number of deaths prevented by all current screening testing treatment and surgery standards combined while screening has improved for some cancers including lung breast colorectal and cervical we know that roughly six in ten cancers diagnosed some 12000000 cases and 5000000 deaths a year are associated with cancers with no recommended screening requirement since gallery will help discover cancer earlier we believe that gallery can help detect three times as many cancers when added there is significant opportunity to improve outcomes for patients and the potential impact on families and communities highlights the importance of gray is work we will also be able to better meet the needs of healthcare providers and delivery systems by improving the overall efficiency of cancer detection by realizing the lower costs associated with the treatment of cancer at earlier stages based on gray is estimates the adoption of gray is technology will lead to significant cost savings for healthcare providers and patients could help reduce diagnostic workup costs by up to 65 these benefits are key drivers in the market potential which we anticipate reflects an addressable market for ngs based ancestry testing of $75000000000 today we are seeing rapid adoption of ngs based therapy selection tests many based on illumina technology we expect this market to grow in a cagr of about sixteen to $14000000000 to an annual 7000000 test opportunity at an approximate afs of 1300 to $2300 the market for lumbar puncture selection is our tsf 500 test currently available for research use only and making its way through regulatory approval for commercial launch in early 22 this report will focus on the strengths and drives utilization of therapy selection tests we are seeing more companies working on monitoring tests that will assess the activity of a patient is cancer this can optimize disease management and determine the effectiveness of cancer therapies for individual patients these assays can also act as surveillance tests for cancer patients who have completed therapy and are in remission we expect this market to grow with a cagr of about 27 the total addressable market is expected to grow from $5000000000 to $15000000000 by 2035 the test opportunity here is expected to grow to about 20000000 tests per year with an expected asp of $700 to $1000 the cancer screening opportunity is significantly larger than therapy selection and monitoring combined this market is expected to grow quickly to about 100 and 50000000 tests in 2035 a 75 growth category this assumes an asp that starts around $1200 and trends to about $300 in 2035 as we scale and dry adoption with increasingly accessible pricing with regards to the market for galleries specifically there is a sizable addressable market of over 100000000 people between the age of fifteen to 79 in the us we believe approximately half of this addressable market is dry adoptable the grand go to market strategy next year will consist of three core channels health systems self insured employers and concierge medicine given the cost improvement potential we feel that health systems and self insured employers will recognize the compelling value proposition and drive adoption of the 1st multi cancer detection ldlt available we have a segment that typically caters to health conscious members that like to be on the forefront of new medical technologies who could be early adopters of galleri we expect that galleri will launch in 2021 we look forward to additional results next year from the ccga substudy three and that batfinder to further support the clinical validation of galleri additionally galleri will continue to work on its diagnostic a for cancer tests or dac which is intended for symptomatic patients and is designed to speed up the time to diagnosis when cancer is suspected and grail also has a minimal residual disease or mrtd test in development intended for patients who have been diagnosed and treated to detect persistent disease following definitive therapy on that note i would like to invite henry the ceo of grail to say a few words thank you francis i am excited to be here today let me start by recognizing the accomplishments of the gray team we are a mission driven company focused on detecting cancer early when it can be cured and we believe our early cancer detection technology could substantially reduce the burden of cancer worldwide we have developed unique technology that preferentially targets the most informative regions of the genome and uses machine learning algorithms to we detect the presence of cancer and identify the tumor tissue of origin we believe by joining forces with illumina we will achieve scale faster preventing more late stage cancer diagnoses we are strongly positioned with our 1st two commercial product launches expected in 2020 2021 and once our deal closes we will be able to leverage the global scale and reach of illumina through relationships in country infrastructure to further our commercialization efforts simply put sales mission and focus will not change but illuminous international footprint and expertise across market access regulatory government affairs and manufacturing will accelerate our ability to realize our mission and goal to improve patient outcomes we built a world class team of data and computer scientists at the forefront of applying in the process we have also established an impressive ip portfolio with more than 230 patents granted globally and another 170 pending patent applications with 115000 participants enrolled and another 30000 planned brexl has built the largest population scale clinical trial programs ever pursued in genomic medicine continue to grow with each test and additional clinical trial participant and today stands at over twelvesix petabytes worth of genomic data for comparison this is five times larger than the cancer genome atlas i want to thank doctor francis and the 11th team for their efforts and their commitment to accelerating our mission and delivering on our promise faster than could be done alone we both believe this is a case where one +one equals three thank you tom i could not be more excited about the opportunity to work with the grail team to accelerate adoption of their life saving products by leveraging our global commercial clinical and operational capabilities our global commercial organization market sell and support only 6060 customers in 100 and fifteen countries including a number of national population scale genomics programs powered by illumina sequencing technology illumina 1st established our clinical lab in 2009 and since then have added two more including one in the uk to support genomics england and the nhs be certified and accredited labs are staffed by more than 250 team members including board certified pathologists medical geneticists genetic counselors and phd scientists over the last five years our labs have processed more than 17000000 arrays and almost 1000000 clinical samples we have also expanded our clinical capabilities and built out world class market access government affairs and regulatory functions in addition our clinical development and manufacturing teams deliver systems and kits registered for ivd use in more than 35 countries around the world now at the same time we have been extending our reach into the clinical market through partnerships with leading clinical companies including bms kyowa kirin and roche as illumina and grail come together we accelerate adoption of clinical ngs based testing this will have a positive impact on our business over time more of our revenue will reflect the clinical value of our ngs products and not only the underlying sequencing outputs as a result illumina will play a direct role in this lumetra remains committed to all of our customers and partners we are dedicated to delivering the most innovative sequencing systems and consumables to our customers and partners there is still so much important research to be done and we know this will be enabled in part by continued innovation in sequencing on the clinical side our mission has always been to deliver the best solutions to our customers we will continue to enable our clinical customers to scale as they too work towards the shared goal with that let me hand things over to sam for a quick review of financial terms and impact this acquisition expands aluminas market opportunity by more than $60000000000 it allows us to participate in the clinical market more fully and will contribute to revenue growth starting modestly in 2021 and meaningfully accelerate over time we expect the transaction to close in the 2nd half of 2021 and we will share more detailed expectations about revenue growth and impact on eps when that happens the sale consideration is $8000000000 since alcoa currently owns twelve of galleon is equity on a fully diluted basis the purchase price will be approximately $7000000000 to galleon is other shareholders as part of the transaction alcoa will pay galleon is shareholders approximately $4000000000 in common stock which is subject to a collar the number of shares issued will be based on the twenty trait volume weighted average price aluminum company of america common stock ten days prior to close moreover the stock consideration collar ensures the final number of shares that grael shareholders receive is derived from a price that will be within a share price band of $295 and $399 the remaining $3100000000 cash consideration is expected to be funded with balance sheet cash and up to an additional $1000000000 raised we have a $1000000 fully committed bridge loan for golden sachs to secure funding availability the last component of the deal includes contingent payment rights to grail shareholders based on grail or related revenues for a twelve year period specifically a twofive payment right is applied to the 1st $1000000000 of revenue each year and all revenue above that would be subject to a nine payment right with that backwash thank you sam when we created grail in 2016 we knew that its mission was the moonshot but an important eleven that would have significantramifications for the detection of cancer is successful palpably impacting 1000000s of lives and opening a massive market opportunity we wanted to see that technology progress as fast as possible create our largest clinical trials and it was clear that the best way to do this and capitalize the effort was as a separate company with this singular focus and an extraordinary team that could execute quickly lumina set it up for success by seeding it with technology and some of our best and brightest four years later grael has proven the skeptics wrong and is now at the pre commercial stage it was a big bet and it paid off hello this is an automated message from the illumina foundation we are pleased to inform you that illumina has raised almost $2000000000 to fund its mission during the same period illumina generator has about $4000000000 in revenues in europe illumina is mission is no longer a moonshot and we believe it is poised to transform cancer detection our mission at illumina is to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome it has not changed in over the last 22 years we began our journey by sequencing the 1st human genome our breakthrough arrays offered higher throughput lower costs more flexibility and higher quality than existing technologies and we became the leading microarray vendor by 2006 more than doubling revenues from the previous year while we enjoyed the success we saw the opportunity to take the next step forward towards our mission through sequencing arrays were not going away and in 2020 we still have an array business but we saw the potential of sequencing for enormous and very elastic research markets required by high quality lower cost sequencing so in 2006 we acquired selexa a sequencing technology company with no revenue for $600000000 a 3rd of our market gap at the time the market was initially skeptical but we began the race to the $1000 genome and over the last fourteen years the vision has proved right we reduced the cost of high quality sequencing of a genome from $100 to one in 2000 and 2007 to $600 today enabling groundbreaking genomic discoveries including circulating fetal dna in maternal blood and the impact of rare variants on cancer therapy response by 2014 when we delivered the industry is 1st $1000 genome our research sequencing business was thriving and once again we sent we were entering a new era of genomics entering the clinic in 2013 we acquired varinata a provider in december 2013 we received the 1st ever fda authorization for our next generation sequencer we embarked on our own multi year clinical transformation building out the capabilities i referenced earlier today our clinical business therapy selection in oncology nict and genetic disease testing account for half of our sequencing consumable revenues we are now entering the next phase of genomics early cancer detection represents the largest genomic application by far we believe over the next decade because cancer screening impacts a very large part of the population it ushers in an era where regular genomic testing is the norm for a population we accelerate this vision by acquiring grails before we open up to q a i want to summarize a few things 1st excluding grails for a moment we remain confident in our business and excited by the opportunity ahead we expect to continue as the leading innovator in sequencing supporting both research and clinical customers grail was not replacing anything and as such the acquisition will be additive to illumina is opportunity and growth we consider early cancer detection to be one of the largest clinical opportunities of the next fifteen years and we believe that we will accelerate global adoption by participating more directly this acquisition is consistent with our strategy to extend into the clinical market the fastest growing opportunity in sequencing is we will continue to deliver sequencing systems and consumables and remain committed to the relentless pursuit of sequencing innovation to democratize access and realize the potential of this technology to positively impact human health 3rd we spun out genoptix four years ago on a moonshot mission the tremendous progress they made now that they stand poised to bring products to market in 2021 we believe this is the right time to bring the gray team into aluminum so that we can help to commercialize and accelerate adoption in closing our mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome and gray is mission to detect cancer early when it can be cured should not be more consistent when it forward to accelerating adoption together with that i will invite the operator to begin the q a certainly at this time if you would like to ask a question please press star one again again you will be limited to one question doug shenkell with allen your line is open a lot of that and you were very comprehensive in explaining why you want to do this deal i am i am actually hoping that you could address how you got comfortable overcoming some of the reasons not to do the deal these include three things that would be really helpful for you to address the 1st is the challenge of competing with customers which has been an issue for you in the past and something you have talked about avoiding so i am 1st off wondering how you expect to manage that and why the change 1st why the pivot there 2nd the dilution associated with this deal which could create a potential internal pnl conflict when it comes to an incentive structure not to mention an issue with investor valuation methodologies i think this is part of the reason your stock got hit so much last week in anticipation of this announcement so how do you handle potential pnl conflict internally and externally moving forward and then 3rd but the lack of clear clinical operating synergies and how you plan to succeed as a clinical development company in a way that you have not in the past we know that illumina is great at certain things that especially developing leading genetic tools platforms and having an amazing commercial team in place to support not just the placement of these platforms but how users use them that said while you have been great as an arms dealer to clinical customers your track record is not as strong when it comes to developing and selling yeah so what are the clinical synergies and how do you quantify them one how do you manage competing with customers two how do you manage the pnl conflict internally and externally three why should we get excited about this given the lack of clear clinical operating synergies thank you sure thank you judge so let us go through each of those the 1st one is how do we manage the challenge of competing with customers our strategy there continues to be that in the vast majority of applications in the markets that we serve we will look to our customers and our partners to develop the applications and our sequencers and consumables and that is going to be true for the vast majority of applications what we said however is that for a very small set of applications where we felt the market was large and we felt that there was a differentiated offering that we could put into the market then we would we would in those markets we still enable our customers and partners to create competing offerings so we continue to support everybody but we said in the very large markets where we felt we had a differentiated capability to bring into the market we would enter those and you have seen us do that for example in the niptg space where we brought innovations and an international property into that market and put together an end to end solution you saw us do that in the large cancer panels like the 500 gene panel tso 500 the next case we feel that the criteria we use have been met this is a very large application for us we think that over the next fifteen years it could potentially be the largest genomics application in the market in terms of addressable market size and the genomic team has put together a very differentiated offering a lot of innovation a lot of ip that was created and talked about the 230 applications that patents that have been granted so we have seventy more that have been filed and so there is a very differentiated offering and in this case you know with grail pioneering the market you know they are sort of leading the way and creating that market and so as we looked at the market we felt it meets the criteria for one of the very small set of markets that we would get into directly we are going to continue though to to enable our customers and partners to create their own offerings in this market too so that is how we thought about you know that question the next question was around dilution and and how that would impact our offering and so the thinking here is that we are going to manage greyhound as a as a separate division and we are going to have a report really transparent about the pnl of greyhound and we are going to manage that differently and separately from the pnl for the rest of the business and we understand the profile of what it will take to get greyhound successful in the market going forward and so we will be very transparent about you know what that that is now we expect that to be delusive for the next few years but then because of the size of the opportunity we expect it to be highly accretive as this as we start to scale the offering in the later years and then again we will be very transparent about sharing what that looks like long term we have a high confidence in the pnl attractiveness of this business but we do know it takes investment in the 1st few years the next question was about you know clinical synergies so what are the synergies that you know that you guys have as you know we have been building out our clinical capabilities since 2013 and so today for example you know we have a number of places where we think that gale could benefit you know as soon as they come in some things we talked about on the call for example that we are engaged with over fifty population sequencing efforts around the world today we are talking to them about oncology therapy selection genetic disease diagnosis that we think is a big area where gale could benefit natural ads to expand the conversation to include cancer screening authority detection we think it will be very valuable in the conversations we are in and so we will be able to immediately scale up the number of conversations that gray is having around the world we talked about our clinical labs we have among the largest clinical genomics labs in the world we have two in the us one in the uk those labs have already processed over a 1000000 clinical samples and built the workflows and and we have also built the regulatory capabilities the market access capabilities that in country surveillance capabilities to support clinical offerings around the world today we have ides that are cleared in 35 countries around the world leveraging relationships we build with the regulatory bodies in those countries as well as having in market surveillance capabilities in those countries and you can see that playing out in the success of our products i think the market like our vericel ibd product which is ceivd mark and doing really well in amia so those are some of the clinical capabilities that frankly we spent the last five plus years building that grail plugs into immediately your next question comes from tycho peterson with jp morgan your line is open hey thanks a couple quick ones so you know your stock lost 20000000000 in market capitalization last week is doug alluded to that you know does that influence your thinking and and what does it set you think the street does not fully understand here you know especially given this is a pretty significant i think about a $4000000 step up since the last round grade given in may and why is buying it all now the right approach given that you could have taken your equity stake off higher maybe at 4050 help the ipo and then you know had a call option to buy it later so that is the 1st question 2nd on margins can you give us a sense of where cogs can go you know we know you have off the shelf technology for a $100 genome so how much of this is about driving down cogs quickly 3rd you know frances you talked about  you know a confidence in in the core business you know i think one of the things that the investor is going to worry about is is you know  you know concerns about growth in the core business or maybe you know you are doing this deal to to diversify and cover up you know it continues to slow down so can you maybe talk to what you think about the core business for next year a little bit more quantitatively and then lastly you know you know thank you for being here you know why is the 44 sensitivity for a screening test you know of clinical value especially at the price points being talked about thank you thank you trecroft alright a lot of ground to cover so i am going to start by talking about your 1st question which is the why now question and then sam is going to turn it over to you to talk about the margins question and then i will come back and talk about you know our core business and then i will look to you maybe i will comment a little bit alright so let us start so why now so why now and honestly we took a longer term view so the events of last week did not really impact our why now decision and i will talk about that a little bit but the reason for why now is frankly the tremendous progress that the grape team has made over the last few years and where they stand right now when we spun out grail four years ago you will remember how this idea got started right so we were processing samples for n i p t in our clinical labs and although we were seeing normal you know fetal dna we noticed abnormalities in the mother is dna and so we reported that to the doctor and in all of those cases it turned out that the mother had cancer and did not know about it and so we incubated so there was a that we could get signals for cancer in the blood and we incubated that idea with our team for a couple of years to feel like there was something there but there was a lot of unknown that was unclear whether there was a mass signal to detect early stage cancer it was unclear whether you could detect only certain types of cancer it was unclear if the approach we were thinking about was the right approach and so what we wanted was to create a company that was going after this moonshot mission that we focused on i think we moved quickly on that but we also wanted to know maybe other approaches in the market would would be more fruitful the team has done a fantastic job over the last four years and sort of dearest to a lot of the questions the the technology they put together the team they have assembled and then probably most importantly the results they are demonstrating from their large scale clinical studies have put to bed a lot of the questions that we had you know the the gallery results i talked about based on the cccg they are able to identify over fifty types of cancer they have a specificity that means that of 99 of the false positive rate is less than one so they will not flood you know healthcare systems with false positives and they have high sensitivity especially for the deadliest cancers and so they stand today on the principles of commercializing a product next year and so now now it makes a lot of sense why acquire them and then so why acquire them you asked that why not just increase our investment and the reason to acquire them is because we have a very clear line of sight into how we can accelerate the plan that they are on today and we can only do that as part of alumina plugging them into our commercial  conversations with population sequencing efforts for example standing them up in our clinical labs around the world rather than wait for them to build up their own clinical labs plugging into our regulatory process i think there is a huge opportunity for us in countries around the world all of those things are things that we can do with their particle luminescence that frankly we would not be able to do as well even if we were a 3040 owner of grail and so you know they are you know basically talk about launching the product next year and their commercialization so exactly the right time we felt where there is a product you know the value has been demonstrated and they are ready to scale and that is where we can help from an operational perspective from a clinical perspective from a commercial perspective in terms of the stop and drop you know we have seen before and i mentioned this in my prepared remarks but this is a big step i understand that this is also a big amount i understand that and you know we have had this happen to us before when we were in the array business and we wanted to get into sequencing and we announced that we were requiring selexa to get into the sequencing business our stock dropped that day too and it took a while for us to work with the market we were going to be going and why we thought that was a big opportunity and of course you know today that is an enormous successful story and sequencing is the vast majority of our revenues and so you know we anticipated that there was going to be work for us to do in explaining this step and explaining the opportunity and explaining why grail and and why grail in illumina and and that is the work we have in front of us but we are very confident that it is the right next step in terms of fulfilling our mission and with that i am going to turn it over to sam for you to talk about margins and questions yeah so i will tackle a couple of things here our margins and i think you had a question on operating expenses as well kyco so you know from an overall cog standpoint the cogs will initially start out you know obviously much higher than our average cog driven by the fact that you know volumes are ramping up so initially you are going to see a higher cog profile for the business as the volumes start ramping up though and twofive to three years post launch of gallery i think that we should start to get to a level which is commensurate with our overall services business and slightly below our overall cog is profile and obviously as we introduce more innovations and you know lower the cost of sequencing to your question the copps will benefit from that as well just like all of our customers will benefit from that in terms of operating expenses you know if you look at what what grail invested last year or for the 1st month it was roughly $135000000 if you extrapolate that for the full year let us say it is you know it is exactly double that it is about 270000000 for the full year as we look forward obviously that number is going to grow because we are going to be ramping and launching products we are going to be accelerating the commercialization efforts and building out a sales force and there is going to be continuing r and d as well so you know opex especially and i am going to be you know i have backed on dilution y know but let me remind you of just the attractiveness of this opportunity longer term and eventually as the volume scale the the opportunity is significant on the top line and even though it requires investment in terms of commercial efforts in r and d you know we will definitely after a few years start to see accretion on y know dilution yes and the questions are around the screening test and where we are and sure so so as you as you noticed tycho the sensitivity for fifty cancers is 44 so let me explain why we think this is breakthrough performance francis touched on the fact that when we pre specified a basket of twelve cancers we have sensitivity of just under seventy and those twelve cancers cancers by the way account for about two thirds of of mortality what you are observing is when you start looking for more cancers than those twelve and you start adding in cancers where the test has lower sensitivity the sensitivity does drop but here is what matters even though the sensitivity drops as you expand the absolute number of cancers you look for the total number of cancers you detect goes up so a test looking for fifty cancers at 44 sensitivity in aggregate detects many more cancers than a test looking for twelve cancers at a 67 sensitivity and when you think about the medical mean we all have seventy of deaths in this country from cancer occurring cancers where there is no screening this test will detects the vast majority of those so so that is why it is the right thing to have a test that can really detect the maximum number of cancers possible great thank you hans your last question teller was you know is this move any reflection of how we think about the core market and is that what is driving this and i say not at all we remain confident in our core market you know obviously this year in the last couple of quarters we see a slowdown because of people sheltering in place as a result of the pandemic but we thought we talked about how that is slowly been building since the end of q one next year certainly as we start to see a number of initiatives kick back up we feel very good about where we are with the core business we talked about the population efforts that all of us is going to be starting in the back half of this year in the us but we will be wrapping up next year similarly the uk biobank project has been going as well i am going to talk about a little bit but it is starting to scale up again and then at the nih effort which this year has been sidetracked to focus on on covid is going to be kicking back up next year so we are optimistic about where population sequencing efforts are going to be starting into next year we are seeing good news in terms of guideline changes for an ipt and continued growth in ipt around the world we are seeing continued adoption of our tsso 500 product they expect that to happen this move is really about our strategy and our strategy has been guided by our mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome our strategy is to provide sequencers and consumables to a broad array of markets and then to pick very specific applications where we can make a real impact we want to take the largest market opportunities where we can provide a differentiated offering and frankly if you look at that criteria probably is no other criteria no other space that meets that criteria as well as urgent cancer detection it is the largest of the genomic applications that we can imagine over the next fifteen years and grail has built a very innovation rich portfolio with good ip around it and so we will have have that so the strategy is you know horizontally provide sequencers and be everywhere and then be very search engine oriented and that is very common for platform companies certainly if you look at you know on technology whether it is apple or amazon or mircosoft they provide the platform but then there are specific applications that they provide directly themselves typically the largest applications and having an application actually gives you access to insights that have you created so having specific applications also helps you have the best platforms in the market so with that we will go to the next question certainly as a reminder please limit yourself to one question to allow others an opportunity derek debrowne with bank of america your line is open tied to sales to grail number one number two a number of questions from investors this morning just wanting to get some better clarity on the eps solution is a twenty to thirty eps solution a reasonable number for the for model investors to sort of do their models and number three what do you expect from the pathfinder trial readouts and and what would be a what would be a good readout to enable the ldt launch and just some initial thoughts on the early commercialization efforts and and what conversations grail has had with potential self insured employers and sort of the other members that you talked about thank you sure so three questions i will take the 1st one around grail revenue to aluminum in the last couple of years maybe sam you can talk about eps solutions and then pan so you can essentially push around it pathfinder readout so for the short in 2019 and 2020 grill was a very very very very small part of our overall revenue in fact i typically look at our top twenty customers on a daily and weekly basis and i do not think i ever saw them in either of those two years on those lists so that is a very small part of our revenue for 2019 or 2020 that may be eps yeah so as i talked about earlier the ramp of all effects and our expectations right now is that in the 1st full year post close of the deal that there would be the ps dissolution of somewhere in the 325 to $375 range and and for folks that are not familiar pathfinder is a 6000 patient clinical trial that is enrolling as we speak it is a return of results study so patients in this trial getting the grail test when the test detects a cancer they are getting worked up and obviously the results returned to them so our expectation is that that real world trial will will confirm the performance we have seen in the lab the other thing that this study is very important for is it will help us understand the service components of the tests that we will provide to help make sure that the workup process post a positive test is is simple and good to use for primary care doctors thank you all right next question patrick donelly with city your line is open great thanks guys maybe there is a follow up on derek there just giving the dilution number a little bit bigger than we were modeling because as the news came out last week sam can you just talk about maybe the optex trajectory over the next twelve months again to get to that 350000 375000 number you noted yeah should we expect that number to really take a big jump up from what we saw on the s one from the the grayle optex number and then maybe just quickly after that you guys were obviously participating in some upside from the royalty to the royalty as a customer etc so can you just expand a little more francis on on i guess why you guys wanted to bring it in house and then also give the royalty almost back to them with the nine over a 1000000000 they just kind of flushed that out a little bit but thanks guys estimates as we as we get closer to the close of the acquisition so at this point we are giving you you know directional numbers just to give you a sense of of what to expect in your models but to answer your question around the opex investment patrick yes obviously there will be an increase from you know what you saw in the s one and what you saw last year or this year sorry i keep saying last year but what you saw this year in terms of investment by grail you know the investment has been focused on r and d and as i said you know the investment that was disclosed was 135000000 so if you expect that that is going to you know be a full year worth of investment that is closer to 270 but as we look forward and as the gallery launches there is going to be investments around the number of factors you know it is going to be r and d it is going to be commercial it is going to be market access government affairs you know dna to support the business there are a number of factors that drive that ohmex in the 1st you know in the and the 1st few years and until the the gallery opens there is going to be investments around the number of factors to start the scale that is going to be significantly diluted to the number that i mentioned earlier which is the 325 to 375 in the 1st full year post launch so i think you know i would also they will mention that with a $six ten that is gotten added to our business you know the the revenue opportunity is quite attractive as we look as we look at the long term yeah and that is not it that is not it to me pick up on your question on royalties so as you figured out you know the arrangement we have you know have pretty acquisition with greylock obviously that they buy sequencers and consumables from us but we also get a royalty on on the greylock revenue and you know as we thought through you know sort of and we modeled what that looks like over the next fifteen years you know it is it is clear to us that you know we participate more fully so we get more revenue more margin dollars yeah in you know if we acquire greylock so just financially this is a much better way of capturing we value the market then continuing to be a supplier to grail with the royalty and as sam pointed out this is a $60000000000 market opportunity and we are able to so sort of capture the value better in the current agreement in terms of the royalty back to grail shareholders and then just as a point there as you heard in the prepared remarks we are twelve currently of grail is shareholders so you know the royalty you know you better adjust it for the twelve that that we own ourselves the thinking here was look we as we were working with the gray investors now this is one area where you know clearly they see the opportunity in front of them and there was a gap in how big their day saws were and we were a little bit more conservative and so this was a nice way to sort of bridge that and say look we are going to make sure that we participate if the opportunity is much bigger than we think then everybody wins otherwise we all share if it is if it is a little bit less than we thought and so this was a way to structure it over the next twelve years where we could you know align hey you know i think you are demonstrating the marketing of being much bigger than you are going to be steve with wolf research your line is open hi good morning thanks for the time i will ask just one i actually want to follow up on a point that the tyker raised and it is about how you want to articulate right now what you think about the core business i appreciate the points that all of us made and bank nchs all coming on next year i am a way to see the pipeline but i wonder would you be comfortable you know taking a view that the the core business the x ray business is a double digit grower as far as you can see out into the future and then my 2nd one is as you think about the landscape of providers you know out five or or ten years ago from now from now what does it look like in terms of how many different cancer detection assays are out there you think are out there having illumina involved in this particular way it means that there is going to be one you know obviously very large scale player the ways to to come at this particular market can you talk about how you you see that looking and what is the importance of the the rather substantial ip portfolio that you have flagged francis and hans as you think about what that landscape looks like thank you very much the 1st one is you know how do we think about the core business and the 2nd one is how do we think the the landscape for cancer deduction assets will play out will there be a significant single winner or will there be multiple players so let me go to the 1st one you know i absolutely am uncomfortable you know saying that we expect our core business over a multi year period to you know to generate double digit growth you know we are still as we said in the very early stages of understanding from a research perspective even how genomics translates you know health and disease but from a critical perspective we are also in the very early stages of penetrating some of the markets we talked about life oncology therapy selection and genetic disease testing and genetic disease testing is less than one penetrate it so i am uncomfortable that over a multiyear period you should be seeing double digit growth from the core business and that you know the acquisition of grail is intended to accelerate that even further but even without it it is a double digit growth in terms of how we expect to perform we are still in the process of finalizing our budget for the year but we expect to see revenue growth in the low teens now the cancer detection market to play out you know this is a very very large market and you know we talked about a $60000000000 market and so we expect that there will be multiple approaches for this market that you know some will focus on single cancers or small set of cancers some will be pan cancer and and frankly that is how we have modeled you know sort of the revenues for us that we expect there to be multiple players you know trying multiple different approaches serving different markets the market is this big and this important we expect to play out that way and this is all the time we have for questions the ium team thanks you all for your participation in today is conference this concludes today is call you may now disconnect",
