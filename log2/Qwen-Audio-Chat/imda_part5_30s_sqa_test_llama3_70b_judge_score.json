            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is suggesting to push out of one's comfort zone and try new things to avoid regrets, whereas the model's answer provides a list of 7 tips for avoiding regrets in daily life. Although the model's answer touches on the topic of regrets, it does not directly address the idea of pushing out of one's comfort zone. The tips provided are more focused on mindfulness, responsibility, and gratitude, which are not directly related to the reference answer.\n\nRating: 2",

            "model_prediction": "Based on the audio, Speaker1 felt ashamed and upset because they had betrayed a friend by attempting to harm someone. They also felt that their friend had betrayed them by not standing up for them when they were accused of a crime.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is about Speaker1's feelings of shame and upset due to someone they trusted betraying them, with photo and video evidence. However, the model's answer claims that Speaker1 felt ashamed and upset because they betrayed a friend and their friend didn't stand up for them when accused of a crime. I think the model's answer is completely misaligned with the reference answer, providing incorrect and irrelevant information.\n\nRating: 0",

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is a simple \"Yes\" (implying \"no\" since the question is \"Does Speaker1 still need to wait...\"), while the model's answer is a more detailed explanation of why Speaker1 doesn't need to wait. I think the model's answer is accurate and relevant, but it's not a direct \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, so it's not a perfect match.\n\nRating: 4",

In contrast, the model's answer shifts the focus to credit cards and financial habits, indicating that the speaker is responsible in using credit cards, whereas their friends may not have established good financial habits.

They may not be able to really go through with you the policy contract wordings because you know they were only told that they only know the jest like you know in general what it covers, you know what the coverages are, you know how much you are being covered .",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is brief and concise, stating that an insurance agent's knowledge about policy contract wordings is limited to general information, such as what is covered and how much the customer is being covered. The model's answer, on the other hand, is wordy and attempts to paraphrase the reference answer. While it captures the general idea, it uses vague language like \"jest\" and \"you know\" multiple times, making it less clear and concise than the reference answer.

            "model_prediction": "The two main reasons mentioned by Speaker2 for not switching to another bank from POSB are that their parents are using POSB, and they have been using it since young, and they didn't find the need to switch to any other banks because of their attractive interest rates as well as the fact that they do not require a minimum amount to be held in the account, unlike other banks where some banks require you to.",
