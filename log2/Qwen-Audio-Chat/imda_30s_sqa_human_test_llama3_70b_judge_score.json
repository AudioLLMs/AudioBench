            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer clearly states that the constructed roads make traveling back difficult, requiring a far detour and a 30-minute walk to a distant bus stop to return to the same location. The model's answer attempts to paraphrase this idea, but it is unclear and lacks precision.
