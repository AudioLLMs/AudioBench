            "model_prediction": "The audio doesn't explicitly offer a direct suggestion for *avoiding* regrets, but it emphasizes being mindful and acting on desires in the moment, like buying that ice cream, to minimize potential regrets later.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"pushing out of one's comfort zone and trying new things\" to avoid regrets, while the model's answer is \"being mindful and acting on desires in the moment\" to minimize potential regrets. I think the model's answer is related to the topic of regrets, but it diverges significantly from the reference in accuracy and relevance. The model's answer focuses more on being mindful in the present, whereas the reference answer emphasizes taking action outside of one's comfort zone.\n\nRating: 2",

The model's answer also changes the focus from the betrayal to the presence of evidence, making it less accurate. However, the model's answer does capture the essence of Speaker1 feeling shame and upset due to the betrayal.\n\nRating: 3",
