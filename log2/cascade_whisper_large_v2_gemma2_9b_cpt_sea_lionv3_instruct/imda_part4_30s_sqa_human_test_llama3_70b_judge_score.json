            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is a concise description of Speaker1's work arrangement, stating that they work from home but visit the office one or two times a week. The model's answer rephrases this information in a similar structure, using slightly different wording. I think the model's answer is a good paraphrase of the reference answer.\n\nRating: 5",

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is \"Half in Chinese and half in English\", while the model's answer is \"Malay and English\". I think the model's answer is completely misaligned, as it doesn't match the reference answer in terms of the specific languages mentioned, and the concept of \"half and half\" is also lost.\n\nRating: 0",

            "model_prediction": "Speaker1 describes taking MCs nowadays as being more scrutinized and recorded, unlike in the past where it was more lenient and less traceable.  Employees' names might be flagged, and their absences become more transparent to their bosses.\n",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer states that taking MCs nowadays is more scrutinized compared to before, as employers may keep records, making it less casual than in the past. The model's answer describes taking MCs nowadays as being more scrutinized and recorded, unlike in the past where it was more lenient and less traceable. Both answers convey the idea that taking MCs is more formalized and recorded nowadays compared to the past. However, the model's answer adds extra information about employees' names being flagged and their absences becoming more transparent to their bosses, which is not present in the reference answer.\n\nRating: 4",

            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is a straightforward summary of Speaker1's criticism, stating that online posts often repeat themselves with redundant introductions and lack meaningful content. The model's answer, while related, adds its own interpretation and details, such as questioning the purpose of the repetition and specifying the examples. I think the model's answer is close to the reference but adds some extra information.\n\nRating: 4",

            "model_prediction": "Speaker1 describes that Hazel's friendships tend to be calming and relaxing for others (\"chill her out\"), except for one guy named Dickson, who doesn't have the same effect. This dynamic leads to Speaker1 observing an imbalance and questioning why Hazel hasn't pursued a romantic interest with Dickson, given his apparent liking for her. \n\n",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is about Hazel not inviting someone out, leading to tension, and Dickson liking Hazel who was already with someone else. The model's answer, on the other hand, describes Hazel's friendships as calming, except for Dickson, and questions why Hazel hasn't pursued a romantic interest with him. I think the model's answer is partially related to the reference, but it misinterprets the situation and adds unnecessary details.\n\nRating: 2",

In contrast, the model's answer only mentions that it was \"pretty cool\" due to modder's work, colouring, and lighting, without capturing the essence of the spiritual feeling or the overall atmosphere. While the model's answer touches on the topic, it lacks detail and accuracy.\nRating: 3",

While the model's answer captures the general idea of using the paddle board as a flotation device, it adds the phrase \"while swimming\", which is not present in the reference answer and implies that Speaker 2 knows how to swim, which is incorrect. \n\nRating: 3",

Speaker2's recollection is less detailed, but they agree that the situation is less severe now compared to then.",
            "judge_response": "Explanation: The reference answer is specific about the speakers' memories, stating that Speaker1 was in secondary school and Speaker2 was in primary school, with the latter being unsure of details.

            "model_prediction": "Speaker1 questions the need for additional practice because they believe that since the bike and their abilities were fine yesterday (same brakes, same value, same example), further practice wouldn't significantly change anything.
