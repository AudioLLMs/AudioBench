In contrast, the model's answer mentions two habits, talking in his sleep and not making his bed, and deduces that Patrick may be a light sleeper and a bit messy.

The model's answer, on the other hand, interprets the phrase literally, assuming the woman is talking about a toothache and having to wait for two hours, which is not implied in the original phrase.
