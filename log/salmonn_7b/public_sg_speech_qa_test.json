        "task_type": "SQA",
        "model_prediction": "Economics can help solve complex healthcare challenges by analyzing the costs and benefits of various healthcare interventions, identifying inefficiencies in the healthcare system, and developing evidence-based policies to improve healthcare outcomes. For example, economists can use cost-benefit analysis to determine whether a particular healthcare intervention is worth the investment, or whether there are more cost-effective ways to achieve the same healthcare outcomes. Additionally, economists can help identify barriers to healthcare access, such as high out-of-pocket costs or lack of insurance coverage, and develop policies to address these barriers. Overall, economics can provide valuable insights to help solve complex healthcare challenges."

Pharmaceutical companies could charge at least $3,000 for cancer drugs, regardless of the actual cost, as patients and insurers were required to pay that amount under the MediShield Life scheme.

By setting limits on insurance claims, insurance companies can also prevent patients from seeking unnecessary medical care that drives up overall healthcare costs.
