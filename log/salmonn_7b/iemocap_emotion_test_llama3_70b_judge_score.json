In contrast, the model's answer is more general, mentioning frustration and disappointment, but not explicitly mentioning sadness. While the model's answer is related to the speaker's emotional state, it doesn't exactly mirror the reference answer in terms of content and accuracy. I think the model's answer is close, but lacks precision.\n\nRating: 3",
