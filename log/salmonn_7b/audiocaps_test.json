Lightning is an electrical discharge that occurs when there is a difference in electrical potential between two points in the atmosphere. This difference in electrical potential can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a difference in temperature or humidity between two points in the atmosphere, or a difference in altitude between two points in the atmosphere. When lightning occurs, it creates an electromagnetic field that can be detected by instruments on the ground. The sound of thunder is caused by the electromagnetic field created by the lightning discharging in the atmosphere. The sound of thunder can be heard at a distance from the source of the lightning discharge, and it can"
