            "reference": "i am going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest 2000000000 live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops will not grow there will be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can not support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so the the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution and even in the 1900s we have seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that is why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things and so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let us say let us go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets emitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather and perhaps worse the indirect effects in that the natural ecosystems can not adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there is some uncertainty there but not very much and there is certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists on this several times do we really have to get down to near zero can not we just you know cut it in half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that is that is a big challenge it is very different than saying you know we are a twelve feet high truck trying to get under a ten feet bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over 26000000000 tons for each american it is about twenty tons for people in poor countries it is less than one ton it is an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it has been constantly going up it is only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you have got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that is going to be based on the number of people the services each person is using on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out per unit of energy so let us look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero now and that is back from high school algebra but let us let us take a look 1st we have got population now the world today has 6800000000 people that is headed up to about 9000000000 now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen but there we see an increase of about onethree the 2nd factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we eat clothing tv heating these are very good things and getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it is a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top 1000000000 we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and in fact these kids do not so they are going out and reading their school work under the street lamps now efficiency e the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that is not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety there are other services like how we make fertilizer or how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we are optimistic we may get a reduction of a a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of six but for these 1st three factors now we have gone from 26000000000 to at best maybe 13000000000 tons and that just will not cut it so let us look at this 4th factor this is going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out per each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas no almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we are going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i do not mean something that is impossible the microprocessor is a miracle the personal computer is a miracle the internet and its services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we do not have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually you just kind of stand by and some come along some do not this is a case where we actually have to drive it full speed and get a miracle in a a pretty tight time line now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people is imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos and somehow people enjoyed that it it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who live with mosquitos so with energy all i could come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fireflies i am told they do not bite in fact they might not even not even leave that jar now there is all sorts gimmicky solutions like that one but they do not really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there is many directions of people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers i have left out tide geothermal fusion biofuels those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we are going to have to work on each of these five and we can not give up any of them because they they look daunting because they all have significant challenges let us look 1st at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there seems like it might be simple but it is not and that is to take all the co two after you have burned it going out the flue pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and agreeing on where these co two quantities should be put will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who is going to be sure who is going to guarantee something that is literally 1000000000s of times larger than any type of waste you think of in in terms of nuclear or other things this is a lot of volume so that is a tough one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing could go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel does not get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste and although it is not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on the last three of the five i have grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually although it is great they do not require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you are talking about many square miles 1000s of time more area than than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are intermittent sources the sun does not shine all day it does not shine every day and likewise the wind does not blow all the time and so if you depend on these sources you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it is not available so we have got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy source is outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and to dimensionalize this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that is going to be a factor of a 100 better than the approaches we have now it is not it is not impossible but it is not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the the intermittent source to be above say twenty to thirty of what you are using if you are counting on it for a 100 you need a an incredible miracle battery now how we are going to go forward on this what is what is the right approach is it a manhattan project what is the the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this 100s in each of these five paths we need at least a 100 people and a lot of them you will look at and say they are crazy that is good and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies including one called esolar that has some great solar thermal technologies vinod khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i am i am trying to help back that nathan myhrvold and i actually are backing a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terrapower is that instead of burning a part of uranium the one which is the u 235 we decided let us burn the 99 the u 238 it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people had talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it is through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right material is approach this looks like it would work and because you are burning that 99 you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today is reactors so instead of worrying about them you just take that it is a great thing it breathes this uranium as it goes along so it is kind of like a candle you can see it is it is a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem i have got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over the 99 where they have taken out the part they burn now so it is called depleted uranium that would power the u s for 100s of years and simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process you would have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it has got lots lots of challenges ahead but it is an example of the many 100s and 100s of ideas that we need to move forward so let us think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let us go out to where we really need to get and and then look at the intermediate for 2050 you have heard many people talk about this eighty reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry cement so to get to that eighty the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation altogether so the other grade is are we deploying this zero emission technology have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we are in the process of of getting it elsewhere that is super important that is a key element of making that report card so backing up from there what should the 2020 report card look like well it again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that sum will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that do not get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed there is a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david mckay book sustainable energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this there is a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it is a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i could pick who is president i could pick a vaccine which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that is half the cost with no co two gets invented this is the wish i would pick this is the one with the greatest impact if we do not get this wish the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between u s and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lives of those 2000000000 will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go for more research funding when countries get together in places like copenhagen they should not just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you would be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives co two tax cap and trade something that gets that price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this dialog be a more rational more understandable dialog including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you thank you thank you thank you just so i understand more about about terrapower right i mean 1st of all what can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is to to actually do the software buy the supercomputer hire all the great scientists which we have done that is only 10s of 1000000s and even once we test our materials out in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you will only be up in the 100s of 1000000s the tough thing is building the pilot reactor finding the several 1000000000 finding the regulator the location that will actually build the 1st one of these once you get the 1st one built if it works as advertised then it is just clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know it and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium and then and then and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down that is right today you are always refueling the reactor so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing where you are opening it up and moving things in and out that is that is not good so if you have very very cheap fuel that you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and and then it is done it is a it is a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution yeah well what happens with the waste you can you can let it sit there there is a lot less waste under this approach then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that and and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today that is sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors that is our fuel to begin with so the thing that has been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours and you are reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you are going through this process but in your talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where where is there most interest in actually doing something with this well we have not picked a particular place and there is all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that is called nuclear so we we we have got a lot of interest that people from the company have been in russia india china i have been back seeing the secretary of energy here talking about how this fits into the the energy agenda so i am optimistic you know the french and japanese have done some work this is a a variant on something that has been done it is an important advance but it is like a fast reactor and a lot of countries have built them so anybody who is done a fast reactor is a candidate to to be where the 1st one gets built so in in your mind timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live well we need for one of these high scale electro electro generation things that is very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that is sort of the deadline that the environment models environmental models have have have shown us that we have to meet and you know terrapower if things go well which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that and there are fortunately now dozens of companies we need it to be 100s who likewise if their science goes well if the funding for their pilot pilot plants goes well that they they can compete for this and it is best if multiple succeed because then you could use a mix a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed in terms of big scale possible game changes is this the biggest that you are aware of out there an energy breakthrough is the the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental constraint but the environmental constraint just makes it so much so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators you know we do not know their work as well as we know this one but the modular people that is a different approach there is a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard but maybe they say that about us and so there there are different ones but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a 1000000 times as much energy as a molecule of say coal and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprint and cost the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is almost in a class of its own if this does not work then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable yeah if you get into that situation it is like if you have you have been over eating and you are about to have a heart attack you know then then then where do you go you may need heart surgery or something there is a line of research on what is called geoengineering which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together now you hope that is just an insurance policy you hope you do not need to do that some people say you should not even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy that you will keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you i am not sure that is wise given the importance of the problem but there is now the the geoengineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect climate skeptics if you had a a sentence or two to say to them how how might you persuade them that they are wrong well unfortunately the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who make scientific arguments are very few you know are they saying there is negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things there are very very few things that they can even say you know there is a chance in a 1000000 of those things the main problem we have here is kind of like aids you make the mistake now and you pay for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later and a somewhat uncertain pain thing in fact the ipcc report you know that that is not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say okay you know that that is not that big of a deal the fact is it is that uncertain part that should move us towards this but my dream here is that if you can make it economic and meet the co two constraints then the skeptics say okay i do not care that it does not put out co two i kind of wish it did put out co two but i guess i will accept it because it is cheaper than what is come before so is that would be your response to the the the bjorn lomborg argument that basically if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co two problem it is going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth it is it is it is a stupid waste of the earth is resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do yeah well the actual spending on the r and d piece you know say the u s should spend 10000000000 a year more than it is right now it is not that dramatic it should not take away from other things the thing you get into big money on and this reasonable people can disagree is when you have something that is non economic and you are trying to fund that that to me mostly is a waste unless you are very close and you are just funding the learning curve and it is going to get very cheap i believe we should try you know more things that have a potential to be far less expensive if the trade off you get into is let us make energy super super expensive then the rich can afford that i mean all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle the disaster is for that 2000000000 and even lomborg has changed his shtick now is why is not the r and d getting more discussed he he is still because of his earlier stuff further associated with the skeptic camp but he is realized that is that is a pretty lonely camp and so he is making the r and d and and so there is a a a thread of something that i i think is appropriate the r and d piece it is crazy how little it is funded well bill i suspect i i speak on the behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much thank you",

for a 100 you need a an incredible miracle battery now how are we going to go forward on this what is what is the right approach is it a manhattan project what is the the thing that can get us there

decided well let us burn the 99 the u 235 we decided well let us burn the 99 the u 235 we decided well let us burn the 99 the u 235 we decided well let us burn the 99 the u 235 we decided well let us burn the 99 the u 235 we decided 88 it is kind of a crazy idea and in fact people had talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it is through the advent of modern super computers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work and because you are burning at 99 you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the left over waste from today is reactors and so instead of worrying about them you just take that it is a great thing it breeds this uranium as it goes along so it is kind of like the candle you can see it is it is a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem i have got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over the 99 where they have taken out the part they burn now called depleted uranium that would power the us for 100s of years and simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process you would have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it has got lots lots of challenges ahead but it is an example of the many 100s and 100s of ideas that we need to move forward so let us think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like like well let us go out to where we really need to get and and then look at the intermediate for 2050 you have heard many people talk about this eighty reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry cement so to get to that eighty the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their electricity electricity generation all together so the other great is are we deploying this zero emission technology have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we are in the process of getting it out elsewhere that is super important that is a key element of making that report card so backing up from there what should the 2020 report card look like well it again should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that sum will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that do not get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of company manneys pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed there is a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david mckay book sustainable energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this there is a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it is a very concrete wish that if you gave me only eleven wish for the next fifty years i can pick who is president i can pick a vaccine which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that is half the cost with no c 02 gets invented this is the wish i would pick this is the one with the greatest impact if we do not get this wish the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between the u s and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lives of those 2000000000 will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go for more research funding when countries get together at places like copenhagen they should not just discuss the c 02 they should discuss this innovation agenda and you would be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives c 02 tax cap and trade something that gets that price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this dialog be a more rational more understandable dialog including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you thank you thank you thank you interested to understand more about about terra power right well to actually do this software what can give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is is well to actually do this software what can give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is is well to actually do this software what can give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is is well to actually do this software what can give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is is well to actually do this software what can give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is is well to actually do this software buy the supercomputer hire all the great scientists which we have done that is only 10s of 1000000s and even once we test our materials out in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you will only be up in 100s of 1000000s the tough thing is building the pilot reactor finding the several 1000000000 finding the regulator the location that will actually build the 1st one of these once you get the 1st one built if it works as advertised then it is just clear as day because the economics the energy density is so different than nuclear as we know it and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium and then and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down that is right today you are always refueling the reactor so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing where you are opening it up and moving things in and out that is not good very very cheap fuel then you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and and then it is done it is it is a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution well what happens with the waste you can you can let it sit there there is a lot less waste under this approach then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that and we start out actually by taking the waste that exists today that is sitting in these cooling pools or dry casting by reactors that is our fuel to begin with so the thing that has been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours and you are reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you are going through this process i mean you are talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where is their most interest in actually doing something with this well we have not picked a particular one yet but there is all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that is called nuclear so we have got a lot of interest that people from the company have been in russia india china i have been back seeing the secretary of energy here talking about how this fits into the energy agenda so i am optimistic you know the french and japanese have done some work this is a variant on something that has been done it is an important advance but it is like a fast reactor countries have built them so anybody who is not a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the 1st one gets built so in your mind time scale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live what we need for one of these high scale electric electrical generation things that is very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that is sort of the deadline that the environment models environmental modeling things that is very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that is sort of the deadline that the environment models environmental modeling things that is very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that is sort of the deadline that the environment models environmental modeling things that is very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that defense have have shown us that we have to meet and you know terror power if things go well which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that and there are fortunately now dozens of companies we need to be 100s who likewise if their science goes well if the funding for their plant pilot plans goes well that they they can compete for this and it is best if multiple succeed because then you can use a mix a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed scalable possible game changes this is the biggest that you are aware of out there an energy breakthrough is the the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental constraint but the environmental constraint just makes it so much so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators you know we do not know their work as well as we know this one but the modular people that is a different approach there is a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard but maybe they say that about us there are different ones but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a 1000000 times as much energy as a molecule of say coal and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprint and cost the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is in almost a class of its own if this does not work then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable yeah if you get into that situation it is like if you are you have been overeating and you are about to have a heart attack you know then then then where do you go you may need heart surgery or something there is a line of research on what is called geoengineering which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together now you hope that is just an insurance policy you hope you do not need to do that some people say you should not even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy that you will be lazy that you will be lazy that you will be lazy that you will be lazy that you will be lazy that you will be lazy that you will be lazy that you will will keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you i am not sure that is why given the importance of the problem but there is now that the geoengineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect climate skeptics if you had a sentence or two to say to them how might you well unfortunately the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who are you know the ones who are you know the ones who are you know the ones who are you know the ones who are you know the ones who are you know the ones who are you know the ones who are you know the ones who are you know the ones who are who make scientific arguments are very few you know are they saying that there is negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things there are very very few things that they can even say you know there is a chance and a 1000000 of those things the main problem you have here it is kind of like aids you make a mistake now and you pay for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later and as a somewhat uncertain painting in fact the ipcsc report you know that that is not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcsc and say zero you know that that is not that big a deal the fact is it is that that uncertain part that should move us towards this but my dream here is that if you can make it economic and meet the c 02 constraints then the skeptics say zero i do not care that it does not put out c 02 i kind of wish it did but i guess i will accept it because it is cheaper well that is right well it is come before so and that would be your response to the the the buenos aires argument that basically if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co two problem it is going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth it is it is a stupid waste of the earth is resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do yeah well the actual spending on the r and d piece say the us should spend 10000000000 a year more than it is right now it is not that dramatic it should be take away from other things the thing you get into big money on and this reasonable people can disagree is when you have something that is not economic and you are trying to fund that that to me is a waste unless you are very close and you are just funding the learning curve and it is going to get very cheap i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive if the tradeoff you get into is let us make energy super super expensive if the tradeoff you get into is let us make energy super super expensive then the rich can afford that i mean all of us here can afford that pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle the disaster is for that 2000000000 and even lomborg has changed his stick now is why is not the r and d getting more disgusted he is still because of his earlier stuff sort of associated with the skeptic camp but he is realized that is that is a pretty lonely camp and so he is making the r and d and and so there is a threat of something that i think is appropriate the r and d piece it is crazy how little we know well bill i suspect i speak on behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much thank you",
