health and the well being of our employees and customers has remained our utmost priority before giving you an update on the measures that we implemented in this regard let me begin a review by providing context this quarter has been quite challenging as we are the impact of the pandemic on the mexican economy on our business and of course on our results despite the impact let me assure you that our bank remains a strong and focused 1st our capital levels are solid and well above the minimum levels 2nd we have a clear study which we are executing to support our customers and minimize the impact on the pandemic on the finances and 3rd we expect to emerge from this difficult environment as a stronger institution business volumes closed the 2nd quarter with high single digit growth for we experienced an adverse shift in our portfolio mixed cohorts lower in segments consumer and loans started to contract in line with market trends where the commercial and loans were resilient and continued to raise their the measures implemented by bank of mexico and the cmpp how allow us to maintain levels of enabling us to for our customers support mechanisms to temporarily alleviate their cash flow and the financial distress caused by economic fallout of the pandemic although it is quality deteriorated slightly in the quarter we made preemptive loan contributions of 3900000000 pesos in addition to the normal quarterly provisions in preparation for our future losses we would revise this amount every in the future as more information becomes available on the performance of our loan for portfolio to in the coming quarters as we normally do we will provide a loan review of our business environment our convictions that mexico is very well positioned again according to economy impact of the covid nineteen pandemic in slide four we will present select economic indicators that show the magnitude of impact of the pandemic and starting economic activity and unemployment as you might recall 2020 growth expectations for the mexican economy were modest prior to the pandemic mainly due to weak profits we indicators showing a contraction of more than twenty during economic activity and 37 on year end year and dropping fix investment market expectation have been revised down to a line nine under decrease in gdp during 220 2000 and twenty for this will be an economic contraction not seen in many decades this significant fall in economic activity was resulted in the loss of more than 1000000 former jobs from the 2nd quarter according to social security data not as many as 20000000 jobs lost employment following the past year economic crisis back in 95 and 2000 and nine it took seven quarters for the mexican economy to recover its previous level of economic activity however in the current one you can see that it is unlikely that economy could recover in within a similar period of time given the depth and the magnitude of the global economic shock and the absence of any meaning meaningful fiscal problem to avoid distribute contraction in in its employment with external demand only and without any mechanism to rate households income loss and not an economy like mexico is long path to recover to previous activity levels with 2021 growth profits being forecasted at only three it could take three to four years to recover 2019 is levels of activity under these conditions inflation pressures should remain low we expect threesix for 2020 allowing bank of mexico to quote interest rates further we expect another 100 of through the year throughout the year which would take the reference rate around four by year end in summary in this scenario of low growth and low interest rates represents a challenging outlook for mexico is commercial and consumer environments and for our business if you turn to slide to slide five you will notice that despite a severe shock to economic activity and employment the system is loans and deposit values is to show a significant year over years expansion of eight and fourteen respectively this is mainly explained by large and medium size companies along with entities that have drawn on the credit lines to ignore continue operating during the months of which the stay at home guidelines have been in effect on the other hand consumer loans sold a relative contraction reflecting the in initial impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior and is starting to practice as seen and maintained by institutions it is worth noting that system demand deposits were made strong up eighteen in up eighteen year and year likely reflecting high needs for equality among households and companies for the stay at home guidance remaining in effect please turn to slide sixty we would like to give you an update on the bank operations during the past few months our health and business continue to continuing to protocols remain in place such as suspending non essential travel limiting the number of people are gathering and group events and enhanced sanititate sanit sanitization measures at branches corporate offices atms and contact centers essentially most corporate employees continue working from home while essential personnel are working on site approximately eighty of the bank branches are open and 92 of our atm locations are functioning normally the bank channels and contact centers have also been operating normally our transactions increase 64 year and year while our sales represented forty of total sales as it did last year as we continue promoting customer is use of channels which continues to drive adoption values further more active resources have been channeled into implementing additional remote operating tools with security being a priority during this critical time we have been supporting our customers through our active relief program offering deferred payments for individuals and and case by case to our corporate customers i will allow this program being in a moment as part of our commitment to our communities we have made numerous donations and supported initiatives that aid the medical community and vulnerable populations we also donated a map to the mexico city government which allows a population to self diagnose dates of symptoms locate medical facilities with capacity near them and obtain information on the pandemic on slide seven you will find a snapshot of our support program that i mentioned before currently nineteen of our loan portfolio is under the payment holiday program for individual and smes with more than 600000 customers benefiting from it through this program we are helping customers who have encountered programs by permitting them to escape loan payment both interest and principal for four months without any penalty or cost because of this this feature under the program it is difficult to assess at this time the extent of the pandemic is impact on our asset quality however we have been proactive in addressing asset quality over the past two months by contacting the customers to better understand their financial situation and by analyzing their ability to pay more than 55 of our branch network personal recoveries calling customers likewise the collections of commercial and departments portfolio by level of concern identifying risk and exposure according to customer quality through this more granular process we are each typ of client within 36 different cluster which have also been analyzing our customer behavioral patterns using our capabilities i know that more of 95 of our payroll customers continue to receive their salaries for those payroll customers who are not longer receiving their salary we are collecting for unemployment insurance with current information we estimate that close to forty of our customers should be able to continue honor in fully the condition of their loans seen it s since since it is for still unclear if the rest will be able to remain current we are are offering offering loan restructurings to many of them in order to speed up the recovery process it will not be until the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year that we will have sufficient hard data on the behavior of the portfolio with regard to our commercial book we are taking a case by case approach to manage our exposure as we have been doing the past critical periods we have remained very close to our customers and are helping them navigate this current challenging environment for those companies that face difficulties we have been offering multiple opportunities to support them our current portfolio of commercial restructure loans is close to 50000000000 pesos and accounts for sixteen of our loan portfolio with 1000000 of large sized corpa corporates in addition to actively managing our portfolio know that 76 of our payment holiday portfolio is associated with mortgages and smes which both have warranties within out total listing book 67 of the portfolio is backed up by warranties issued by part of mexico development banks which allow those to share the risk with them specifically for those that during the rivera program 75 of them have warranties furthermore payrolls and outer loans nine of portfolio are semi secured even percented by each customer salary and card please turn to slide eight for i would like to share with you some of the key characteristics of our remote support emergent portfolio which is giving us relative comfort to to its defensive nature our organic port eh m mortgage portfolio accounts for 86 of all our mortgages portfolio has a loan to value ratio of 44 has an ltb of seventy providing warranty coverage the mpl ratio of this portfolio is threesix and has been quite stable for some time for the past two years our mortgage has allow us to attract higher income customers which are more defensive in the current environment to respond to this point our average ticket has been increasing since our lunch since our launch of problem and is currently not only the highest among our peers but thirty 37 higher than the average of our peers in addition up close customers are loyal as they also have their payroll and their credit cards with us having a low loan to value ratios as well as being the main bank of our customers lowers the probability of nonpayment as this type of customer tends to prioritize their home mortgages in economic downturns considering the level of warranties we have the structure for our portfolio and the proactive measures we are taking we can see that we are on the right path to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and the quality of a loan portfolio on a slide nine let me comment on our dynamics and the we have seen during the past few months commercial loans continue to support therefore their contribution within local loan increase from 78 from the 2nd quarter of nineteen to 82 in the 2nd quarter in 2020 in commercial loans now represent 64 of our total loans these changes makes have had an impact on our nii as will be explained later in the call in terms of organization dynamics we have seen encouraging trends during the quarter that are worth noting here in the mortgage and commercial segments there is loan right relevance sequentially proven compared to may surpassing january is 2020 level in consumer loans june loan renigation remains 25 below the 1st quarter in twenty monthly average however it expanded 33 upon the 2020 minimum rates april as you can see on slide ten our capital positions are very strong at the end of june our common equity peer one cep one ratio is elevensix 58 basis points above march and as significantly in excess of the eighttwo minimum requirement established for the bank is during april shareholder is meeting to postpone the dividend payment for 2019 have allow us to further strength our capital position in terms of liquidity our 2nd quarter in 2020 liquidity to coverage ratio reached 211 well above the bank is the bank requirement and supported by senior notes we should back in april before turning the call over to i would like to finish my remarks by reiterating that we have been acting safely and decidedly to further strengthen our bank in order to mitigate the impact of the current crisis on our operations in addition to implementing proper protocols and measures to protect our employees and customers we have continued serving clients with high standards of customer service through our branches and the channels again we are confident that our bank is well positioned to support the customers as they recover from this unprecedented crisis now let me pass hold the call over to who will review the quarter is most important trends and metrics thank you thank you hector good day everybody please turn to slide eleven for an overview for recent loan performance total loans expanded seven year to year but contracting contracted three sequentially given strong corporate loan demand at the end of the 1st state quarter loan margin segments are growing twice as fast as high margin segments and current contracted nine and six year to year respectively due to economics eh to the economy is weak performance by contrast mortgage loans increased a solid nine year to year and expanded thirteen per percent when excluding the runoff effect of ge and ing portfolio which was well above market growth high margin segments have reduced their contribution to income by almost 100 basis points individual loans on slide twelve show a slow down growing four on a year to year basis mainly supported by mortgages as mentioned previously mortgages have proved to be the segment within the mexican market during the past periods of economic instability with this in mind we decided to lower even more the rate of our plus product to seven75 targeting loyal customers as of june close to sixty of our mortgage was coming from the plus which allows to increase cross selling of other products in july we launched a new product a new mortgage product called which is the 1st commission free mortgage product in mexico unique characteristics of this product are the customers do not have to pay an application fee monthly commission for a home appraisal nor are life and unemployment insurance required leaving only notary fees to be paid by the customer when incurring this product as you can see even during this challenging times we have not stopped innovating there continues to be a downward trending credit card loans as we take a more conservative approach toward this segment in addition to matching a customer is credit limits credit card usage declined thirty year over year during the quarter as many clients stayed at home this drop had a negative impact on balances of course after usage rates reach a very low level in april they recover in may and june of the remaining slide below 1st quarter levels our consumer loans have been concentrated in payroll loans growing twofive year to year and are still above the market for data as of the end of may personal loans continue to contract consistent with our strategy to focus on more defensive segments of the market as hector noted finally our other loan production in june more than doubled compared to previous quarter is average boosted by our new commercial alliance with nasdaq turning to slide thirteen closing our base of loyalty customers continues demonstrating important progress with year and year increases of almost seventeen and 31 respectively despite a challenging business environment loyalty penetration that is loyal to active customers to stands at 35 400 points higher than a year ago we have seen continuous growth in the use for digital channels as customers have stayed home during the pandemic this quarter product sales on digital channels accounted for 44 of the total almost doubling year ago levels digital monetary transactions also spiked reaching almost 13rd of the total while mobile transactions represented 93 of total deed of transactions versus 84 in 2019 while our customers also kept growing at a solid 38 year and year rate reaching 4300000 at the end of the quarter as you can see on slide fourteen commercial loans grew nine year and year but decrease sequentially as some corporates started prepaying some lines withdrawn in the 1st quarter of the year government and middle market segments continue to register double digits year and year expansion although their sequential evolution showed lower and stable volumes respectively loans register up towards sequential quarterly contraction and segment showed a weakening trend even for the pandemic outstanding loans are similar to the ones we had in the 4th quarter of 201710 quarters ago the downward trend is also related to our lower risk appetite for lending in segment given that more than fifty of our sme loan during the payment holiday program and those customers cannot use their credit lines while in the program loan origination in this segment will remain low until we have ore visibility on the performance of the economy moving on total deposits on the slide fifteen this increased ten year and year while quarter and quarter we saw a three contraction there was a shift between demand and time to process favor by lower interest rates as of the the 2nd quarter of this year demand deposits represented 64 of total deposits and were up eleven year and year deposit grows from individual stance eh turns out at 23 year and year supported by a promotion campaign to attract these types of deposits after an untypical 1st quarter of this year deposits from individuals continue to grow faster than corporate deposits in line with out strategy to further increase our expose to retail deposits retail deposit now represents thirty 33 of total deposits almost 400 basis points higher than its contribution in the 1st quarter of 2018 turning to slide sixteen we have a very strong capital and liquidity positions as hector has highlighted we maintain a sound funding position with a net loans to the of 91851 of the strongest levels since becoming a listed company our liquidity rates are increased 89 percentage points relative to the 1st quarter of this year and now spans a 211 well above the regulatory threshold of 100 we also remain very comfortable with our debt profile with manageable debt maturities regarding capitalization our ratio increased 46 basis points sequentially to sixteenseven reflecting the postponement of the dividend payments as recommended by the banking commission well our core tier one ratio was up 58 basis points to elevensix and and our tier one ratio stood at thirteen03 as you can see on a slide seventeen net interest income decreased four year on year and six quarter on quarter as a result net interest margin contract at 128 basis points to fourfive for the quarter our margin decline was a result of lower interest rates and lower balances within the high yielding segments coupled with higher average assets as a consequence of significant increase in our security is portfolio without this last effect eh our nim would have contracted only 54 basis points as hector explained earlier we are expecting net interest income to continue contracting dur during the remainder eh remainder of the year due to anticipated decreases in interest rates combined with a change in our portfolio mix where growth would likely come from low yielding segments and with unlikely contraction with high yielding segments however this downward pressure will be partially mitigated by our expanded investment and security portfolio please move on to slide eighteen net commissions and fees decreased two one year on year affected by the double digit decline in credit card transactions credit card usage decreased 42 in april 34 in may and fourteen in june on a year on year basis insurances register only a slight contraction given renewals of several groups insurance policies which partially compensated for software insurance demand insurance represents almost thirty of our total fees and have proven to be a defensive segment even considering the the the pandemic with health and life insurance growing while retail insurance is slightly decreasing our investment banking team have been very active mainly in financial advisory services which translated into strong fee growth of 31 in this line eh of our business which partially compensated for weaker results in other areas mainly credit card fees turning to slide nineteen gross operating income grew nine year on year driven by a solid performance in market related income which was significantly above our historical average levels of between 600 to 800000000 pesos per quarter the current interest rates the fx market volatility especially during a april and may supported market making income in addition we sold investment in securities in order to for the strengthening our liquidity position generating non recurring gains that boosted this quarter is result all this contributed for market related income that accounted for thirteeneight of gross of revenue threefive times higher than historical average of four moving on to provisions on slide twenty in light of the deterioration of mexico is economic environment and in anticipation of a possible deterioration of our loan portfolio both due to the pandemic in june we register a special charge of low loans provisions on top of those normally require the 3900000000 pesos charge raised total provisions to 8350000000 pesos in the quarter up 88 year on year and 62 sequentially we have made this estimate of preemptive provisions with information currently at hand however this amount could be revised in the future as more information becomes available cost of risk for the quarter stood at three one a 44 basis point year on year increase and 49 basis points sequentially our total npl ratio showed a slight 28 basis points year over year increase to twofive mainly due to the sme segment together with our mortgage and credit card portfolios as explained earlier these ratios only reflect the performance of 81 of our total portfolio that does not fall under the payment holiday program we consider this ratio encouraging as its evolution is quite benign when considering the significant deterioration in in economic activity and employment however it will not be until the 3rd and 4th quarter of this years of this year that the debtors pro program will end it will be at that time when npl ratios will reflect the real magnitude of the economic impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide 21 administrative and promotional expenses increase onetwo year on year reflecting the e the effort to control personal costs mainly reserves for viable compensation and amortization expenses related to the strategic and it investments that we made over the past thr three years as we will continue investing in the digitalization of the bank and in technology operates we are targeting grading operating efficiencies in the common quarters such as the ability to reduce the number of business trips viable compensation as well as limiting base salary increases among other improvements less business travel and salary caps would greatly led to a sequential onenine decrease in our total expenses during the 2nd quarter of this year such expense controls combined with strong operating income and the conclusion of our three year investment plan contributed to a 358 basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio which decreased to fortyseven on a six months eh basis the ratio improved 227 basis points year on year to 42three turning to profitability on the slide 22 you will note that our earnings were mainly impacted by special loaners provisions that we discussed earlier profit before taxes was down 24 year on year for the quarter and eleven for the 1st half of the year net income decreased 25 year on year to 4200000000 pesos while our effective tax rate increase 38 basis points year on year to 25three this resulted in an elevenfive decrease in net income for the 1st six months six months of 2020 which was 9600000000 pesos return on on equity was elevennine 543 basis points below the year ago level and down 362 basis points sequentially year to date roe contracted 328 basis points to thirteenfive let me now turn the call back to hector grisi for some final remarks hector please go ahead thank you didier okay please turn to slide 23 let me share with you some final thoughts on what lies ahead given the unprecedented nature of these health crisis and uncertainty surrounding this duration and magnitude we anticipate only a very gradual recovery of the economy which has obvious implications with regard to our operating environment we expect our loan portfolio will likely be driven by commercial loans mainly medium and large corporates government loans as well as mortgages the consumer board recover very gradually and this will depend on the speed of the rental turnaround in employment economic activity as well as business and consumer confidence although visibility and asset quality is limited due to the payment holiday program which have been talking and taking rapid and decisive action in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the loan book our recoveries plan which includes a very detailed and in deep analysis of each customer is situation is allowing us to preemptively and swiftly prepare the bank for complicated quarters ahead in particular we have allocated a large number of current employees and branches involved in carrying out the recovery strategy we will continue focusing on enhancing customer loyalty and on cross selling non credit products to support non interest income we also remain committed in to making additional investments in the bank transformation mainly in it and digitalization but we will continue to look for efficiencies in other lines with the strict cost control in order to support the bottom line and finally rest assured that our banks is operating from a position of strength with robust capital and high liquidity levels that will allow us to overcome this complicated but what we believe are temporary circumstances we are now ready to tackle questions please operator let us go ahead thank you if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press star one to ask a question please ask one question and a follow up if you have further questions please re enter the queue we will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions thank you our 1st question is from the line of jason mollin from scotiabank please go ahead hi thank you very much my question is on the operating outlook the disclosure is excellent it is it is always been i like the way you presented it on slide nineteen we we can look at the the main the main drivers for the operating income and clearly as you you talked about market related revenue was very strong well above historical levels about fourteen of the total operating income compared to let us say three or four in the past these are different times but how should we think about efficiency going forward you talked about cost control we saw that if you can just give us a general sense you you mention you there are certain costs your you can control and you are controlling can you talk a little bit about the physical infrastructure is there a an opportunity to rationalize physical branch network after the investments you you made what should we be looking for in terms of efficiency going forward the the dynamic is is quite skewed from all of these moving parts the very high trading and and the low the low revenues given what is going on thank you thank you look i mean i did not set i mean and if you take a look at our numbers basically we have decreased the operation cost of the bank quite significantly i mean 1st of all i mean not traveling and not doing many things basically have reduced naturally the cost but we have also been very strict in the in new projects and new situations i mean we are basically focusing all our expenses in it to support the backbone and to be ready for what is coming so in that sense that is one of your priority secondly we are taking a look and we are doing a deep dive in terms of all our infrastructure and we are not going to get take i mean wrong decisions in terms of closing down a big number of of branches or anything like that i think we are going to be rationally looking at each of the micro markets that we have divided the country into and we will decide with evolution of the economy what should happen there so but we are going to be very strict if you have seen the growth of the past four or five years in terms of branches we actually have decreased the number of total branches we have just we have been very intelligent in the way we have managed that what we have done is upgraded the current and the most important branches which we are going to basically be taking a little bit more time than the time that we were thinking of of upgrading all the branches that are not up to the standard so this is actually what we are doing we are going to basically rationalize all all all expending and do it on where the most important thing is that is basically the it platform and the digitalization of the bank so in that sense we are going to be very concentrated on that we also believe that i mean given that we have been able to operate the bank under these circumstances we have a huge amount of people basically working from home you basically get to understand just actually how really how much people do you need what can you rationalize et cetera so what you are going to see from us is that we are going to be very responsible in the way we manage that and concentrate on those points we are working currently on that plan we are working on our three year plan and and we are basically including all these inward solution maybe as a follow up just some comments on what you would seen throughout your peers and the santander group in in the region or elsewhere are there other things you think that could be applied to mexico that could help perhaps on the side of the banking system perhaps in terms operationally or it or or any factors at all thank you wh what we are doing basically is for example i mean in terms of developing these the platforms et cetera but we are doing it we are doing it now instead of each country basically developing the platforms we are doing it together so that basically is going to help out quite a lot so it is not mexico for example right now in mexico we are developing the new super app and the new super app is going to be used in the in in in in all the other countries you know for example the onboarding for smes we are using the one that is being developed at the in europe so all those type type of things are going to help us out basically in reducing our cost for the the infrastructure that we are developing and we are working together much more within the group in order to do that so you are going to see that i mean in the cost of basically developing things and it is going to come down due to the fact that we are doing it together with the rest of our sister banks so so so those t great thank you very much implementing at this ti at this point thank you i appreciate it you are welcome too the next question comes from the line of jorge kuri from morgan stanley please go ahead hi good morning everyone i i wondered what is about net interest margin you you you pointed out that you expect further complications in the next couple of quarters given falling grades and weak loan demands and mixed deterioration as as you look at 2021 in the context of what you said on n not a strong economic recovery next year and with average rates next year being m m much lower than 2020 if if indeed rates end up at four and w what is the expectation for the net interest margin next year and for nii i i is it possible that we are likely to see another year of nii compression and and to to what extent that can be offset elsewhere in the pml and and my 2nd question is on the on the coverage ratio and i and i know that banks you you know the the banks normally do not target a coverage ratio i get it but but evidently the the the size of your reserves have a relationship to the size of your logbook the size of your mpls and the size of the amount of loans that are on their restructuring and so when i look at your capex ratio at 100 138 it looks low relative to where banorte ended up at 201 and 185 so i i wonder you know why why w w why not just you know take a much bigger charge on provisions this quarter you know evidently there is there is there is a lot of uncertainty ahead and the more the better a and and so is this piecemeal just going to you know potentially put more pressure on your earnings going forward rather just you know take a really big one swoop and you know r raise your coverage to north of 200 and and is that likely maybe something you will do in the 3rd quarter thank you look jorge i will ask this is hector i will ask i will answer the 1st part and then i will ask didier to complete on the on the basic numbers of nii okay i mean 1st of all i mean if if you saw the presentation we are basically changing the mix of of the credit loan portfolio okay 1st of all i mean if you have seen i mean we have decreased quite a lot our exposure unfortunately to smes given the lack of warranties from the government from nafinsa okay so the portfolio has dropped almost ten so in that sense that basically is a high yield portfolio which is going to continue to shrink unless we we see some warranties from the government and you if you see our portfolio which is quite important we have like 62 of it already warranted by nafinsa okay the corresponding volume this basically goes to answer your 2nd part of the question in terms of the amount of the amount of reserves that we have done then you see that also we see that for example consumer credit and consumer loans are going to decrease as well so the mix is completely changing that we are going the i mean we are going basically back to where we were wh where we were five years ago when we had much more exposure to corporates and to medium sized companies than to consumer loans remember that we have that different mix okay so that is why nii is shrinking on the other side what we have also been doing it was with pricing and we are very s strict on pricing risk okay so we have been increasing the margin on the corporate loans quite significantly due to that fact you know that we are basically looking at the the risk that we are taking and we are looking very closely at the ratings of those companies and we are pricing risk accordingly okay this is not a situation in which we want to spend the port credit portfolio just to expand it we are basically doing it just to the companies that we believe that have a future and that will be there in the next few years and both we are pricing the risk accordingly so in that sense you are going to see us going towards that also the other concentration is mortgages which we which we believe i mean there is a sector still of growth i mean as you know there is a lack of a or or a big deficit in terms of homes in mexico so we believe there is still a part of the population that can afford a mortgage mortgages penetration in mexico was quite low versus the rest and also loan penetration is quite low so we believe there is a chance to to to continue to penetrate that sector and maybe on payrolls on some situations we will basically be also lending in that in the in that part i mean and auto loans also we have seen some interesting development there with very cautious approach to it so in that sense the mix of the portfolio is going to change and probably didier can let you know exactly how do we see nii evolving in terms of what you were asking in terms of the reserves we maybe we have actually been doing reserves accordingly wh to what we believe we are doing in terms of how the portfolio is is behaving at this point what i can tell you is that the portfolio not on payments holidays is behaving much much better than we believed that it was going to t that it was going to turn actually i am quite surprised about it hopefully it continues that way but in that sense we are basically being in my opinion being very responsible in the amount of of reserves that we are making at this point also we have done a tremendous job with the data hopes that we have in reviewing the portfolio on holidays and that portfolio is being divided as we said in 36 clusters okay these clusters have been divided upon ri upon the amount of risk that we have on each particular situation and in some of these portfolios even before the payment holiday ends we are already talking to clients and discussing the way that that we could get paid on those particular situations because what we believe is that whoever gets paid 1st is the one that is the one that is going to get paid so we are basically being very aggressive on that sense to talk to our clients and basically trying to get that and to recover the portfolio as you have seen 55 of our branches have been turned into collecting branches i mean to basically this we are dedicating our executives to collect we have divided them up in the sectors that we believe are the ones that are the ones that are going to be much more important in that or that are going to be hit the most in the economy so in that sense i believe we are very well prepared although i mean or nevertheless is always i mean a lot of uncertainty in what is happening and we did not want to go overboard and we believe it is the right the right approach is the one that we have made but we will continue to see over the next few months evolution what i can tell you is that we are going to be very conservative in the way we manage that okay didier i do not know if you want to complete absolutely eh absolutely hector i would like to to complement on what you mentioned eh eh great talking to you jorge long time no speak eh in terms of eh nims you know eh definitely you know as we laid out in the presentation we see significant pressures and let me just give you some background information that i think it is it is eh it is quite relevant the the speed at which interest rates have come down in mexico is is is is significant you know just in this quarter eh the average of the reference reference rate came down 123 basis points that is the the the fastest decline that eh we have seen eh in the recent history we we did not saw a a an increase of those eh you know of that magnitude when eh when interest rates were were coming up okay so that is one thing to have in mind the the the impact that you see in this quarter i think is is probably most that we are going to see in a relative basis relative to the 1st quarter of this year and relative to the 2nd quarter of last year okay also bear in mind that when interest rates were close to four as we probably agree with you that that is where we are headed you know are close to five you know and this was the 2nd and 3rd quarter of 2016 i think that eh the the number that that we reported the 448 in this quarter you know have to do with with what i was referring to you know the speed at which interest rates eh eh came down and also on top of that you have the the the change in mix on our loan side and also the fact that in order to protect the eh the income from eh interest rates coming down we we increased our pay interest securities portfolio significantly you know and those are you know lower margin eh assets relative to the the the loan portfolio just to you know share with you we have bought in this account you know both divestment and maturities the overall growth in our pay investment and securities portfolio is 96000000000 over the last twelve months so what we expect coming down the road you know pay for the rest of 2020 and eh for next year i think that you know having said that there is still a lot of uncertainty you know i think that probably the the most severe numbers in terms of name are the ones that we saw this quarter you know there is probably you know ten to fifteen basis points eh probably further adjustment or slight eh improvement for the rest of the year okay and next year i think that eh we will we will probably get to see names similar or slightly above to the ones that we were seeing eh eh in this quarter now in regarding to the current ratio you are totally right in the sense that we do not target that that is resulting number and also you know when you eh make reference to you know our number 138 looks low relative to the 1st quarter this year they had 140 in this in the 2nd quarter they did as we did also increase the provisions for different to us they made a significant charge off 4600000000 pesos so that is why you know they are their increased to 200 i am probably just elaborating elaborating eh the more on what information you know the letter of provisions that we have are in line with the expected losses that we we estimate you know you might have a or you might question whether we you know this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that you know under current circumstances we we have definitely done different types of sensitivity analysis or scenario analysis okay so if recovery in the mexican economy you know we have with these quarters eh provisions we are you know more than covered you know for the rest of the year now do we think that there is going to be a type recovery in the mexican economy i do not think so you know it is very you know low probability you know now we have a you know the the our leave of provisions according to other types of more a u type or an adverse scenario having agility contraction of twelvefive you know and under those circumstances these quarters provisions are not enough for the entire year there could be close to sixty to 75 depending on the magnitude of the eh contraction that that you assume okay eh eh so so there should be direct correlation between expected losses and provisions and the provisions that we are putting forward we think that with information that we have are quite strong to cover you know expected losses if the the the economy ends up contracting more than we are expecting right now definitely we will need to provide a provision of provisions something that i i encourage you to look at if you have not done so eh yet you know the the bank they released in the stability financial stability report published a few weeks ago an analysis regarding npl for the entire system and they what they did is look at information from the entire banking system from the last twenty years and they pay you know using an econometric model they they estimated you know where are the critical variables that determine npls and they break down the the the portfolio in consumer loans in mortgage loans and in corporates so once they determine you know these econometric model then they provided a you know a shock with the variables that we are seeing lately and they estimated how much npl ratios rate for the entire banking system for consumer loans that would imply a 32 increase for mortgages nineteen and for corporates also 32 so when you do that math and you break down you know by types of loans by type of bank you get to see you know this is obviously a ballpark estimate because obviously every single bank has different practices in origination practices and recoveries and so on but you can get a sense of the magnitude in terms of using this model you know how much you you will expect at each bank with with provision okay thank you thank hector for the detailed responses we will take the next question it comes from the line of ernesto from bank of america please go ahead hi good morning hector thanks for the opportunity my 1st question is a follow up on the preventive provisions of 349 pesos so you think this level of provisions will be enough for the rest of the year or are you going to evaluate to create more depending on the behavior of payments up to the relief program and then my 2nd question is a different one because we would like to know if you have exposure to either mexico on the chapter eleven or that has restructured loans with the banks for about a year but i understand that you can not disclose your exposure so maybe if you can remind us how much of your loan book is exposed to airlines and how much to food and beverage and if there is a sector that is concerning you and finally my my last question is competition in mortgage loans we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates of mortgages in light of the lower rates so how has been your strategy to attract more more mortgage clients and how competitive is your interest rate thank you thank you ernesto let me let me start and then maybe i will complement 1st of all on the of provision like i have spoken many times to my cro and he basically tells me that when i ask you and ask him the same question that you are asking me at this and he says look i do not have my crystal ball so clear and it is quite impossible not impossible but it is difficult to assess what we are doing i mean what i can tell you is that we are doing our best job in in basically reviewing the portfolio we do like that we see the rate that we review the the behavior and we are basically trying to be as conservative as we can in order to manage it so and if we see that the portfolio continues to deteriorate it is much more complicated we are going to find out i mean the payment shock comes in the 1st week of august we are preparing for next week actually when the 1st loans that went into the holiday start to to mature and we we see that we see how the performance of the portfolio is and then we will take you are going to see our numbers right as i mean we are going to take the provisions as soon as they come if needed okay and the 2nd point in mexico yes and and we do have exposure to them nothing that we cannot control or nothing too big for the size of the bank i mean our top exposure to airlines is not big i mean compared to the top of the heights of the portfolio i would say eh probably it is not big it is not very significant versus the size of the bank and we have loans or provisions already on some to mexico so we can tell you that in in the provisions that we make some of them are made to for the exposure which is not relevant in terms of yes we do have exposure to them also not i mean not significant and we are basically in those structure and process as of now and we see that the company can recover fairly i mean i do not see that in that particular situation unfortunately in front of me and we can back to you on that one in terms of the competition of mortgage loans it is quite important what we do we cannot important differentiation in terms of how we do mortgages versus our competition if you take a look at what fees it is a completely different prototype nobody has replicated in the mexican market i mean some of the other banks basically have tried to do what we are doing the best rate available in the market but in order to get the rate rate available in the market which is seven points 75 for a fifteen year mortgage you have to basically turn into turn 1st into your most important bank to your number bank number one bank but in order to be able to get that rate you have to have different products with us that basically you have to have your payroll you have to direct maybe you you you have to have your insurance you have to something that you have to do in order to access the rate in that regard what happens is even if the loan is at seven75 and we are also very cautious in the loan value that we are doing that that loan that is why precisely i was explaining in the presentation that that is why our for mortgage is 37 larger than the rest so we go directly to the mort to the wealthy people okay to the people that are in the best situation right now so we believe that our portfolio is more resilient in this particular situations and also that we get the best client because those are the ones that basically can achieve this rate and can achieve these and have these characteristics to act in this type of role so that is why the the the portfolio we believe is going to behave well and is going to be managed or is going be behave in a nice in a nice way due to that fact okay and we have seen the way the portfolio has performed and we see that the performance is according to our expectations given the very complicated circumstances okay so in that regard i mean there is competition i mean there are some banks i mean a couple of banks have tried to come in and and basically compete with us head to head in this type of situations and they have not been able to have the same type of problems that we send to the market then we came out with another prototype the basically has a particular and has everything included in the rate you do not have any fees any commissions you do not have to pay for any ancillary costs or anything like that so that particular thing is for people that i mean that they believe that we have a lot of things under the table and that we are not completely clear it is completely transparent to the client and that is above nine as a rate and and that is for a difficult different type of client so we have a chinese menu for every different type of what we do and and for example for a different sector that is mutual that is basically clients with lower ticket and well there are some of these clients are very good and have very good credit quality and that is what we decided to compete in that sector i do not know if these answer your question or not please be a complement sure hector eh regarding your 1st 1st question ernesto it was as previously mentioned uniting on the you know how severe is the contraction this year you know and how that impacts the capacity for clients to to pay back their loans we think that eventually if there is you know a u type recovery and gdp contracting somewhere around ten twelve then we have made with the provisions of this quarter more than half of what we require and that could be you know sixty 75 of what we require you know with information that we have right now okay but it is going to be dependent on how this evolves and obviously we are closely monitoring eh you know how our clients are are behaving okay now on your 2nd question regarding the exposure that you have to mexican eh your obviously for reasons we cannot disclose those but we can eh reassure you that these two exposures that we have are not within our top ten exposures eh to mention we have already provisions partially exposure with mexico that is close to 45 of the exposure that we have that is not material okay and i do not have with me the breakdown in terms of food and beverage the breakdown that i have right now it is more the one that is used more for regulatory purposes and do not have that detail but eh for sure we can follow up with that this is super helpful thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from brian from citibank please go ahead everyone thank you for the opportunity to ask question before my question i wanted to make a that capability do so what was the percentage sorry i think that is forty right forty thank you and and now for my question you know quality and you mentioned portfolio has a large degree of my question is could you and the what are you expecting in terms of npl for thank you if you like i can take that hector the you know credit cards do not have collateral you know so so laws given defaults in in credit cards is eh close to 100 you know you you basically do not eh eh recover that much in terms of eh eh credit cards you know and you know we think that that is that is going to be one of the eh eh products eh most impacted you know when you look at you know the different types of loans that clients have you know we think that eh mortgages are the ones that you eh eh you do not pay you continue paying you know if there is just one loan that you continue paying that is that is mortgages and probably credit cards are eh you know at the bottom of eh your pay priorities you know when you have eh eh trouble the npls that that we see in in credit cards have been increasingly likely but i think is you know probably stable when you compare it historically so we do not expect you know a significant eh deterioration eh you know cost of risk by way of eh eh the provisions that eh we are taking it is close to eleven so i do not know hector if you would like to if perchance you would like to to further complement on this this is the operator mister chavez line has gone idle i will try to reconnect him at this time would we like to take the next question eh sure the next question comes from tito labarta from goldman sachs hi good morning thank you for the call and taking the questions one question on the the market related income i know you talked you know the big spike in the quarter but do do you think that goes back to normal already in the 3rd quarter or do you think that can remain elevated elevated for some period of time just to get i know it is hard to predict but market related income going forward and if i can ask just one follow up on on the provision you know i understand given this you kind of feel comfortable with where you are but you know if you look at the cost of risk before this quarter had been around twosix twoseven you know barring any changes in the scenario that you see right now is that twosix twoseven what we should expect sort of going forward as well again barring any significant changes in in the current scenario okay thank you i mean what i can tell you is yes we have had a good running in terms of market related income i think that that the banks position to lose hope the the important point is and in it continues to be the way that it is then you can expect that we can that we can basically have good numbers there i do not think that we are going to have in the in the in the 3rd quarter numbers as good as they were in the in the in this quarter both i mean it also depends on what is happening in in the next few days in the next few months in terms of the provisions and the cost of risk you want to comment on that absolutely eh you know i think that eh once you take out the provisions that we did this quarter i think that cost of risk should be slightly higher than the numbers that eh we were having over the last say five quarters eh but not to levels that we have reported this quarter so some require eh eh 300 pesos point that that would be my my eh my take and obviously as you mentioned you know with information that we currently have okay okay thank you i will take the next question it comes from the line of carlos gomez from hsbc please go ahead hello good morning i have a question about credit risk but not to your corporate but to the virtual financial system we already saw one company got has liquidated has been put in liquidation but eh by the national banking commission crisis being unable to operate so eventually one would imagine might get into trouble are you taking special precautions in regard to any sectors of the financial system and do do you think we you will encounter much trouble or most of them will be able to go through this okay thank you thank you carlos i mean i mean in all these particular situations and depend how long the crisis is going to take i mean it is probably going to take down some financial players i mean that since we are yes we are being very cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what their position is and their situation and we are going to basically continue to monitor that as the crisis continues to to to evolve so in that sense we are very close in to that particular sector we do not have i mean we are not a big lender to the sector i mean i can tell you that if you they are not in the ten most important clients they are not financial players so in that sense we are not worried about the that we have out to them but we are very concern taking a look and monitoring them all the time okay hopefully the crisis is shorter and nobody else goes down but we will see what happens any particular that using money special monitoring you know market related or consumer related or payroll i think microfinance is a sector that we need to be very close monitoring we do not have to we do not have to s a lot big to them but that is a sector that covering would be complicated as always in these type of situations the people that suffer the most are the ones that are on the are on the base of the pyramid so unfortunately that is the case and we are monitoring that quite closely thank you so much take the next question it comes from from please go ahead good morning thank you for taking my question my question is regarding liquidity i mean your liquidity improved nicely in the quarter in part it was all be to the $1800000000 that issuance but also given a very strong increase in funding with banks in this quarter so could you please provide some to the nature of this funding source and what would be your strategy for liquidity in the coming quarters thank you very much eh hi alonzo you know there are p several factors regarding liquidity pay pay i think that the the most relevant is our you know how we fund a a you know the let us say the loan to the that as mentioned was one of the strongest numbers that we have reported since we became a listed company close to 92 so that is that is in my opinion that is the most and fundamental way of looking at it then as you rightly mentioned the the debt issuance is you know contributed significantly to the increase of our liquidity coverage ratio and we are monitoring you know any p p potential use of the committed lines of credit that we have with our clients that if you look at it it is probably the one let us say risk that could materialize in in in the short term we have ample of liquidity to honor or pay you know every single committed line of credit that that we have but that that is the one the most relevant driver in terms of consumption of liquidity the other types of you know events that could impact our liquidity you know are you know are more gradual you know and those could be you know a contraction in deposits that we are not seeing that and i think that the bank has managed quite practically you know per liquidity to be prepared for you know any potential p p you know really worst case scenario further down the the road thank you and regarding the line of your balance sheet the line of bank and other loans which increased 81 in quarter one quarter do you do you do you think these line would will remain as close to those levels or do you think you could substitute these source of funding with probably other debt issuances in coming quarters what your strategy there you know we we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the the specific you know ten year cost you know we end up you know we drawing or take advantage of the the different funding sources so you know i would say that not only that particular line item but every single line item is is is reviewed you know and under current market circumstances we you know it is it is our p obligation to look at better ways of you know not only funding the bank but you know keeping structures in place so that the bank you know can continue supporting you know long growth so that is something that we continuously monitor alonzo so so yes you know it could be that we keep it at those levels or that we reduce it if there is an opportunity to find you know a a more effective funding source thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from yuri fernandes from j p morgan please go ahead thank you i have a question regarding the on npl ratio it was not quarter over quarter and i understood that some peers they had higher tier jobs and that may explain a little bit of difference but given how the players where the was not as high we kind of saw more flattish behavior because of the special accounting because of the so what drove the iterations quarter for for you and my 2nd qua question is regarding a special accounting criteria when we look to those numbers the the balance of natl they are much higher than than they once the old accounting versus the current special accounting and i would like some kind of difference here like a very negative outlook would be to see you know like those numbers materializing as losses so if you can explain for me the differences on the special accounting versus the old accounting and if the balance of natls there may may become losses i would appreciate thank you hi yuri in terms of the npl ratio you know this this quarter what drove this likely deterioration was basically a credit card that went up from fourfourteen to four82 and the and it is a miss basically going from two61 to three37 as as we discuss during the quarter during the call you know the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not enrolled in the in the support programs so but we are seeing you know this slight deterioration has to do more with what is happening with the the portfolio of the clients that did not did not enroll in the program and it is not a significant deterioration in our view given you know the the you know what is going on in the economy it was just a you know a slight deterioration now on your 2nd question could you elaborate on that you know i i do not i do not know exactly what you are comparing you know the special accounting criteria to the other accounting criteria so the previous accounting before the new regulation for for covid you have like a table on your release comparing the special accounting criteria versus the former i think like d six accounting criteria and when we look to the balance of non performing loans i believe the balance you have to date something like 18000000000 pes 19000000000 pesos that im that implies the twofive internal ratio but if you look to the old accounting criteria the the d six accounting i think the balance of npls they are closer to forty 44000000000 pesos so the npl ratio they would be much higher i understand that maybe a lot of loans that will not really become an npl that they are there but my concern is that as soon as these accounting criteria go go goes back to normal if we could see you know like a a a a higher need of provisions working on npls so that is why i ask the difference and if it if and if it makes sense you know to to expect them worsening on that you know i think that that you know it it is thoroughly dependent on the level of or or the type of assumptions that we make because the the system that accounting criteria is very stringent in terms of a a let us say a and percentage of you know how much you you the client have paid back so i think that it is it is a in my opinion it is it is somehow extreme comparison okay so it it has to do with you know with the special accounting criteria you basically allow clients not to pay you know or every client that is not paying their interest and capital stays current you know and under the old or the prevailing accounting criteria you know you have to take into account just the you know when you are ninety days past due and depending on if you are you know let us say corporate client you know depending on how much you have already paid back whether you are twenty or more or how you know the time that has elapsed you know it it it is very i would say the precaut i would say that the presumptions are critical and i think that probably what it is what is important is to understand that in the following two quarters we will get to know the the hard data you know we you know rather than you know comparing those numbers with big assumptions i think that as soon as clients start paying back or not we will get to know you know how you know the magnitude of the impact okay rather than just making you know some assumptions that you know could materialize or not as mentioned during the call i think that we have make we have made a good assessment in terms of the risk that each client has you know the relationship that we have with them and we have also asked them you know you know how they are doing and whether they have the capacity to pay back so taking all that into account that is how we we come up with this provisions associated with expected losses that we assume so i would encourage you yuri just to wait a couple of quarters and with with the hard data you know just analyze you know if we on one hand the benefit of these temporary measures that the banking commission provided and on the other hand you know the the the true impact that it has had you know no no spectacular thank you thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from nicolas riva from bank of america yes thank you very much for taking my question i have eleven question i apologize if you already mentioned it so you mentioned that nineteen of the of the loan portfolio has been subject to some kind of relief measure have these measures ended already for any clients and if so if you can tell us what percentage of these clients that have resumed payments already since it has been already about four months since the full outbreak of the pandemic and and if this has not been the case if the payment holiday has not ended for for any significant amount of clients if you can tell us when you make these these provision charts the 3900000000 pesos in this quarter did you incorporate any assumptions in terms of what will be the percentage of these nineteen of these clients under the debt relief program that will pay you back once the payment holidays end thank you you know 1st the payment holidays payment holiday period ends tomorrow so we will start the the you know seeing whether clients pay back or not starting next week so we do not have that information yet you know now regarding you know how we made provisions for for this quarter you know and as mentioned throughout the call you know we classified the clients depending on the risk that they have the exposure that they have with us the relationship that we have they have with us so we we classified the you know retail clients in 25 clusters and in eleven clusters so depending on the level of of cluster that each client falls in you know there is either a high risk or high exposure you know for clients and we assume certain probability of those clusters either paying back their loans or not okay so that is how we came up with with the with the provisions that we we we made this quarter so yes there is but it depends you know there are 36 responses in terms of you know whether b we expect a high number or number of clients to pay back their loans it is it is it you know it is it is because of these analysis that we have done that we feel relatively confident that with the information that we have what we have provided is is is good is a good provision for deterioration for the rest of the year okay thank you very much the next question comes from from ubs please go ahead okay thank you very much for taking my question it is just one i just wanted to understand the dynamic of the credit relief program held by the bank and on npls twofive and according to my calculation if their loans reach at almost fifteen of total loans if i am not wrong roughly a similar level to the other banks but different from other players and even considering the brazilians the chileans they have a npls decreased in the 2nd q you mentioned that this deterioration is coming from the sme and the credit card so i just wanted to understand if this high npls behaved worse than expected by the banks considering the amount of loans that were postponed and what does the bank sees for this semester in terms of fostering the credit relief program in case of regulators extend and change the rules for it so thank you very much i think that you know the 1st of all you know the npls that increased that we see in the 2nd quarter are also seeded with those clients that do not enter into the relief program okay so you have to do with that 81 of clients that decided not to enter into into the program and obviously those clients are also exposed to the the deterioration of economic activity you know hector mentioned you know the the the losses that you know the employee losses that we have seen so it is it has to do more with that okay with the let us say with the clients that do not enroll in the program okay whether we were expecting you know that type of deterioration you know i think that if someone tells you that they were envisioning this type of economic deterioration i think that they are lying you know i think that we have we were not expecting this type of contraction you know the magnitude that we are seeing you know if you look at how every single analyst updates his forecast for the mexican economy every week you get to see the downward adjustments so so i think that it do not surprises us you know we mentioned that given this this deterioration of economic activity we think it is just a slight deterioration okay the but as mentioned we will get to see the final impact or the final numbers probably in the next two to three quarters you know it is not only what happens the rest of the year i think that this the impact of the pandemic at least for mexico has a possibility of you know going further than just 2020 so so we will get to see that okay i think it is it is a quite early to to have a definitive view on a complete impact on on other quality okay okay thank you very much the last question comes from from btt please go ahead hi everyone my questions were already answered thank you very much there are no further questions in the queue and i would now like to turn the floor back over to mister hector chavez for any closing remarks thank you operator and thanks everyone once again for joining santander mexico on this call as

afternoon to those in europe thank you for joining our annual call today i hope you and your families are healthy and safe as we discuss our last quarter mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the health and the well being of our employees and customers has remained our utmost priority before giving you an update on the measures we implemented in this regard let me begin a review by providing context this past quarter has been quite challenging as we started seeing the impact of the pandemic on the mexican economy on our business and of course on our results despite the impact let me assure you that our rank remains strong and focused 1st our capital and liquidity levels are solid and well above the minimum regulatory levels 2nd we have a clear strategy which we are executing to support our customers and minimize the impact of the pandemic on the finances and 3rd we expect to emerge from this difficult environment as a stronger institution business volumes closed the 2nd quarter with high single digit year on year growth while we experienced an adverse shift in our portfolio mix towards lower yielding segments consumer and sme loans started to contract in line with market trends while the commercial and mortgage loans were resilient and continued to register spurts the timely measures implemented by banco de mexico and the cnbv have allowed us to maintain ample levels of liquidity and capital enabling us to offer our customers support mechanisms to temporarily alleviate their cash flow and the financial stress caused by the economic fallout of the pandemic although asset quality deteriorated slightly in the quarter we made preemptive loan loss provisions of 3900000000 pesos in addition to the normal quarterly provisions in preparation for our future losses we would revise this amount in the future as more information becomes available on the performance of our loan portfolio during the coming quarters as we normally do we will provide an overview of our business environment but let me emphasize again our conviction that guatemala where mexico is very well positioned against the current and still growing economy impact of the covid nineteen pandemic in slide four we present select economic indicators that show the magnitude of the impact in the pandemic is having on economic activity in having on economic activity and employment as you may recall 2020 gdp growth expectations for the mexican economy were modest prior to the pandemic mainly due to weak private investment prospects with equitable and impartial indicators showing a contraction of more than twenty year on year in economic activity and 37 year on year in drop in fixed investment market consensus expectations have been revised down to around nine annual decrease in gdp during 222020 for additional context this would be an economic contraction not seen in many decades activities resulted in the loss of more than 1000000 formal jobs during the 2nd quarter according to social security data but as many as 20000000 jobs were lost taking into account informal employment following the past two severe economic crises back in 95 and 2009 it took seven quarters for the mexican economy to recover its previous level of economic activity however in the current one we consider it is unlikely that economy could recover within a similar period of time given the depth and magnitude of a global economic shock and the absence of any meaningful fiscal program to address the severe contraction in its employment with external demand rounding only gradually and without any mechanism to alleviate households income loss an open economy like mexico faces a slow path to recovery from previous to previous activity levels with 2021 growth prospects being forecasted at only +three it could take three to four years to recover 2019 levels of activity under these conditions inflation pressures should remain low we expect threesix for 2020 allowing banco de mexico to cut interest rates a little further we expect another 100 basis points of cuts through the year through the year which would take the reference rate to around four a year in summary this scenario of low growth and low interest rates represents a challenging outlook for mexico is commercial and consumer environments and for our business if you turn to slide five you will notice that despite the severe shock to economic activity and employment the system is loans and deposit volumes still show a significant year over year expansion of eight and fourteen respectively this is as may be explained by large and medium sized companies and government entities that have drawn on the credit lines to maintain the liquidity of their balance sheets in order to continue operating during the months of which the stay at home guidelines have been in effect on the other hand consumer loans showed a relevant contraction reflecting the initial impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior and of product origination practices being maintained by financial institutions it is worth noting that system wide demand deposits remain strong up eighteen eighteen year on year likely reflecting heightened needs for liquidity among households and companies collateral at home guidelines remain in effect please turn to slide six or we would like to give you an update on the bank operations during the past few months our health and business continuity protocols remain in effect such as suspending non essential travel limiting the number of people at gatherings and group events and enhancing sanitation measures at branches corporate offices atms and contact centers as of today most corporate employees continue working from home while only essential personnel are working on site approximately eighty of the bank branches are open and 92 of our atm locations are open functioning normally the bank is digital channels and contact centers have also been operating normally our digital monetary transactions increased 64 year on year while our digital sales represented 44 of total sales close as much as they did last year as we continue promoting customer is use of digital channels which continue to drive adoption levels further more more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore more intelligent resources we most operate in tools with server security being a priority during this critical time we have been supporting our customers through a debt relief program offering deferred payments for individuals and sme is and case by case debt restructuring to our corporate customers i will elaborate on this program in a moment as part of our commitment to our communities we have made numerous donations and supported initiatives that aid the medical community and vulnerable populations we also donated an app to the mexico city government which allows the population to self diagnose based on symptoms locate medical facilities within their capacity near them and obtain information on the pandemic on slide seven you will find an overview of our debt support program that i mentioned before currently ninety of our total loan portfolio is under the payroll holiday program for individual and small and medium sized enterprises 600000 customers benefiting from it through this program we are helping customers who have encountered liquidity programs by permitting them to skip long payment both interest and principal for four months without any penalty or cost because of this feature under the program it is difficult to assess at this time the extent of the pandemic is impact on our asset quality however we have been proactive in addressing asset quality quality over the past few months by contacting our customers to better understand their financial situation and by analyzing their ability to pay more than 55 of our branch network personnel is focused on recoveries calling customers directly likewise the collections and commercial and wealth departments segmented the portfolio by level of concern identifying risk and exposure according to customer quality through this more granular process we are smart calling each type of client within 36 different clusters we have also been analyzing our customer behavior patterns using our crm capabilities and know that more than 95 of our payroll customers continue to receive their salaries for those payroll customers who are not longer receiving their salary we are collecting for unemployment insurance with current information we estimate that close to forty our custodians should be able to continue honoring fully the conditions of all their loans the need is simple since it is still unclear if the rest will be able to remain current we are offering upfront loan restructurings to many of them in order to speed up the recovery process it will not be until the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year that we will have sufficient hard data on the behavior of the portfolio with regard to our commercial book we are taking a conservative approach a case by case approach to manage our exposure as we did during the past critical periods we have remained very close to our customers and are helping them navigate this current challenging environment for those companies that face difficulties we have been offering multiple alternatives to support them our current portfolio of commercial structured loans is close to 50000000000 pesos and accounts for sixteen of our loan portfolio with medium and large size corporates in addition to actively managing our portfolio know that 76 of our payment holiday portfolio is associated with mortgages and esms which both have warrants within our total esm book 67 of the portfolio is backed up by warrants issued by nafin one of mexico is development banks which allows us to share the risk with them specifically for those esms arising in the refferal program 75 of the portfolio is backed up by warrants issued by nafin one of mexico is development banks which allows us to share the risk with them specifically for those esms arising in the refferal program 75 of the portfolio is backed up by warrants issued by nafin one of mexico is development banks of them have warrants furthermore payrolls and auto loans nine of the deferred portfolio are semi secured given the collateral represented by each customer is salary and car please turn to slide eight for i would like to share with you some of the key characteristics of our mortgage portfolio which is giving us relative comfort due to its defensive nature our organic mortgage portfolio accounts for 86 percentage of all our mortgages the existing portfolio has a long to value ratio of 44 while originations has an ltv of seventy providing very good warranty coverage the npl ratio of this portfolio is threesix and has been quite stable for some time for the past two years our hypotheekbank nv mortgage has allowed us to attract higher income customers which are more defensive current environment to expound on this point our average ticket has been increasing since our launch since we launched our product and is currently not only the highest among our peers but serves 37 higher than the average ticket of our peers in addition ipoheta plus customers are loyal as they also have their perks and their credit cards with us having a low loan to value ratio as well as being the main bank of our customer lowers the price the probability of non payment at this type of customer tends to prioritize the home mortgages in economic downturns all in all considering the level of warrants we have the structure of our portfolio and the proactive measures we are taking we consider we are on the right path to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the quality of the loan portfolio on slide nine let me comment on origination dynamics and the mix we have seen so far in the past few months commercial loans continue to support total loan growth therefore their contribution within local loan origination increased from 78 in the 2nd quarter of nineteen to 82 in the 2nd quarter in 2020 behind these commercial loans now represent 64 of our total loans this changing mix has had an impact on our n a i as will be explained later in the call in terms of origination dynamics we have seen encouraging trends during the quarter that i will note here in the mortgage and commercial segments june is loan origination registered relevant sequential improvements compared to may surpassing january is 22 year low in consumer loans june loan origination remains 25 below the 1st quarter in 2020 monthly average however it is under 33 percent above the 2020 minimum which left april as you can see on the slide our capital and liquidity positions are very strong at the end of june our common equity tier one c p i one ratio stood at elevensix 58 basis points above march and was significantly in excess of the eighttwo minimum requirement established for the banks of our size the decision taken during april is shareholders meeting to postpone the dividend payment for 2019 has allowed us to further strengthen our capital position in terms of liquidity our 2nd quarter in 2020 liquidity coverage ratio reached 211 well above the bank of mexico is regulatory requirement and supported by the senior notes we issued back in april before turning the call over to lydia i would like to finish my remarks by stating that we have been active safe and decisive in further strengthening our bank in order to mitigate the impact of the current crisis on our operations in addition to implementing proper protocols and measures to protect our employees and customers we have continued serving clients with high standards of customer service through our branches and digital channels again we are confident that our bank is well positioned to support our customers as they recover from this unprecedented crisis let me pass hold the call over to dhirendra who will review the part is most important trends and metrics thank you thank you ektor good day everybody please turn to slide eleven for an overview of our recent loan performance total loans expanded seven year over year but contracting contracted three sequentially given strong corporate loan demand at the end of the 1st quarter low margin segments are growing twice as fast as high margin segments where sme is and credit cards contracted nine and six year in year respectively due to the economics to the economy is weak performance by contrast mortgage loans increased a solid nine year in year and expanded thirteen when excluding the runoff effect of g e and n i g portfolios which was well above market growth high margin segments have reduced their contribution to net interest income by almost a 100 basis points individual loans on the slide twelve slow down growing four on a year on year basis mainly supported by mortgages as mentioned previously mortgages have proved to be a defensive segment within the mexican market during the past periods of economic instability with this in mind we decided to lower even more the rate of our ipotecaplus product to seven75 targeting loyal customers as of june close to sixty of our mortgage origination was coming from ipotecaplus which allows us to increase cross selling of other products products in july we launched a new product a new mortgage product called hipoteca libre which is the 1st commission free mortgage product in mexico unique characteristics of this product are the customers do not have to pay an application fee monthly commission or a home appraisal nor are life and unemployment insurance required leaving only nominal fees to be paid by the customer when obtaining this product as you can see even during these challenging times we have not stopped innovating tailing there continues to be a time warp in credit card loans as we take a more conservative approach toward this segment in addition to managing customer credit limits credit card usage declined thirty year over year during the quarter as many clients stayed at home this drop had a negative impact on balances of course as to usage rates reached a very low level in april they recovered in may and june although remaining slightly strictly below 1st quarter levels growth in our consumer loans has been concentrated in payday loans growing twofive year on year and still above the market per cnbv data as of the end of may personal loans continue to contract consistent with our strategy to focus on more defensive segments of the market as noted by sector finally our other loan production in june more than doubled compared to previous quarters average boosted by our new commercial and business loans alliance with masda turning to slide thirteen growth in our base of loyal and digital customers continues to demonstrate important progress with year on year increases of almost seventeen and 31 respectively despite the challenging business environment loyalty penetration that is loyal to active customers stands at 35 400 points higher than a year ago we have seen continuous growth in the use of digital channels as customers have stayed home during the pandemic this quarter is product sales via digital channels accounted for 44 of the total almost doubling year ago levels digital monetary transactions also spiked reaching almost 13rd of the total while mobile transactions represented 93 of total digital transactions versus 84 in 2019 mobile customers also kept growing at a solid 38 year on year rate reaching 4300000 at the end of the quarter as you can see on slide fourteen commercial loans grew nine year over year but decreased sequentially as some corporates started prepaying some lines withdrawn in the 1st quarter of this year government and middle market segments continued to register double digit year over year expansion although their sequential evolution showed lower and stable volumes respectively sme loans registered a 4th sequential quarterly contraction as this segment showed a weakening trend even before the pandemic outstanding loans are similar to the ones we had in the 4th quarter of 201710 quarters ago the downward trend is also related to our lower risk appetite for lending in the sme segment given that more than fifty of our sme loan book joined the payment holiday deferral program and those customers cannot use their credit lines while in the program loan origination in this segment will remain low until we have more visibility on the performance of the economy moving on to total deposits on the slide fifteen this increased ten year on year while quarter on quarter we saw a two contraction during the quarter there was a shift between demand and time deposits favoring lower interest rates as of the 2nd quarter of this year demand deposits represented 64 of total deposits and were up eleven year on year deposit growth from individuals stands out at 23 year on year supported by our promotion campaigns to attract these types of deposits after an atypical 1st quarter of this year deposits from individuals continue to grow faster than corporate deposits in line with our strategy to further increase our exposure to retail deposits retail deposits now represent 33 of total deposits almost 400 basis points higher than its contribution in the 1st quarter of 2018 turning to slide sixteen we have a very strong capital and liquidity position aspects a had highlighted we maintain a sound funding position with a net loans to deposits ratio of 91eight one of the strongest levels since becoming a listed company our liquidity coverage ratio increased 89 points relative to the 1st quarter of this year and now stands at 211 well above the regulatory threshold of a 100 we also remain very comfortable with our debt profile with manageable debt maturities regarding capitalization our ratio increased 46 basis points sequentially to sixteenseven reflecting the postponement of the dividend payments as recommended by the banking commission while our core tier one ratio was up 58 basis points to elevensix and our core tier one ratio stood at thirteen03 as you can see on slide seventeen net interest income decreased four year on year and six quarter on quarter a result net interest margin contracted a 128 basis points to fourfive for the quarter our margin decline was a result of lower interest rates and lower balances within the high yielding segments coupled with higher average assets as a consequence of a significant increase in our securities portfolio without this last effect our net interest margin would have contracted only 35 basis points as a sector we are expecting net interest margin income to continue contracting during the remainder of the remainder of the year due to anticipated decreases in interest rates combined with a change in our portfolio mix where growth will likely come from low yielding segments and with a likely contraction in high yielding segments however these downward pressures will be partially mitigated by our expanded investment in securities portfolio please move on to slide eighteen net commissions and fees decreased two one year on year affected by the double digit decline in credit card transactions credit card usage decreased 42 in april 34 in may and fourteen in june on a year on year basis insurance fees register only a slight contraction given renewals of several groups insurance policies which partially compensated for softer insurance demand insurance represents almost thirty of our total fees and has proven to be a defensive segment even considering the the the pandemic with health and life insurance growing while retail insurance is slightly decreased our investment banking team has been very active mainly in financial advisory services which translated into strong fee growth of 31 in this line of our business which partially compensated for weaker results in other areas mainly credit card fees turning to slide nineteen gross premium income grew nine year on year driven by a solid performance in market related income which was significantly above our historical average levels of between 600 to 800000000 pesos per quarter declared interest rates the fx market volatility especially during april and may supported market making income in addition we saw investment in securities in order to further strengthen our liquidity position generating non recurring gains that boosted these quarters results all this contributed for market related income that accounted for thirteeneight of gross operating revenues threefive times higher than the historical average of four moving on to provisions on slide 29 in light of the deterioration of mexico is economic environment and in anticipation of a possible deterioration of our loan portfolio both due to the pandemic in june we registered a special charge of low loans provisions on top both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post

we have made this estimate of pre emptive provisions with the information currently at hand however this amount could be revised in the future as more information becomes available cost of risk for the quarter stood at threenine increase and 49 basis points sequentially our total empla ratio showed a slight 28 basis points year over year increase to twofive mainly due to the s m segment together with mortgage and credit card portfolios as explained earlier these ratios only reflect the performance of 81 of our total portfolio that does not fall under the payment holiday program we consider this ratio encouraging as its evolution is quite benign when considering the significant deterioration in economic activity and employment however it would not be until the 3rd and 4th quarter of these years of this year that the debtors program will end it will be at that time that mpl ratios will reflect the real magnitude of the economic impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide 21 administrative and promotional expenses increase onetwo year on year reflecting the impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide 22 administrative and promotional expenses increase onetwo year on year reflecting the impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide 23 administrative and promotional expenses increase onetwo year on year reflecting the impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide 24 administrative and promotional expenses increase onetwo year on year reflecting the impact of the pan to control personal costs mainly reserves for variable compensation and amortization expenses related to the strategic and it investments that we made over the past three years as we will continue investing in the digitalization of the bank and in technology upgrades we are targeting greater operating efficiencies in the common quarters such as the ability to reduce the number of business trips variable compensation as well as limiting base salary increases among other improvements less business travel and salary caps has already led to a sequential onenine decrease in our total expenses during the 2nd quarter of this year such expense controls combined with strong operating income and the conclusion of our three year investment plan contributed to a 358 basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio which decreased to fortyseven on a six month basis the ratio improved 227 basis points year on year to 42three turning to profitability on slide 22 you will note that our earnings were mainly impacted by the special low notes provisions that we discussed earlier profit before taxes was down 24 year over year for the quarter and eleven for the 1st half of the year net income decreased 25 year over year to 4200000000 pesos while our effective tax rate increased 38 basis points year over year to 25three this resulted in an elevenfive decrease in net income for the 1st six months of 2020 which was 9600000000 pesos return on equity was elevennine 543 basis points below the year ago level and down 362 basis points sequentially year to date arroyo reported 328 basis points to thirteenfive eckhart please go ahead thank you riviere please turn to slide 23 let me share with you some final thoughts on what lies ahead given the unprecedented nature of this health crisis and the uncertainty surrounding its duration and magnitude we anticipate only a very gradual recovery of our economy which has obvious implications with regard to our operating environment we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial we expect special loans mainly medium and large corporations government loans as well as mortgages the consumer will recover very gradually and this will depend on the speed of the eventual turnaround in employment economic activity as well as business and consumer confidence although visibility on asset quality is limited due to the parental holiday program which has been talking and taking rapid and decisive action in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the loan book a recoveries plan which includes a very detailed and in depth analysis of each customer is situation is allowing us to pre emptively and swiftly prepare the bank for complicated quarters ahead in particular we have allocated a large number of current employees and branches involved in carrying out the recovery strategy we will continue focusing on enhancing customer loyalty and on cross selling non credit products to support non interest income our income we also remain committed to making additional investments in the bank transformation mainly in it and digitalization but we will continue to look for efficiencies in other lines with a strict cost control in order to support the bottom line and finally rest assured that our banks is operating from a position of strength with robust capital and high liquidity levels that will allow us to overcome this complicated but what we believe are temporary circumstances please go ahead thank you if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press star one to ask a question please ask one question and a follow up if you have further questions please re enter the queue we will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question opportunity to signal for questions thank you our 1st question is from the line of rhys moline from scotia bank please go ahead hi my question is on the operating outlook the disclosures are excellent as always and i like the way you presented it thank you very much my question is on the operating outlook the disclosures are excellent as always and i like the way you presented it thank you very much our 1st question is from the line of rhys moline from scotia bank please go ahead hi my question is on the operating outlook the disclosures are excellent as always and i like the way you presented it thank you very much my question is on the operating outlook the disclosures are excellent as always and i like the way you presented it thank you very on slide nineteen we can look at the main main drivers for the operating income and clearly as you we talked about market related revenue was very strong well above historical levels about fourteen of the total operating income compared to let us say three or four in the past these are different times but how should we think about efficiency going forward you talked about cost control we saw that if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you can if you just give us a general sense you mentioned there are certain costs you can control and you are controlling can you talk a little bit about the physical infrastructure is there an opportunity to rationalize the physical branch network after the investments you have made what should we be looking for in terms of efficiency going forward the dynamic is quite skewed from all of these moving parts the very high trading and the low the low revenues giving what is going on thank you thank you look i mean as you have said i mean and if you take a look at our numbers basically we have decreased the operation cost of the bank quite significantly i mean 1st of all i mean not traveling and not doing many things basically have reduced naturally the cost we have also been very strict in the new projects and new situations i mean we are basically focusing all our expenses in it to support the backbone and to be ready for what is coming so in that sense that is going to be our priority secondly we are taking a look and we are doing a deep dive in terms of all our infrastructure and we are not going to get take i mean rough decisions in terms of closing down a big number of branches or anything like that i think that we are going to be rationally looking at each of the micro markets that we have divided the country into and we will decide with the evolution of the economy what should happen there so but we are going to be very strickt if you have seen the growth of the post four or five years in terms of branches we actually have decreased the number of total branches we have just we have been very intelligent in the way we branches which we are going to basically be taking a little bit more time than the time that we were thinking of of upgrading all the branches are not up to the standard so this exactly what we are doing we are going to basically rationalize all of all of expending and do it on where the most important thing is that is basically the it platform and the digitalization of the bank so in that sense we are going to be working we are very concentrated on that we also believe that i mean given that we have been able to operate at the bank under these income taxes we have a huge amount of people basically working from home you basically get to understand exactly how really how much people do you need what can you rationalize et cetera so what you are going to see from us is that we are going to be very responsible in the way we manage that and concentrate on those points where we are working currently on that we are working on our three year plan and we are basically including all these in order to do so maybe as a follow up just some comments on what you have seen throughout your peers in descent and their group in the region or elsewhere are there other things you think that could be applied to mexico that could help perhaps on the side of the banking system perhaps in terms of terms of operationally or it or or any factors at all thank you what we are doing basically is for example i mean in terms of developing digital platforms et cetera what we are doing it we are doing it now instead of each country basically developing the platforms we are doing it together so that basically is going to help out quite a lot so it is not mexico for example right now in mexico we are developing the new super app and the new super app is going to be used in all the other countries no for example the embodiment for sme is you are using the one that is being developed in europe so all those type of things are going to help us out basically in reducing our cost for the digital infrastructure that we are developing and we are working together much more within the group in order to do that so you will see that i mean the cost of basically developing things and it is going to come down due to the fact that we are doing it together with the rest of our ten sister banks so those three factors are very important for implementing this at this point thank you i appreciate it the next question comes from the line of jorge gudi from morgan stanley please go ahead the next question comes from the line of jorge gudi from morgan stanley please go ahead hi good morning everyone i wanted to ask about net interest margin you you you pointed out that that you expect further complications in the next couple of quarters given falling rates and weak loan demand and mixed deterioration as you look at 2021 in the context of what you said on not a strong economic recovery next year and with average rates next year being much lower than 2020 if indeed rates at about four what is the expectation for net interest margin next year and for n a i is it possible that we are likely to see another year of n a i compression and to what extent that could be offset elsewhere in the pnl and my 2nd question is on the coverage ratio and i know that banks banks normally do not target a coverage ratio i get it but but evidently the the size of your reserves have a relationship to the size of your loan book the size of your npls and the size of the amount of loans that are on their restructuring and so when i look at your coverage ratio it looks like 10138 it looks low relative to where banco noroeste ended up at 201 and bancolombia at 185 so i wonder why why not just take a much bigger charge on provisions this order evidently there is there is a lot of uncertainty ahead and the more the better and and so is this peas meal just going to potentially put more pressure on your earnings going forward rather than just take a really big one soup and raise your coverages to north of 200 likely made something you will do in the 3rd order thank you look eric i will ask this sector i will ask this department to answer the 1st part and then i will ask them to be here to complete on the basic numbers of n i zero okay i mean 1st of all i mean if you saw the presentation we are basically changing the mix of all of the credit long portfolio okay 1st of all i mean if you have seen we have decreased quite a lot our pursuant unfortunately it is a means given the lack of warrants from the government from lafayette ok so the portfolio has dropped almost ten so in that sense that basically is a high yield portfolio which is going to continue to shrink unless we see some warrants from the government and you if you see our portfolio which is quite important we have like 62 of it already warranted by lafayette ok the court is ruling this basically goes to answer your 2nd question the question in terms of the amount of the amount of reserves that we have done then you see that also we see that for example consumer credit and consumer loans are going to decrease as well so the mix is completely changing and we are going i mean we are going basically back to where we were five years ago when we had much more exposure to corporates and to medium sized companies than to consumer loans remember that at different levels okay so that is why nia is shrinking on the other side what we also been doing is we were pricing and we are very strict on pricing risk okay so we have been increasing the margin on the corporate loans quite significantly due to that fact that we are basically looking at the risk that we are taking and we are looking very closely at the ratings of those companies and we are pricing accordingly this is not a situation in which we want to spend the portfolio of the great portfolios just to expand it we are basically doing it just to the companies that we believe have a future and will be there in the next few years and both are pricing the risk accordingly so in that sense you will find us going towards that also the other concentration is mortgages which we believe there is a sector still of growth and as you know there is a lack of or a big deficit in terms of homes in mexico so we believe there is still a part of the population that can afford a mortgage mortgages is penetration in mexico was quite low versus the rest and also low penetration is quite low so we believe there is a chance to to to continue to penetrate that sector and maybe on payrolls on some situations we will basically be also lending in that in that part i mean auto loans also we have seen some interesting developments there we have seen some interesting developments there we have seen some interesting developments there we have seen some interesting developments there we have seen some interesting developments there we have seen some interesting developments there we have seen some interesting developments there we have seen some interesting developments there we have seen some interesting developments there very cautious approach to it so in that sense the mix of the portfolio is going to change and probably we will be able to let you know exactly how do we see ai evolving in terms of what you were asking in terms of the reserves we we we actually been doing reserves according to what we believe we are doing in terms of how the portfolio is is is behaving at this point what i can tell you is that the portfolio not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not payment holidays is behaving much much better than we believed that it was going to that it was going to turn actually i am quite surprised about it hopefully it continues that way but in that sense we are basically being in my opinion being very responsible in the amount of research that we are making at this point also we have done a tremendous job with the data and that we have in reviewing the portfolio on holidays and that portfolio is being divided as we said in 36 clusters okay these clusters have been divided upon upon the amount of risk that we have on each particular situation and in some of these portfolios even before the payment holiday ends we are already talking to clients and discussing the way that we could get paid pay on those particular situations because what we believe is that whoever gets paid 1st is the one again there is the one that is going to get paid so we are basically being very aggressive on that sense to talk to our clients and basically trying to get that and to recover that portfolio as you have seen fifty of our branches have been turned into collecting branches i mean to basically this we are dedicating our executives to collect we have divided them up on them in the sectors that we believe are the ones that are the ones that are going to be much more important in the economy or that are going to be hit the most in the economy so in that sense we really were very well prepared although i mean nevertheless it is always a lot of uncertainty what is happening and we did not want to go overboard we believe it is the right approach the right approach is the one that we have made but we will continue to do so over the next few months evolution but i can tell you is that we are going to be very conservative in the way we manage that okay lily i do not know if you want to complete absolutely absolutely lily i would like to to compliment on what you mentioned a great talking to you jorge long time no speak in terms of a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a some background information that i think it is it is quite relevant the the speed at which interest rates have come down in mexico is is is significant you know just in this quarter the average of the reference reference rate came down a 123 basis points that is the the fastest decline that we have seen in the recent history we we did not see an increase of those you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you of that magnitude when when interest rates were were coming up ok so that is one thing to have in mind that the the the impact in nim that you see in this quarter i think is is probably the most severe that we are going to see in a relative basis relative to the 1st quarter of this year and relative to the 2nd quarter of last year ok also bear in mind that when interest rates were close to four as we probably agree with you that that is where we are headed you know our nim was close to five you know and this was you know the 2nd and 3rd quarter of 2016 i think that you know the the the number that we reported the 448 in this quarter it has to do with the with what i was referring to you know the speed at which interest rates came down ok and also on top of that you have the the you know the change in a mix on our the loan site and also the fact that in order to protect the net interest income from interest rates coming down we we increased our investment in securities portfolio significantly you know and those are you know lower margin activities assets relative to the loan portfolio just just to share with you we have bought you know this taking into account you know both you know divestments and maturities the overall growth in our pay investment securities portfolio is 96000000000 pesos over the last twelve months so what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is you know what we expect coming down is on the road you know for the rest of 2020 and the you know next year i think that you know having said that it is there is still a lot of uncertainty you know i think that probably the the most severe numbers in terms of nym are the ones that we saw this quarter you know there is probably you know ten to fifteen basis points probably further adjustment or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or light improvement for the rest of the year okay and next year i think that we will probably get to see names similar or slightly above to the ones that we were seeing in this quarter okay now regarding the coverage ratio you are totally right in the sense that we do not target a coverage ratio if that is that is a result in number and also you know when you make reference to you know our number 13080 looks slow relative to banorte banorte in the 1st quarter of this year they had a 140 in these in the 2nd quarter they did as we did also know increase the provisions but different to us you know they did a significant charge off 4600000000 pesos so that is why you know their corruption increased to 200 a percentage i am probably just elaborating elaborating elaborating more on what tector mentioned you know the level of provisions that we have are in line with the expected losses that we we estimate you know you might have a you know or you might question you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under for current circumstances we we have definitely done different types of sensitivity analysis or scenario analysis okay so if there is a v type recovery in the mexican economy you know we have with these quarterly provisions we are you know more than covered you know for the rest of the year now do we think that there is going to be a v type recovery in the mexican economy i do not think so you know it is very you know low probability now we have assessed you know the the our level of provisions according to other type of scenarios you know more a u type or an adverse scenario having a gdp contraction of twelvefive you know and under those circumstances these quota provisions are not enough for the entire year there could be close to 75 depending on the magnitude of the gdp a contraction that that you assume ok so so there should be a direct correlation between expected losses and provisions and the provisions that we are putting forward we think that with the information that we have are quite strong to cover you know expected losses if the economy ends up costing attracting more than we are expecting right now definitely we will need to provide additional provisions something that i i encourage you to look at if you have not done so yet you know the central bank banco central released in the stability financial stability report published a few weeks ago an analysis regarding mpls for the entire system and what they did is look at information from the entire banking system for the last twenty years and they you know using an econometric model they they estimated you know what are the critical variables that determine lp is and they break down the the loan portfolio in consumer loans in mortgage loans and corporate loans so so once they they determine you know these these econometric models they they determine you know what are the critical variables that determine lp is and they break down the the loan portfolio in consumer loans in mortgage loans and corporate loans so so once they they determine you know these these econometric models they they determine you know what are the critical variables that determine lp is and they break down the the loan portfolio the metric model then they provided a you know a shock with the variables that we are seeing lately and they estimated how much n p l ratios would derate for the entire banking system for consumer loans that would imply a 32 increase for mortgages nineteen and for corporates also 32 so when you do that math and you break it down a loan you know by the type of loan by type of bank you get to see you know this is obviously a bull is eye estimate because obviously every single bank has different practices in you know origination practices and recoveries and so on but you can get a sense of the magnitude in terms of you know using this model how much you you would expect that each bank would provision okay thank you thanks hector lizarraga for the detailed response we will take the next question it comes from the line of ernesto gavilondo from bank of america please go ahead hi good morning hector and divere thanks for the opportunity my 1st question is a follow up on the preventive provisions of 3900000000 pesos so you think this level of provisions would be enough for the rest of the year or for a year ahead going to evaluate to create more depending on the behavior of payments after the relief program and then my 2nd question is a difficult one because we would like to know if you have exposure to aeromexico on the chapter eleven or twilight that has restructured loans with the banks for about a year but i understand if you cannot disclose your exposure so maybe if you can remind us how much of your loan book is exposed to airlines and how much is exposed to twilight that has restructured loans with the banks for about a year much to food and beverage and it is there is a sector that is concerning you and and finally my last question is some competition in mortgage loans we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates of mortgages in light of the lower rates so how has been your strategy to attract more mortgage clients and how competitive is your interest rate thank you thank you minister let me let me start and then the director will complement 1st of all on the follow up of provisions like i have not spoken many times to my cio and he basically tells me that when i asked you and asked the same question you are asking me at this and he basically says look i mean i have a crystal ball so clear and it is quite impossible but it is going to be difficult to assess what we are doing i mean what i can tell you is that we are doing our best job in basically reviewing the portfolio we do that every single day we review the behavior of it and we are basically trying to be as conservative as we can in order to manage it so and if we see that the portfolio continues to deteriorate or is much more complicated we are going to find out i mean the payment shock comes in the 1st week of august we are preparing for it next week actually when the 1st loans that went into the penny holiday start to mature and we will see the we will see how the performance of the portfolio is and then we will take i mean you are going to see our numbers write as i mean we want to take the provisions as soon as they come if and when they are needed ok our 2nd point in aruba mexico yes and aruba yes we do have exposure to them nothing that we cannot control or nothing too big for the size of the bank i mean our total exposure to airlines is not big i mean compared to the total size of the portfolio i would say probably gilbride knows a percentage much better but it is not big i mean it is not very significant versus the size of the bank and we have done some provisions already on some of the exposure we have supplied to mexico okay we can tell you that in the provisions that we made some of them are made to for the aluminum exposure which is not relevant in terms of falcaea yes we do have exposure to them also not i mean not significant and we are basically in the restructuring process as of now and we see that the company can recover fairly i mean i do not see that falcaea is going to be a particular situation food and drink available i do not know if it is available unfortunately i do not have it in front of me and we could get back to you on that on that data rest in terms of the competition on mortgage loans it is quite important what we do we have a important differentiation in terms of how we do mortgages versus our competition if you take a look at what ipoqeta plus is it is a completely different product that nobody has replicated in the mexican market i mean it is a completely different product that nobody has replicated in the mexican market some of the other banks basically have tried to do a little bit of what we do in ipoteka plc ipoteka plc is the best rate available in the market but in order to get a rate best available in the market which is seven75 for a fifteen year mortgage you have to basically turn into turn earth into your most important bank your number one bank what in order to do that you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank your number one bank what in order to do that you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank your number one bank what in order to do that you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank your number one bank what in order to do that you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank your number one bank what in order to do be able to get that rate you basically have to have different products with us that basically you have to have your payroll you have to direct deposit your utilities with us you have to have your insurance you have so there is something that you have to do in order to be able to access the rate in that regard what happens is even if the loan is at seven75 and we are also very cautious in the loan to value that we do in that loan that is why i was explaining in the presentation that that is why our ticket for mortgage is 37 larger than the rest so we go directly to the mortgage to the wealthy people okay to the people that are in the best situation right now so we believe that our portfolio is more resilient in these particular situations and also that we have the best client because those are the ones that basically can achieve this rate and can achieve this and have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a characteristics to act in this type of product so that is why the portfolio we believe is going to behave well and it is going to be managed or is going to behave in a nice in a nice in a nice way due to that fact okay so and we have seen the way the portfolio has performed and we see that the performance is according to our expectations given the very complicated circumstances so in that regard i mean there is competition i mean there are some banks i mean a couple of banks have tried to come in and basically compete with us head to head in these types of situations but they have not been able to have the same type of product that we sell to the market then we came out with another product that is the hypotheca free the hypotheca free basically has the particularity that has everything included in the rate you do not have any fees any commissions you do not have to pay for any ancillary costs or anything like that so that particular thing for people that i mean that they believe that we have a lot of things under the table and there were no completely clear this is completely transparent to the client and that hypotheca is above nine that is the rate and and thus for a different type of client so we have a chinese menu for every type of client that would like to access what we do and for example the hypotheca free goes to a different sector that is new to us that is basically clients with a lower ticket and there are some of these clients that are very good and have very good credit quality and that is where we decided to compete in that sector i do not know if this answered your question ernest and please bear with me sure ernest regarding your 1st question as i previously mentioned you know it depends on the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the how severe is the gdp contraction this year you know and how that impacts the capacity for clients to pay back their loans we think that the you know as mentioned if there is a you know like a u type recovery and you know gdp contracting somewhere around ten to twelve then we have made with the provisions of this quarter more than half of what we required and that could be you know sixty to 75 of what we require you know with the information that we have right now ok so but it is going to be dependent on how this evolves you know and obviously we are closely monitoring a you know how our clients are are behaving ok now on your 2nd question regarding the exposure that we have to illicit mexico and el salvador you know obviously for conf these two exposures that we have are not within our top ten exposures as ehtion mentioned we have already provisioned the partially the exposure that we have with ido mexica that is close to 45 of the exposure that we have that is not that the material okay and i do not have with me the breakdown in terms of food and beverage the breakdown that we have that i have right now is more the one that the cnbc uses more for regulatory purposes and do not do do not have do not have that detail but for sure we can follow up with that ernest now this is super helpful eric and amy thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from brian flores from city bank please go ahead hi eric good morning thank you for the opportunity to ask question do you have my question you mentioned that based on your crm capabilities you saw a certain percentage of customers continuing to pay what is that exact percentage sorry forty i think that is forty thank you and now for my question you know we saw some deterioration in asset quality across the board and and as you mentioned overview of your s d portfolio has a large degree of guarantee by ratiopharm my question is is that correct guyss could you elaborate on anything on the collateral there and the not given default for for this segment what are you expecting in terms of mpl for this segment thank you if you like i can take that thea eh if you like i can take that thea eh if you like i can take that thea eh if you like i can take that thea eh if you like i can take that thea eh if you like i can take that thea eh if you like i can take that thea eh if you like i can take credit cards do not have a collateral you know so so laws given faults in in credit cards is close to a 100 you know you basically do not recover that much you know in terms of credit cards you know and you we think that that is that is going to be one of the most impacted you know when you look at a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a different types of loans that clients have you know we think that mortgages are the ones that you pay you pay you do not you know you continue paying you know if there is any just one loan that you continue paying that is mortgages and probably credit cards are you know at the bottom of your priorities you know when you have a trouble you know the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the in credit cards you know have been increasing slightly but i think it is relatively stable when you compare it you know historically so we do not we do not expect you know a significant you know deterioration no but you know the cost of risk you know with the provisions that we are taking is close to eleven so i do not know ehctor if you would like to ehctor chavez you would like to to further the complement on this time would you like to take the next question one question on the market related income i know you need to know the big spike in the quarter but do you think that goes back to normal already in the 3rd quarter or do you think that can remain elevated elevated for some period of time to figure i know it is tough to predict but if you could give some more color on how you think about market related income going forward and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and if we look at the cost of risk before this quarter it had been around two62seven you know barring any changes in the scenario that you see right now is that two62seven what we should expect sort of going forward as well again barring any significant changes in the current scenario thank you i mean what i can tell you is yes we had a good run in terms of market related income i think the bank is well positioned to do so the important point is volatility and if volatility continues to be the way it is then you can expect that we can we can basically have good numbers there i do not think we are going to have in the in the in the 3rd quarter numbers as good as they were in the in the in this quarter but it will not depend on what happens in the next quarter days in the next month in terms of the provisions and the cost of risk did you want to comment on that absolutely right ito you know i think that once you take out the destroyed areas the provisions that we did this quarter i think that cost of risk should be slightly higher than the numbers that we were having over the last five quarters but not to levels that we reported quarter so somewhere you know below the 300 basis points that would be my my take and obviously as you mentioned you know with the information that we currently have okay okay well thank you we will take the next question it comes from the line of carlos gomez from h s b c please go ahead i have a question about credit risk but not to your corporate but to the stress of the financial system we already saw one company that has been liquidated has been put into liquidation by the national banking commission this is becoming a very long crisis with 10s of 1000000000s of economy being unable to operate so eventually one would imagine that some situations might get into trouble i would like to take special precautions in regard to any effects of the financial system and do you think we will you will encounter much trouble or most of them will be able to go through this okay thank you thank you carlos i mean i mean in all these particular situations and depend how long the crisis is going to take i mean it is probably going to take down some financial patios in that sense we are yes we are being very cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what they are doing and their situation and we are going to basically continue to monitor that as the crisis continues to to evolve so in that sense we are very close in to a particular sector we do not have i mean we are not a big lender to the sector i can tell you that if they are not in as the gilbane is or their ten most important clients there are not financial players so in that sense we are not worried about the exposure that we have out to them but we are very concerned taking a look and monitoring them more the time okay hopefully the crisis is shorter and nobody else goes down but let us see what happens in any particular sub segments that you are interested in monitoring you know market related or consumer related or healthcare related or education related or any other area that you are interested in monitoring you know market related or consumer related or healthcare related or education related or any other area that you are interested in monitoring you know market related or consumer related or healthcare related or education related or any other area that you are interested in monitoring you know market related or consumer related or healthcare related or education related related or payroll i think microfinance is a sector that we need to be very close monitoring we do not have to we do not have to a lot of big spurts to them but that is a sector that corporately would be complicated as always in these type of situations the people that suffer the most are the ones that are on the base of the pyramid so unfortunately that is the case and we are monitoring that quite closely thank you very much let us take the next question it comes from alonso garcia from credi suisse please go ahead good morning thank you for taking my question my question is regarding liquidity i mean your liquidity coverage ratio improved nicely in the quarter in fact it was above the $1800000000 that each one does in april but also given a very strong increase in funding with banks this quarter so could you please provide some color to the nature of this funding source and what would be your strategy for liquidity in the coming quarters thank you very much hi alonzo the you know there are several factors regarding liquidity the you know i think that the most relevant are you know how we fund the you know let us say the loans to deposit ratio that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that has that it was one of the strongest numbers that we have reported since we became a listed company close to 92 so that is that is in my opinion that is the most robust and fundamental way of looking at it then as you rightly mentioned the debt issuance is you have contributed significantly to the increase of our liquidity coverage ratio and we are monitoring you know any potential use of the committed lines of credit that we have with our clients that if you look at it is probably the one let us say risk that could materialize in in the short term we have ample liquidity to honor every single committed line of credit that that we have but that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the one that is the and the most relevant driver in terms of consumption of liquidity the other types of you know events that could impact our liquidity you know are are more gradual you know and those could be you know a construction in deposits that were not seen that and i think that the bank has managed a quite well actively you know liquidity to be prepared for any potential you know really worst case scenario further down the road thank you and regarding the line of in your balance sheet the line of banks and other loans which increased 81 quarter over quarter do you think this line would remain at those levels or do you think you could substitute this source of funding with you know some other source of funding with you know some other source of funding with you know some other source of funding with you know some other source of funding with you know some other source of funding with you know some other source of funding with you know some other source of funding with you know some other source of funding with you know some other source of funding with you know probably other the issues in coming quarters what is your study there you know we we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the specific you know tenure cost you know we end up withdrawing or taking advantage of the different funding sources so you know i would say that not only that particular line item but every single line item is is is reviewed you know and under current market circumstances we you know it is it is our obligation to look at better ways of of of not only funding the bank but keeping the structures in place so that the bank you know can continue supporting you know long term growth of course that is something that we continue to monitor as well so so yes you know it could be that we keep it at those levels or that we reduce it if there is an opportunity to find a more effective funding source i am sorry i do not understand what you are trying to say could you please rephrase your question or provide more context further for for you and my 2nd question is regarding the special accounting criteria when we look to those numbers the balance of npls are much higher than than the ones the old accounting versus the current special accounting and i would like to understand the difference here if it is like a very negative outlook with which you see you know like those numbers materializing as losses if you can explain for me the differences on the special accounting versus the old accounting and if the balance of mpls there may become losses i would appreciate thank you from two61 to three37 as as we discussed during the call during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call and it is not a significant deterioration in our view given you know the you know what is going on in the economy is just a you know a slight deterioration no now on your 2nd question could you elaborate on that you know i i do not know exactly what you are comparing you know the special accounting criteria to the other accounting criteria so before the s p 500 regulation for covid you have like a table on your release comparing the special accounting criteria versus the former i think like b six accounting criteria and when we look to the balance of non performing loans i believe the balance you have to date is something around like 18000000000 pesos 19000000000 pesos that that implies the twofive illiquid ratio but if you look to the old accounting criteria the d six accounting criteria the d six accounting criteria i think the balance of npls are closer to 4044000000000 pesos so the npl ratio would be much higher i understand that maybe a lot of loans that do not really become npls are there but my concern is that as soon as these accounting criteria go goes back to normal if we could see you know like a higher need of provisions working on npls so that is why i ask the difference and if it makes sense to expect them veracity on that no i think that that you know it it is fairly dependent on the level of or or the type of assumptions that we make because the existing accounting criteria is very stringent in terms of a let us say bad news and percentage of how much you have the client has paid back so so i think that it is it is in my opinion it is it is somehow an extreme comparison okay so it has to do with you know with the you know the special accounting criteria you basically allow clients not to pay you know or every client that is not paying their interest and capital stays current you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you and the under the old or the prevailing accounting criteria you know you have to take into account just the the you know when when you are ninety days past due and depending on if you are you know let us say a corporate client you know depending on how much you have already paid back whether you are twenty or or more or how the time that has elapsed you know bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah b it it it is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very actions i think that as soon as clients start paying back or not we will get to know you know how you know the magnitude of the impact okay rather than just making you know some assumptions that you could materialize or not as as mentioned during the call i think that we have made we have made a good assessment in terms of the risk that each client has you know the relationship that we have with them and we have also asked them you know you know how they are doing and whether they have the capacity to pay back so taking all that into account that is how we have come up with these provisions associated with the expected losses that you assume so i would i would encourage you judy just to to wait a couple of quarters and with the hard data you know just analyze you know if we if we you know on one hand the benefit of these temporary measures you know just analyze you know if we if we you know on one hand the benefit of these temporary measures you know just analyze you know if we if we you know on one hand the benefit of these temporary measures you know just analyze you know if we if we that the banking commission provided and on the other hand you know the the the true impact that it has had in our asset quality no no that is very clear thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from nicolas riva from bank of america yes thank you very much for taking my question i have only one question i apologize if you already mentioned it and you mentioned that nineteen of the loan portfolio has been subject to some kind of debt relief measures payment holidays giving grace periods have these measures ended already for any clients and if so if you can tell us what is the percentage of clients that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments already that have resumed payments four months is the full outbreak of the pandemic and and it has not been the case if the payment holiday has ended for any significant amount of clients if you can tell us when you made this provision charge of the 3900000000 pesos in this quarter did you incorporate any assumption in terms of what would be the percentage of these clients under the relief program i will pay you back once the payment holiday ends thank you you know 1st the payment holidays payment holiday period ends tomorrow so we will start the the you know seeing whether clients pay back or not in starting next week so we do not have that information yet no now regarding you know how we made provisions for this quarter you know and as mentioned throughout the call we classified the clients depending on the risk that they have the exposure that they have with us the relationship that they have with us so we we classified the retail clients in 25 clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in 25 clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in 25 clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in 25 clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in 25 clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in 25 clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in 25 client falls in you know there is either a high risk or high exposure a category you know for clients and we assume certain probability of those clusters either paying back their loans or not okay so that is how we came up with with with the provision that we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we or low number of clients to pay back their loans it is it you know it is it is because of these analysis that we have done that we feel a relatively confident that with the information that we have what we have provided is is is good is a good provision for asset quality deterioration for the rest of the year ok thank you very much the next question comes from olivo artuzo from ubs please go ahead okay thank you very much for taking my question it is just one i just wanted to understand the dynamic of the credit relief program held by the bank and the hike on npls to twofive according to my calculation the deferred loans reach almost fifteen of total loans if i am not wrong they are roughly a similar level to the other banks but different from other players and even considered and the brazilian and chilean subsidiaries they have also fostered their credit relief program n p l decreased in the 2nd quarter you mentioned that this deterioration is emanating from the s e m and the credit card segment so i just wanted to understand if this hike in n p l behaved worse than expected by the bank considering the amount of loans that were owed and what does the bank cease for this semester in terms of fostering the credit relief program in case of regulators extend the schedule and change the rules forward so thank you very much no i think that you know the 1st of all you know the npls that the increase that we see in the 2nd quarter are associated with those clients that do not enter into the relief program okay so it has to do with that 81 of clients that decided not to enter into into the program and obviously those clients are also exposed to the deration of the economic activity you know the ector mentioned you know the the losses that you know the unemployed losses that we have seen so it is it has to do more with that okay with the clients that do not enter into the program so let us let us say with the clients that do not enter into the program whether we were expecting you know that type of deterioration you know i think that if someone tells you that they were envisioning this type of economic deterioration i think that they are lying you know i think that we were not expecting this type of contraction you know the magnitude that we were seeing if you look at how every single analyst updates its the forecast for the mexican economy every week you
