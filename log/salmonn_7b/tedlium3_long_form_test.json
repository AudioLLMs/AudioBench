        "answer": "i 'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i 'm writing anything but i 'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i 'd find let me read you the entry disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i 'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn 't using a thesaurus back then i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today i 'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here 's the updated version of this entry unfortunately it 's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome so it 's not just about the words it 's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it 's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who 's empowered by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn 't we want to open doors for them instead one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl i think you 're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i 'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy on doctor p 's part to get me to do the exercises i didn 't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn 't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable our language hasn 't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it 's an interesting thing because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity and i 'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people 's questions about it and i think i 'm starting to figure out why implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing adversity isn 't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it 's part of our life and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there 's very little but it 's always with me and certainly i 'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person 's struggle there is adversity and challenge in life and it 's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn 't whether or not you 're going to meet adversity but how you 're going to meet it so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they 're not equipped to adapt there 's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i 'm disabled and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i 've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don 't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have we are effectively grading someone 's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability and most importantly there 's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability so it 's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we 're less burdened by the presence of it this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character to paraphrase it 's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin 's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest human skill and perhaps you know until we 're tested we don 't know what we 're made of maybe that 's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven 't adapted ourselves to yet i think the greatest adversity that we 've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy now who 's normal there 's no normal there 's common there 's typical there 's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don 't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute there 's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community they didn 't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn 't aimee mullins and i turn around and it 's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i 'm sorry sir  i don 't have we met i i don 't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn 't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother 's womb oh that guy and but of course actually it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother 's stories of that day because of course typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother 's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you 've been making liar out of me ever since the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone 's life and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there 's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it and there 's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you 'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn 't have hesitated for a second i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i 'm not so sure and it 's because of the experiences i 've had with them not in spite of the experiences i 've had with them and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i 've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you 're off if you can hand somebody the key to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense you 're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it 's called the streaming trials we call it tracking here in the states it 's separating students from a b c d and so on and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a 's told them they were a 's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students and told them they were d 's and that 's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too the teachers didn 't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that 's how they went about teaching them and treating them so i think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit a spirit that 's been crushed doesn 't have hope it doesn 't see beauty it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being i 'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child has known god not the god of names not the god of don 'ts but the god who only knows four words and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you",

        "answer": "everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness coaching everybody would like to make people happier but in spite of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we 're just as messed up as anybody else is the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things i think there is one particular meaning for to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we 'll have to give up and we 'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it 's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they 're both lumped in the notion of happiness and the third is it 's the focusing illusion and it 's the unfortunate fact that we can 't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance i mean this is a real cognitive trap there 's just no way of getting it right now i 'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures reported a story and that was the story he said he 'd been listening to the symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally it ruined the whole experience but it hadn't what it had ruined were the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves there is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present is capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it 's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor asks does it hurt now when i touch you here and then there is a remembering self and the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it 's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question how have you been feeling lately or how was your trip to albania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess of the notion of happiness now the remembering self is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic response of our memory it starts immediately we don 't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story and let me begin with one example this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won 't go into detail it 's no longer painful these days but it was painful when this when this study was run in the nineteen nineties they were asked to report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are asked who of them suffered more and it 's a very easy question i mean clearly patient b suffered more his colonoscopy was longer and every minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there is another question how much did these patients think they suffered and here is a surprise and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than patient b the stories of the colonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end it 's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for a than for b in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view of the experiencing self clearly b had a worse time now what you could do with patient a and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off and you have the remembering self of patient a and lot better off because now you have endowed patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it 's also true of the stories that we make up what defines a story are changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life and i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long which means that you know in in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand most of them don 't leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it 's the finite resource that we 're spending while we 're on this earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self and they 're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that 's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self a two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self time has very little impact on this story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose then the one that chooses is the one that has you know the memory that is less bad and that 's the the surgeon that will be chosen the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don 't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future we don 't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories and basically you can look at this you know as a tyranny of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn 't need i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case that is that it 's we we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self and this is a bit hard to justify i think i mean i how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self and when i think about that i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago which was clearly the best vacation i 've ever had and i think of it relatively often relative to how much i think of other vacations and i probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme you know in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of this there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you 'll get an amnesic drug so that you won 't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation and and if and if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between your two selves and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict and it 's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer why do we pick them the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two selves now the two selves bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self and so you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self 's life and they 're all happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it 's a completely different thing this is not about how happily a person lives it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life very different notions anyone who doesn 't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of well being who 've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallup organization has a world poll with more that half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences and there there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn 't teach you much about how happily they 're living their life and vice versa you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is about point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told oh his father is six feet tall would how much would you know about his height well you would know something about his height but there 's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures but this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves you are going to end up doing very different things the bottom line of what i 've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend the same to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if if say you live in ohio and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places and that contrast say is in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are but now because the reflective self is in charge you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it 's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier well their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that but one thing will happen they will think they are happier because when they think about it they 'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio and they will feel they made the right decision it is very difficult to think straight about well being and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you thank you i 've got a question for you thank thank you so much now when we were on the phone a few weeks ago you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey is that is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now sure sure i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self when you know we looked at how at how feelings vary with income and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that 's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it 's a large representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year six sixty thousand sixty thousand sixty thousand sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get above that we get an absolutely flat line i mean i 've rarely seen lines so flat clearly what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys you misery and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you earn the more satisfied you are that does not hold for emotions but danny the the whole american endeavor is about you know life liberty the pursuit of happiness if people took seriously that finding i mean it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about you know for example taxation policy and so forth is is there any chance that politicians that the country generally would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the uk it is happening and in other countries it is happening people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy of happiness when they think of public policy it 's going to take a while and it 's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life evaluation so we need to have that debate fairly soon how to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self this is going to influence policy i think in years to come in the united states efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next decade or two part of national statistics well it seems to me this issue will or at least should be the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics thank you danny kahneman",

I HAD SOMEBODY COUNT THE NUMBER OF BOOKS WITH HAPPINESS IN THE TITLE PUBLISHED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND THEY GAVE UP AFTER ABOUT FORTY AND THERE WERE MANY MORE THERE IS A HUGE WAVE OF INTEREST IN HAPPINESS AMONG RESEARCHERS THERE IS A LOT OF HAPPINESS COACHING EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPIER BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS FLOOD OF WORK THERE ARE SEVERAL COGNITIVE TRAPS THAT SORT AND MY TALK TODAY WILL BE MOSTLY ABOUT THESE COGNITIVE TRAPS THIS APPLIES TO LAY PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THEIR OWN HAPPINESS AND IT APPLIES TO SCHOLARS THINKING ABOUT HAPPINESS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT WE'RE JUST AS MESSED UP AS ANYBODY ELSE IS THE FIRST OF THESE TRAPS IS A RELUCTANCE TO ADMIT COMPLEXITY IT TURNS OUT THAT THE WORD HAPPINESS IS JUST NOT A USEFUL WORD ANY MORE BECAUSE WE APPLY IT TO TOO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK TH BUT BY AND LARGE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP AND WE WILL HAVE TO ADOPT A MORE COMPLICATED VIEW OF WHAT WELL BEING IS THE SECOND TRAP IS A CONFUSION BETWEEN EXPERIENCE IN MEMORY BASICALLY IT'S BETWEEN BEING HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE AND BEING HAPPY ABOUT YOUR LIFE OR HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE AND THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT CONCEPTS AND THEY ARE BOTH LUMPED IN THE NOTION OF HAPPINESS AND IT'S THE UNFORTUNATE FACT BUT WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT AFFECTS WELL-BEING WITHOUT DISTORTING ITS IMPORTANCE. I MEAN THIS IS A REAL COGNITIVE TRAP THERE IS JUST NO WAY OF GETTING IT RIGHT. NOW I'D LIKE TO START WITH AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY WHO HAD A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION AFTER ONE OF MY LECTURES REPORTED A STORY AND THAT WAS THE STORY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN LISTENING TO A SYMPHONY AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS MUSIC AND AT THE VERY END OF There was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added, really quite emotionally, it ruined the whole experience but it hadn't. What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. He had had the experience, he had had twenty minutes of glorious music. They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory, the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had got to keep. What this is telling us really is that we... AND BE THINKING OF OURSELVES AND OF OTHER PEOPLE IN TERMS OF TWO SELVES THERE IS AN EXPERIENCING SELF WHO LIVES IN THE PRESENT AND KNOWS THE PRESENT IT'S CAPABLE OF RELIVING THE PAST BUT BASICALLY IT HAS ONLY THE PRESENT IT'S THE EXPERIENCING SELF THAT THE DOCTOR APPROACHES YOU KNOW WHEN THE DOCTOR ASKS DOES IT HURT NOW WHEN I TOUCH YOU HERE AND THEN THERE IS A REMEMBERING SELF AND THE REMEMBERING SELF IS THE ONE THAT KEEP SCORE AND MAINTAINS THE STORY OF OUR LIFE AND IT'S THE ONE THAT THE DOCTOR APPROACHES IN ASKING THE QUESTION HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LATELY OR HOW WAS YOUR TRIP TO ALBANIA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT ENTITIES THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND THE REMEMBERING SELF AND GETTING CONFUSED BETWEEN THEM IS PART OF THE MISSES ABOUT THE NOTION OF HAPPINESS NOW THE REMEMBERING SELF IS A STORY TELLER AH0 N D DH AE1 T R IH1 L IY0 S T AA1 R T S W IH0 DH AH0 B EY1 S IH0 K sil R IH0 S P AA1 N S AH1 V AW1 R M EH1 M ER0 IY0 IH0 T S T AA1 R T S IH0 M IY1 D IY0 AH0 T L IY0 W IY1 D OW1 N T sil OW1 N L IY0 T EH1 L S T AO1 R IY0 Z W EH1 N W IY1 S EH1 T AW1 T T AH0 T EH1 L S T AO1 R IY0 Z sil AA1 R M EH PAH01 N F AH0 L W EH1 N DH IH0 S EH1 K S sil HH W EH1 N DH IH0 S S T AH1 D IY0 W AH1 Z R AH1 N IH0 N DH AH0 N AY1 N IY1 N T IY0 N AY1 N T IY0 Z sil DH EY1 AA1 R AE1 S T T UW1 R IY0 P AO1 R T AA1 N DH EH1 R P EY1 N ER0 EH1 V R IY0 S IH1 K S T IY0 S EH1 K AH0 N D Z sil AE1 N D HH IY1 R AA1 R T UW1 P PATIENTS THINK THEY SUFFERED AND HERE IS A SURPRISE AND THE SURPRISE IS THAT PATIENT A HAD A MUCH WORSE MEMORY OF THE COLONOSCOPY THAN PATIENT B THE STORIES OF THE COLONOSCOPHIES WERE DIFFERENT AND BECAUSE A VERY CRITICAL PART OF A STORY IS HOW IT ENDS AND NEITHER OF THESE STORIES IS VERY INSPIRING OR GREAT BUT ONE OF THEM IS DISTINCTLY WORSE THAN THE OTHER The one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end. It's a bad story. How do we know that? Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for A than for B in memory. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the point of view of the experiencing self, clearly B had a worse time. NOW WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH PATIENT A AND WE ACTUALLY RAN CLINICAL EXPERIMENTS AND IT HAS BEEN DONE AND IT DOES WORK YOU COULD ACTUALLY EXTEND THE COLONOSCOPY OF PATIENT A BY JUST KEEPING THE TUBE IN WITHOUT JIGGLING IT TOO MUCH THAT WILL THAT WILL CAUSE THE PATIENT TO SUFFER BUT JUST A LITTLE AND MUCH LESS THAN BEFORE AND IF YOU DO THAT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU HAVE MADE THE EXPERIENCING SELF OF PATIENT A WORSE OFF Making the remembering self of patient A a lot better off because now you have endowed patient A with a better story about his experience. What defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up. What defines a story is changes, significant moments and endings. Endings are very, very important. YOU KNOW, THE ENDING DOMINATES IT. NOW THE EXPERIENCING SELF LIVES ITS LIFE CONTINUOUSLY. IT HAS MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE, ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND YOU CAN ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MOMENTS AND THE ANSWER IS REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD. THEY ARE LOST FOREVER. MEAN MOST OF THE MOMENTS OF OUR LIFE AND I CALCULATED YOU KNOW, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESENT IS SAID TO BE ABOUT THREE SECONDS LONG THAT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW, IN A L A THOUSAND, MOST OF THEM DON'T LEAVE A TRACE, MOST OF THEM ARE COMPLETELY IGNORED BY THE REMEMBERING SELF AND YET SOMEHOW YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THEY SHOULD COUNT THAT WHAT HAPPENS DURING THESE MOMENTS OF EXPERIENCE IS OUR LIFE IT'S THE FINITE RESOURCE THAT WE ARE SPENDING WHILE WE ARE ON THIS EARTH AND HOW TO SPEND IT WOULD SEEM TO BE RELEVANT BUT THAT IS NOT THE STORY THAT THAT REMEMBERING SELF KEEPS FOR US SO WE HAVE A G The biggest difference between remembering self and experiencing self is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing self, if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation. That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. For the remembering self, the two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation. Because there are no new memories added. You have not changed the story. And in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes our remembering self from our experiencing self. Time has very little impact on the story. Now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions. Because if you have a patient who has had say two cerebral aneurysms, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes our remembering self from our experiencing self. Time has very little impact on the story. Now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions. Because if you have a patient who has had say two cerebral aneurysms, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes our remembering self from our experiencing self. Time has Experiencing self has no voice in this choice. We actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally, we think of our memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally, we think of our memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally, we think of our memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally, we think of our memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally, we think of our memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our EXPERIENCES WE THINK OF OUR FUTURE AS ANTICIPATED MEMORIES AND BASICALLY YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW AS A TYRANNY OF THE REMEMBERING SELF AND YOU CAN THINK OF THE REMEMBERING SELF SORT OF DRAGGING THE EXPERIENCING SELF THROUGH EXPERIENCES THAT THE EXPERIENCING SELF DOESN'T NEED I HAVE THAT SENSE THAT WHEN WE GO ON VACATIONS THIS IS VERY FREQUENTLY THE CASE THAT IS THAT IT'S WE WE GO ON VACATIONS TO A VERY LAR OUR REMEMBERING SELF AND THIS IS A BIT HARD TO JUSTIFY I THINK. I MEAN HOW MUCH DO WE CONSUME OUR MEMORIES THAT IS ONE OF THE EXPLANATIONS THAT IS GIVEN FOR THE DOMINANCE OF THE REMEMBERING SELF AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT I THINK ABOUT A VACATION WE HAD IN ANTARCTICA A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH WAS CLEARLY THE BEST VACATION I HAVE EVER HAD AND I THINK OF IT RELATIVELY OFTEN RELATIVE TO HOW MUCH I THINK OF OTHER VACATION TRIP, I WOULD SAY FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS NOW YOU KNOW IF I HAD EVER OPENED THE FOLDER WITH THE SIX HUNDRED PICTURES IN IT I WOULD HAVE SPENT ANOTHER HOUR NOW THAT IS THREE WEEKS AND THAT IS AT MOST AN HOUR AND A HALF THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCREPANCY NOW I MAY BE A BIT EXTREME, YOU KNOW, IN HOW LITTLE APPETITE I HAVE FOR CONSUMING MEMORIES BUT EVEN IF YOU DO MORE OF THIS THERE IS A GENU DO WE PUT SO MUCH WEIGHT ON MEMORY RELATIVE TO THE WEIGHT THAT WE PUT ON EXPERIENCES? SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IMAGINE THAT FOR YOUR NEXT VACATION YOU KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE VACATION ALL YOUR PICTURES WILL BE DESTROYED AND YOU'LL GET AN AMNESIC DRUG SO THAT YOU WON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING NOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE THE SAME VACATION? DIFFERENT VACATION THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN YOUR TWO CELLS AND YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADJUDICATE THAT CONFLICT AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT AT ALL OBVIOUS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF TIME THEN YOU GET ONE ANSWER AND IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF OF MEMORIES YOU MIGHT GET ANOTHER ANSWER WHY DO WE PICK THE VACATIONS WE DO IS A PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTS US YOU KNOW WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN THE TWO CELLS NOW The two selves bring up two notions of happiness. There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per self. So you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life. And there are happinesses for moments, as a fairly complicated process. What are the emotions that can be measured. And by the way, now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea. The idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self, it's a completely different thing. This is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is. When that person thinks about her life, very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being who have been.

We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like, spending time with people that we like. There are other pleasures, but this is dominant. So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things the bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute. FOR WELL-BEING IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOTION. NOW VERY QUICKLY ANOTHER REASON WE CANNOT THINK STRAIGHT ABOUT HAPPINESS IS THAT WE DO NOT ATTEND TO THE SAME THINGS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LIFE AND WE ACTUALLY LIVE SO IF YOU ASK THE SIMPLE QUESTION OF HOW HAPPY PEOPLE ARE IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO THE CORRECT ANSWER. WHEN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION YOU THINK PEOPLE MUST BE HAPPIER IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU DON' SAY YOU LIVE IN OHIO LAUGHING AND AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIVING IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE THINKING OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PLACES AND THAT CONTRAST SAYS IN CLIMATE. WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT CLIMATE IS NOT VERY IMPORTANT TO THE EXPERIENCING SELF AND IS NOT EVEN VERY IMPORTANT TO THE REFLECTIVE SELF THAT DECIDES HOW HAPPY PEOPLE ARE BUT NOW BECAUSE THE REFLECTIVE SELF IS IN CHARGE YOU MAY END UP, SOME PEOPLE MAY END UP MOVING TO CALIFORNIA AND IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING TO TRACE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA IN THE HOPE OF GETTING HAPPIER WELL THEIR EXPERIENCING SELF IS NOT GOING TO GET HAPPIER WE KNOW THAT BUT ONE THING WILL HAPPEN THEY WILL THINK THEY ARE HAPPIER BECAUSE WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT IT IT THEY'LL BE REMINDED OF HOW HORRIBLE THE W To feel they made the right decision. It is very difficult to think straight about well-being and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is. Thank you. I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING RESOLVE THAT WE FOUND IN THE GALLOP SURVEY IS A NUMBER WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND WE FOUND THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE EXPERIENCING SELF WHEN YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT HOW INCOME HOW FEELINGS VARY WITH INCOME AND IT TURNS OUT THAT BELOW AN INCOME OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AMERICANS AND THAT'S A VERY LARGE SAMPLE OF AMERICANS LIKE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SO IT'S A Six hundred dollars a year. Sixty thousand dollars. Sixty thousand dollars a year. People are unhappy, and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that, we get an absolutely flat line. I mean, I've really seen lines so flat. Clearly, what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly in terms of this. The other self, the remembering self, you get a different story. The more money you are, the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions. But, Dani, the whole American endeavor is about, you know, life liberty, the pursuit of happiness. If people took seriously that finding, I mean, it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about, for example, taxation policy and so forth. Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally would take a finding like that seriously? BASICALLY, AND RUN PUBLIC POLICY BASED ON IT. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THERE IS RECOGNITION OF THE ROLE OF HAPPINESS RESEARCH IN PUBLIC POLICY. THE RECOGNITION IS GOING TO BE SLOW IN THE UNITED STATES, NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT IN THE U K, IT IS HAPPENING AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES IT IS HAPPENING PEOPLE ARE RECOGNISING THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE THINKING OF POLICY WHEN OF HAPPINESS, WHEN THEY THINK OF PUBLIC POLICY.

        "answer": "so i 've known a lot of fish in my life i 've loved only two that first one was a it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish flavorful textured meaty a best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability so you could feel good about selling it i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and asked if i 'd speak at an event about the farm 's sustainability absolutely i said here was a company trying to solve what 's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past fifty years we 've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests it 's hard to overstate the destruction ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the salmons swordfish they 've collapsed there was nothing left so for better or for worse aquaculture fish farming is going to be a part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they 're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it 's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna not very sustainable doesn 't taste very good either so here finally was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support them the day before the event i called the head of pr for the company let 's call him don don i said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to sea you you don 't pollute that 's right he said we 're so far out the waste from our fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added we 're basically a world unto ourselves that feed conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business two point five to one great two point five to one what what are you feeding sustainable proteins he said great i said got off the phone and that night i was lying in bed and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event i called don i said don what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said he didn 't know he would ask around well i got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let 's call him don too don i said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets i said chicken pellets he said yeah feathers skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feed i said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking you know two percent well it 's about thirty percent he said i said don what 's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish there there was a long pause on the line and he said there 's just too much chicken in the world i fell out of love with this fish no not because i 'm some self righteous goody two shoes foodie i actually am no i fell out of love with this fish because i swear to god after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken this second fish it 's a different kind of love story it 's the romantic kind the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up ok it came to the table a bright almost shimmering white color the chef had overcooked it like twice over ok amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it 's been overcooked i can 't but this guy can let 's call him miguel actually his name is miguel and no he didn 't cook the fish and he 's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand it he 's a biologist at veta la palma it 's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it 's at the tip of the guadalquivir river until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands they did it by draining the land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well they couldn 't make it work not economically and ecologically it was a disaster killed like ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reversed the flow of water they literally flipped the switch instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish farm bass mullet shrimp eel and in the process miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction the farm 's incredible i mean you 've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland i was there not long ago with miguel he 's an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile dundee okay there we are slogging through the wetlands and i 'm panting and sweating got mud up to my knees and miguel 's calmly conducting a biology lecture here he 's pointing out a rare black shouldered kite now he 's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe it turns out miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish i didn 't know anything about fish i 'm an expert in relationships and then he 's off launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants and don 't get me wrong that was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it 's great but i was in love and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before so i interrupted him i said miguel what makes your fish taste so good he pointed at the algae i know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships it 's amazing but what are your fish eating what 's the feed conversion ratio well he goes on to tell me it 's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they 'd be eating in the wild the plant biomass the phytoplankton the zooplankton it 's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it 's totally self renewing there there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn 't feed its animals later that day i was driving around this property with miguel and i asked him i said for a place that seems so natural unlike like any fish any farm i 'd ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it was as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see that 's success he said look at their bellies pink they 're feasting feasting i was totally confused i said miguel aren 't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds well the last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it more than two hundred and fifty different species it 's become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of europe i said miguel isn 't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he shook his head no he said we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flamingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pinker the belly the better the system okay so let 's review a farm that doesn 't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn 't even be there in the first place they brood in a town a hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm and every evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back they do that because they 're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two no kidding you know i was imagining a march of the penguins thing you know so i looked at miguel i said miguel do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night do they do that for the children he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song he said no they do it because the food 's better you know i didn 't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and i don 't like fish skin i don 't like it seared i don 't like it crispy it 's that acrid tar like flavor i almost never cook with it yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like fish skin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean i mentioned that to miguel and he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it 's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved to soak up impurities and then he added but our water has no impurities okay a farm that doesn 't feed its fish a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators and then i realized when he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the guadalquivir river it 's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water is cleaner than when it entered the system is so healthy it purifies the water so not just a farm that doesn 't feed its animals not just a farm that measures its health health success by the health of its predators but a farm that 's literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic a drop in the ocean i know but i 'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it 's a recipe for the future of good food whether we 're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good but for a lot people that 's a bit too radical we 're not realists us foodies we 're lovers we love farmers markets we love small family farms we talk about local food we eat organic and when you suggest these are the things that will insure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy i love pink flamingos but how are you going to feed the world how are you going to feed the world how are you going to feed the world can i be honest i don 't love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world one billion people will go hungry today one billion that 's more than ever before because of gross inequalities in distribution not tonnage no i don 't love this question because it 's determined the logic of our food system for the last fifty years feed grain to herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked if we 're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be that 's been the motivation it 's been the justification it 's been the business plan of american agriculture we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that 's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible that 's not a business and it isn 't agriculture our bread basket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land not by pumps but by fresh water not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea want to feed the world let 's start by asking how are we going to feed ourselves or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself to do that don 't look at the agribusiness model for the future it 's really old and it 's tired it 's high on capital chemistry and machines and it 's never produced anything really good to eat instead let 's look to the ecological model that 's the one that relies on two billion years of on the job experience farms that aren 't worlds unto themselves farms that restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships because they 're the ones that are experts in flavor too and if i 'm going to be really honest they 're a better chef than i 'll ever be you know i 'm okay with that because if that 's the future of good food it 's going to be delicious thank you",

ABSOLUTELY I SAID HERE IS A COMPANY TRYING TO SOLVE WHAT'S BECOME THIS UNIMAGINABLE PROBLEM FOR US CHEFS HOW DO WE KEEP FISH ON OUR MENUS FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE BEEN FISHING THE SEAS LIKE WE CLEAR CUT FORESTS IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE Large fish, the ones we love, the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish they've collapsed. There's almost nothing left. So for better or worse aquaculture, fish farming it's gonna be part of our future. A lot of arguments against it, fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient. Take tuna, a major drawback. It's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one. That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farmed tuna.

I met mister aires in two thousand and eight, two years ago at a disney concert hall. He had just heard a performance of beethoven's first and fourth symphonies and came backstage and introduced himself when speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of beethoven's fourth symphony. And we got talking about music and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. Now I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life but as a result now he is prone to these psychotic episodes the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding. AND THEN DISAPPEARING FOR DAYS WANDERING THE STREETS OF SKID ROW EXPOSED TO ITS HORRORS WITH THE TORMENT OF HIS OWN MIND UNLEASHED UPON HIM AND NATHANIEL WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF AGITATION WHEN WE STARTED OUR FIRST LESSON AT WALT DISNEY CONCERT HALL HE HAD A KIND OF MANIC GLINT IN HIS EYES HE WAS LOST AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT INVISIBLE DEMONS AND SMOKE AND HOW SOMEONE WAS POISONING HIM IN HIS SLEEP AND I AFRAID NOT FOR MYSELF BUT I WAS AFRAID THAT I WAS GOING TO LOSE HIM THAT HE WAS GOING TO SINK INTO ONE OF HIS STATES AND THAT I WOULD RUIN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VIOLIN IF I STARTED TALKING ABOUT SCALES AND ARPEGGIOS AND OTHER EXCITING FORMS OF DYNAMIC VIOLIN PEDAGOGY SO I JUST STARTED PLAYING AND I PLAYED THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE BEETHOVEN VIOLIN CONCERTO AND AS I PLAYED I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A PROFOUND CHANGE OCCURRING IN N It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical, a chemical reaction for which my playing the music was its catalyst. Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, acquired quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin and started to play by ear certain snatches of music. We started talking about music from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Brooklyn, all the bees from Bartok, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen. And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music but he related to this music at a personal level. He spoke about it with a kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through SAYING MUSIC AND TALKING ABOUT MUSIC THIS MAN HAD TRANSFORMED FROM THE PARANOID DISTURBED MAN THAT I'D JUST COME FROM WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES TO THE CHARMING AEOIDOTE BRILLIANT JULIAR TRAINED MUSICIAN MUSIC IS MEDICINE MUSIC CHANGES US AND FOR NATHANIEL MUSIC IS SANITY BECAUSE MUSIC ALLOWS HIM TO TAKE HIS THOUGHTS AND DELUSIONS AND SHAPE IT TEEM THRO UH HH IH1 Z IH0 M AE2 JH AH0 N EY1 SH AH0 N AE1 N D HH IH1 Z K R IY0 AE1 T IH0 V IH2 T IY0 IH1 N T UW0 R IY2 AE1 L AH0 T IY2 sil AE1 N D DH AE1 T IH1 Z AH0 N IH0 S K EY1 P sil F ER0 M HH IH1 Z S T AO1 R M EH2 N T IH0 D S T EY1 T sil AE1 N D AY1 AH2 N D ER0 S T UH1 D DH AH0 T DH IH0 S W Makes us and moves us, inspires and unites us. And for Nathaniel, music brought him back into a fold of friends, the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we are at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row because he reminds me why. I became a musician. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. Thank you.

        "answer": "several years ago here at ted peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge and the idea 's pretty simple teams of four have to build the tallest free standing structure out of twenty sticks of spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow the marshmallow has to be on top and though it seems really simple it 's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly and so i thought that this was an interesting idea and i incorporated it into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then i 've conducted about seventy design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the ctos of the fortune fifty and there 's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and i 'd like to share some of them with you so normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task they talk about it they figure out what it 's going to look like they jockey for power then they spend some time planning organizing they sketch in they lay out spaghetti they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures and then finally just as they 're running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and they stand back and ta da they admire their work but what really happens most of the time is that the ta da turns into an uh oh because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so there are a number of people who have a lot more uh oh moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school they lie they cheat they get distracted and they produce really lame structures and of course there are teams that have a lot more ta da structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten and it 's pretty amazing as peter tells us not only do do they produce the tallest structures but they 're the most interesting structures of them all so the question you want to ask is how come why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of this none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti inc right they don 't time spend time jockeying for power but there 's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan right and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens it 's a crisis sound familiar right ok what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes successive prototypes always keeping the marshmallow on top so they have multiple times to to fix ill built prototypes along the way so designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process and with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn 't work so the capacity to play in prototype is is really essential but let 's look at how different teams perform so the average for most people is around twenty inches business schools students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that kindergarteners better than most adults who does the very best architects and engineers thankfully and thirty nine inches is the tallest structure i i 've seen and why is it because they understand triangles and self re enforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building self reinforce stable structures so ceos a little bit better than average but here 's where it gets interesting if you put in an executive admin on the team they get significantly better terrible you know you look around you go oh that team 's going to win you can just tell beforehand and why is that because they have specials skills of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and pays a close attention to to work will significantly improve the team 's performance specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination leads to to strong success if you have ten teams that typically perform you 'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures and i i tried something interesting i thought let 's up the ante once so i offered a ten thousand dollar prize of software to the winning team so what do you think happened to these design students what was the result here 's what happened not one team had a standing structure not one had a a if anyone had built say a one inch structure they could have taken home the prize so isn 't it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact we did the exercise again with the same students what do you think happened then so now they understand the value of prototyping so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time so there 's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge and the reason is i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly every project has its own marshmallow doesn 't it the challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and those of you who are interested may want to go to marshmallowchallenge dot com it 's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows there 's step by step instructions on this there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system there 's world records on this as well and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand and sometimes a little prototype of

        "model_prediction": "Several years ago here at ted, peter skilman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge and the idea is pretty simple. teams of four have to build the tallest freestanding structure out of twenty sticks of spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow. the marshmallow has to be on top and though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly and so i thought this was an interesting idea and i incorporated it into a design workshop AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS AND SINCE THEN I'VE CONDUCTED ABOUT SEVENTY DESIGN WORKSHOPS ACROSS THE WORLD WITH STUDENTS AND DESIGNERS AND ARCHITECTS EVEN THE CTOs OF THE FORTUNE FIFTY AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EXERCISE THAT REVEALS VERY DEEP LESSONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF COLLABORATION AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THEM WITH YOU SO NORMALLY MOST PEOPLE BEGIN BY ORIENTING THEMSELVES TO THE TASK THEY TALK ABOUT IT THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT IT' THEN THEY SPEND SOME TIME PLANNING ORGANIZING THEY SKETCH IN THEY LAY OUT SPAGHETTI THEY SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME ASSEMBLING THE STICKS INTO EVER GROWING STRUCTURES AND THEN FINALLY JUST AS THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SOMEONE TAKES OUT THE MARSHMALLOW AND THEN THEY GINGERLY PUT IT ON TOP AND THEY STAND BACK AND TADA THEY ADMIRE THEIR WORK BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS MOST OF THE TIME IS THAT THE TADA TURNS INTO AN OH OH BECAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE MARSHMALLOW CA Structure to buckle and to collapse. so there are a number of people who have a lot more uh oh moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school. they lie, they cheat, they get distracted, they've and they produce really lame structures and of course there's teams that have a lot more tada structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten and it's pretty amazing as peter tells us not only do they produce the tallest structures but they're the most interesting structures Of them all. so the question you want to ask is how come why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of the none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti inc. they don't time spend time joking for power but there's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on top they run out of time and what happens is it's a crisis sound familiar right okay What kindergartners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes. Successive prototypes always keeping the marshmallow on top. So they have multiple times to to fix in and build prototypes along the way. So designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process and with each version, kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. So the capacity to play and prototype is really essential. But let's look at how different teams perform. So the average for prototyping is really essential. But let's look at how different teams perform. So the average for prototyping is really essential. But let's look at how different teams perform. So the average for prototyping is really essential. But let's look at how different teams perform. People is around twenty inches, business school students about half of that, lawyers a little better but not much better than that, kindergartners better than most adults. who does the very best architects and engineers, thankfully and thirty nine inches is the tallest structure i've seen. and why is it because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometric patterns or the key to building self-reinforcing stable structures. so ceos, a little bit better than average, but here's where things get really interesting. It's interesting. If you put an executive admin on the team, they get significantly better. You know, you look around, you go, oh, that team's going to win. You can just tell beforehand. And why is that? Because they have specialized skills of facilitation. They manage the process. They understand the process. And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance. Specialized skills and facilitation skills. The combination leads to strong success. If you have ten teams that typically perform, you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. and i i tried something interesting. i thought, let's up the ante once. so i offered a ten thousand dollar prize of software to the winning team. so what do you think happened to these designed students? what was the result? well, here's what happened. not one team had a standing structure. not one had a one inch structure. if anyone had built, say, a one inch structure, they would have taken the prize. so Isn't it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact? we did the exercise again with the same students. what do you think happened then? so now they understand the value of prototyping. so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best. they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time. so there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. so you might ask, why would anyone actually spend time running a marshmallow? CHALLENGE AND THE REASON IS I HELP CREATE DIGITAL TOOLS AND PROCESSES TO HELP TEAMS BUILD CARS AND VIDEO GAMES AND VISUAL EFFECTS AND WHAT THE MARSHMALLOW CHALLENGE DOES IS IT HELPS THEM IDENTIFY THE HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY EVERY PROJECT HAS ITS OWN MARSHMALLOW THAT THE CHALLENGE PROVIDES A SHARED EXPERIENCE A COMMON LANGUAGE A COMMON STANCE TO BUILD THE RIGHT PROTOTYPE AND SO THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS SO SIMPLE EXER interested in going to marshmallow challenge dot com. it's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows or step-by-step instructions on this. there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system. there's world records that are on this as well. and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport. it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking, our feeling, and our doing to the challenge. That we have at hand. and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an oh-oh moment to a tada moment and that can make a big difference. thank you very much."

        "answer": "let 's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool ted ish machine and it 's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are and i wonder what you 'd choose because i 've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don 't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idol i don 't know i 'm i 'm convinced that there 's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i 'm not part of that crowd i have to say i don 't want to go back and it 's not because i 'm adventurous it 's because possibilities on this planet they don 't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward this is the greatest time there 's ever been on this planet by any measure you wish to choose health wealth mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there 's never been a time like this my great grandparents died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents are closing in on eighty so i 've there 'd better be there 'd better be a nine at the beginning of my death number but it 's not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago think about that it 's an incredible fact and why is it true smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it 's gone it 's vanished we vanquished it puff in the rich world diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out seeing if it works changing it when it doesn 't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that 's the good news unfortunately that 's all the good news because there 's some other problems and they 've been mentioned many times and one of them is that despite all our accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day that number 's rising and it 's rising really rapidly and it 's disgraceful and not only that we 've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforest oil gas they 're going away and they 're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we 're going away too so the question is can we do that and i i think we can i think it 's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn 't also destroy it i really do believe that and no it ain 't wishful thinking but here 's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we 've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we 've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we 're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields and yet i actually think we 'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we fought about these things more vigorously on on more fronts than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can 't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen everyone 's entitled to their opinion they 're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you 're not entitled to you 're not entitled to your own facts sorry you 're not and this took me awhile to figure out about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history i didn 't know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so i wrote a story about that too and i couldn 't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature 's ground but you know i do what i do i wrote the story i moved on i mean i 'm a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it 's fine but these stories bothered me and i couldn 't figure out why and eventually i did and that 's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren 't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people they were exactly like the people in this room and it it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let 's be honest we 're at a point in this world where we don 't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress okay there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we 've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there 's no reason we shouldn 't have you can just say a few names and people will understand chernobyl bhopal the challenger vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads i mean you know you can choose your list there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right so be skeptical ask questions demand proof demand evidence don 't take anything for granted but here 's the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we 're not that good at doing that and the reason that i can say that is because we 're now in an epidemic of fear like one i 've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles mumps and rubella vaccine shot very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it 's a serious issue the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all it doesn 't matter it doesn 't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real we don 't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i i do understand that i think we all do but you know what the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here 's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it 's horrible and what kind what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now i understand it i do understand it because does anyone have measles here has one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles doesn 't happen very much doesn 't happen in this country at all but it happened a hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that 's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour but since it didn 't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jenny mccarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live and they can do it because they don 't link causation and correlation they don 't understand that these things seem the same but they 're almost never the same and it 's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy was a hero jonas salk he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio puff gone that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul offit he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it 's save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it 's good except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so paul 's a terrorist when paul speaks in a public hearing he can 't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school and why because paul made a vaccine i don 't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that 's happening we have measles in this country now and it 's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it 's just a numbers game and they 're not just going to die of measles what about polio let 's have that why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought i was a little strident no one 's ever said that before she wasn 't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine why because we don 't have polio and you know what we didn 't have polio in this country yesterday today i don 't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he 's flying to lax right now he 's over ohio and he 's going to land in a couple hours he 's going to rent a car and he 's going to come to long beach and he 's going to attend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesn 't know that he 's infected with a paralytic disease and we don 't either because that 's the way the world works that 's the planet we live on don 't pretend it isn 't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning echinacea echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going i know you did because half of americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn 't matter how often we find out that they 're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that it 's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for dark urine i 'm totally with you dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well i think i understand we hate big pharma we hate big government we don 't trust the man and we shouldn 't our health care system sucks it 's cruel to millions of people it 's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul bending to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo that 's fantastic i love big placebo but you know it 's not it 's it 's it 's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and i have all sorts of little props here none of it ginkgo fraud echinacea fraud acai i don 't even know what that is but we 're spending billions of dollars on it it 's fraud and you know what when i say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it 's it 's it makes them feel good and you know what you 're wrong because i don 't care if it 's the secretary of h h s who 's saying hmm i 'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on the mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science you end up in a place you don 't want to be you end up in thabo mbeki south africa he killed four hundred thousand of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of aids hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don 't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now the most mindless epidemic we 're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it 's an idiotic debate it has to stop it 's a debate about words about metaphors it 's ideology it 's not science every single thing we eat every grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there weren 't tangerines in the garden of eden there wasn 't any cantaloupe there weren 't christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years and some of it worked and some of it didn 't we got rid of the stuff that didn 't now we can do it in a more precise way and there are risks absolutely but we can put something like vitamin a into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives you don 't want to do that i i have to say i don 't understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things i constantly hear are too many chemicals pesticides hormones monoculture we don 't want giant fields of the same thing that 's wrong we don 't want companies patenting life we don 't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes you 're right let 's fix it it 's true we 've got a huge food problem but this isn 't science this has nothing to do with science it 's law it 's morality it 's patent stuff you know science isn 't a company it 's not a country it 's not even an idea it 's a process it 's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn 't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we 're afraid is really very deadening and it 's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next fifty years we 're going to have to grow seventy percent more food than we do right now seventy percent this is investment in africa over the last thirty years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we 're not giving it to them and why genetically engineered food we don 't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance cassava 's something that half a billion people eat it 's kind of like a potato it 's just a bunch of calories it sucks it doesn 't have nutrients it doesn 't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now and then people would be able to eat it and they 'd be able to not go blind they wouldn 't starve and you know what that would be nice it wouldn 't be chez panisse but it would be nice and all i can say about this is why are we fighting it why i mean let 's ask ourselves why are we fighting it because we don 't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it 's not about chemicals it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food this isn 't about rice krispies this is about keeping people alive and it 's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don 't if we continue to act the way we 're acting we 're guilty of something that i don 't think we want to be guilty of high tech colonialism there 's no other way to describe what 's going on here it 's selfish it 's ugly it 's beneath us and we really have to stop it so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say so you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward and absolutely absolutely i do it 's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it and we 're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we 're going to be happy we do i know that we can and as far as i 'm concerned that 's something the world needs right now

To those of us who can even afford it. so we run away from it and where do we run? we leap into the arms of a big placebo. that's fantastic. i love big placebo. but you know it's not it's it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and i have all sorts of little props here none of it. ginkgo fraud acai i don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it it's fraud and you know what when i say this stuff people scream Me, and they say, what do you care? let people do what they want to do. it's, it makes me feel good. and you know what? you're wrong. because i don't care if it's the secretary of hhss who's saying, huh, i'm not gonna take the evidence of my experts on mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas. when you start down the road where belief in magic replaces evidence and science, you end up in a place you don't want to be. you end up in taboo and becky's south africa. africa. he killed four hundred thousand of his people by insisting that beetroot, garlic, and lemon oil were much more effective than the anti-retroviral drugs we know can slow the course of aids hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are, there always are now the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between Proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite, it's an idiotic debate. it has to stop. it's a debate about words, about metaphors. it's ideology. it's not science. every single thing we eat, every grain of rice, every sprig of parsley, every brussels sprout has been modified by man. you know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of eden. there wasn't canola. there weren't christmas trees. we made it all. we made it over the last eleven thousand years. some of it worked, and some of it didn't. we got rid of the stuff that didn't. now we can do it in a more precise way. and there are risks, absolutely. but we can put something like vitamin a into rice, and that stuff can help millions of people. millions of people prolong their lives. you don't want to do that? i have to say, i don't understand it. we object to genetically engineered food. why do we do that? well, the things i constantly hear are too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones. Monoculture. We don't want giant fields of the same thing. It's wrong. We don't want companies patenting life. We don't want companies owning seeds. And you know what my response to all of that is? Yes, you're right. Let's fix it. It's true. We've got a huge food problem. But this isn't science. This is nothing to do with science. It's law. It's morality. It's patent stuff. You know, science isn't a company. It's not a country. It's not even an idea. It's a process. And sometimes it's a process. And sometimes it's a process. And sometimes it's a process. And sometimes it's a process. And sometimes it's a process. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid is really very deadening and it's preventing millions of people from prospering. You know, in the next fifty years, we're going to have to grow seventy percent more food than we do right now. Seventy percent. This is investment in Africa over the last thirty years. Disgraceful. Disgraceful. They need it and we're not giving it to them. And why? Medically engineered food. we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff. like ketchup, for instance. ketchup is something that half a billion people eat. it's kind of like a potato. it's just a bunch of calories. it sucks. it doesn't have nutrients. it doesn't have protein. and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now. and then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind. they wouldn't starve. and you know what? that would be nice. it wouldn't be shepherd's pie, but it would be nice. and all i can say about this is... Is why are we fighting it? why, let's ask ourselves, why are we fighting it? because we don't want to move genes around. this is about moving genes around. it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, our insistence on having bigger food, better food, singular food this isn't about rice crispy's, this is about keeping people alive and it's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don't if we continue to act the way we're acting we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of high tech colonialism. there's no other way to describe what's going on here. it's selfish. it's ugly. it's beneath us and we really have to stop it. so after this amazingly fun conversation, you might want to say, so you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward? and absolutely, absolutely i do. it's stuck in the present right now, but we have an amazing opportunity. we can set that time machine on any thing we want. we can move it where we want. Move it and we're gonna move it where we want to move it. we have to have these conversations and we have to think. but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we're gonna be happy we do. i know that we can and as far as i'm concerned that's something the world needs right now. thank you. thank you."

        "answer": "i 'm going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops won 't grow there will be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can 't support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so the the climate changes will be terrible for them also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time uh really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds we 've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and that 's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make uh modern materials and do so many things and so we 're in a wonderful situation with uh electricity in the rich world but as we make it cheaper and let 's say let 's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets emitted that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather and perhaps worse the indirect effects in that the natural ecosystems can 't adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses now the exact amount of how you map from a a certain increase of co two to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are there 's some uncertainty there but not very much and there 's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists on this several times do we really have to get down to near zero can 't we just you know cut it in half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that 's that 's a big challenge it 's very different than saying you know we 're a twelve feet high truck trying to get under a ten feet bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american it 's about twenty tons uh for people in poor countries it 's less than one ton it 's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it 's been constantly going up it 's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so you 've got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and that 's going to be based on the number of people the services each person 's using on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out per unit of energy so let 's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero uh probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero now and that 's back from high school algebra but let 's let 's take a look first we 've got population now the world today has six point eight billion people that 's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we eat clothing tv heating these are very good things and getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and it 's a great thing for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year this number on average is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and in fact these kids don 't so they 're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps now efficiency e the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something that 's not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizer or how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less and so overall here if we 're optimistic we may get a reduction of a a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of six but for these first three factors now we 've gone from twenty six billion to at best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won 't cut it so let 's look at this fourth factor this is going to be a key one and this is the amount of co two put out per each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal no if you burn natural gas no almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what we 're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i don 't mean something that 's impossible the microprocessor is a miracle the personal computer is a miracle the internet and its services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don 't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually you just kind of stand by and some come along some don 't this is a case where we actually have to drive it full speed and get a miracle in a a pretty tight time line now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab people 's imagination here i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos and somehow people enjoyed that it it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who live with mosquitos so with energy all i could come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fireflies i 'm told they don 't bite in fact they might not even not even leave that jar now there 's all sorts gimmicky solutions like that one but they don 't really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although there 's many directions of people seeking i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers i 've left out tide geothermal fusion biofuels those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here is that we 're going to have to work on each of these five and we can 't give up any of them because they they look daunting because they all have significant challenges let 's look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there seems like it might be simple but it 's not and that 's to take all the co two after you 've burned it going out the flue pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and agreeing on where these co two quantities should be put will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who 's going to be sure who 's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in in terms of nuclear or other things this is a lot of volume so that 's a tough one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing could go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel doesn 't get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste and although it 's not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on the last three of the five i 've grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually although it 's great they don 't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming so you 're talking about many square miles thousands of time more area than than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are intermittent sources the sun doesn 't shine all day it doesn 't shine every day and likewise the wind doesn 't blow all the time and so if you depend on these sources you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it 's not available so we 've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy source is outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and to dimensionalize this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that 's going to be a factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now it 's not it 's not impossible but it 's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the the intermittent source to be above say twenty to thirty percent of what you 're using if you 're counting on it for a hundred percent you need a an incredible miracle battery now how we 're going to go forward on this what 's what 's the right approach is it a manhattan project what 's the the thing that can get us there well we need lots of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least a hundred people and a lot of them you 'll look at and say they 're crazy that 's good and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this bill gross has several companies including one called esolar that has some great solar thermal technologies vinod khosla 's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and i 'm i 'm trying to help back that nathan myhrvold and i actually are backing a company that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that there 's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terrapower is that instead of burning a part of uranium the one percent which is the u two thirty five we decided let 's burn the ninety nine percent the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people had talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it 's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right material 's approach this looks like it would work and because you 're burning that ninety nine percent you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today 's reactors so instead of worrying about them you just take that it 's a great thing it breathes this uranium as it goes along so it 's kind of like a candle you can see it 's it 's a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel this really solves the problem i 've got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over the ninety nine percent where they 've taken out the part they burn now so it 's called depleted uranium that would power the u s for hundreds of years and simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process you 'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so you know it 's got lots lots of challenges ahead but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward so let 's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let 's go out to where we really need to get and and then look at the intermediate for twenty fifty you 've heard many people talk about this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation altogether so the other grade is are we deploying this zero emission technology have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we 're in the process of of getting it elsewhere that 's super important that 's a key element of making that report card so backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like well it again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that sum will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there doing things that don 't get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed there 's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david mckay book sustainable energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this there 's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it 's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i could pick who 's president i could pick a vaccine which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that 's half the cost with no co two gets invented this is the wish i would pick this is the one with the greatest impact if we don 't get this wish the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible between u s and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and and drive we need to go for more research funding when countries get together in places like copenhagen they shouldn 't just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and you 'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives co two tax cap and trade something that gets that price signal out there we need to get the message out we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you thank you thank you thank you just so i understand more about about terrapower right i mean first of all what can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is to to actually do the software buy the supercomputer hire all the great scientists which we 've done that 's only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then you 'll only be up in the hundreds of millions the tough thing is building the pilot reactor finding the several billion finding the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these once you get the first one built if it works as advertised then it 's just clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know it and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium and then and then and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down that 's right today you 're always refueling the reactor so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing where you 're opening it up and moving things in and out that 's that 's not good so if you have very very cheap fuel that you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and and then it 's done it 's a it 's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution yeah well what happens with the waste you can you can let it sit there there 's a lot less waste under this approach then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that and and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today that 's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors that 's our fuel to begin with so the thing that 's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours and you 're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you 're going through this process but in your talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where where is there most interest in actually doing something with this well we haven 't uh picked a particular place uh and there 's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that 's called nuclear so we we we 've got a lot of interest that people from the company have been in russia india china i 've been back seeing the secretary of energy here talking about how this fits into the the energy agenda so i 'm optimistic you know the french and japanese have done some work this is a a variant on something that has been done it 's an important advance but it 's like a fast reactor and a lot of countries have built them so anybody who 's done a fast reactor is a candidate to to be where the first one gets built so in in your mind timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live well we need for one of these high scale electro electro generation things that 's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy that 's sort of the deadline that the environment models environmental models have have have shown us that we have to meet and you know terrapower if things go well which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that and there are fortunately now dozens of companies we need it to be hundreds who likewise if their science goes well if the funding for their pilot pilot plants goes well that they they can compete for this and it 's best if multiple succeed because then you could use a mix a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed in terms of big scale possible game changes is this the biggest that you 're aware of out there an energy breakthrough is the the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental constraint but the environmental constraint just makes it so much so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators you know we don 't know their work as well as we know this one but the modular people that 's a different approach there 's a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard but maybe they say that about us and so there there are different ones but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of say coal and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprint and cost the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is almost in a class of its own if this doesn 't work then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable yeah if you get into that situation it 's like if you 've you 've been over eating and you 're about to have a heart attack you know then then then where do you go you may need heart surgery or something there is a line of research on what 's called geoengineering which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together now you hope that 's just an insurance policy you hope you don 't need to do that some people say you shouldn 't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy that you 'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you i 'm not sure that 's wise given the importance of the problem but there 's now the the geoengineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect climate skeptics if you had a a sentence or two to say to them how how might you persuade them that they 're wrong well unfortunately the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who make scientific arguments are very few you know are they saying there 's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things there are very very few things that they can even say you know there 's a chance in a million of those things the main problem we have here is kind of like aids you make the mistake now and you pay for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later and a somewhat uncertain pain thing in fact the ipcc report you know that that 's not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say okay you know that that isn 't that big of a deal the fact is it 's that uncertain part that should move us towards this but my dream here is that if you can make it economic and meet the co two constraints then the skeptics say okay i don 't care that it doesn 't put out co two i kind of wish it did put out co two but i guess i 'll accept it because it 's cheaper than what 's come before so is that would be your response to the the the bjorn lomborg argument that basically if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co two problem it 's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth it 's it 's it 's a stupid waste of the earth 's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do yeah well the actual spending on the r and d piece you know say the u s should spend ten billion a year more than it is right now it 's not that dramatic it shouldn 't take away from other things the thing you get into big money on and this reasonable people can disagree is when you have something that 's non economic and you 're trying to fund that that to me mostly is a waste unless you 're very close and you 're just funding the learning curve and it 's going to get very cheap i believe we should try you know more things that have a potential to be far less expensive if the trade off you get into is let 's make energy super super expensive then the rich can afford that i mean all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle the disaster is for that two billion and even lomborg has changed his shtick now is why isn 't the r and d getting more discussed he he 's still because of his earlier stuff further associated with the skeptic camp but he 's realized that 's that 's a pretty lonely camp and so he 's making the r and d point and and so there is a a a thread of something that i i think is appropriate the r and d piece it 's crazy how little it 's funded well bill i suspect i i speak on the behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much thank you",

In fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting WORSE MEANS THAT MANY YEARS THEIR CROPS WON'T GROW THERE'LL BE TOO MUCH RAIN NOT ENOUGH RAIN THINGS WILL CHANGE IN WAYS THAT THEIR FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT SIMPLY CAN'T SUPPORT AND THAT LEADS TO SALVATION IT LEADS TO UNCERTAINTY IT LEADS TO REST SO THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGES WILL BE TERRIBLE FOR THEM ALSO THE PRICE OF ENERGY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM IN FACT IF YOU COULD PICK JUST ONE THING TO LOWER THE PRICE OF TO REDUCE POVER BY FAR YOU WOULD PICK ENERGY NOW THE PRICE OF ENERGY HAS COME DOWN OVER TIME REALLY ADVANCED CIVILIZATION IS BASED ON ADVANCES IN ENERGY THE COAL REVOLUTION GIULED THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND EVEN IN THE NINETEEN HUNDRED S WE'VE SEEN A VERY RAPID DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY THAT'S WHY WE HAVE REFRIGERATORS AIR CONDITIONING WE CAN MAKE MODERN MATERIALS AND DO SO MANY THINGS AND SO WE'RE IN A A WONDERFUL SITUATION WITH ELECTRICITY IN THE RICH WORLD BUT AS WE MAKE IT CHEAPER AND LET'S SAY LET'S GO FOR MAKING IT TWICE AS CHEAP WE NEED TO MEET A NEW CONSTRAINT AND THAT CONSTRAINT HAS TO DO WITH C O TWO C O TWO IS WARMING THE PLANET AND THE EQUATION ON C O TWO IS ACTUALLY A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE IF YOU SUM UP THE C O TWO THERE IS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE IF YOU SUM UP THE C O TWO THERE IS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD ON THAT GETS EMITTED THAT LEADS TO A TEMPERATURE INCREASE AND THAT TEMPERATURE INCREASE LEADS TO SOME VERY NEGATIVE EFFECTS THE EFFECTS ON THE WEATHER PERHAPS WORSE THE INDIRECT EFFECTS IN THAT THE NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS CAN'T ADJUST TO THESE RAPID CHANGES AND SO YOU GET ECOSYSTEM COLLAPSES NOW THE EXACT AMOUNT OF HOW YOU MAP FROM A CERTAIN INCREASE IN CO2 TO WHAT TEMPERATURE WILL BE AND WHERE THE POSITIVE FEEDBACKS ARE THERE'S SOME UN NOT VERY MUCH AND THERE'S CERTAINLY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW BAD THOSE EFFECTS WILL BE BUT THEY WILL BE EXTREMELY BAD I ASKED THE TOP SCIENTISTS IN THIS SEVERAL TIMES DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GET DOWN TO NEAR ZERO CAN'T WE JUST KNOCK IT IN HALF OR A QUARTER AND THE ANSWER IS THAT UNTIL WE GET NEAR TO ZERO THE TEMPERATURE WILL CONTINUE TO RISE AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN SA SQUEEZE UNDER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO GET TO ZERO NOW WE PUT OUT A LOT OF CARBON DIOXIDE EVERY YEAR OVER TWENTY SIX BILLION TONS FOR EACH AMERICAN IT'S ABOUT TWENTY TONS FOR PEOPLE IN POOR COUNTRIES IT'S LESS THAN ONE TON IT'S AN AVERAGE ABOUT FIVE TONS FOR EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AND SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES THAT WILL BRING THAT DOWN TO ZERO IT'S BEEN CONSTANTLY GOING UP IT'S ONLY Various economic changes that have even flattened it all. So we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero. This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication. So you've got a thing on the left, C O two, that you want to get to zero. And that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the C O two being put out per. Unit of energy. So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero that's back from high school algebra. But let's let's take a look first we've got population the world today has six point eight billion people that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that. BY PERHAPS TEN OR FIFTEEN PERCENT. BUT THERE WE SEE AN INCREASE OF ABOUT ONE POINT THREE THE SECOND FACTOR IS THE SERVICES WE USE THIS ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING THE FOOD WE EAT CLOTHING TV HEATING THESE ARE VERY GOOD THINGS GETTING RID OF POVERTY MEANS PROVIDING THESE SERVICES TO ALMOST EVERYONE ON THE PLANET AND IT'S A GREAT THING FOR THIS NUMBER TO GO UP IN THE RICH WORLD PERHAPS THE TOP ONE BILLION WE USE PROBABLY COULD CUT BACK AND USE LESS BUT EVERY YEAR THIS NUMBER ON AVERAGE IS GOING TO GO UP AND SO OVERALL THAT WILL MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SERVICES DELIVERED PER PERSON HERE WE HAVE A VERY BASIC SERVICE DO YOU HAVE LIGHTING IN YOUR HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO READ YOUR HOMEWORK AND IN FACT THESE KIDS DON'T SO THEY'RE GOING OUT AND READING THEIR SCHOOLWORK UNDER THE STREET LAMPS NOW EFFICIENCY E, THE ENERGY FOR EACH SERVICE HERE FINALLY W GOING UP THROUGH VARIOUS INVENTIONS AND NEW WAYS OF DOING LIGHTING THROUGH DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARS DIFFERENT WAYS OF BUILDING BUILDINGS THERE ARE A LOT OF SERVICES WHERE YOU CAN BRING THE ENERGY FOR THAT SERVICE DOWN QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY SOME INDIVIDUAL SERVICES EVEN BRING IT DOWN BY NINETY PERCENT THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES LIKE HOW WE MAKE FERTILIZER OR HOW WE DO AIR TRANSPORT WHERE THE ROOMS FOR IMPROVEMENT ARE FAR FAR LESS AND Mythic we may get a reduction of a of a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of six but for these first three factors now we've gone from twenty six billion to at best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just won't cut it so let's look at this fourth factor this is going to be a key one and this is the amount of c o two put out for each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to The speaker is discussing the challenges of creating a sustainable energy system. They mention that burning coal and natural gas are not sustainable and that almost every way we make electricity today is unsustainable. They also mention that the emergence of renewables and nuclear power is a step in the right direction. However, the speaker also notes that creating a truly sustainable energy system at a global scale is a daunting task. They also mention that the term \"miracle\" is often used to describe technological advancements in energy production, but they argue that these advancements are not necessarily miraculous, but rather the result of hard work and innovation. THE INTERNET AND ITS SERVICES ARE A MIRACLE. SO THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE CREATION OF MANY MIRACLES. USUALLY WE DON'T HAVE A DEADLINE WHERE YOU HAVE TO GET THE MIRACLE BY A CERTAIN DATE. USUALLY YOU JUST KIND OF STAND BY AND SOME COME ALONG, SOME DON'T. THIS IS A CASE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DRIVE AT FULL SPEED AND GET A MIRACLE IN A PRETTY TIGHT TIMELINE. NOW I THOUGHT HOW COULD I REALLY CAPT ILLUSTRATION, SOME DEMONSTRATION THAT WOULD GRAB PEOPLE'S IMAGINATION HERE I THOUGHT BACK TO A YEAR AGO WHEN I BROUGHT MOSQUITOES AND SOMEHOW PEOPLE ENJOYED THAT IT REALLY GOT THEM INVOLVED IN THE IDEA OF YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE WITH MOSQUITOES SO WITH ENERGY ALL I COULD COME UP WITH IS THIS I DECIDED THAT RELEASING FIRE FLIES WOULD BE MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT HERE THIS YEAR SO HERE WE HAVE AH SOMETHING AFTER PHYLLOPHAGOUS I'M SURE THEY DON'T BITE IN FACT THEY MIGHT EVEN NOT EVEN LEAVE THAT JAR NOW THERE'S ALL SORTS OF GIMMICKY SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT ONE BUT THEY DON'T REALLY ADD UP TO MUCH WE NEED SOLUTIONS EITHER ONE OR SEVERAL THAT HAVE UNBELIEVABLE SCALE AND UNBELIEVABLE RELIABILITY AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S MANY DIRECTIONS OUR PEOPLE ARE SEEKING I REALLY ONLY SEE F ACHIEVE THE BIG NUMBERS I'VE LEFT OUT TIDE GEOTHERMAL FUSION VIA FUELS THOSE MAY MAKE SOME CONTRIBUTION AND IF THEY CAN DO BETTER THAN I EXPECT SO MUCH THE BETTER BUT MY KEY POINT HERE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON EACH OF THESE FIVE AND WE CAN'T GIVE UP ANY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY LOOK DAUNTING BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES LET'S LOOK FIRST AT THE BURNING Fossil Fuels EITHER BURNING COAL OR BURNING YOU NEED TO DO THERE SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE SIMPLE BUT IT'S NOT AND THAT'S TO TAKE ALL THE C O TWO AFTER YOU BURN IT GOING OUT THE FLU PRESSURIZE IT CREATE A LIQUID PUT IT SOMEWHERE AND HOPE IT STAYS THERE NOW WE HAVE SOME PILOT THINGS THAT DO THIS AT THE SIXTY EIGHTY PERCENT LEVEL BUT GETTING UP TO THAT FULL PERCENTAGE THAT WILL BE VERY TRICKY AND AGREEING ON WHERE THESE C O TWO QUANTITIES SHOULD BE PUT WILL BE HARD Who's gonna be sure, who's gonna guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things. This is a lot of volume. So that's a tough one. Next would be nuclear. It also has three big problems. Costs, particularly in highly regulated countries is high. The issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing can go wrong that even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even though even I HAVE THESE HUMAN OPERATORS THAT THE FUEL DON'T GET USED FOR WEAPONS AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE WASTE ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT VERY LARGE THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THAT PEOPLE NEED TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT SO THREE VERY TUFF PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT BE SOLVABLE AND SO SHOULD BE WORKED ON THE LAST THREE OF THE FIVE I HAVE GROOVED TOGETHER THESE ARE WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN REFER TO AS THE RENEWABLE SOURCES AND THEY ACTUALL SOME DISADVANTAGES ONE IS THAT THE DENSITY OF ENERGY GATHERED IN THESE TECHNOLOGIES IS DRAMATICALLY LESS THAN A POWER PLANT THIS IS ENERGY FARMING SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MANY SQUARE MILES THOUSANDS OF TIMES MORE AREA THAN IT YOU THINK OF AS A NORMAL ENERGY PLANT ALSO THESE ARE INTERMITENT SOURCES THE SUN DOESN'T SHINE ALL DAY IT DOESN'T SHINE EVERY DAY AND LIKEWISE THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW ALL THE TIME SO IF Y To have some way of getting energy during those time periods that it's not available so we've got big cost challenges here we have transmission challenges for example say this energy source is outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem and to dimensionalize this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for PHONES FOR FLASHLIGHTS FOR EVERYTHING AND COMPARE THAT TO THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY THE WORLD USES AND WHAT I FOUND IS THAT ALL THE BATTERIES WE MAKE NOW COULD STORE LESS THAN TEN MINUTES OF ALL THE ENERGY AND SO IN FACT WE NEED A BIG BREAKTHROUGH HERE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE A FACTOR OF A HUNDRED BETTER THAN THE APPROACHES WE HAVE NOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S NOT A VERY EASY THING NOW TRY TO GET THE INTERMITENT SOURCE TO BE ABOVE SAY TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT OF WHAT YOU'RE USING. IF YOU'RE COUNTING ON IT FOR A HUNDRED PERCENT YOU NEED A AN INCREDIBLE MIRACLE BATTERY NOW HOW ARE WE GOING TO GO FORWARD ON THIS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE RIGHT PROCESS IS IT A BANNANHANT PROJECT WHAT'S THE THING THAT CAN GET US THERE WELL WE NEED LOTS OF COMPANIES WORKING ON THIS HUNDREDS IN EACH OF THESE FIVE PATHS WE NEED AT LEAST A H A LOT OF THEM YOU'LL LOOK AT AND SAY THEY'RE CRAZY THAT'S GOOD AND I THINK HERE IN THE TED GROUP WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY PURSUING THIS BILL GROSS HAS SEVERAL COMPANIES INCLUDING ONE CALLED E S O L A R THAT HAS SOME GREAT SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGY VINODE KOLASI IS INVESTING IN DOZENS OF COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING GREAT THINGS AND HAVE INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES AND IM IM TRYING TO HELP BACK THAT There are some innovations in nuclear, modular liquid and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago. So the idea that there are some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. The idea of a terawatt power is that instead of burning the part of uranium the one percent which is the u two thirty five we decided well let's burn the ninety nine percent the u two thirty five. Eighty eight it is kind of a crazy idea and in fact people had talked about it for a long time but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so it's through the advent of modern super computers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right materials approach this looks like it would work and because you're burning at ninety nine percent you have greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the ways AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE AS FUEL ALL THE LEFT OVER WASTE FROM TODAY'S REACTORS. AND SO INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT THEM YOU JUST TAKE THAT IT'S A GREAT THING IT BREEDS THIS URANIUM AS IT GOES ALONG SO IT'S KINDA LIKE THE CANDLE YOU CAN SEE IT'S IT'S A LOG THERE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A TRAVELING WAVE REACTOR IN TERMS OF FUEL THIS REALLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM I'VE GOT A PICTURE HERE OF A PLACE IN KENTUCKY THIS IS CALLED DEPLETED URANIUM THAT WOULD POWER THE US FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND SIMPLY BY FILTERING SEA WATER IN AN INEXPENSIVE PROCESS YOU'D HAVE ENOUGH FUEL FOR THE ENTIRE LIFETIME OF THE REST OF THE PLANET SO YOU KNOW IT'S GOT LOTS LOTS OF CHALLENGES AHEAD BUT IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF IDEAS THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD SO LET'S THINK HOW SHOULD WE MEASURE OURSELVES WHAT SHOULD Well, let's go out to where we really need to get and and then look at the intermediate. For twenty fifty you've heard many people talk about this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries Including countries like China will have had to switch their electricity electricity generation altogether so the other great is are we deploying this zero emission technology have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it out elsewhere that's super important that's a key element of making that report card so backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like well it again it should have the two elements IMPROVEMENTS WE SHOULD GO THROUGH THESE EFFICIENCY MEASURES TO START GETTING REDUCTIONS. THE LESS WE EMIT, THE LESS THAT SUM WILL BE OF CO2 AND THEREFORE THE LESS THE TEMPERATURE. BUT IN SOME WAYS THE GRADE WE GET THERE DOING THINGS THAT DON'T GET US ALL THE WAY TO THE BIG REDUCTIONS IS ONLY EQUALLY OR MAYBE EVEN SLIGHTLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER WHICH IS THE PIECE OF INNOVATION ON THESE BREAKTHROUGHS. THESE BREAK Money, pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed. There's a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book, our choice and the david mckay book, sustainable energy without the hot air. They really go through it and i think can create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this there's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology if you gave me only ONE WISH FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS I CAN PICK WHO'S PRESIDENT I CAN PICK A VACCINE WHICH IS SOMETHING I LOVE OR I COULD PICK THAT THIS THING THAT'S HALF THE COST WITH NO CO2 GETS INVENTED THIS IS THE WISH I WOULD PICK THIS IS THE ONE WITH THE GREATEST IMPACT IF WE DON'T GET THIS WISH THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE WHO THINK SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM WILL BE TERRIBLE BETWEEN THE US AND CHINA BETWEEN POOR COUNT SO WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO? WHAT AM I APPEALING TO YOU TO STEP FORWARD AND AND DRIVE? WE NEED TO GO FOR MORE RESEARCH FUNDING. WHEN COUNTRIES GET TOGETHER AT PLACES LIKE KOENIGSBERG THEY SHOULDN'T JUST DISCUSS THE C O T TWO THEY SHOULD DISCUSS THIS INNOVATION AGENDA AND YOU'D BE S T U N D AT THE R I D I K L I K L I Y A S L O W L E V A L Z AH V S P E N D IH0 NG sil AA1 N DH IY1 Z IH0 N AH0 V E MAN: SIGNAL OUT THERE WE NEED TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT WE NEED TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE BE MORE RATIONAL, MORE UNDERSTOOD DIALOGUE INCLUDING THE STEPS THAT THE GOVERNMENT TAKES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WISH BUT IT IS ONE I THINK WE CAN ACHIEVE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M STUDIED TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT ABOUT TERRA POWER RIGHT WELL TO ACTUALLY DO THIS SOFTWARE THIS IS WHAT SORT OF SCALE OF INVESTMENT THIS IS BUY THE SUPERCOMPUTER, HIRE ALL THE GREAT SCIENTISTS WE'VE DONE THAT'S ONLY TENS OF MILLIONS AND EVEN ONCE WE TEST OUR MATERIALS OUT IN A RUSSIAN REACTOR TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MATERIALS WORK PROPERLY THEN YOU'LL ONLY BE UP IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. THE TUFF THING IS BUILDING THE PILOT REACTOR FINDING THE SEVERAL BILLION FINDING THE REGULATOR THE LOCATION THAT WILL ACTUALLY BUILD THE FIRST ONE OF THESE IF IT WORKS AS ADVERTISED Because the economics, the energy density is so different than nuclear as we know it. And so to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium. And then and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down. That's right. Today you're always refueling the reactor. So you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong. That thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out. That's not good. Very, very cheap fuel. Then you can put sixty years in. Just think of it as a log. Put it down and not have those same complexities. And it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and and then it's done. It's it's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. Well, what happens with the waste? You can you can let it sit there. There's a lot less waste under this approach. Then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that. AND AND WE START OUT ACTUALLY BY TAKING THE WASTE THAT EXISTS TODAY THAT'S SITTING IN THESE COOLING POOLS OR DRY CASTING BY REACTORS THAT'S OUR FUEL TO BEGIN WITH SO THE THING THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM FROM THOSE REACTORS IS ACTUALLY WHAT GETS FED INTO OURS AND YOUR REDUCING THE VOLUME OF THE WASTE QUITE DRAMATICALLY AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES HERE A PLACE BUT AND THERE'S ALL THESE INTERESTING DISCLOSURE RULES ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S CALLED NUCLEAR. SO WE'VE GOT A LOT OF INTEREST THAT PEOPLE FROM THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN IN RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA. I'VE BEEN BACK SEEING THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY HERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS FITS INTO THE THE ENERGY AGENDA. SO I'M OPTIMISTIC YOU KNOW THE FRENCH AND JAPANESE HAVE DONE SOME WORK THIS IS A VARIANT ON SO A lot of countries have built them. So, anybody who's not a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. So, in your mind, time scale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live what we need for one of these high-scale electric electrical generation things that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environment models environmental models that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environment models environmental models that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environment models environmental models that's very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy. That's The Verbal Communication:\n\nThe speaker begins by discussing the challenges of fundraising for scientific research. He notes that it is difficult to secure funding for scientific research due to the fact that many people do not fully understand the importance of scientific research.\n\nThe speaker then goes on to discuss the importance of scientific research. He notes that scientific research is essential for advancing our understanding of the world around us and for developing new technologies that can improve our lives.\n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of scientific research and the need for continued funding for scientific research. He notes that scientific research is a critical component of our society and that we must continue to invest in it if we want to maintain our position as a global leader in scientific innovation.\n\nTranscription:\n\nThe speaker begins by discussing the challenges of fundraising SCALE POSSIBLE GAME CHANGES THIS IS THE BIGGEST THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF ABOUT THERE AN ENERGY BREAKTHROUGH IS THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WITHOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINT BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINT JUST MAKES THAT SO MUCH SO MUCH GREATER IN THE NUCLEAR SPACE THERE ARE OTHER INNOVATORS YOU KNOW THEIR WORK AS WELL AS WE KNOW THIS ONE BUT There are different ones. but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of say coal. and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprint and cost the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is in almost a class of its own. if this doesn't work, then what? do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable? Yeah, if you get into that situation, it's like if you're you've been overeating and you're about to have a heart attack. You know, then, then, then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something. There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together. Now you hope that's just an insurance policy. You hope you don't need to do that. Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy that you'll do nothing. Sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? Who make scientific arguments are very few, you know? Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things? There are very, very few things that they can even say, you know? There's a chance and a million of those things. The main problem you have here it's kind of like AIDS. You make a mistake now and you pay for it a lot later. And so when you have all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later, and as a somewhat is very, very few things that they can even say, you know? There's a chance and a million of those things. The main problem you have here it's kind of like AIDS. You make a mistake now and you pay for it a lot later. And so when you Uncertain painting. In fact, the Ipcc report you know that that's not necessarily the worst case. And there are people in the rich world who look at Ipcc and say, oh, you know, that, that isn't that big a deal. The fact is, it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. But my dream here is that if you can make it economic and meet the co2 two, then the skeptics say, oh, I don't care that it doesn't put out co2 two. I kind of wish it did. But I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper. Someone sneezed, and then there was applause. So, and then that would be your response to the, the, the Beaux-Arts argument that basically, if you, if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem, it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth. It's, it's a stupid waste of the earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. Yeah, well, the actual spending on the R&D piece, say, the US should spend ten billion a year more than it is right now. It's not that dramatic. It should be. TAKE AWAY FROM OTHER THINGS. THE THING YOU GET INTO BIG MONEY ON AND THIS REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE IS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ECONOMIC AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FUND THAT THAT TO ME MOSTLY IS A WASTE. UNLESS YOU'RE VERY CLOSE AND YOU'RE JUST FUNDING THE LEARNING CURVE AND IT'S GOING TO GET VERY CHEAP I BELIEVE WE SHOULD TRY MORE THINGS THAT HAVE A POTENTIAL TO BE FAR LOWER EXPENSIVE IF THE TRADE OFF YOU GO INTO PAY FIVE TIMES AS MUCH FOR OUR ENERGY AND NOT CHANGE OUR LIFESTYLE. THE DISASTER IS FOR THAT TWO BILLION. AND EVEN LONG BORN HAS CHANGED HIS STICK NOW IS WHY ISN'T THE R N D GETTING MORE DISGUSTED HE'S STILL BECAUSE OF HIS EARLIER STUFF SORT OF ASSOCIATED WITH THE SKEPTIC CAMP BUT HE'S REALIZED THAT'S THAT'S A PRETTY LONELY CAMP AND SO HE'S MAKING THE R N D POINT AND SO THERE IS A THREAT OF SOMETHING THAT Well, bill, i suspect i speak on behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true. thank you so much. thank you."

        "answer": "i 'm jane mcgonigal i 'm a game designer i 've been making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking that 's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it 's actually the opposite is true three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world 's most urgent problems in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i 've calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week so that 's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i 'll just i 'll say it again let it sink in if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade no i 'm serious i am here is why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly this is a portrait by a photographer named phil toledano he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic gaming emotion now if you 're not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo you probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem if you are a gamer you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows up is surprise this is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win now oh you 've heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of that 's an epic win this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the i 'm not good at life face and this is actually me making it can you see yes good this is actually me making the i 'm not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why we 're better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don 't mean just good as in successful although that 's part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate and when we 're in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment 's notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life when we when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don 't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious maybe depressed frustrated or cynical we never have those feelings when we 're playing games they just don 't exist in games so that 's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can 't achieve everything how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games especially in world of warcraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission right away but not just any mission it 's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you can 't achieve but it is on the the verge of what you 're capable of so you have to try hard but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft there is no sitting around wringing your hands there is always something specific and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission it 's not something that we have in real life that easily this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also there is this epic story this inspiring story of why we 're there and what we 're doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength and plus one intelligence we don 't get that kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off this stage i 'm not going to have plus one speaking and plus one crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea i don 't get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it 's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds it 's just better than reality so so far collectively all the world of warcraft gamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth now that 's not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like it 's a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate okay so when we talk about how much time we 're currently investing in playing games the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but it 's also apt because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we are actually changing what we are capable of as human beings we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species this is true i believe this so consider this really interesting statistic it was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school and some of you have probably read malcom gladwell 's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hour theory of success it 's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master ten thousand hours at effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuosos at it we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world and so now what we 're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is what exactly are gamers getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games these are our virtuoso gamers five hundred million people who are who are extraordinarily good at something and in the next decade we 're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is if you don 't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world particularly in india china brazil can get online they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade it will bring us up to one point five billion gamers so i 've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at here are the four things i came up with the first is urgent optimism okay think of this as extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success gamers always believe that an epic win is possible and that it is always worth trying and trying now gamers don 't sit around ok gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric there is a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they 've beaten us badly and the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal they 'll stay with the game until it 's over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation and and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result blissful productivity i love it you know there is a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it 's because we know when we 're playing a game that we 're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optimized as human beings to do hard and meaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they 're given the right work finally epic meaning gamers love to be attached to awe inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective so you all know wikipedia biggest wiki in the world second biggest wiki in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of warcraft wiki five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world they are building an epic story they are building epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft okay so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world that 's the problem that i 'm trying to solve there is an economist named edward castronova his work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds and he says we 're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments and he 's an economist so he 's rational and he says not like me i 'm a game designer i 'm exuberant but he says he says that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world now i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to start making the real world work more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened twenty five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep 's knuckles right before we had awesome game controlers we had sheep 's knuckles and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings and if you 're familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus you might know this history which is the history of who invented games and why herodotus says that games particularly dice games were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine that the king of lydia decided that they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution so according to herodotus they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat and then on the next day they would play games and on the next day they would eat and according to herodotus they passed eighteen years this way surviving through a famine by eating on one day and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how we 're using games today we 're using games to escape real world suffering we 're using games to get away from everything that 's broken in the real environment everything that 's not satisfying about real life and we 're getting what we need from games but it doesn 't have to end there this is really exciting according to herodotus after eighteen years the famine wasn 't getting better so the king decided they would play one final dice game they divided the entire kingdom in half they played one dice game and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure they would leave lydia and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take the civilization somewhere else where they could thrive now this sounds crazy right but recently dna evidence has shown that the etruscans who lead to the roman empire actually share the same dna as the ancient lydians and so recently scientists have suggested that herodotus 's crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might have actually saved their culture by playing games escaping to games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually saved the entire civilization that way okay we can do that we 've been playing warcraft since nineteen ninety four that was the first real time strategy game from the world of warcraft series that was sixteen years ago they played dice games for eighteen years we 've been playing warcraft for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so that 's where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of game play from let 's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games until we solve real world problems now i know you 're asking how are we going to solve real world problems in games well that 's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future we have this banner in our offices in palo alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict the future what we want to do is make the future we want to imagine the best case scenario outcome and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality we want to imagine epic wins and then give people the means to achieve the epic win i 'm just going to very briefly show you three games that i 've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures so this is world without oil we made this game in two thousand and seven this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage the oil shortage is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it 's real and to live your real life as if we 've run out of oil so when you come to the game you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time news videos data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs what 's not available how food supply is being affected how transportation is being affected if schools are closed if their is rioting and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to blog about it to post videos to post photos we piloted this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand and seven and we 've tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience nobody wants to change how they live just because it 's good for the world or because we are supposed to but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them we 've run out of oil this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game so for the next world saving game we decided to aim higher bigger problem than just peak oil we did a game called superstruct at the institute for the future and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet this supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system of course we asked people to come online almost like a jerry bruckheimer movie you know jerry bruckheimer movies you form a dream team you 've got the astronaut the scientist the ex convict and they all have something to do to save the world but in our game instead of just having five people on the dream team we said everybody is on the dream team and it 's your job to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net we had eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks they came up with five hundred insanely creative solutions that you can go online if you google superstruct and see so finally the last game we 're launching it march third this is a game done with the world bank institute if you complete the game you will be certified by the world bank institute as a social innovator class of two thousand ten working with universities all over sub saharan africa and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills we 've got a graphic novel we 've got leveling up in skills like local insight knowledge networking sustainability vision and resourcefulness i would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing areas who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world so i 'm going to wrap up now i want to ask a question what do you think happens next we 've got all these amazing gamers we 've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do but none of them have saved the real world yet well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real world work that games are a powerful platform for change we have all these amazing superpowers blissful productivity the ability to weave a tight social fabric this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter to survive on this planet for another century and that 's my hope that you will join me in making and playing games like this when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want so i say let the world changing games begin thank you",

        "model_prediction": "I'm jane mcgonigal. i'm a game designer. i've been making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing games so Online games some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it's actually the opposite is true three billion hours a week is not nearly enough gameplay to solve the world's most urgent problems in fact i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically i've calculated Dedicated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of gameplay every week so that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so i'll just i'll say it again let it sink in if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade no i'm serious i am here's why this picture pretty much sums up why i think we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade no i'm serious i am here's why this picture pretty much sums up why i think we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade Games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly this is a portrait by a photographer named phil tolhido. he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming. so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic gaming emotion. now, if you're not a gamer, you might miss some of the nuance in this photo. you probably see the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear, but intense concentration. deep, deep focus on tackling a really. Difficult problem. if you are a gamer, you will notice a few nuances here. the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows are up is surprise. this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic win know. oh, you've heard of that? okay, so we have some gamers among us. an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive, you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it. it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination. And when you get there, you are shocked to discover what you're truly capable of. that's an epic win. this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win. and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century. the face of someone who, against all odds, is on the verge of an epic win. now, unfortunately, this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems. this is what i call the i'm not good at life face. and this is actually the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century. the face of someone who, against all Me making it. can you see it? yes, good. this is actually me making the i'm not good at life face. this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley, california where i did my ph.d. on why we're better in games than we are in real life. and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have. we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it. we do achieve more in game worlds. but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters. inspired to collaborate. And to cooperate. and when we're in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moment's notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life when we're when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often don't feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious maybe depressed or cynical we never have those feelings when we're playing games they just don't exist in games so that's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything? how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work? so i looked at games like world of warcraft, which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment. and i started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds. so the first thing is, whenever you show up in one of these online games, especially in world of warcraft, there are lots and lots of different characters. Actors who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission right away. but not just any mission. it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game. right. so you can do it. they never give you a challenge that you can't achieve. but it is on the verge of what you're capable of. so you have to try hard. but there's no unemployment in world of warcraft. there's no sitting around wringing your hands. there's always something specific and important to be done. and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go. hundreds of thousands of people ready to help you. Work with you to achieve your epic mission. that's not something we have in real life that easily. the sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also there's this epic story, this inspiring story of why we're there and what we're doing and then we get all this positive feedback. you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength and plus one intelligence. we don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off the stage i'm not going to have you know, plus one speaking and plus one crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea. Don't get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds it's just better than reality so so far collectively all the world of warcraft gamers have spent five point ninety three million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth now that's not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like it's a bad thing but to put that in context Five point nine three million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up. that was the first upright primate. okay. so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but it's also apt because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we're actually changing what we They're capable of as human beings. we're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. this is true, i believe this so consider this really interesting statistic it was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all for children in the united states Ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school some of you have probably probably read malcolm gladwell's new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hour theory of success it's based on this great cognitive science Research that if we can master ten thousand hours of effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuosos at it, it will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world and so now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuosos gamers so the big question is what exactly are gamers getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented Endowed human resource on our hands this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games these are our virtuoso gamers five hundred million people who are extraordinarily good at something and in the next decade we're gonna have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is if you don't know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet So that gamers all over the world, particularly in india, china, brazil, can get online. they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. that'll bring us up to one point five billion gamers. so i've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at. here are the four things i came up with. the first is urgent optimism. ok, think of this as extreme self-motivation. urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible and that it's always worth trying and trying now. gamers don't sit around ok, gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric there's a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if they've beaten us badly the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal they'll stay with the game until it's over and so playing a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they Game together actually builds up bonds and trusts and cooperation and and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result blissful productivity i love it you know there's a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it's because we know when we're playing a game that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optimized as human beings to do hard and meaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time If they're given the right work finally, epic meaning gamers love to be attached to awe inspiring missions to human, planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective so you all know wikipedia biggest wiki in the world second biggest wiki in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of warcraft wiki five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of warcraft than any other source Warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world they are building an epic story they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft ok so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world Worlds that's the problem that i'm trying to solve there's an economist named edward kastraneko who's work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds and he says we're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments and he's an economist so he's rational and he says that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve More in online worlds than they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world now i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to start making the real world work more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened twenty five hundred years ago Ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep's knuckles

civilization somewhere else where they could thrive. now, this sounds crazy, right? but recently dna evidence has shown that the etruscans, who then led to the roman empire, actually share the same dna as the ancient libyans. and so recently scientists have suggested that herodotus's crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine. so this crazy story might be true. They might have actually saved their culture by playing games, escaping to games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually saved the entire civilization that way. okay, we can do that. we've been playing warcraft since nineteen ninety four. that was the first real-time strategy game from the world of warcraft series. that was sixteen years ago. they say we are ready for our own epic game. Now, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world, so that's where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of gameplay from. let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games until we solve real world problems. now, i know you're asking how are we going to solve real world problems and games? well, that's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future. we have this banner in our offices in palo alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future. We do not want to try to predict the future. but what we want to do is make the future. we want to imagine the best case scenario outcome and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality. we want to imagine epic wins and then give people the means to achieve the epic win. i'm just going to very briefly show you three games that i've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. so this is world without oil. we made this game in two thousand and seven. this is an online game in which you try to survive. an oil spill. The oil shortage is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil so when you come to the game you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real-time news videos data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs what's not available how health food supplies are being affected how transportation is being affected and if schools are closed if there's rioting and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this was true and And we ask you to blog about it to post videos to post photos we piloted this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand and seven and we've tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience nobody wants to change how they live just because it's good for the world or because we're supposed to but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them we've run out of oil this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience nobody wants to change how they live just because it's good for the world or because we're supposed to but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them we've Habits that they learned in this game so for the next world saving game we decided to aim higher, bigger problem than just peak oil we did a game called superstrike at the institute for the future and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet the supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system of course we asked people to come online almost like a jerry bruckheimer movie you know jerry bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team, you've got the astronaut, the scientist, the Scientists, ex-convicts, and they all have something to do to save the world. but in our game, instead of just having five people on the dream team, we said everybody's on the dream team, and it's your job to invent the future of energy, the future of food, the future of health, the future of security, and the future of the social safety net. we had eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks, and it came up with five hundred insanely creative solutions that you can go online if you google superstition and see so finally, the last game we're launching at march third, this is a game done with the world bank institute. if you complete the game you will be certified by the world bank institute as a social innovator class of two thousand and ten working with universities all over sub-saharan africa and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills we've got a graphic novel we've got leveling up in skills like local insight knowledge networking sustainability vision and resourcefulness i would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing areas who might benefit from coming Together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world so i'm gonna wrap up now i want to ask a question what do you think happens next we've got all these amazing gamers we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do but none of them have saved the real world yet well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real world work that games are a powerful platform for change we have all these amazing superpowers blissful productivity The ability to weave a tight social fabric this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter to survive on this planet for another century and that's my hope that you will join me in making and playing games like this when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want so i say let the world changing games begin thank you"

        "text": "Recognize the verbal communication and transcribe it into text.",
        "answer": "i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction in high school i i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this in in a in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and and you know that curiosity also manifested itself in in the fact that whenever i wasn 't in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was a real science geek but it was all about trying to understand understand the world understand the the limits of of possibility and my you know love of of science fiction actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this is in the late sixties you know we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a you know a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it and i was a an artist i could draw i could paint and and i i found that because there weren 't you know video games and this saturation of cg movies and and all of this imagery in the media landscape i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the author 's description put something on on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the behind the textbook and that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened the the jacques cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that that seemed pretty pretty darn unlikely but i could that was a world i could really go to right here on earth that was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean but i didn 't let that daunt me i pestered my father until he finally found a a scuba class in in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live and i actually got certified in a pool in a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and i didn 't see the ocean a a real ocean for another two years until we until we moved to california you know since then you know in in the in the intervening forty years i 've i 've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and i 've learned that that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with with amazing life that really is beyond beyond our imagination you know nature 's imagination is so so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is is ongoing and and just as strong as it ever was but when i when i chose a career as an adult it was film making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic books and so on so film making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens and the abyss and with the abyss i i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with film making so you know merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature we actually embraced computer generated animation cg and this this resulted in the first soft surface character cg animation that was ever in a in a movie and even though the film didn 't make any money barely broke even i should say i witnessed something amazing which is that the the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic you know it 's arthur clarke 's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical and so that that that got me very excited and i thought wow this is this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with ilm we created the liquid metal dude in that film the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we did make a little more money on that one so you know drawing a line through those those two two dots of of experience came to this this is going to be a whole new world this was a whole new world of creativity for for film artists so i i started a company with stan winston my good friend stan winston who is the the the premier make up and and creature designer at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog past the kind of analog processes of of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while but we found ourselves lagging in the in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects of cg effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg and the main characters would all be in cg and the world would be in cg and you know the envelope pushed back and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren 't going to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks and you know i i went and pitched it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship it 's going to be this epic romance passionate film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic and that 's why i made the movie and that 's the truth now the studio didn 't know that but i convinced them i said i said we 're going to dive to the wreck we 're going to film it for real we 'll be using it in the opening of the film it will be really important it will be a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding an expedition sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality because we actually created a reality where six months later i find myself in a russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through a view port not a movie not hd for real now that that blew my mind and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical and it required enormous planning you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can 't get back by yourself and you know i i thought wow i 'm i 'm like living in a science fiction movie this is really cool and so i i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration of course the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity it was imagination and it was an experience that hollywood couldn 't give me because you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn 't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and and sometimes things that i had had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them so i was completely smitten by this and had to do more and so i actually made a kind of curious decision after the success of titanic i said okay you know i 'm going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker and i 'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while and so you know we started planning these these expeditions and we wound up going to the bismark and and exploring it with with robotic vehicles we went back to the titanic wreck we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship which had never been done nobody had ever looked inside the wreck they didn 't have the means to do it so we created technology to do it so you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submersible and looking out at planks that look much like this where i knew that the that the band had played and i 'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the through the corridor of the of the ship you know when i say you know i 'm i 'm i 'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i 've i 've ever had because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship so it was this absolutely remarkable experience and it really made me realize that made me realize that the the telepresense experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars then your consciousness is is in injected into the into the vehicle into this this other form of existence it was really really quite profound and maybe a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening you know some decades out as as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in in many sort of post human futures that i that i can imagine as a science fiction fan so having done these these expeditions and and you know really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing amazing animals they are basically aliens right here on earth they live in an environment of chemosynthesis they don 't survive on sunlight based system the way we do and so you 're seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree centigrade water plumes that you think they can 't possibly exist at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well again you know it 's the science fiction influence as a kid and i wound up getting involved with the space community really involved with with nasa sitting on the nasa advisory board planning actual space missions going to russia going to the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three d camera systems and this was fascinating but what what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists planetary scientists people who were interested in these extremely fine environments taking them down to the vents and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space science i 'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan you know as a kid and doing this stuff for real and you know along the way in this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about leadership now you think directors got to be a leader leader of you know captain of the ship and all that sort of thing i didn 't really learn about leadership until i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this what do i get out of it we don 't make money at these damn shows you know we barely break even there is no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails someplace you know sitting at the beach made all these films made all these documentary films you know for a very limited audience no fame no glory no money what are you doing you 're doing it for the task itself for the challenge and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team because we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time sometimes at sea for for for two or three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you that you 've done a task that you can 't explain to someone else when you come back to the shore and you say you know we had to do this and the fiber optic and the attentuation and the this and the that all the all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea you can 't explain it to people it 's that thing that that maybe cops have or people in in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it creates a bond creates a bond of respect so when i came back to make my next movie which was avatar i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return and it really changed the dynamic so here i was again with a small team in you know in uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didn 't exist before tremendously exciting tremendously challenging and we became a family over a four and half year period and it completely changed how i do movies so people have commented on how well you know you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself that changed as a result of that so what can we synthesize out of all this you know what 's the what are the lessons learned well i think number one is curiosity it 's the most powerful thing you own imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world i have young film makers come up to me and say you know give me some advice for doing this and i say don 't put limitations on yourself other people will do that for you don 't do it to yourself don 't bet against yourself and and take risks nasa has this has this phrase that they like failure is not an option but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration because it 's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so that 's the thought i would leave you with is that in whatever you 're doing failure is an option but fear is not thank",

        "model_prediction": "I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. In high school, I took a bus to school, an hour each way, every day. And I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this in, in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I woke up in the morning, I WASN'T IN SCHOOL I WAS I WAS OUT IN THE WOODS HIKING AND TAKING SAMPLES FROGS AND SNAKES AND BUGS AND POND WATER AND BRINGING IT BACK LOOKING AT IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE I WAS YOU KNOW I WAS A REAL SCIENCE GEEK BUT IT WAS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND THE WORLD UNDERSTAND THE LIMITS OF OF POSSIBILITY AND MY LOVE OF OF SCIENCE FICTION ACTUALLY SEEMED TO BE MIRRORED IN THE WORLD AROUND ME BECAUSE WHAT WAS BREATHE AH0H0 Y UW1 N OW1 W IY1 W ER0 W IY1 W ER0 G OW1 IH0 NG T AH0 DH AH0 M UW1 N W IY1 W ER0 IH0 K S P L AO1 R IH0 NG DH AH0 D IY1 P OW1 SH AH0 N Z JH AE1 K K AH0 S T OW1 W AH1 Z K AH1 M IH0 NG IH0 N T UW1 AA1 R sil L IH1 V IH0 NG R UW1 M Z W IH0 TH HH IH0 Z AH0 M EY1 Z IH0 NG S P E I G movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape I had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the author's description put something on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the behind the textbook and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and That was the creativity had to, had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened, the Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth. I might not really go to an alien world on a space ship someday, that that seemed pretty darn unlikely but i could that was a world i could really go to, right here on Earth that was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books. So I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean. But I didn't let that deter me. I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo, New York right across the border from where we lived. And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo, New York. And I didn't see the ocean. REAL OCEAN FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS UNTIL WE THOUGH WE MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AND NOW SINCE THEN YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW IN THE INTERVENING FORTY YEARS I'VE I'VE SPENT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND HOURS UNDER WATER AND FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF THAT WAS IN SUBMERSIBLES AND I'VE LEARNED THAT THAT THAT DEEP OCEAN ENVIRONMENT AND EVEN THE SHALLOW OCEANS ARE SO RICH WITH WITH AMAZING LIFE THAT REALLY IS BEYOND BEYOND OUR I Imagination is so so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is ongoing and and just as strong as it ever was but when i when i chose a career as an adult it was filmmaking and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my urges to To create images and I was as a kid constantly drawing comic books and so on so filmmaking was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens then the abyss and with the abyss i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking so you know merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was that to solve a problem you have to go to the abyss and with the abyss i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking so you know merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was that to solve a problem you have to go to the abyss and with the abyss i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking so SPECIFIC NARRATIVE PROBLEM ON THAT FILM WHICH WAS TO CREATE THIS KIND OF LIQUID WATER CREATURE WE ACTUALLY EMBRACED COMPUTER GENERATED ANIMATION CG AND THIS THIS RESULTED IN THE FIRST SOFT SURFACE CHARACTER CG ANIMATION THAT WAS EVER IN A MOVIE AND EVEN THOUGH THE FILM DIDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY BARELY BROKE EVEN I SHOULD SAY I WITNESSED SOMETHING AMAZING WHICH IS THAT THE GI The audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic. You know, it's Arthur Clark's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. They were seeing something magical. And so that, that, that got me very excited. And I thought, wow, this is, this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art. So with Terminator 2, which was my next film, we took that much further. Working with with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude in that film. And the success hung on that. Balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we did make a little more money on that one ah so you know drawing a line through those those two two dots of experience came to this this is going to be a whole new world this is a whole new world of creativity for for film artists so i started a company with my good friend stan wilson my good friend stan wilson who was a the premier makeup and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and The future designer at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the kind of analogue processes of of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while but we found ourselves lagging in the in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to do ABSOLUTELY PUSH THE ENVELOPE OF VISUAL EFFECTS, OF CG EFFECTS BEYOND WITH REALISTIC HUMAN EMOTIVE CHARACTERS GENERATED IN CG AND THE MAIN CHARACTERS WOULD ALL BE IN CG AND THE WORLD WOULD BE IN CG AND THE ENVELOPE PUSHED BACK AND I WAS TOLD BY FOLKS AT MY COMPANY THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS FOR A WHILE SO I SHELVED IT AND MADE THIS OTHER MOVIE ABOUT A BIG SHIP THAT SINKS And you know, i went in and pitched it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship. it's gonna be this epic romance, passionate film. secretly, what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic. and that's why i made the movie. and that's the truth. now, the studio didn't know that. but i convinced them. i said, we're gonna dive to the real wreck of titanic. we're gonna film it for real. we'll be using it in the opening of the film. it'll be really important. it'll be a great marketing hook. and i talked them into it. and i said, we're gonna dive to the real wreck of This goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality because it actually created a reality where six months later i found myself in a russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through a viewport not a movie not hd for real now that that blew my mind and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this dive these deep dives was like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical all kinds of things but it was like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical all kinds of things but it was like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical all kinds of things but it was like a space mission you know where it was it was highly Technical and it required enormous planning and you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself and you know, i've thought, wow, i'm like living in a science fiction movie. this is really cool and so i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration. of course, the curiosity, the science component of it was everything. it was adventure, it was curiosity, it was imagination and it was an experience that The speaker is saying that Hollywood couldn't give them the ability to create a visual representation of something they saw out of a window during an expedition. They mention that they were able to imagine a creature and create a visual representation of it, but they couldn't imagine what they saw out of the window. They also mention that they were seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents, and sometimes things that they had never seen before that were not described by science at the time they saw them. The speaker also mentions that they were completely smitten by what they saw and had to do more. MALE: MAKE A KINDA CURIOUS DECISION AFTER THE SUCCESS OF TITANIC I SAID OH YEAH YOU KNOW I'M GONNA PARK MY DAY JOB AS A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE MAKER AND I'M GONNA GO BE A FULL TIME EXPLORER FOR A WHILE. AND SO YOU KNOW WE STARTED PLANNING THESE THESE EXPEDITIONS AND WE WOKE UP GOING TO THE BISMARCK AND AND EXPLORE IT WITH WITH ROBOTIC VEHICLES WE WENT BACK TO THE TITANIC RICK WE TOOK LITTLE BOTS THAT WE The speaker is discussing a ship that has never been seen before. They mention that they surveyed the ship and found that it doesn't have the means to do so. They also mention that they created technology to survey the ship. The speaker then mentions that they are currently on the deck of the ship, which is submerged, and they are looking at planks that look similar to the ones they saw before. The speaker then mentions that they know that the band played a song and they are flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. Finally, the speaker mentions that their mind is operating the vehicle. I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship. So it was this absolutely remarkable experience and it really MADE ME REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW TELL THE TELEPRESENCE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN HAVE THESE ROBOTIC AVATARS THAT YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS IS IS INJECTED INTO THE INTO THE VEHICLE INTO THIS THIS OTHER FORM OF EXISTENCE AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY QUITE PROFOUND AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF A GLINT TO TO WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING YOU KNOW SOME DECADES OUT AS WE START TO HAVE CYBORG BODIES FOR EXPLORATION OR FOR OTHER MEANS AND IN MANY AS A SCIENCE FICTION FAN, WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE DONE THESE EXPEDITIONS AND AND YOU KNOW REALLY BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE WHAT WAS DOWN THERE SUCH AS AT THE AT THE DEEP OCEAN VENTS WHERE WE HAD THESE AMAZING, AMAZING ANIMALS. THEY'RE BASICALLY ALIENS RIGHT HERE ON EARTH. THEY LIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF CHEMOSYNTHESIS. THEY DON'T SURVIVE ON SUNLIGHT BASED SYSTEM THE WAY WE DO. AND SO YOU'RE SEEING To degrade water plumes that you think they can't possibly exist at the same time and i was getting very interested in space science as well, again, you know, it's the science fiction influence as a kid and i wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with with nasa sitting on the nasa advisory board planning actual space missions, going to russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things to actually go and fly to the international NATIONAL SPACE STATION WITH OUR THREE D CAMERA SYSTEMS AND THIS WAS FASCINATING BUT WHAT BUT WHAT I WENT UP DOING WAS BRINGING SPACE SCIENTISTS WITH US INTO THE DEEP AND TAKING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY HAD ACCESS ASTROBIOLOGISTS PLANETARY SCIENTISTS PEOPLE WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THESE EXTREMOPHILE ENVIRONMENTS TAKING THEM DOWN TO THE VENDS AND LETTING THEM SEE AND TAKE SAMPLES AND TEST INSTRUMENTS AND SO ON. SO HERE WE WERE MAKING DOCUMENTARY F CLOSED LOOP BETWEEN BEING THE SCIENCE FICTION FAN YOU KNOW AS A KID AND DOING THIS STUFF FOR REAL AND YOU KNOW ALONG THE WAY IN THIS JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY I LEARNED A LOT I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT SCIENCE BUT I ALSO LEARNED A LOT ABOUT LEADERSHIP NOW YOU THINK DIRECTORS GOT TO BE A LEADER LEADER OF YOU KNOW CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP ALL THAT SORT OF THING I DIDN'T REALLY LEARN ABOUT LEADERSHIP UNTIL I DID THESE EXPEDITIONS BECA I'm gonna at a certain point say, what am i doing out here? why am i doing this? what do i get out of it? we don't make money at these damn shows. you know, we barely break even. there's no fame in it. people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails somewhere, you know, sitting at the beach. made all these films, made all these documentary films, that, you know, for a very limited audience. no fame, no glory, no money. what are you doing? you're doing it for the task itself. for the challenge. and the ocean is the The most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team because we would do these things with ten, twelve people working for years at a time sometimes at sea for for two, three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a task.

The process itself that changed as a result of that. So what can we synthesize out of all this? You know, what's that? What are the lessons learned? Well, I think number one is curiosity. It's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team. I have young filmmakers come up to me and say, \"Give me some advice for doing this.\" And I say, \"Don't put limitations on yourself.\" Other people will do that for you. Don't do it to yourself. Don't bet against yourself. And, you know, NASA has this, has this phrase that they like. Failure is not an option. But failure has to be an option. In art and in an experiment, failure has to be an option. EXPLORATION BECAUSE IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH AND NO IMPORTANT DEVELOPER THAT REQUIRED INNOVATION WAS DONE WITHOUT RISK. YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE RISKS SO THAT'S THE THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT IN WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING FAILURE IS AN OPTION BUT FEAR IS NOT THANK YOU"

accidents and right away i see there 's a different pattern that emerges this is because in the mid area here people are at their most active and over here they 're at their most frail we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects but not for everyone if we go ahead and we filter by age say forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about and if you drill into that it 's especially the case for men so you get the idea that viewing

into a particular year you can jump right into a specific issue so i 'm looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue the sports i 'm a lance armstrong fan so i 'll go ahead and i 'll click on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lance armstrong 's been a part of now if i want to just kind of take a peek at these i might think well what about taking a look at all of cycling so i can step back and expand on that and i see greg lemond now and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrower broader backing in backing out you 're not searching you 're not browsing you 're doing something that 's actually a little bit different it 's in between and we think it changes the way information can be used so i want to extrapolate

of just little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from i 'm only showing the top five hundred most popular wikipedia pages right here but even in this limited view we can do a lot of things right away we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on wikipedia i 'm going to go ahead and select government now having selected government i can now see that the wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are time magazine people of the year so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page it 's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them looking at one of these particular summaries i can then drill into the concept of time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them so looking at these people i can see that the majority come from government some have come from natural sciences some fewer still have come from business there 's my boss and one has come from music and interestingly enough bono is also a ted prize winner so we can go jump and take a look at all the ted prize winners so you see we 're navigating the

looking for bing over here for live labs pivot and from these i can drill into the web page and just launch them again it 's one metaphor repurposed multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data so right now in this world we think about data as being this curse we talk about the curse of information overload we talk about drowning in data what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden if we can do that then instead of being trapped in data we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with

WHAT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY TURN THAT UPSIDE DOWN AND TURN THE WEB UPSIDE DOWN SO THAT INSTEAD OF NAVIGATING FROM ONE THING TO THE NEXT WE GET USED TO THE HABIT OF BEING ABLE TO GO FROM MANY THINGS TO MANY THINGS AND THEN BEING ABLE TO SEE THE PATTER Instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge. and if we get the knowledge, maybe there's even wisdom to be found. so with that, i thank you."

        "answer": "for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies the placebo effect just because the person thinks that what 's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a for pain management for example if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect something fake becomes something real because of someone 's perception of it in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i 'm going to show you how it works this is a trick that 's been in every children 's magic book since at least the nineteen fifties i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies i 'll do it for you and then i 'll explain it and then i 'll explain why i explained it ok so here is what happens the knife which you can examine my hand which you could examine i 'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this i 'll get my sleeve back and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i 'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here right that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i 'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve and the object of this is quite simple i 'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all is well my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it 's held so tightly in place that i can shake it and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ta da so this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very even though it 's a very simple trick methodologically probably many of you in the room know this trick what happens is this i hold the knife in my hand i say i 'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i 'm holding onto my wrist is because that 's actually the secret of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index finger is just going to shift from where it is to a position pointing out like this nice one someone who didn 't have a childhood is out there so it goes like this from here right and as i move around my finger shifts so we could talk about why this is deceptive why you don 't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mind and the way it processes information it doesn 't count one two three it groups them but that 's not really what this is about right and then i open my hand up obviously it 's clinging there not by animal magnetism but by chicanery my index finger being there and then when i close my finger same thing as i move back this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors thanks now what does that have to do with the placebo effect well i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open i 'm not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an astonishing thing turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that 's like aspirin shaped it 's just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical they 're sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill what that really flipped me out turns out though that that 's not even where it stops if you have capsules they are more effective than tablets in any form a colored capsule that 's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills i don 't remember the statistic now sorry but the point is these dosages have something to do with it and the form has something and if you want the ultimate in placebo you 've go to the needle right a syringe with some inert a couple ccs of some inert something and you inject this into a patient well this is such a powerful image in their mind it it 's so much stronger than the white pill it 's a really this graph well i 'll show it to you some other time when we have slides the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality it 's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hat pin it 's very very sharp and i 'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit ok this is really my flesh this is not damian 's special grown flesh that 's my skin right there this is not a hollywood special effect i 'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side if you 're queasy if you if you faint easily i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night and some people that i didn 't know and one woman almost passed out so i suggest if you if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next thirty in fact you know what i 'll do the first bad part behind it you 'll get to see you can look away too if you 'd like to so here is what happens right here the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce i 'm sorry man am i freaking you out ok and then just through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this now essentially we 're in the same position we were in with the knife trick sort of but you can 't count my fingers right now can you so let me show them to you that 's one two three four five yes i know what people think when they see this they go well he 's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes so let me give you a little peek how 's that look out there pretty good yeah i know and the people in the back go okay i didn 't really see that people in the satellite room are like starting to move in now let me give you good close look at this that really is my skin that is not a hollywood special effect that 's my flesh and i can twist that around i 'm sorry if you 're getting queasy look away don 't look at the thing people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go well yeah that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be see there 's a hole there and a hole there if it were real he would be bleeding let me work up some blood for you yes there it is normally now i would take the needle out i would clean off my arm and i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real i 'm just going to leave it there and walk off the stage i will be seeing you several times over the next few days i hope you 're looking forward to that thank you very much",

IN OTHER WORDS, SUGAR PILLS HAVE A MEASURABLE EFFECT IN CERTAIN KINDS OF STUDIES THE PLACEBO EFFECT JUST BECAUSE THE PERSON THINKS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM IS ISS MAGICAL OR A SOMETHING SORT OF AH FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, IF THEY BELIEVE IT ENOUGH THERE'S A MEASURABLE EFFECT IN THE BODY CALLED THE PALLIATIVE EFFECT. SOMETHING FAKE BECOMES SOMETHING REAL BECAUSE OF SOMEONE'S PERCEPTION OF IT IN ORDER FOR US TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER I WANT TO START BY SHOWING YOU A RUDEMENTARY VERY SIMPLE MAGIC TRICK AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS THIS IS A TRICK THAT'S BEEN IN EVERY CHILDR MAGIC IN THE NINETEENTH SEVENTIES I'LL DO IT FOR YOU AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN IT AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN WHY I EXPLAINED IT. SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS: LITTLE KNIFE WHICH YOU COULD EXAMINE MY HAND WHICH YOU COULD EXAMINE I'M JUST GOING TO HOLD THE KNIFE IN MY FIST LIKE THIS I'M GONNA GET MY SLEEVE BACK AND TO MAKE SURE NOTHING GOES UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE I'M JUST GOING TO SQUEEZE MY RIST RIGHT HERE THAT WAY YOU CAN SEE TH I'm going to open my hand and hopefully it falls as well my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. In fact, it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it and the knife does not come off. Nothing goes up or down my sleeve, there's no trickery and you can examine everything. Ta da! So this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very even though it's a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very Simple trick methodologically. Probably many of you in the room know this trick. What happens is this. I hold the knife in my hand. I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve. That is a lie. The reason I'm holding on to my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion. In a moment, when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you, this finger right here, my index finger, is just going to shift from where it is to a position pointing out like this. Eh? Nice one. Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. So it goes like this from here, right? And as I move around my finger shifts. So we could talk about why this is deceptive, why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mind and the way it processes information, it doesn't count one, two, three, it groups them. But that's not really what this is about, right? Then I opened my hand, obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism but by chicanery. My index finger being there. And then when I close my finger, same thing, as I move back, this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger. I take this hand away, you give the knife out, there's a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks. Now, what does that have to do with the placebo effect? Well, I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open. I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this to me was an astonishing thing. Turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill, that's like... A spray shaped, just a round white pill, it has some certain measurable effect. But if you change the form that you give the placebo in, like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it, it is actually measurably more effective even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical use. They're sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill what really flips me out is that that's not even where it stops if you Uh, have capsules. They're more effective than tablets in any form. A colored capsule that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. Dosage has something to do with this. You know, one pill twice a day is not as good as three pills. I don't remember the statistical name for it, but the point is these dosages have something to do with it and the form has something to do with it. And if you want the ultimate in placebo, you go to the needle. Right? A syringe with some inert liquid. A couple of ccs of some inert stuff and you inject this into a patient. Well, this is such a powerful image in their mind that it's so much stronger than the white pill. Is it really this graph, well, I'll show it to you at some other time when we have slides. The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality. It's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect. I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD TAKE THAT IDEA AND APPLY IT TO A MAGIC TRICK AND TAKE SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A FAKE TRICK AND MAKE IT SEEM REAL. AND WE KNOW FROM THAT STUDY THAT WHEN YOU WANT REALITY YOU GO TO THE NEEDLE THIS IS A SEVEN INCH HAT PIN IT'S VERY VERY SHARP INTERVIEWER: What's your name?\n\nINTERVIEWEE: My name is Maurice.\n\nINTERVIEWER: Nice to meet you Maurice. What do you do for a living?\n\nINTERVIEWEE: I'm a doctor.\n\nINTERVIEWER: What kind of doctor?\n\nINTERVIEWEE: I'm a psychiatrist.\n\nINTERVIEWER: That's interesting. Can you tell me a little bit about what you do?\n\nINTERVIEWEE: Sure. As a psychiatrist, my job is to help people who are struggling with mental health issues. I use a variety of techniques, including therapy and medication, to help my patients manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.\n\nINTERVIEWER: That's Would you like to? So here's what happens. Right here, at the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm, I just make a little pierce. I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out? Okay, and then just threw my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this. Now, essentially, we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick. Sort of, but you can't count my fingers right now, can you? So let me show you to that. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. One, two, three, four, five, six FOR FIVE, EH? I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK WHEN THEY SEE THIS, THEY GO WELL. HE WAS CERTAINLY NOT DUMB ENOUGH TO STAB HIMSELF THROUGH THE SKIN TO ENTERTAIN US FOR A FEW MINUTES. SO LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE PEEK. HOW'S THAT LOOK OUT THERE? PRETTY GOOD? I KNOW. AND THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK GO, I DIDN'T REALLY SEE THAT PEOPLE IN SATELLITE ROOM ARE LIKE STARTING TO MOVE IN NOW. GIVE YOU A GOOD CLOSE LOOK AT TH People in the back or people on video years from now will see this and go, \"Yeah, that looks kind of neat and some sort of effect there.\" But if it were real, he would be, \"See, there's a hole there and a hole there. If it were real, he would be bleeding.\" Let me work up some blood for you. Now, normally, I would take the needle out, I would clean up my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds, but I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real, Going to leave it there and walk off the stage. I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much."
