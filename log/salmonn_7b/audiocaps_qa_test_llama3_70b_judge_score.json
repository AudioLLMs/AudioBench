The model's answer lacks the specificity of the reference, failing to pinpoint the type of event. However, it does capture the essence of the scene with the mention of \"repeated gunfire and screaming in the background\". I think the model's answer is close but not precise enough to match the reference.\n\nRating: 3",

A motorboat is a type of boat with a motor, but the reference answer specifically points to the motor as the primary source of sound, not the entire boat.\n\nRating: 4",
