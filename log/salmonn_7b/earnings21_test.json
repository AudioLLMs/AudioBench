MAGNITUDE OF IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC AND STARTING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND <INAUDIBLE> UNEMPLOYMENT AS YOU MIGHT RECALL 2020 <INAUDIBLE> GROWTH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MEXICAN ECONOMY WERE MODEST PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC MAINLY DUE TO WEAK <INAUDIBLE> PROFITS WE <INAUDIBLE> INDICATORS SHOWING A CONTRACTION OF MORE THAN 20% <INAUDIBLE> DURING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND 37% ON YEAR END YEAR AND DROPPING FIX INVESTMENT MARKET <INAUDIBLE> EXPECTATION HAVE BEEN REVISED DOWN TO A LINE 9% UNDER DECREASE IN GDP DURING 220 2000 AND 20 FOR <INAUDIBLE> THIS WILL BE AN ECONOMIC CONTRACTION NOT SEEN IN MANY DECADES THIS SIGNIFICANT FALL IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WAS RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION FORMER JOBS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER ACCORDING TO SOCIAL SECURITY DATA NOT AS MANY AS 20 MILLION JOBS LOST <INAUDIBLE> EMPLOYMENT FOLLOWING THE PAST <INAUDIBLE> YEAR ECONOMIC CRISIS BACK IN 95 AND 2000 AND 9 IT TOOK SEVEN QUARTERS FOR THE MEXICAN ECONOMY TO RECOVER ITS PREVIOUS LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HOWEVER IN THE CURRENT ONE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ECONOMY COULD RECOVER IN WITHIN A SIMILAR PERIOD OF TIME GIVEN THE DEPTH AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SHOCK AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY MEANING MEANINGFUL FISCAL PROBLEM TO AVOID DISTRIBUTE CONTRACTION IN IN ITS EMPLOYMENT WITH EXTERNAL DEMAND <INAUDIBLE> ONLY <INAUDIBLE> AND WITHOUT ANY MECHANISM TO <INAUDIBLE> RATE HOUSEHOLDS' INCOME LOSS AND NOT AN ECONOMY LIKE MEXICO <INAUDIBLE> IS LONG PATH TO RECOVER <INAUDIBLE> TO PREVIOUS ACTIVITY LEVELS WITH 2021 GROWTH PROFITS BEING FORECASTED AT ONLY 3% IT COULD TAKE

WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY RATIONALIZE ALL UH ALL UH ALL EXPENDING AND DO IT ON WHERE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IS BASICALLY THE IT PLATFORM AND THE DIGITALIZATION OF THE BANK SO IN THAT SENSE WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY CONCENTRATED ON THAT UH WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT I MEAN GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE THE BANK UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE BASICALLY WORKING FROM HOME UH YOU BASICALLY GET TO UNDERSTAND JUST ACTUALLY HOW REALLY HOW MUCH PEOPLE DO YOU NEED UH WHAT CAN YOU RATIONALIZE ET CETERA SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FROM US IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY UH RESPONSIBLE IN THE WAY WE MANAGE THAT AND UH CONCENTRATE ON THOSE POINTS WE ARE WORKING CURRENTLY ON THAT PLAN WE ARE WORKING ON OUR THREE-YEAR PLAN AND UH AND UH WE'RE BASICALLY INCLUDING ALL THESE UH INWARD SOLUTION MAYBE UH AS A FOLLOW UP MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> JUST SOME COMMENTS ON WHAT YOU'D SEEN UH THROUGHOUT YOUR PEERS AND THE SANTANDER GROUP IN IN THE REGION OR ELSEWHERE ARE THERE OTHER THINGS YOU THINK THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO MEXICO THAT COULD HELP UM PERHAPS ON THE SIDE OF THE BANKING SYSTEM PERHAPS IN TERMS OPERATIONALLY OR IT OR OR ANY FACTORS AT ALL THANK YOU WH- WHAT WE'RE DOING BASICALLY IS FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING UH THESE THE PLATFORMS ET CETERA BUT WE'RE DOING IT WE'RE DOING IT UH NOW INSTEAD OF EACH COUNTRY BASICALLY DEVELOPING THE PLATFORMS WE ARE DOING IT UH TOGETHER SO THAT BASICALLY IS GOING TO HELP OUT QUITE A LOT SO UH IT'S NOT MEXICO FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IN MEXICO WE'RE DEVELOPING THE NEW SUPER APP AND THE NEW SUPER APP IS GOING TO BE USED IN THE IN IN IN IN ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE ONBOARDING UH FOR SMES WE ARE USING THE ONE THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED AT THE IN EUROPE SO ALL THOSE TYPE TYPE OF THINGS ARE GOING TO HELP US OUT BASICALLY IN REDUCING OUR COST UH FOR THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING AND WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER MUCH MORE WITHIN THE GROUP IN ORDER TO DO THAT SO YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT I MEAN IN THE COST OF UH BASICALLY DEVELOPING THINGS AND IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF OUR UH UM SISTER BANKS SO SO SO THOSE T- GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH <CROSSTALK> IMPLEMENTING AT THIS TI- AT THIS POINT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT YOU'RE WELCOME TOO THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF JORGE KURI FROM MORGAN STANLEY PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UM I I WONDERED WHAT'S ABOUT NET INTEREST MARGIN UM YOU YOU YOU POINTED OUT THAT YOU EXPECT FURTHER UM COMPLICATIONS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS GIVEN UH FALLING GRADES AND WEAK UH LOAN DEMANDS AND UM MIXED DETERIORATION UM AS AS YOU LOOK AT 2021 UH IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU SAID ON N- NOT A STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY NEXT YEAR AND WITH AVERAGE RATES NEXT YEAR BEING M- M- MUCH LOWER THAN 2020 IF IF INDEED RATES END UP AT 4% AND W- WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION FOR THE NET INTEREST MARGIN NEXT YEAR AND FOR NII I- I- IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE ANOTHER YEAR OF UM NII COMPRESSION AND AND TO TO WHAT EXTENT THAT CAN BE OFFSET UH ELSEWHERE IN THE PML AND AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS ON UM THE ON THE COVERAGE RATIO AND I AND I KNOW THAT BANKS YOU YOU KNOW THE THE BANKS NORMALLY DON'T TARGET A COVERAGE RATIO I GET IT UM BUT BUT EVIDENTLY THE THE THE SIZE OF YOUR RESERVES UH HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO THE SIZE OF YOUR LOGBOOK THE SIZE OF YOUR MPLS AND THE SIZE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOANS THAT ARE ON THEIR RESTRUCTURING UM AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR CAPEX RATIO AT 100 138% IT LOOKS LOW RELATIVE TO WHERE BANORTE ENDED UP AT 201% AND <UNK> 185% SO I I WONDER YOU KNOW WHY WHY W- W- WHY NOT JUST YOU KNOW TAKE A MUCH BIGGER CHARGE ON PROVISIONS THIS QUARTER UM YOU KNOW EVIDENTLY THERE IS THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AHEAD AND UM THE MORE THE BETTER A- AND AND SO IS THIS PIECEMEAL JUST GOING TO YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY PUT MORE PRESSURE ON YOUR EARNINGS GOING FORWARD RATHER JUST YOU KNOW TAKE A REALLY BIG ONE SWOOP AND YOU KNOW R- RAISE YOUR COVERAGE TO NORTH OF 200% UM AND AND IS THAT LIKELY MAYBE SOMETHING YOU WILL DO IN THE THIRD QUARTER THANK YOU UM LOOK JORGE I WILL ASK UM THIS IS HECTOR I WILL ASK UM I WILL ANSWER THE FIRST PART AND THEN I WILL ASK DIDIER TO COMPLETE ON THE ON THE BASIC NUMBERS OF NII OKAY UM I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I MEAN IF IF YOU SAW THE PRESENTATION WE ARE BASICALLY CHANGING THE MIX OF UM OF THE CREDIT LOAN PORTFOLIO OKAY FIRST OF ALL I MEAN UM IF YOU HAVE SEEN I MEAN UH WE HAVE DECREASED QUITE A LOT OUR EXPOSURE UNFORTUNATELY TO SMES GIVEN THE LACK OF UH WARRANTIES FROM THE GOVERNMENT FROM NAFINSA OKAY SO UH THE PORTFOLIO HAS DROPPED ALMOST 10% SO IN THAT SENSE UH THAT BASICALLY IS A HIGH-YIELD PORTFOLIO WHICH UM IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO SHRINK UNLESS WE WE SEE SOME WARRANTIES FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND YOU IF YOU SEE OUR PORTFOLIO WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT WE HAVE LIKE 62% OF IT ALREADY WARRANTED BY NAFINSA OKAY THE CORRESPONDING VOLUME THIS BASICALLY GOES TO ANSWER YOUR SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF UH THE AMOUNT OF UH THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES THAT WE HAVE DONE UH THEN YOU SEE THAT UH ALSO WE SEE THAT FOR EXAMPLE CONSUMER CREDIT AND UH CONSUMER LOANS ARE GOING TO DECREASE AS WELL SO THE MIX IS COMPLETELY CHANGING THAT WE'RE GOING THE I MEAN WE'RE GOING BASICALLY BACK TO WHERE WE WERE WH- WHERE WE WERE FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD MUCH MORE EXPOSURE TO CORPORATES AND TO MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES THAN TO CONSUMER LOANS REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE THAT DIFFERENT MIX OKAY SO THAT'S WHY NII IS SHRINKING ON THE OTHER SIDE WHAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN DOING IT WAS WITH PRICING AND WE ARE VERY S- STRICT ON PRICING RISK OKAY SO UM WE'VE BEEN INCREASING THE MARGIN ON THE CORPORATE LOANS QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO THAT FACT YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE BASICALLY LOOKING AT THE THE RISK THAT WE ARE TAKING AND UH WE ARE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE RATINGS OF THOSE COMPANIES AND WE ARE PRICING RISK ACCORDINGLY OKAY THIS IS NOT A SITUATION IN WHICH WE WANT TO SPEND THE PORT- CREDIT PORTFOLIO JUST TO EXPAND IT WE ARE BASICALLY DOING IT JUST TO THE COMPANIES THAT WE BELIEVE THAT HAVE A FUTURE AND THAT WILL BE THERE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND BOTH WE'RE PRICING THE RISK ACCORDINGLY SO IN THAT SENSE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE US GOING TOWARDS THAT ALSO THE OTHER CONCENTRATION IS MORTGAGES WHICH WE UH WHICH WE BELIEVE I MEAN THERE IS A SECTOR STILL UH OF GROWTH I MEAN AS YOU KNOW THERE IS A LACK OF A OR OR A BIG DEFICIT IN TERMS OF HOMES IN MEXICO SO WE BELIEVE THERE IS STILL A PART OF THE POPULATION THAT CAN AFFORD A MORTGAGE UH MORTGAGES PENETRATION IN MEXICO WAS QUITE LOW VERSUS THE REST AND ALSO LOAN PENETRATION IS QUITE LOW SO WE BELIEVE THERE IS A CHANCE TO TO TO CONTINUE TO PENETRATE THAT SECTOR AND MAYBE ON PAYROLLS ON SOME SITUATIONS WE WILL BASICALLY BE UH ALSO LENDING IN THAT IN THE IN THAT PART I MEAN AND AUTO LOANS ALSO WE HAVE SEEN SOME INTERESTING UH DEVELOPMENT THERE WITH VERY CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO IT SO IN THAT SENSE THE MIX OF THE PORTFOLIO IS GOING TO CHANGE AND PROBABLY DIDIER CAN LET YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW DO WE SEE NII EVOLVING IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WERE ASKING IN TERMS OF UM THE RESERVES UH WE MAYBE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN DOING RESERVES ACCORDINGLY WH- TO WHAT WE BELIEVE WE ARE DOING UH IN TERMS OF UH UH HOW THE PORTFOLIO IS UH IS UH BEHAVING AT THIS POINT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THE PORTFOLIO NOT ON PAYMENTS HOLIDAYS IS BEHAVING MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN WE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS GOING TO T- THAT IT WAS GOING TO TURN ACTUALLY I'M QUITE SURPRISED ABOUT IT HOPEFULLY UH IT CONTINUES THAT WAY BUT IN THAT SENSE WE ARE BASICALLY BEING- IN MY OPINION UH BEING VERY RESPONSIBLE IN THE AMOUNT OF UH OF RESERVES THAT WE ARE MAKING AT THIS POINT ALSO WE HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB UH WITH THE DATA UH HOPES THAT WE HAVE IN REVIEWING UM THE PORTFOLIO ON HOLIDAYS AND THAT PORTFOLIO IS BEING DIVIDED AS WE SAID IN 36 CLUSTERS OKAY THESE CLUSTERS HAVE BEEN DIVIDED UPON RI- UPON THE AMOUNT OF RISK THAT WE HAVE ON EACH PARTICULAR SITUATION AND IN SOME OF THESE PORTFOLIOS UH EVEN BEFORE THE PAYMENT HOLIDAY ENDS WE ARE ALREADY TALKING TO CLIENTS AND DISCUSSING THE WAY UH UH THAT THAT WE COULD GET PAID ON THOSE PARTICULAR SITUATIONS BECAUSE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT WHOEVER GETS PAID FIRST IS THE ONE THAT IS THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO GET PAID SO WE ARE BASICALLY BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE ON THAT SENSE TO TALK TO OUR CLIENTS AND BASICALLY TRYING TO GET THAT AND TO RECOVER THE PORTFOLIO AS YOU HAVE SEEN 55% OF OUR BRANCHES HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO UH COLLECTING BRANCHES I MEAN UH TO BASICALLY THIS UH UH WE'RE DEDICATING OUR EXECUTIVES TO COLLECT WE HAVE DIVIDED THEM UP IN THE SECTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN THAT OR THAT ARE GOING TO BE HIT THE MOST IN THE ECONOMY SO IN THAT SENSE I BELIEVE WE'RE VERY WELL PREPARED ALTHOUGH I MEAN OR NEVERTHELESS UH IS ALWAYS I MEAN A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO GO OVERBOARD AND WE BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT UH THE RIGHT APPROACH IS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE MADE BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS EVOLUTION WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY CONSERVATIVE IN THE WAY WE MANAGE THAT OKAY UM DIDIER I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMPLETE ABSOLUTELY EH ABSOLUTELY HECTOR I WOULD LIKE TO TO COMPLEMENT ON WHAT YOU MENTIONED EH EH GREAT TALKING TO YOU JORGE LONG TIME NO SPEAK UM EH IN TERMS OF UH EH NIMS YOU KNOW EH DEFINITELY YOU KNOW AS WE LAID OUT IN THE PRESENTATION WE SEE SIGNIFICANT UH PRESSURES AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION THAT I THINK IT'S IT'S EH IT'S QUITE RELEVANT UM THE THE SPEED AT WHICH INTEREST RATES HAVE COME DOWN IN MEXICO IS IS IS IS SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW JUST IN THIS QUARTER EH THE AVERAGE OF THE REFERENCE UH REFERENCE RATE CAME DOWN 123 BASIS POINTS THAT'S THE THE THE FASTEST DECLINE THAT EH WE'VE SEEN EH IN THE RECENT HISTORY WE WE DIDN'T SAW A A AN INCREASE OF THOSE EH YOU KNOW OF THAT MAGNITUDE WHEN EH WHEN INTEREST RATES WERE WERE COMING UP OKAY SO THAT'S ONE THING TO HAVE IN MIND THE THE THE IMPACT THAT YOU SEE IN THIS QUARTER I THINK IS IS PROBABLY MOST <INAUDIBLE> THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN A RELATIVE BASIS RELATIVE TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR AND RELATIVE TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR OKAY UM ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT WHEN INTEREST RATES WERE CLOSE TO 4% AS WE PROBABLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED YOU KNOW ARE CLOSE TO 5% YOU KNOW AND THIS WAS THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF 2016 UH I THINK THAT EH THE THE NUMBER THAT THAT WE REPORTED THE 448% IN THIS QUARTER YOU KNOW HAVE TO DO WITH WITH WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO YOU KNOW THE SPEED AT WHICH INTEREST RATES EH EH CAME DOWN AND ALSO ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE THE THE THE CHANGE IN MIX ON OUR LOAN SIDE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE EH THE INCOME FROM EH INTEREST RATES COMING DOWN WE WE INCREASED OUR PAY INTEREST SECURITIES PORTFOLIO SIGNIFICANTLY YOU KNOW AND THOSE ARE YOU KNOW LOWER MARGIN UH EH ASSETS RELATIVE TO THE THE THE LOAN PORTFOLIO JUST TO YOU KNOW SHARE WITH YOU UH WE'VE BOUGHT IN THIS ACCOUNT YOU KNOW BOTH DIVESTMENT AND MATURITIES THE OVERALL GROWTH IN OUR PAY INVESTMENT AND SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS 96 BILLION OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS SO UM WHAT WE EXPECT COMING DOWN THE ROAD YOU KNOW PAY FOR THE REST OF 2020 AND EH FOR NEXT YEAR I THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW HAVING SAID THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY YOU KNOW I THINK THAT PROBABLY THE THE MOST SEVERE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF NAME ARE THE ONES THAT WE SAW THIS QUARTER YOU KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW 10 TO 15 BASIS POINTS EH PROBABLY FURTHER ADJUSTMENT OR SLIGHT EH IMPROVEMENT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR OKAY AND NEXT YEAR I THINK THAT EH WE'LL WE'LL PROBABLY GET TO SEE NAMES SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE TO THE ONES THAT WE WERE SEEING EH EH IN THIS QUARTER NOW IN REGARDING TO THE CURRENT RATIO YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT WE DON'T TARGET <INAUDIBLE> THAT THAT'S UH RESULTING NUMBER AND ALSO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU EH MAKE REFERENCE TO YOU KNOW OUR NUMBER 138% LOOKS LOW RELATIVE TO <INAUDIBLE> THE FIRST QUARTER THIS YEAR THEY HAD 140% UH IN THIS IN THE SECOND QUARTER THEY DID AS WE DID ALSO <INAUDIBLE> INCREASE THE PROVISIONS FOR DIFFERENT TO US THEY MADE A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE OFF 4.6 BILLION PESOS SO THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEIR INCREASED TO 200% UH I'M PROBABLY JUST ELABORATING ELABORATING EH THE MORE ON WHAT INFORMATION YOU KNOW UH THE LETTER OF PROVISIONS THAT WE HAVE ARE IN LINE WITH THE EXPECTED LOSSES THAT WE WE ESTIMATE UM YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE A OR YOU MIGHT QUESTION WHETHER WE YOU KNOW THIS IS ENOUGH OR NOT YOU KNOW AND LET ME SHARE WITH YOU THAT YOU KNOW UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES WE WE HAVE DEFINITELY DONE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OR SCENARIO ANALYSIS OKAY SO IF <INAUDIBLE> RECOVERY IN THE MEXICAN ECONOMY YOU KNOW WE HAVE WITH THESE QUARTERS EH PROVISIONS WE ARE YOU KNOW MORE THAN COVERED YOU KNOW FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR NOW DO WE THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A TYPE RECOVERY IN THE MEXICAN ECONOMY I DON'T THINK SO YOU KNOW IT'S VERY YOU KNOW LOW PROBABILITY YOU KNOW NOW WE HAVE A <INAUDIBLE> YOU KNOW THE THE OUR LEAVE OF PROVISIONS ACCORDING TO OTHER TYPES OF <INAUDIBLE> MORE A U TYPE OR AN ADVERSE SCENARIO HAVING AGILITY CONTRACTION OF 12.5% YOU KNOW AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THESE QUARTERS PROVISIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR THERE COULD BE CLOSE TO 60 TO 75% DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE <INAUDIBLE> EH CONTRACTION THAT THAT YOU ASSUME OKAY EH EH SO SO THERE SHOULD BE UH DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN EXPECTED LOSSES AND PROVISIONS AND THE PROVISIONS THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD WE THINK THAT WITH INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE UH ARE QUITE STRONG TO COVER YOU KNOW EXPECTED LOSSES IF THE THE THE ECONOMY ENDS UP CONTRACTING MORE THAN WE ARE EXPECTING RIGHT NOW DEFINITELY WE WILL NEED TO PROVIDE A PROVISION OF PROVISIONS SOMETHING THAT I I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO EH YET YOU KNOW THE THE <INAUDIBLE> BANK <INAUDIBLE> UM THEY RELEASED IN THE STABILITY FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT PUBLISHED A FEW WEEKS AGO AN ANALYSIS REGARDING NPL FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND THEY WHAT THEY DID IS LOOK AT INFORMATION FROM THE ENTIRE BANKING SYSTEM FROM THE LAST 20 YEARS AND THEY PAY YOU KNOW USING AN ECONOMETRIC MODEL THEY THEY ESTIMATED YOU KNOW WHERE ARE THE CRITICAL VARIABLES THAT DETERMINE NPLS AND THEY BREAK DOWN THE THE THE PORTFOLIO IN CONSUMER LOANS IN MORTGAGE LOANS AND IN CORPORATES SO ONCE THEY DETERMINE YOU KNOW THESE ECONOMETRIC MODEL THEN THEY PROVIDED A YOU KNOW A SHOCK WITH THE VARIABLES THAT WE'RE SEEING UH LATELY AND THEY ESTIMATED HOW MUCH UH NPL RATIOS RATE FOR THE ENTIRE BANKING SYSTEM UM FOR CONSUMER LOANS THAT WOULD IMPLY A 32% INCREASE FOR MORTGAGES 19% AND FOR CORPORATES ALSO 32% SO WHEN YOU DO THAT MATH AND YOU BREAK DOWN YOU KNOW BY TYPES OF LOANS BY TYPE OF BANK YOU GET TO SEE YOU KNOW THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BALLPARK ESTIMATE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY EVERY SINGLE BANK HAS DIFFERENT PRACTICES IN ORIGINATION PRACTICES AND RECOVERIES AND SO ON BUT YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE IN TERMS OF USING THIS MODEL YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU YOU WILL EXPECT AT EACH BANK WITH WITH PROVISION OKAY THANK YOU THANK HECTOR FOR THE UH DETAILED RESPONSES WE WILL TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM THE LINE OF ERNESTO <INAUDIBLE> FROM BANK OF AMERICA PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING HECTOR THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY UH MY FIRST QUESTION IS A FOLLOW UP ON THE PREVENTIVE PROVISIONS OF 349 PESOS SO YOU THINK THIS LEVEL OF PROVISIONS WILL BE ENOUGH FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR OR ARE YOU GOING TO EVALUATE TO CREATE MORE DEPENDING ON THE BEHAVIOR OF PAYMENTS UP TO THE RELIEF PROGRAM AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS UH A DIFFERENT ONE BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE EXPOSURE TO EITHER MEXICO ON THE CHAPTER 11 OR <INAUDIBLE> THAT HAS RESTRUCTURED LOANS WITH THE BANKS FOR ABOUT A YEAR BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN NOT DISCLOSE YOUR EXPOSURE SO MAYBE IF YOU CAN REMIND US HOW MUCH OF YOUR LOAN BOOK IS EXPOSED TO AIRLINES AND HOW MUCH TO FOOD AND BEVERAGE AND IF THERE IS A SECTOR THAT IS CONCERNING YOU AND FINALLY UH MY MY LAST QUESTION IS UM COMPETITION IN MORTGAGE LOANS UH WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT BANKS REDUCING THE INTEREST RATES UH OF MORTGAGES IN LIGHT OF THE LOWER RATES SO HOW HAS BEEN YOUR STRATEGY TO ATTRACT MORE MORE MORTGAGE CLIENTS AND HOW UH COMPETITIVE IS YOUR INTEREST RATE THANK YOU THANK YOU ERNESTO UH LET ME LET ME START AND THEN MAYBE I WILL COMPLEMENT FIRST OF ALL ON THE <INAUDIBLE> OF PROVISION LIKE UM I HAVE SPOKEN MANY TIMES TO MY CRO AND HE BASICALLY TELLS ME THAT UH WHEN I ASK YOU AND ASK HIM THE SAME QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME AT THIS POINT AND HE SAYS LOOK I DON'T HAVE MY CRYSTAL BALL UM SO CLEAR AND IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHAT WE'RE DOING I MEAN WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST JOB IN IN BASICALLY REVIEWING THE PORTFOLIO WE DO LIKE THAT WE SEE THE RATE THAT WE REVIEW THE THE BEHAVIOR AND WE'RE BASICALLY TRYING TO BE AS CONSERVATIVE AS WE CAN IN ORDER TO MANAGE IT SO UM AND IF WE SEE THAT THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT I MEAN THE PAYMENT SHOCK COMES IN THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST WE'RE PREPARING FOR NEXT WEEK ACTUALLY WHEN THE FIRST LOANS THAT WENT INTO THE HOLIDAY START UM TO TO MATURE AND WE WE SEE THAT WE SEE HOW THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO IS AND THEN WE'LL TAKE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE OUR NUMBERS UH RIGHT AS UH I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE PROVISIONS AS SOON AS THEY COME IF UH NEEDED OKAY AND THE SECOND POINT IN MEXICO YES AND AND <INAUDIBLE> WE DO HAVE UH EXPOSURE TO THEM NOTHING THAT WE CANNOT CONTROL OR NOTHING TOO BIG FOR THE SIZE OF THE BANK I MEAN OUR TOP EXPOSURE TO AIRLINES UM IS NOT BIG I MEAN COMPARED TO THE TOP OF THE HEIGHTS OF THE PORTFOLIO I WOULD SAY EH PROBABLY <INAUDIBLE> IT'S NOT BIG IT'S NOT VERY SIGNIFICANT VERSUS THE SIZE OF THE BANK AND UH WE HAVE LOANS OR PROVISIONS ALREADY ON SOME <INAUDIBLE> TO MEXICO SO WE CAN TELL YOU THAT IN IN THE PROVISIONS THAT WE MAKE SOME OF THEM ARE MADE TO FOR THE EXPOSURE WHICH IS NOT RELEVANT IN TERMS OF <INAUDIBLE> YES WE DO HAVE EXPOSURE TO THEM ALSO NOT I MEAN NOT SIGNIFICANT AND WE ARE BASICALLY IN THOSE STRUCTURE AND PROCESS AS OF NOW AND UH WE SEE THAT THE COMPANY CAN RECOVER UH FAIRLY I MEAN I DON'T SEE THAT <INAUDIBLE> IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION <INAUDIBLE> UNFORTUNATELY IN FRONT OF ME AND WE CAN BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE <INAUDIBLE> IN TERMS OF THE COMPETITION OF MORTGAGE LOANS UM IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT WHAT WE DO UH UH WE CANNOT IMPORTANT DIFFERENTIATION IN TERMS OF HOW WE DO MORTGAGES VERSUS OUR COMPETITION IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT <INAUDIBLE> FEES IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROTOTYPE NOBODY HAS REPLICATED IN THE MEXICAN MARKET I MEAN SOME OF THE OTHER BANKS BASICALLY HAVE TRIED TO DO <INAUDIBLE> WHAT WE ARE DOING <INAUDIBLE> THE BEST RATE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET BUT IN ORDER TO GET THE RATE UH RATE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET WHICH IS SEVEN POINTS 75% FOR A 15 YEAR MORTGAGE YOU HAVE TO BASICALLY TURN INTO TURN FIRST INTO YOUR MOST IMPORTANT BANK TO YOUR NUMBER BANK NUMBER ONE BANK BUT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT RATE YOU HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS WITH US THAT BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR PAYROLL YOU HAVE TO DIRECT MAYBE YOU YOU <INAUDIBLE> YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR INSURANCE YOU HAVE TO SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE RATE IN THAT REGARD WHAT HAPPENS IS EVEN IF THE LOAN IS AT 7.75 AND WE'RE ALSO VERY CAUTIOUS IN THE LOAN VALUE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT THAT LOAN THAT'S WHY PRECISELY I WAS EXPLAINING IN THE PRESENTATION THAT THAT'S WHY OUR <INAUDIBLE> FOR MORTGAGE IS 37% LARGER THAN THE REST SO WE GO DIRECTLY TO THE MORT- TO THE WEALTHY PEOPLE OKAY TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE BEST SITUATION RIGHT NOW SO WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PORTFOLIO IS MORE RESILIENT IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AND ALSO THAT UM WE GET THE BEST CLIENT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT BASICALLY CAN ACHIEVE THIS RATE AND CAN ACHIEVE THESE AND HAVE THESE CHARACTERISTICS TO ACT IN THIS TYPE OF ROLE SO THAT'S WHY THE THE THE PORTFOLIO WE BELIEVE IS GONNA BEHAVE WELL AND IS GOING TO BE MANAGED UM OR IS GOING BE UM BEHAVE IN A NICE IN A NICE WAY DUE TO THAT FACT OKAY AND WE HAVE SEEN THE WAY THE PORTFOLIO HAS PERFORMED AND WE SEE THAT THE PERFORMANCE IS ACCORDING TO OUR EXPECTATIONS GIVEN THE VERY COMPLICATED CIRCUMSTANCES OKAY SO IN THAT REGARD I MEAN THERE IS COMPETITION I MEAN THERE ARE SOME BANKS I MEAN A COUPLE OF BANKS HAVE TRIED TO COME IN AND AND BASICALLY COMPETE WITH US HEAD TO HEAD IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATIONS AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEMS THAT WE SEND TO THE MARKET THEN WE CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER PROTOTYPE <INAUDIBLE> THE <INAUDIBLE> BASICALLY HAS A PARTICULAR AND HAS EVERYTHING INCLUDED IN THE RATE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FEES ANY COMMISSIONS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY ANCILLARY COSTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT PARTICULAR THING IS FOR PEOPLE THAT I MEAN THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS UNDER THE TABLE AND THAT WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR IT'S COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT TO THE CLIENT AND THAT IS ABOVE 9% AS A RATE AND UH AND THAT'S FOR A DIFFICULT DIFFERENT TYPE OF CLIENT SO WE HAVE A CHINESE MENU FOR EVERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF <INAUDIBLE> UH WHAT WE DO AND AND FOR EXAMPLE <INAUDIBLE> FOR A DIFFERENT SECTOR THAT IS MUTUAL THAT IS BASICALLY CLIENTS WITH LOWER TICKET AND UM WELL THERE ARE SOME OF THESE CLIENTS ARE VERY GOOD AND UH HAVE VERY GOOD CREDIT QUALITY AND UH THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDED TO COMPETE IN THAT SECTOR I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OR NOT PLEASE BE A COMPLEMENT SURE HECTOR UM EH REGARDING YOUR FIRST FIRST QUESTION ERNESTO UH IT WAS AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED UNITING <INAUDIBLE> ON THE YOU KNOW HOW SEVERE IS THE CONTRACTION THIS YEAR YOU KNOW AND HOW THAT IMPACTS THE CAPACITY FOR CLIENTS TO TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS WE THINK THAT EVENTUALLY IF THERE'S UH YOU KNOW A U TYPE RECOVERY AND GDP CONTRACTING SOMEWHERE AROUND 10-12 % THEN WE HAVE MADE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS QUARTER MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT WE REQUIRE AND THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW 60-75 % OF WHAT WE REQUIRE YOU KNOW WITH INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW OKAY BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON HOW THIS EVOLVES AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE CLOSELY MONITORING EH YOU KNOW HOW OUR CLIENTS ARE ARE BEHAVING OKAY NOW ON YOUR SECOND QUESTION REGARDING THE EXPOSURE THAT YOU HAVE TO MEXICAN <INAUDIBLE> EH YOUR OBVIOUSLY FOR REASONS WE CANNOT DISCLOSE THOSE BUT WE CAN EH REASSURE YOU THAT THESE TWO EXPOSURES THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT WITHIN OUR TOP 10 EXPOSURES EH TO MENTION WE HAVE ALREADY PROVISIONS PARTIALLY EXPOSURE WITH MEXICO THAT'S CLOSE TO 45% OF THE EXPOSURE THAT WE HAVE THAT IS NOT MATERIAL OKAY AND I DON'T HAVE WITH ME THE BREAKDOWN IN TERMS OF FOOD AND BEVERAGE THE BREAKDOWN THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW IT'S MORE UH THE ONE THAT IS USED MORE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES AND DO NOT HAVE THAT DETAIL BUT EH FOR SURE WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THAT THIS IS SUPER HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM BRIAN <UNK> FROM CITIBANK PLEASE GO AHEAD UH EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTION BEFORE MY QUESTION I WANTED TO MAKE A <INAUDIBLE> THAT <INAUDIBLE> CAPABILITY DO SO <INAUDIBLE> WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE SORRY <CROSSTALK> I THINK THAT'S 40% RIGHT 40% THANK YOU AND AND NOW FOR MY QUESTION UH YOU KNOW <INAUDIBLE> QUALITY AND YOU MENTIONED <INAUDIBLE> PORTFOLIO HAS A LARGE DEGREE OF <INAUDIBLE> UH MY QUESTION IS COULD YOU <INAUDIBLE> AND THE <INAUDIBLE> WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING IN TERMS OF NPL FOR <INAUDIBLE> THANK YOU UM IF YOU LIKE I CAN TAKE THAT HECTOR UM THE YOU KNOW CREDIT CARDS DO NOT HAVE COLLATERAL YOU KNOW SO SO LAWS GIVEN DEFAULTS IN IN CREDIT CARDS IS EH CLOSE TO 100% YOU KNOW YOU YOU BASICALLY DO NOT EH EH RECOVER THAT MUCH IN TERMS OF EH EH CREDIT CARDS YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE EH EH PRODUCTS EH MOST IMPACTED YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT UH YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOANS THAT CLIENTS HAVE YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT EH MORTGAGES ARE THE ONES THAT YOU EH EH YOU DON'T PAY YOU CONTINUE PAYING YOU KNOW IF THERE'S JUST ONE LOAN THAT YOU CONTINUE PAYING THAT'S THAT'S MORTGAGES AND PROBABLY CREDIT CARDS ARE EH YOU KNOW AT THE BOTTOM OF EH YOUR PAY PRIORITIES YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE EH EH TROUBLE THE NPLS THAT THAT WE SEE IN IN CREDIT CARDS HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY LIKELY BUT I THINK IS YOU KNOW PROBABLY STABLE WHEN YOU COMPARE IT HISTORICALLY SO WE DON'T EXPECT YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT EH DETERIORATION EH YOU KNOW COST OF RISK BY WAY OF EH EH THE PROVISIONS THAT EH WE'RE TAKING IT'S CLOSE TO 11% SO I DON'T KNOW HECTOR IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO IF PERCHANCE YOU WOULD LIKE TO TO FURTHER COMPLEMENT ON THIS THIS IS THE OPERATOR MR CHAVEZ' LINE HAS GONE IDLE I WILL TRY TO RECONNECT HIM AT THIS TIME WOULD WE LIKE TO TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION EH SURE THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM TITO LABARTA FROM GOLDMAN SACHS HI GOOD MORNING UH THANK YOU FOR THE CALL AND TAKING THE QUESTIONS UM ONE QUESTION ON THE THE MARKET RELATED INCOME I KNOW YOU TALKED YOU KNOW THE BIG SPIKE IN THE QUARTER BUT DO DO YOU THINK THAT GOES BACK TO NORMAL ALREADY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OR DO YOU THINK THAT CAN REMAIN ELEVATED ELEVATED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME JUST TO GET I KNOW IT'S HARD TO PREDICT BUT <INAUDIBLE> MARKET RELATED INCOME GOING FORWARD AND IF I CAN ASK JUST ONE FOLLOW UP ON ON THE PROVISION UM YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND GIVEN THIS <INAUDIBLE> YOU KIND OF FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE YOU ARE BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF RISK BEFORE THIS QUARTER HAD BEEN AROUND 2.6 2.7 YOU KNOW BARRING ANY CHANGES IN THE SCENARIO THAT YOU SEE RIGHT NOW IS THAT 2.6 2.7 WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT SORT OF GOING FORWARD AS WELL AGAIN BARRING ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN IN THE CURRENT SCENARIO OKAY THANK YOU I MEAN WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS UM YES WE HAVE HAD A GOOD RUNNING IN TERMS OF MARKET RELATED INCOME I THINK THAT THAT THE BANKS POSITION TO LOSE HOPE THE THE IMPORTANT POINT IS <INAUDIBLE> AND IN <INAUDIBLE> IT CONTINUES TO BE THE WAY THAT IT IS THEN YOU CAN EXPECT THAT WE CAN UM THAT WE CAN BASICALLY HAVE GOOD NUMBERS THERE I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN THE IN THE IN THE THIRD QUARTER NUMBERS AS GOOD AS THEY WERE IN THE IN THE IN THIS QUARTER BOTH I MEAN IT ALSO DEPENDS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IN TERMS OF THE PROVISIONS AND THE COST OF RISK <INAUDIBLE> YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT ABSOLUTELY EH YOU KNOW I THINK THAT EH ONCE YOU TAKE OUT THE PROVISIONS THAT WE DID THIS QUARTER I THINK THAT COST OF RISK SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE NUMBERS THAT EH WE WERE HAVING OVER THE LAST SAY FIVE QUARTERS EH BUT NOT TO LEVELS THAT WE'VE REPORTED THIS QUARTER SO SOME REQUIRE EH EH 300 PESOS POINT THAT THAT WOULD BE MY MY EH MY TAKE AND OBVIOUSLY AS YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW WITH INFORMATION THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE OKAY OKAY THANK YOU I'LL TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM THE LINE OF CARLOS GOMEZ FROM HSBC PLEASE GO AHEAD HELLO GOOD MORNING UM I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT CREDIT RISK BUT NOT TO YOUR CORPORATE BUT TO THE VIRTUAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM WE ALREADY SAW ONE COMPANY GOT HAS LIQUIDATED HAS BEEN PUT IN LIQUIDATION BUT EH BY THE NATIONAL BANKING COMMISSION UH <INAUDIBLE> CRISIS <INAUDIBLE> BEING UNABLE TO OPERATE SO EVENTUALLY ONE WOULD IMAGINE <INAUDIBLE> MIGHT GET INTO TROUBLE UH ARE YOU TAKING SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS UH IN REGARD TO ANY SECTORS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND DO- DO YOU THINK WE- YOU'LL ENCOUNTER MUCH TROUBLE OR MOST OF THEM WILL BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THIS OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU CARLOS I MEAN UM I MEAN IN ALL THESE PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AND DEPEND HOW LONG THE CRISIS IS GONNA TAKE I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE DOWN SOME FINANCIAL PLAYERS I MEAN THAT SINCE WE ARE- YES WE ARE BEING VERY CAUTIOUS AND REVIEWING AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT UH THEIR POSITION IS AND THEIR SITUATION UM AND WE'RE GONNA BASICALLY CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT AS THE CRISIS CONTINUES TO- TO- TO EVOLVE SO IN THAT SENSE UH WE ARE VERY CLOSE IN UH TO THAT PARTICULAR SECTOR WE DON'T HAVE- I MEAN WE ARE NOT A BIG LENDER TO THE SECTOR I MEAN UH UH I CAN TELL YOU THAT UM IF YOU UH THEY'RE NOT IN THE <INAUDIBLE> TEN MOST IMPORTANT CLIENTS THEY'RE NOT FINANCIAL PLAYERS SO IN THAT SENSE WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE <INAUDIBLE> THAT WE HAVE OUT TO THEM BUT WE ARE VERY CONCERN TAKING A LOOK AND MONITORING UH THEM ALL THE TIME OKAY HOPEFULLY THE CRISIS IS SHORTER AND NOBODY ELSE GOES DOWN BUT UM WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS ANY PARTICULAR <INAUDIBLE> THAT USING MONEY <INAUDIBLE> SPECIAL MONITORING YOU KNOW MARKET-RELATED OR CONSUMER-RELATED OR PAYROLL I THINK MICROFINANCE IS A SECTOR THAT WE NEED TO BE UH VERY CLOSE MONITORING WE DON'T HAVE TO- WE DON'T HAVE TO S- A LOT BIG <INAUDIBLE> TO THEM BUT THAT'S A SECTOR THAT COVERING WOULD BE COMPLICATED AS ALWAYS IN THESE TYPE OF SITUATIONS THE PEOPLE THAT SUFFER THE MOST ARE THE ONES THAT UH ARE ON THE- ARE ON THE BASE OF THE PYRAMID SO UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE CASE AND WE ARE MONITORING THAT QUITE CLOSELY THANK YOU SO MUCH TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM <UNK> FROM <INAUDIBLE> PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS REGARDING LIQUIDITY UM I MEAN YOUR LIQUIDITY <INAUDIBLE> IMPROVED NICELY IN THE QUARTER IN PART IT WAS ALL BE- TO THE $1.8 BILLION THAT ISSUANCE <INAUDIBLE> BUT ALSO GIVEN A VERY STRONG INCREASE IN FUNDING WITH BANKS IN THIS QUARTER SO COULD YOU PLEASE PROVIDE SOME <INAUDIBLE> TO THE NATURE OF THIS FUNDING SOURCE AND WHAT WOULD BE YOUR STRATEGY FOR LIQUIDITY IN THE COMING QUARTERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH EH HI ALONZO UM YOU KNOW THERE ARE P- SEVERAL FACTORS UH REGARDING LIQUIDITY PAY- PAY- I THINK THAT THE- THE MOST UM UH RELEVANT IS OUR YOU KNOW HOW WE FUND A- A YOU KNOW THE- LET'S SAY THE LOAN TO THE <INAUDIBLE> THAT AS MENTIONED WAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST UH NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE REPORTED SINCE WE BECAME A LISTED COMPANY CLOSE TO 92% SO THAT'S- THAT'S IN MY OPINION THAT'S THE MOST <INAUDIBLE> AND FUNDAMENTAL WAY OF UH LOOKING AT IT THEN UM AS YOU RIGHTLY MENTIONED THE UM THE DEBT ISSUANCE IS UH YOU KNOW CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE INCREASE OF OUR UH UH LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO AND WE ARE MONITORING YOU KNOW ANY P- P- POTENTIAL USE OF UH THE COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR CLIENTS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S PROBABLY THE ONE UH UH LET'S SAY RISK THAT COULD MATERIALIZE IN- IN- IN THE SHORT TERM WE HAVE AMPLE OF LIQUIDITY TO HONOR OR PAY YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE COMMITTED LINE OF CREDIT THAT UH THAT WE HAVE BUT THAT- THAT'S THE ONE- THE MOST RELEVANT UH DRIVER IN TERMS OF CONSUMPTION OF UH LIQUIDITY THE OTHER TYPES OF UH YOU KNOW EVENTS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY YOU KNOW ARE YOU KNOW ARE MORE GRADUAL YOU KNOW AND THOSE COULD BE YOU KNOW UH A CONTRACTION IN DEPOSITS THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT UM AND I THINK THAT THE BANK HAS UH MANAGED UM QUITE PRACTICALLY YOU KNOW PER LIQUIDITY TO BE PREPARED FOR YOU KNOW ANY POTENTIAL P- P- YOU KNOW REALLY WORST CASE UH SCENARIO FURTHER DOWN THE- THE ROAD THANK YOU AND REGARDING THE LINE OF UH YOUR BALANCE SHEET THE LINE OF BANK AND OTHER LOANS UH WHICH INCREASED 81% IN QUARTER ONE QUARTER DO YOU- DO YOU- DO YOU THINK THESE LINE WOULD- WILL REMAIN AS CLOSE TO THOSE LEVELS OR DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SUBSTITUTE THESE SOURCE OF FUNDING WITH PROBABLY OTHER DEBT ISSUANCES IN COMING QUARTERS WHAT YOUR STRATEGY THERE UH YOU KNOW WE- WE MONITOR CONSTANTLY THE DIFFERENT UH TYPE OF UH FUNDING SOURCES AND DEPENDING ON THE-

A CREDIT CARD THAT WENT UP FROM 4.14% TO 4.82% AND THE- AND IT'S A MISS BASICALLY GOING FROM 2.61% TO 3.37% UM AS- AS WE DISCUSS UH DURING THE QUARTER- DURING THE CALL UM UH YOU KNOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO DID NOT UH ENROLLED IN THE- IN THE SUPPORT PROGRAMS SO BUT UH WE'RE SEEING YOU KNOW THIS SLIGHT DETERIORATION HAS TO DO MORE WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE- THE PORTFOLIO OF THE CLIENTS THAT DID NOT- DID NOT ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN OUR VIEW GIVEN YOU KNOW THE- THE YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ECONOMY IT WAS JUST A YOU KNOW A SLIGHT

        "model_prediction": "Good day, everyone, and welcome to banco santander mexico's second quarter, twenty twenty earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. following the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. i'd like to turn the conference over to mr. ezequiel saavedra, managing director and head of investor relations. please go ahead. thank you. good morning and welcome to our second quarter, twenty twenty earnings conference call. we appreciate everyone's participation today. By now, everyone should have access to our earning press release and the presentation for today's call, both of which were distributed before the market opened today and can be found in our investor relations website. Presenting on our call today will be eduardo gorini, executive president and ceo, gilmar mena, our cfo, and roberto brand, executive general director of public affairs. We will review our second quarter results as well as provide an update on how we are operating under the health and safety protocols that are designed. To help mitigate the risks related to the covid nineteen pandemic then we will be happy to answer your questions during the q and a session before we begin our formal remarks, allow me to remind you that certain statements made during the course of this discussion constitute forward looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and including covid nineteen that could cause actual results to materially differ Different, including tactics that could be beyond the company's control. for an explanation of this risk, please refer to our filings with the sec and the mexican stock exchange. hector, please go ahead. thank you, hector. good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those in europe. thank you for joining our annual call today. i hope you and your families are healthy and safe as we discuss our last quarter, mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the health and The well-being of our employees and customers has remained our utmost priority before giving you an update on the measures we implemented in this regard, let me begin a review by providing context this past quarter has been quite challenging as we started seeing the impact of the pandemic on the mexican economy on our business and of course on our results despite the impact, let me assure you that our rank remains strong and focused first our capital and liquidity levels are solid and well above the minimum regulatory levels second we have a clear strategy which we are executing to support our customers and minimize the impact of the pandemic on the finances and third we expect to emerge from this difficult environment as a stronger institution business volumes closed the second quarter with high single digit year-on-year growth while we experienced an adverse shift in our portfolio mix towards lower yielding segments consumer and sme loans started to contract in line with market trends while the commercial and mortgage loans were resilient and continued to register spurts the timely measures implemented by banco de mexico and the cnbv have allowed us to maintain ample levels of liquidity and capital enabling us to offer our customers support mechanisms to temporarily alleviate their cash flow and the financial stress caused by the economic fallout of the pandemic. Although asset quality deteriorated slightly in the quarter, we made preemptive loan loss provisions of three point nine billion pesos in addition to the normal quarterly provisions in preparation for our future losses. we would revise this amount in the future as more information becomes available on the performance of our loan portfolio during the coming quarters. as we normally do, we will provide an overview of our business environment, but let me emphasize again our conviction that Guatemala where mexico is very well positioned against the current and still growing economy impact of the covid nineteen pandemic in slide four we present select economic indicators that show the magnitude of the impact in the pandemic is having on economic activity in having on economic activity and employment as you may recall twenty twenty gdp growth expectations for the mexican economy were modest prior to the pandemic mainly due to weak private investment prospects With equitable and impartial indicators showing a contraction of more than twenty percent year on year in economic activity and thirty-seven percent year on year in drop in fixed investment, market consensus expectations have been revised down to around nine percent annual decrease in gdp during two twenty two thousand and twenty for additional context, this would be an economic contraction not seen in many decades. Activities resulted in the loss of more than one million formal jobs during the second quarter according to social security data, but as many as twenty million jobs were lost taking into account informal employment following the past two severe economic crises back in ninety five and two thousand and nine it took seven quarters for the mexican economy to recover its previous level of economic activity however in the current one we consider It is unlikely that economy could recover within a similar period of time given the depth and magnitude of a global economic shock and the absence of any meaningful fiscal program to address the severe contraction in its employment. with external demand rounding only gradually and without any mechanism to alleviate households, income loss, an open economy like mexico faces a slow path to recovery from previous to previous activity levels with two thousand and twenty one growth, prospects being forecasted at only plus three percent. it could take three to four years to recover two thousand and nineteen levels of activity. under these conditions, inflation pressures should remain low. we expect three point six for two thousand and twenty. allowing banco de mexico to cut interest rates a little further. we expect another hundred basis points of cuts through the year through the year which would take the reference rate to around four percent a year. In summary, this scenario of low growth and low interest rates represents a challenging outlook for mexico's commercial and consumer environments and for our business. if you turn to slide five, you will notice that despite the severe shock to economic activity and employment, the system's loans and deposit volumes still show a significant year-over-year expansion of eight percent and fourteen percent, respectively. this is as may be. Explained by large and medium-sized companies and government entities that have drawn on the credit lines to maintain the liquidity of their balance sheets in order to continue operating during the months of which the stay-at-home guidelines have been in effect on the other hand, consumer loans showed a relevant contraction reflecting the initial impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior and of product origination practices being maintained by financial institutions. It is worth noting that system-wide demand deposits remain strong, up 18 18 percent year on year, likely reflecting heightened needs for liquidity among households and companies. collateral at home guidelines remain in effect. please turn to slide six or we would like to give you an update on the bank operations during the past few months. our health and business continuity protocols remain in effect. Such as suspending non-essential travel, limiting the number of people at gatherings and group events, and enhancing sanitation measures at branches, corporate offices, atms, and contact centers. as of today, most corporate employees continue working from home while only essential personnel are working on site approximately eighty percent of the bank branches are open and ninety two percent of our atm locations are open. functioning normally the bank's digital channels and contact centers have also been operating normally our digital monetary transactions increased sixty four percent year on year while our digital sales represented forty four percent of total sales close as much as they did last year as we continue promoting customer's use of digital channels which continue to drive adoption levels further more, more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore, more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore, more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore, more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore, more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore, more intelligent resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels furthermore, more intelligent resources We most operate in tools with server security being a priority during this critical time we have been supporting our customers through a debt relief program offering deferred payments for individuals and sme's and case by case debt restructuring to our corporate customers i will elaborate on this program in a moment as part of our commitment to our communities we have made numerous donations and supported initiatives that aid the medical community and vulnerable populations We also donated an app to the mexico city government which allows the population to self-diagnose based on symptoms, locate medical facilities within their capacity near them, and obtain information on the pandemic. on slide seven, you will find an overview of our debt support program that i mentioned before. currently, ninety percent of our total loan portfolio is under the payroll holiday program for individual and small and medium-sized enterprises. Six hundred thousand customers benefiting from it through this program, we are helping customers who have encountered liquidity programs by permitting them to skip long payment both interest and principal for four months without any penalty or cost. Because of this feature under the program, it is difficult to assess at this time the extent of the pandemic's impact on our asset quality. However, we have been proactive in addressing asset quality. Quality over the past few months by contacting our customers to better understand their financial situation and by analyzing their ability to pay more than fifty five percent of our branch network personnel is focused on recoveries calling customers directly likewise the collections and commercial and wealth departments segmented the portfolio by level of concern identifying risk and exposure according to customer quality through this more granular process we are Smart calling each type of client within thirty six different clusters we have also been analyzing our customer behavior patterns using our crm capabilities and know that more than ninety five percent of our payroll customers continue to receive their salaries for those payroll customers who are not longer receiving their salary we are collecting for unemployment insurance with current information we estimate that close to forty percent Our custodians should be able to continue honoring fully the conditions of all their loans. the need is simple. since it is still unclear if the rest will be able to remain current, we are offering upfront loan restructurings to many of them in order to speed up the recovery process. it will not be until the third and fourth quarters of this year that we will have sufficient hard data on the behavior of the portfolio. with regard to our commercial book, we are taking a conservative approach. A case-by-case approach to manage our exposure. as we did during the past critical periods, we have remained very close to our customers and are helping them navigate this current challenging environment. for those companies that face difficulties, we have been offering multiple alternatives to support them. our current portfolio of commercial structured loans is close to fifty billion pesos and accounts for sixteen percent of our loan portfolio with medium and large size corporates. in addition to actively managing our portfolio, know that seventy six percent of our payment holiday portfolio is associated with mortgages and esms, which both have warrants. within our total esm book, sixty seven percent of the portfolio is backed up by warrants issued by nafin, one of mexico's development banks, which allows us to share the risk with them, specifically for those esms arising in the refferal program, seventy five percent of the portfolio is backed up by warrants issued by nafin, one of mexico's development banks, which allows us to share the risk with them, specifically for those esms arising in the refferal program, seventy five percent of the portfolio is backed up by warrants issued by nafin, one of mexico's development banks Of them have warrants. furthermore, payrolls and auto loans, nine percent of the deferred portfolio, are semi-secured given the collateral represented by each customer's salary and car. please turn to slide eight, for i would like to share with you some of the key characteristics of our mortgage portfolio which is giving us relative comfort due to its defensive nature. our organic mortgage portfolio accounts for eighty six percent. Percentage of all our mortgages the existing portfolio has a long-to-value ratio of forty four percent while originations has an ltv of seventy percent providing very good warranty coverage the npl ratio of this portfolio is three point six percent and has been quite stable for some time for the past two years our hypotheekbank nv mortgage has allowed us to attract higher income customers which are more defensive Current environment to expound on this point, our average ticket has been increasing since our launch since we launched our product and is currently not only the highest among our peers but serves thirty seven percent higher than the average ticket of our peers. in addition, ipoheta plus customers are loyal as they also have their perks and their credit cards with us having a low loan to value ratio as well as being the main bank of our customer lowers the price The probability of non-payment at this type of customer tends to prioritize the home mortgages in economic downturns all in all considering the level of warrants we have the structure of our portfolio and the proactive measures we are taking we consider we are on the right path to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the quality of the loan portfolio on slide nine let me comment on origination dynamics and the mix we have seen so far In the past few months, commercial loans continue to support total loan growth. therefore, their contribution within local loan origination increased from seventy eight percent in the second quarter of nineteen to eighty two percent in the second quarter in two thousand and twenty. behind these, commercial loans now represent sixty four percent of our total loans. this changing mix has had an impact on our n a i as will be explained later in the call. In terms of origination dynamics, we have seen encouraging trends during the quarter that i'll note here. in the mortgage and commercial segments, june's loan origination registered relevant sequential improvements compared to may, surpassing january's twenty two year low. in consumer loans, june loan origination remains twenty five percent below the first quarter in twenty twenty monthly average. however, it is under thirty three percent. percent above the two thousand and twenty minimum which left april. as you can see on the slide, our capital and liquidity positions are very strong. at the end of june, our common equity tier one c p i one ratio stood at eleven point six percent. fifty eight basis points above march and was significantly in excess of the eight point two percent minimum requirement established for the banks of our size. the decision taken during april's shareholders meeting to postpone the dividend payment for two thousand and nineteen has allowed us to further strengthen our capital position in terms of liquidity our second quarter in two thousand and twenty liquidity coverage ratio reached two hundred and eleven percent well above the bank of mexico's regulatory requirement and supported by the senior notes we issued back in april before turning the call over to lydia, i would like to finish my remarks. By stating that we have been active, safe, and decisive in further strengthening our bank in order to mitigate the impact of the current crisis on our operations, in addition to implementing proper protocols and measures to protect our employees and customers. We have continued serving clients with high standards of customer service through our branches and digital channels. Again, we are confident that our bank is well positioned to support our customers as they recover from this unprecedented crisis. Let me pass hold the call over to dhirendra who will review the part's most important trends and metrics. thank you. thank you, ektor. good day, everybody. please turn to slide eleven for an overview of our recent loan performance. total loans expanded seven percent year-over-year, but contracting contracted three percent sequentially, given strong corporate loan demand at the end of the first quarter. low-margin segments are growing twice as fast as high-margin segments, where sme's and credit cards contracted nine percent. and six percent year in year respectively due to the economics to the economy's weak performance. by contrast, mortgage loans increased a solid nine percent year in year and expanded thirteen percent when excluding the runoff effect of g e and n i g portfolios which was well above market growth. high margin segments have reduced their contribution to net interest income by almost a hundred basis points. individual loans on the slide twelve slow down, growing four percent on a year-on-year basis mainly supported by mortgages. as mentioned previously, mortgages have proved to be a defensive segment within the mexican market during the past periods of economic instability. with this in mind, we decided to lower even more the rate of our ipotecaplus product to seven point seventy five percent, targeting loyal customers. as of june, close to sixty percent of our mortgage origination was coming from ipotecaplus, which allows us to increase cross-selling of other products. Products. in july we launched a new product, a new mortgage product called hipoteca libre, which is the first commission-free mortgage product in mexico. unique characteristics of this product are the customers do not have to pay an application fee, monthly commission, or a home appraisal. nor are life and unemployment insurance required. leaving only nominal fees to be paid by the customer when obtaining this product. as you can see, even during these challenging times, we haven't stopped innovating. tailing. there continues to be a time warp in credit card loans as we take a more conservative approach toward this segment. in addition to managing customer credit limits, credit card usage declined thirty percent year over year during the quarter as many clients stayed at home. this drop had a negative impact on balances, of course. as to usage, rates reached a very low level in april they recovered in may and june, although remaining slightly. strictly below first quarter levels. growth in our consumer loans has been concentrated in payday loans, growing two point five percent year on year and still above the market per cnbv data as of the end of may. personal loans continue to contract, consistent with our strategy to focus on more defensive segments of the market, as noted by sector. finally, our other loan production in june more than doubled compared to previous quarters average, boosted by our new commercial and business loans. Alliance with masda turning to slide thirteen growth in our base of loyal and digital customers continues to demonstrate important progress with year-on-year increases of almost seventeen percent and thirty-one percent respectively despite the challenging business environment loyalty penetration that is loyal to active customers stands at thirty-five percent four hundred points higher than a year ago we have seen continuous growth in the use of digital channels as customers have stayed home during the pandemic this quarter's product sales via digital channels accounted for forty four percent of the total, almost doubling year ago levels. digital monetary transactions also spiked, reaching almost one third of the total, while mobile transactions represented ninety three percent of total digital transactions versus eighty four percent in twenty nineteen. mobile customers also kept growing at a solid thirty eight percent year on year rate, reaching four point three million at the end of the quarter. As you can see on slide fourteen, commercial loans grew nine percent year-over-year, but decreased sequentially as some corporates started prepaying some lines withdrawn in the first quarter of this year. government and middle market segments continued to register double-digit year-over-year expansion, although their sequential evolution showed lower and stable volumes, respectively. sme loans registered a fourth sequential quarterly contraction, as this segment showed a weakening trend even before the pandemic. Outstanding loans are similar to the ones we had in the fourth quarter of twenty seventeen ten quarters ago the downward trend is also related to our lower risk appetite for lending in the sme segment given that more than fifty percent of our sme loan book joined the payment holiday deferral program and those customers cannot use their credit lines while in the program, loan origination in this segment will remain low until we have more visibility on the performance of the economy moving on to total deposits on the slide fifteen this increased ten percent year on year while quarter on quarter we saw a two percent contraction during the quarter there was a shift between demand and time deposits favoring lower interest rates as of the second quarter of this year demand deposits represented sixty four percent of total deposits and were up eleven percent year on year deposit growth from individuals stands out at twenty three percent year on year supported by our promotion campaigns to Attract these types of deposits after an atypical first quarter of this year, deposits from individuals continue to grow faster than corporate deposits in line with our strategy to further increase our exposure to retail deposits retail deposits now represent thirty three percent of total deposits almost four hundred basis points higher than its contribution in the first quarter of twenty eighteen turning to slide sixteen we have a very strong capital and liquidity position Aspects a had highlighted we maintain a sound funding position with a net loans to deposits ratio of ninety one point eight percent one of the strongest levels since becoming a listed company our liquidity coverage ratio increased eighty nine percent points relative to the first quarter of this year and now stands at two hundred and eleven percent well above the regulatory threshold of a hundred percent we also remain very comfortable with our debt profile with manageable debt maturities regarding Capitalization, our ratio increased forty six basis points sequentially to sixteen point seven percent, reflecting the postponement of the dividend payments as recommended by the banking commission while our core tier one ratio was up fifty eight basis points to eleven point six percent and our core tier one ratio stood at thirteen point zero three percent. As you can see on slide seventeen, net interest income decreased four percent year-on-year and six percent quarter-on-quarter. a result, net interest margin contracted a hundred and twenty eight basis points to four point five percent for the quarter. our margin decline was a result of lower interest rates and lower balances within the high yielding segments coupled with higher average assets as a consequence of a significant increase in our securities portfolio. without this last effect, our net interest margin would have contracted only thirty five basis points. as a sector, we're expecting net interest margin. Income to continue contracting during the remainder of the remainder of the year due to anticipated decreases in interest rates combined with a change in our portfolio mix where growth will likely come from low yielding segments and with a likely contraction in high yielding segments however these downward pressures will be partially mitigated by our expanded investment in securities portfolio please move on to slide eighteen net commissions and fees decreased two point one percent year on year affected by The double-digit decline in credit card transactions credit card usage decreased forty two percent in april thirty four percent in may and fourteen percent in june on a year-on-year basis insurance fees register only a slight contraction given renewals of several groups insurance policies which partially compensated for softer insurance demand insurance represents almost thirty percent of our total fees and has proven to be a defensive segment Even considering the the the pandemic with health and life insurance growing while retail insurance is slightly decreased our investment banking team has been very active mainly in financial advisory services which translated into strong fee growth of thirty one percent in this line of our business which partially compensated for weaker results in other areas mainly credit card fees turning to slide nineteen gross premium income grew nine percent year on year driven by a solid performance in market-related income which was significantly above our historical average levels of between six hundred to eight hundred million pesos per quarter. declared interest rates the fx market volatility especially during april and may supported market-making income in addition, we saw investment in securities in order to further strengthen our liquidity position, generating non-recurring gains that boosted these quarters results. All this contributed for market related income that accounted for thirteen point eight percent of gross operating revenues, three point five times higher than the historical average of four percent. Moving on to provisions on slide twenty nine in light of the deterioration of mexico's economic environment and in anticipation of a possible deterioration of our loan portfolio both due to the pandemic in june we registered a special charge of low loans provisions on top both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post both post Those normally require the three point nine billion pesos charge, raised total provisions to eight point thirty five billion pesos in the quarter, up eighty eight percent year on year and sixty two percent sequentially. we have made this estimate of pre-emptive provisions with the information currently at hand. however, this amount could be revised in the future as more information becomes available. cost of risk for the quarter stood at three point nine percent. increase and forty nine basis points sequentially our total empla ratio showed a slight twenty eight basis points year over year increase to two point five percent mainly due to the s&m segment together with mortgage and credit card portfolios as explained earlier these ratios only reflect the performance of eighty one percent of our total portfolio that does not fall under the payment holiday program we consider this ratio encouraging as its evolution is quite benign When considering the significant deterioration in economic activity and employment however, it would not be until the third and fourth quarter of these years of this year that the debtors' program will end it will be at that time that mpl ratios will reflect the real magnitude of the economic impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide twenty one administrative and promotional expenses increase one point two percent year on year reflecting the impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide twenty two administrative and promotional expenses increase one point two percent year on year reflecting the impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide twenty three administrative and promotional expenses increase one point two percent year on year reflecting the impact of the pandemic now please turn to slide twenty four administrative and promotional expenses increase one point two percent year on year reflecting the impact of the pan to control personal costs mainly reserves for variable compensation and amortization expenses related to the strategic and it investments that we made over the past three years as we will continue investing in the digitalization of the bank and in technology upgrades we're targeting greater operating efficiencies in the common quarters such as the ability to reduce the number of business trips variable compensation as well as limiting base salary increases among other improvements less business travel and salary caps Has already led to a sequential one point nine percent decrease in our total expenses during the second quarter of this year such expense controls combined with strong operating income and the conclusion of our three year investment plan contributed to a three hundred and fifty eight basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio which decreased to forty point seven percent on a six month basis the ratio improved two hundred and twenty seven basis points year on year to forty two point three percent Turning to profitability on slide twenty two, you will note that our earnings were mainly impacted by the special low notes provisions that we discussed earlier. Profit before taxes was down twenty four percent year over year for the quarter and eleven percent for the first half of the year. Net income decreased twenty five percent year over year to four point two billion pesos while our effective tax rate increased thirty eight basis points year over year to twenty five point three percent. This resulted in an eleven point five percent Decrease in net income for the first six months of twenty twenty which was nine point six billion pesos return on equity was eleven point nine percent, five hundred forty three basis points below the year ago level and down three hundred sixty two basis points sequentially year to date, arroyo reported three hundred twenty eight basis points to thirteen point five percent Eckhart, please go ahead. thank you, riviere. please turn to slide twenty three. let me share with you some final thoughts on what lies ahead. given the unprecedented nature of this health crisis and the uncertainty surrounding its duration and magnitude, we anticipate only a very gradual recovery of our economy which has obvious implications with regard to our operating environment. we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial. we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial. we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial. we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial. we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial. we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial. we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial. we expect our long portfolio will likely be driven by commercial. we expect special loans mainly medium and large corporations government loans as well as mortgages the consumer will recover very gradually and this will depend on the speed of the eventual turnaround in employment economic activity as well as business and consumer confidence although visibility on asset quality is limited due to the parental holiday program which has been talking and taking rapid and decisive action in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. on the loan book a recoveries plan which includes a very detailed and in-depth analysis of each customer's situation is allowing us to pre-emptively and swiftly prepare the bank for complicated quarters ahead. in particular, we have allocated a large number of current employees and branches involved in carrying out the recovery strategy. we will continue focusing on enhancing customer loyalty and on cross-selling non-credit products to support non-interest income. Our income we also remain committed to making additional investments in the bank transformation mainly in it and digitalization but we will continue to look for efficiencies in other lines with a strict cost control in order to support the bottom line and finally rest assured that our banks is operating from a position of strength with robust capital and high liquidity levels that will allow us to overcome this complicated but what we believe are temporary circumstances.

Opportunity to signal for questions. thank you. our first question is from the line of rhys moline from scotia bank. please go ahead. hi, my question is on the operating outlook. the disclosures are excellent as always. and i like the way you presented it. thank you very much. my question is on the operating outlook. the disclosures are excellent as always. and i like the way you presented it. thank you very much. our first question is from the line of rhys moline from scotia bank. please go ahead. hi, my question is on the operating outlook. the disclosures are excellent as always. and i like the way you presented it. thank you very much. my question is on the operating outlook. the disclosures are excellent as always. and i like the way you presented it. thank you very On slide nineteen, we can look at the main main drivers for the operating income, and clearly as you we talked about, market-related revenue was very strong, well above historical levels, about fourteen percent of the total operating income compared to, let's say, three or four percent in the past. these are different times, but how should we think about efficiency going forward? you talked about cost control. we saw that. if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you Just give us a general sense. you mentioned there are certain costs you can control and you are controlling. can you talk a little bit about the physical infrastructure? is there an opportunity to rationalize the physical branch network after the investments you've made? what should we be looking for in terms of efficiency going forward? the dynamic is quite skewed from all of these moving parts. the very high trading And the low, the low revenues giving what's going on. thank you. thank you. look, i mean, as you have said, i mean, and if you take a look at our numbers, basically we have decreased the operation cost of the bank quite significantly. i mean, first of all, i mean, not traveling and not doing many things, basically have reduced naturally the cost. we have also been very strict in the new projects and new situations. I mean, we are basically focusing all our expenses in it to support the backbone and to be ready for what's coming so in that sense, that's going to be our priority secondly, we are taking a look and we're doing a deep dive in terms of all our infrastructure and we're not going to get take i mean, rough decisions in terms of closing down a big number of branches or anything like that I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE RATIONALLY LOOKING AT EACH OF THE MICRO MARKETS THAT WE HAVE DIVIDED THE COUNTRY INTO AND WE WILL DECIDE WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN THERE SO BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY STRICKT IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE GROWTH OF THE POST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IN TERMS OF BRANCHES WE ACTUALLY HAVE DECREASED THE NUMBER OF TOTAL BRANCHES WE HAVE JUST WE HAVE BEEN VERY INTELLIGENT IN THE WAY WE Branches which we are gonna basically be taking a little bit more time than the time that we were thinking of of upgrading all the branches are not up to the standard so this exactly what we're doing we're gonna basically rationalize all of all of expending and do it on where the most important thing is that is basically the it platform and the digitalization of the bank so in that sense we're gonna be working We're very concentrated on that. we also believe that i mean given that we have been able to operate at the bank under these income taxes, we have a huge amount of people basically working from home you basically get to understand exactly how really how much people do you need what can you rationalize, et cetera. so what you're going to see from us is that we're going to be very responsible in the way we manage that and concentrate on those points where we're working currently on that. We are working on our three-year plan and we are basically including all these in order to do so. maybe as a follow-up, just some comments on what you've seen throughout your peers in descent and their group in the region or elsewhere. are there other things you think that could be applied to mexico that could help? perhaps on the side of the banking system, perhaps in terms of terms of Operationally or it or or any factors at all thank you what we're doing basically is for example i mean in terms of developing digital platforms et cetera what we're doing it we're doing it now instead of each country basically developing the platforms we are doing it together so that basically is going to help out quite a lot so it's not mexico for example right now in mexico we're developing the new super app and the new super app is going to be used in all the other countries No, for example, the embodiment for sme's you are using the one that is being developed in europe. so all those type of things are going to help us out basically in reducing our cost for the digital infrastructure that we're developing. and we're working together much more within the group in order to do that. so you will see that i mean the cost of basically developing things and it's going to come down due to the fact that we're doing it together with the rest of our ten sister banks. So, those three factors are very important for implementing this at this point. thank you, i appreciate it. the next question comes from the line of jorge gudi from morgan stanley. please go ahead. the next question comes from the line of jorge gudi from morgan stanley. please go ahead. hi, good morning, everyone. i wanted to ask about net interest margin. you you you pointed out that that you expect Further complications in the next couple of quarters given falling rates and weak loan demand and mixed deterioration as you look at twenty twenty one in the context of what you said on not a strong economic recovery next year and with average rates next year being much lower than twenty twenty if indeed rates at about four percent What is the expectation for net interest margin next year and for n.a.i. is it possible that we're likely to see another year of n.a.i. compression and to what extent that could be offset elsewhere in the pnl and my second question is on the coverage ratio and i know that banks Banks normally don't target a coverage ratio. i get it. but, but evidently, the, the size of your reserves have a relationship to the size of your loan book, the size of your npls, and the size of the amount of loans that are on their restructuring. and so when i look at your coverage ratio, it looks like one hundred one hundred thirty eight percent. it looks low relative to where banco noroeste ended up at two hundred one percent and bancolombia at one hundred eighty five percent. So i wonder why why not just take a much bigger charge on provisions this order evidently there is there's a lot of uncertainty ahead and the more the better and and so is this peas meal just going to potentially put more pressure on your earnings going forward rather than just take a really big one soup and raise your coverages to north of two hundred percent Likely made something you'll do in the third order. thank you. look, eric, i will ask this sector, i will ask this department to answer the first part and then i will ask them to be here to complete on the basic numbers of n i o, okay. i mean, first of all, i mean, if you saw the presentation, we are basically changing the mix of all of the credit long portfolio. okay. first of all, i mean, if you have seen, we have decreased quite a lot our Pursuant unfortunately it is a means given the lack of warrants from the government from lafayette ok so the portfolio has dropped almost ten percent so in that sense that basically is a high yield portfolio which is going to continue to shrink unless we see some warrants from the government and you if you see our portfolio which is quite important we have like sixty two percent of it already warranted by lafayette ok the court's ruling this basically goes to answer your second question The question in terms of the amount of the amount of reserves that we have done then you see that also we see that for example consumer credit and consumer loans are going to decrease as well so the mix is completely changing and we're going i mean we're going basically back to where we were five years ago when we had much more exposure to corporates and to medium-sized companies than to consumer loans remember that At different levels, okay? so that's why nia is shrinking. on the other side, what we also been doing is we were pricing and we are very strict on pricing risk. okay? so we've been increasing the margin on the corporate loans quite significantly due to that fact, that we are basically looking at the risk that we are taking and we are looking very closely at the ratings of those companies and we are pricing accordingly. This is not a situation in which we want to spend the portfolio of the great portfolios just to expand it we are basically doing it just to the companies that we believe have a future and will be there in the next few years and both are pricing the risk accordingly. so in that sense you will find us going towards that also the other concentration is mortgages which we believe there is a sector still of growth. and as you know, there is a lack of Or a big deficit in terms of homes in mexico. so we believe there is still a part of the population that can afford a mortgage mortgages is penetration in mexico was quite low versus the rest and also low penetration is quite low. so we believe there is a chance to to to continue to penetrate that sector and maybe on payrolls on some situations we will basically be also lending in that in that part. i mean, auto loans also we have seen some interesting developments there. we have seen some interesting developments there. we have seen some interesting developments there. we have seen some interesting developments there. we have seen some interesting developments there. we have seen some interesting developments there. we have seen some interesting developments there. we have seen some interesting developments there. we have seen some interesting developments there. very cautious approach to it so in that sense the mix of the portfolio is going to change and probably we'll be able to let you know exactly how do we see ai evolving in terms of what you were asking in terms of the reserves we we we actually been doing reserves according to what we believe we are doing in terms of how the portfolio is is is behaving at this point what i can tell you is that the portfolio not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not Payment holidays is behaving much, much better than we believed that it was gonna that it was gonna turn actually, i'm quite surprised about it. hopefully it continues that way. but in that sense, we are basically being in my opinion being very responsible in the amount of research that we are making at this point also we have done a tremendous job with the data and That we have in reviewing the portfolio on holidays and that portfolio is being divided as we said in thirty six clusters. okay these clusters have been divided upon upon the amount of risk that we have on each particular situation and in some of these portfolios even before the payment holiday ends we are already talking to clients and discussing the way that we could get paid. Pay on those particular situations because what we believe is that whoever gets paid first is the one again there is the one that is going to get paid. so we are basically being very aggressive on that sense to talk to our clients and basically trying to get that and to recover that portfolio. as you have seen fifty percent of our branches have been turned into collecting branches. i mean to basically this we're dedicating our executives to collect. We have divided them up on them in the sectors that we believe are the ones that are the ones that are gonna be much more important in the economy or that are gonna be hit the most in the economy. so in that sense, we really were very well prepared although i mean, nevertheless it's always a lot of uncertainty what's happening. and we didn't want to go overboard. we believe it's the right approach. the right approach is the one that we have made. but we will continue to do so. Over the next few months, evolution, but i can tell you is that we're going to be very conservative in the way we manage that okay, lily, i don't know if you want to complete absolutely, absolutely, lily, i would like to to compliment on what you mentioned a great talking to you, jorge, long time no speak in terms of a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, Some background information that i think it's it's quite relevant the the speed at which interest rates have come down in mexico is is is significant you know, just in this quarter the average of the reference reference rate came down a hundred and twenty three basis points that's the the fastest decline that we've seen in the recent history we we didn't see an increase of those you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you Of that magnitude when when interest rates were were coming up ok so that's one thing to have in mind that the the the impact in nim that you see in this quarter i think is is probably the most severe that we're going to see in a relative basis relative to the first quarter of this year and relative to the second quarter of last year ok also bear in mind that when interest rates were close to four percent As we probably agree with you that that's where we're headed you know our nim was close to five percent you know and this was you know the second and third quarter of twenty sixteen i think that you know the the the number that we reported the four forty eight percent in this quarter it has to do with the with what i was referring to you know the speed at which interest rates came down ok and also on top of that you have the The you know the change in a mix on our the loan site and also the fact that in order to protect the net interest income from interest rates coming down we we increased our investment in securities portfolio significantly you know and those are you know lower margin activities assets relative to the loan portfolio just just to share with you we've bought, you know, this taking into account, you know, both, you know, divestments and maturities the overall growth in our pay investment securities portfolio is ninety six billion pesos over the last twelve months. so what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, you know, what we expect coming down is, On the road, you know, for the rest of twenty twenty and the, you know, next year. i think that, you know, having said that, it's, there's still a lot of uncertainty. you know, i think that, probably, the, the most severe numbers in terms of nym are the ones that we saw this quarter. you know, there's probably, you know, ten to fifteen basis points, probably, further adjustment or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, Light improvement for the rest of the year okay and next year i think that we will probably get to see names similar or slightly above to the ones that we were seeing in this quarter okay now regarding the coverage ratio you're totally right in the sense that we don't target a coverage ratio if that's that's a result in number and also you know when you Make reference to you know our number one hundred thirty eighty percent looks slow relative to banorte. Banorte in the first quarter of this year they had a hundred forty percent. in these in the second quarter they did as we did also know increase the provisions but different to us you know they did a significant charge off four point six billion pesos so that's why you know their corruption increased to two hundred a Percentage i'm probably just elaborating elaborating elaborating more on what tector mentioned you know the level of provisions that we have are in line with the expected losses that we we estimate you know you might have a you know or you might question you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under you know whether we this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that under you know under for current circumstances, we we have definitely done different types of sensitivity analysis or scenario analysis okay so if there's a v type recovery in the mexican economy you know we have with these quarterly provisions we're you know more than covered you know for the rest of the year now do we think that there's gonna be a v type recovery in the mexican economy i don't think so you know it's very you know low probability Now we have assessed you know the the our level of provisions according to other type of scenarios, you know, more a u type or an adverse scenario having a gdp contraction of twelve and a half percent you know and under those circumstances, these quota provisions are not enough for the entire year there could be close to seventy five percent depending on the magnitude of the gdp A contraction that that you assume ok so so there should be a direct correlation between expected losses and provisions and the provisions that we are putting forward we think that with the information that we have are quite strong to cover you know expected losses if the economy ends up costing attracting more than we are expecting right now definitely we will need to provide additional provisions something that i i encourage you to look at if you haven't done so yet you know the central bank banco central released in the stability financial stability report published a few weeks ago an analysis regarding mpls for the entire system And what they did is look at information from the entire banking system for the last twenty years and they, you know, using an econometric model they, they estimated, you know, what are the critical variables that determine lp's and they break down the, the loan portfolio in consumer loans in mortgage loans and corporate loans so, so once they, they determine, you know, these, these econometric models, they, they determine, you know, what are the critical variables that determine lp's and they break down the, the loan portfolio in consumer loans in mortgage loans and corporate loans so, so once they, they determine, you know, these, these econometric models, they, they determine, you know, what are the critical variables that determine lp's and they break down the, the loan portfolio The metric model then they provided a you know a shock with the variables that we're seeing lately and they estimated how much n p l ratios would derate for the entire banking system for consumer loans that would imply a thirty two percent increase for mortgages nineteen percent and for corporates also thirty two percent so when you do that math and you break it down A loan, you know, by the type of loan, by type of bank, you get to see, you know, this is obviously a bull's-eye estimate, because, obviously, every single bank has different practices in, you know, origination practices, and recoveries, and so on. but you can get a sense of the magnitude in terms of, you know, using this model, how much you you would expect that each bank would provision. okay. thank you. Thanks, hector lizarraga, for the detailed response. we will take the next question. it comes from the line of ernesto gavilondo from bank of america. please go ahead. hi, good morning, hector and divere. thanks for the opportunity. my first question is a follow-up on the preventive provisions of three point nine billion pesos. so you think this level of provisions would be enough for the rest of the year or for a year ahead? Going to evaluate to create more depending on the behavior of payments after the relief program and then my second question is a difficult one because we would like to know if you have exposure to aeromexico on the chapter eleven or twilight that has restructured loans with the banks for about a year but i understand if you cannot disclose your exposure so maybe if you can remind us how much of your loan book is exposed to airlines and how much is exposed to twilight that has restructured loans with the banks for about a year Much to food and beverage and it's there is a sector that is concerning you and and finally my last question is some competition in mortgage loans we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates of mortgages in light of the lower rates so how has been your strategy to attract more mortgage clients and how competitive is your interest rate thank you Thank you, minister. let me, let me start, and then the director will complement first of all, on the follow-up of provisions, like i haven't spoken many times to my cio, and he basically tells me that when i asked you and asked the same question, you're asking me at this point, and he basically says, look, i mean, i have a crystal ball so clear, and it is quite impossible. but it is going to be difficult to assess what we're doing. I mean what i can tell you is that we're doing our best job in basically reviewing the portfolio we do that every single day we review the behavior of it and we're basically trying to be as conservative as we can in order to manage it so and if we see that the portfolio continues to deteriorate or is much more complicated we're going to find out i mean the payment shock comes in the first week of august we're preparing for it Next week, actually, when the first loans that went into the penny holiday start to mature, and we'll see the we'll see how the performance of the portfolio is, and then we'll take, i mean, you're going to see our numbers write as, i mean, we want to take the provisions as soon as they come, if and when they're needed. Ok, our second point in aruba, mexico, yes, and aruba, yes, we do have exposure to them. Nothing that we cannot control or nothing too big for the size of the bank. i mean, our total exposure to airlines is not big. i mean, compared to the total size of the portfolio, i would say probably gilbride knows a percentage much better. but it is not big. i mean, it is not very significant versus the size of the bank. and we have done some provisions already on some of the exposure we have supplied to mexico. okay. We can tell you that in the provisions that we made, some of them are made to for the aluminium exposure which is not relevant in terms of falcaea yes we do have exposure to them also not i mean not significant and we are basically in the restructuring process as of now and we see that the company can recover fairly i mean i don't see that falcaea is gonna be a particular situation food and drink Available, i don't know if it's available. unfortunately, i don't have it in front of me. and we could get back to you on that, on that data rest. in terms of the competition on mortgage loans, it's quite important what we do. we have a important differentiation in terms of how we do mortgages versus our competition. if you take a look at what ipoqeta plus is, it's a completely different product that nobody has replicated in the mexican market. i mean, it's a completely different product that nobody has replicated in the mexican market. Some of the other banks basically have tried to do a little bit of what we do in ipoteka plc. ipoteka plc is the best rate available in the market. but in order to get a rate best available in the market which is seven point seventy five percent for a fifteen year mortgage you have to basically turn into turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. what in order to do that, you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. what in order to do that, you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. what in order to do that, you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. what in order to do that, you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. what in order to do Be able to get that rate, you basically have to have different products with us that basically you have to have your payroll, you have to direct deposit your utilities with us, you have to have your insurance, you have so there is something that you have to do in order to be able to access the rate in that regard what happens is even if the loan is at seven point seventy five and we're also very cautious in the loan to value that we do in that loan that's why I was explaining in the presentation that that's why our ticket for mortgage is thirty seven percent larger than the rest. so we go directly to the mortgage to the wealthy people, okay? to the people that are in the best situation right now. so we believe that our portfolio is more resilient in these particular situations and also that we have the best client because those are the ones that basically can achieve this rate and can achieve this and have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a Characteristics to act in this type of product so that's why the portfolio we believe is going to behave well and it's going to be managed or is going to behave in a nice, in a nice, in a nice way due to that fact okay so and we have seen the way the portfolio has performed and we see that the performance is according to our expectations given the very complicated circumstances so in that regard I mean, there is competition. i mean, there are some banks. i mean, a couple of banks have tried to come in and basically compete with us, head-to-head in these types of situations. but they have not been able to have the same type of product that we sell to the market. then we came out with another product that is the hypotheca free. the hypotheca free basically has the particularity that has everything included in the rate. you don't have any fees, any commissions. you don't have to pay for any ancillary costs or anything like that. so that particular thing For people that i mean that they believe that we have a lot of things under the table and there were no completely clear this is completely transparent to the client and that hypotheca is above nine percent that's the rate and and thus for a different type of client so we have a chinese menu for every type of client that would like to access what we do and for example the hypotheca free goes to a different sector that is new to us That is basically clients with a lower ticket. and there are some of these clients that are very good and have very good credit quality. and that's where we decided to compete in that sector. i don't know if this answered your question, ernest, and please bear with me. sure, ernest. regarding your first question, as i previously mentioned, you know, it depends on the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the How severe is the gdp contraction this year, you know, and how that impacts the capacity for clients to pay back their loans we think that the you know, as mentioned, if there's a you know, like a u type recovery and you know, gdp contracting somewhere around ten to twelve percent then we have made with the provisions of this quarter more than half of what we required. AND THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT WE REQUIRE YOU KNOW WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW OK SO BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON HOW THIS EVOLVES YOU KNOW AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE CLOSELY MONITORING A YOU KNOW HOW OUR CLIENTS ARE ARE BEHAVING OK NOW ON YOUR SECOND QUESTION REGARDING THE EXPOSURE THAT WE HAVE TO ILLICIT MEXICO AND EL SALVADOR YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY FOR CONF these two exposures that we have are not within our top ten exposures as ehtion mentioned we have already provisioned the partially the exposure that we have with ido mexica that's close to forty five percent of the exposure that we have that is not that the material okay and i don't have with me the breakdown in terms of food and beverage the breakdown that we have that i have right now is more the one that the cnbc uses more for regulatory purposes And don't do don't have don't have that detail but for sure we can follow up with that ernest now this is super helpful eric and amy thank you very much we'll take the next question it comes from brian flores from city bank please go ahead hi eric good morning thank you for the opportunity to ask question do you have my question You mentioned that based on your crm capabilities, you saw a certain percentage of customers continuing to pay. what is that exact percentage? sorry? 40%? i think that's forty percent. thank you. and now for my question, you know, we saw some deterioration in asset quality across the board. and And as you mentioned overview of your s&d portfolio has a large degree of guarantee by ratiopharm my question is, is that correct, guyss? could you elaborate on anything on the collateral there and the not given default for for this segment? what are you expecting in terms of mpl for this segment? thank you. if you like, i can take that, thea, eh? if you like, i can take that, thea, eh? if you like, i can take that, thea, eh? if you like, i can take that, thea, eh? if you like, i can take that, thea, eh? if you like, i can take that, thea, eh? if you like, i can take that, thea, eh? if you like, i can take Credit cards do not have a collateral, you know, so, so laws given faults in in credit cards is close to a hundred percent, you know, you basically do not recover that much, you know, in terms of credit cards, you know, and you we think that that's that's gonna be one of the most impacted, you know, when you look at a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a Different types of loans that clients have, you know, we think that mortgages are the ones that you pay, you pay, you don't, you know, you continue paying, you know, if there's any just one loan that you continue paying, that's mortgages, and probably credit cards are, you know, at the bottom of your priorities, you know, when you have a trouble, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, In credit cards, you know, have been increasing slightly, but i think it's relatively stable when you compare it, you know, historically. so we don't, we don't expect, you know, a significant, you know, deterioration, no. but, you know, the cost of risk, you know, with the provisions that we're taking is close to eleven. Percent. so i don't know, ehctor, if you would like to, ehctor chavez, you would like to, to further the complement on this? Time? would you like to take the next question? Um, one question on the market related income. i know you need to know the big spike in the quarter. but do you think that goes back to normal already in the third quarter? or do you think that can remain elevated elevated for some period of time? to figure, i know it's tough to predict, but if you could give some more color on how you think about market related income going forward. and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and If we look at the cost of risk before this quarter, it had been around two point six, two point seven, you know, barring any changes in the scenario that you see right now, is that two point six, two point seven, what we should expect sort of going forward as well again, barring any significant changes in the current scenario, thank you. i mean, what i can tell you is, yes, we had a good run in terms of market related Income. i think the bank's well positioned to do so. the important point is volatility and if volatility continues to be the way it is, then you can expect that we can we can basically have good numbers there. i don't think we're going to have in the in the in the third quarter numbers as good as they were in the in the in this quarter but it won't depend on what happens in the next quarter. Days in the next month. in terms of the provisions and the cost of risk, did you want to comment on that? absolutely. right. ito. you know, i think that once you take out the destroyed areas, the provisions that we did this quarter, i think that cost of risk should be slightly higher than the numbers that we were having over the last five quarters. but not to levels that we reported. Quarter. so, somewhere, you know, below the three hundred basis points, that would be my, my take. and, obviously, as you mentioned, you know with the information that we currently have, okay? okay. well, thank you. we'll take the next question. it comes from the line of carlos gomez from h s b c. please go ahead. I have a question about credit risk, but not to your corporate, but to the stress of the financial system. we already saw one company that has been liquidated, has been put into liquidation by the national banking commission. this is becoming a very long crisis, with tens of billions of economy being unable to operate. so eventually, one would imagine that some situations might get into trouble. i would like to take special precautions. In regard to any effects of the financial system and do you think we'll you'll encounter much trouble or most of them will be able to go through this okay. thank you. thank you, carlos. i mean, i mean in all these particular situations, and depend how long the crisis is going to take. i mean, it's probably going to take down some financial patios. in that sense, we are yes, we are being very cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what they're doing. And their situation and we're gonna basically continue to monitor that as the crisis continues to to evolve. so in that sense we are very close in to a particular sector we don't have i mean we are not a big lender to the sector. i can tell you that if they're not in as the gilbane's or their ten most important clients there are not financial players. so in that sense, we are not worried about the exposure that we have out to them but we are very concerned taking a look and monitoring them more the time, okay. hopefully the crisis is shorter and nobody else goes down but let's see what happens in any particular sub-segments that you're interested in monitoring, you know, market-related or consumer-related or healthcare-related or education-related or any other area that you're interested in monitoring, you know, market-related or consumer-related or healthcare-related or education-related or any other area that you're interested in monitoring, you know, market-related or consumer-related or healthcare-related or education-related or any other area that you're interested in monitoring, you know, market-related or consumer-related or healthcare-related or education-related Related or payroll? i think microfinance is a sector that we need to be very close monitoring. we don't have to we don't have to a lot of big spurts to them but that's a sector that corporately would be complicated as always in these type of situations the people that suffer the most are the ones that are on the base of the pyramid. so unfortunately, that's the case and we are monitoring that quite closely. Thank you very much. let's take the next question. it comes from alonso garcia from credi suisse. please go ahead. good morning. thank you for taking my question. my question is regarding liquidity. i mean, your liquidity coverage ratio improved nicely in the quarter. in fact, it was above the one point eight billion dollars that each one does in april but also given a very strong increase in funding with banks this quarter. So, could you please provide some color to the nature of this funding source and what would be your strategy for liquidity in the coming quarters? thank you very much. hi, alonzo. the, you know, there are several factors regarding liquidity. the, you know, i think that the most relevant are, you know, how we fund the, you know, let's say, the loans to deposit ratio that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that has, that It was one of the strongest numbers that we have reported since we became a listed company, close to ninety two per cent. so that's, that's, in my opinion, that's the most robust and fundamental way of looking at it. then as you rightly mentioned, the debt issuance is you have contributed significantly to the increase of our liquidity coverage. Ratio and we are monitoring you know any potential use of the committed lines of credit that we have with our clients that if you look at it is probably the one let's say risk that could materialize in in the short term we have ample liquidity to honor every single committed line of credit that that we have but that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the one that's the And the most relevant driver in terms of consumption of liquidity. the other types of you know events that could impact our liquidity you know are are more gradual you know and those could be you know a construction in deposits that were not seen that and i think that the bank has managed a quite well Actively, you know, liquidity to be prepared for any potential, you know, really worst-case scenario further down the road. thank you. and regarding the line of in your balance sheet, the line of banks and other loans which increased eighty one percent quarter over quarter, do you think this line would remain at those levels or do you think you could substitute this source of funding with, you know, some other source of funding with, you know, some other source of funding with, you know, some other source of funding with, you know, some other source of funding with, you know, some other source of funding with, you know, some other source of funding with, you know, some other source of funding with, you know, some other source of funding with, you know, some other source of funding with, you know, Probably other the issues in coming quarters. what's your study there? you know, we we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the specific, you know, tenure, cost, you know, we end up withdrawing or taking advantage of the different funding sources. so You know, i would say that not only that particular line item, but every single line item is is is reviewed, you know? and under current market circumstances, we, you know, it's, it's our obligation to look at better ways of, of, of not only funding the bank, but keeping the structures in place so that the bank, you know, can continue supporting, you know, long-term growth. Of course, that's something that we continue to monitor as well. So, so yes, you know, it could be that we keep it at those levels or that we reduce it if there's an opportunity to find a more effective funding source. I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're trying to say. Could you please rephrase your question or provide more context? Further for for you and my second question is regarding the special accounting criteria when we look to those numbers the balance of npls are much higher than than the ones the old accounting versus the current special accounting and i would like to understand the difference here if it's like a very negative outlook with which you see you know like those numbers materializing as losses if you can explain for me the differences on the special accounting versus the old accounting and if the balance of mpls there may become losses, i would appreciate. thank you From two point sixty one percent to three point thirty seven percent as as we discussed during the call during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call as we discussed during the call And it's not a significant deterioration in our view given you know the you know what's going on in the economy is just a you know a slight deterioration no now on your second question could you elaborate on that? you know i i don't know exactly what you're comparing you know the special accounting criteria to the other accounting criteria so Before the s&p 500 regulation for covid you have like a table on your release comparing the special accounting criteria versus the former i think like b six accounting criteria and when we look to the balance of non-performing loans i believe the balance you have to date is something around like eighteen billion pesos nineteen billion pesos that that implies the two point five percent illiquid ratio but if you look to the old accounting criteria the d six accounting criteria the d six accounting criteria I think the balance of npls are closer to forty forty four billion pesos so the npl ratio would be much higher i understand that maybe a lot of loans that do not really become npls are there but my concern is that as soon as these accounting criteria go goes back to normal if we could see you know like a higher need of provisions working on npls so that's why i ask the difference and if it makes sense to expect them Veracity on that no i think that that you know it it's fairly dependent on the level of or or the type of assumptions that we make because the existing accounting criteria is very stringent in terms of a let's say bad news and percentage of how much you've the client has paid back so so I think that it's it's in my opinion it's it's somehow an extreme comparison okay so it has to do with you know with the you know the special accounting criteria you basically allow clients not to pay you know or every client that's not paying their interest and capital stays current you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you And the under the old or the prevailing accounting criteria you know you have to take into account just the the you know when when you're ninety days past due and depending on if you are you know let's say a corporate client you know depending on how much you have already paid back whether you're twenty percent or or more or how the time that has elapsed you know bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah b It it it's very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very Actions\n\nI think that as soon as clients start paying back or not we'll get to know, you know, how, you know, the magnitude of the impact, okay, rather than just making, you know, some assumptions that you could materialize or not. As, as mentioned during the call, I think that we have made, we have made a good assessment in terms of the risk that each client has, you know, the relationship that we have with them and We have also asked them, you know, you know how they're doing and whether they have the capacity to pay back. so taking all that into account, that's how we've come up with these provisions associated with the expected losses that you assume. so i would, i would encourage you, judy, just to, to wait a couple of quarters and with the hard data, you know, just analyze, you know, if we, if we, you know, on one hand, the benefit of these temporary measures, you know, just analyze, you know, if we, if we, you know, on one hand, the benefit of these temporary measures, you know, just analyze, you know, if we, if we, you know, on one hand, the benefit of these temporary measures, you know, just analyze, you know, if we, if we That the banking commission provided and on the other hand, you know, the, the, the true impact that it has had in our asset quality. no, no, that's very clear. thank you very much. we will take the next question. it comes from nicolas riva from bank of america. yes, thank you very much for taking my question. i have only one question. i apologize if you already mentioned it. And you mentioned that nineteen percent of the loan portfolio has been subject to some kind of debt relief measures, payment holidays, giving grace periods. have these measures ended already for any clients? and if so, if you can tell us what's the percentage of clients that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments already, that have resumed payments Four months is the full outbreak of the pandemic and and it has not been the case if the payment holiday has ended for any significant amount of clients if you can tell us when you made this provision charge of the three point nine billion pesos in this quarter did you incorporate any assumption in terms of what would be the percentage of these clients under the relief program? I will pay you back once the payment holiday ends. thank you. you know, first, the payment holidays, payment holiday period ends tomorrow. so we'll start the, the, you know, seeing whether clients pay back or not in starting next week. so we don't have that information yet. no. now, regarding, you know, how we made provisions for this quarter. You know and as mentioned throughout the call we classified the clients depending on the risk that they have the exposure that they have with us the relationship that they have with us so we we classified the retail clients in twenty five clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in twenty five clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in twenty five clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in twenty five clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in twenty five clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in twenty five clusters and esms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of cluster that you know retail clients in twenty five client falls in you know there's either a high risk or high exposure a category you know for clients and we assume certain probability of those clusters either paying back their loans or not okay so that's how we came up with with with the provision that we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we Or low number of clients to pay back their loans. it's it you know it's it's because of these analysis that we've done that we feel a relatively confident that with the information that we have what we have provided is is is good is a good provision for asset quality deterioration for the rest of the year ok thank you very much the next question comes from olivo artuzo from ubs. please go ahead. Okay, thank you very much for taking my question. it is just one. i just wanted to understand the dynamic of the credit relief program held by the bank and the hike on npls to two point five percent. according to my calculation, the deferred loans reach almost fifteen percent of total loans. if i'm not wrong, they are roughly a similar level to the other banks but different from other players and even considered. and the brazilian and chilean subsidiaries they have also fostered their credit relief program n.p.l. decreased in the second quarter you mentioned that this deterioration is emanating from the s.e.m. and the credit card segment so i just wanted to understand if this hike in n.p.l. behaved worse than expected by the bank considering the amount of loans that were owed and what does the bank cease for this semester in terms of fostering the credit relief program. in case of regulators, extend the schedule and change the rules forward. so, thank you very much. no, i think that, you know, the first of all, you know, the npls that the increase that we see in the second quarter are associated with those clients that do not enter into the relief program. okay. so, it has to do with that. eighty one percent. Of clients that decided not to enter into into the program and obviously those clients are also exposed to the deration of the economic activity. you know the ector mentioned, you know, the the losses that you know the unemployed losses that we've seen so it's it has to do more with that okay with the clients that do not enter into the program. so let's let's say with the clients that do not enter into the program. Whether we were expecting you know that type of deterioration you know i think that if someone tells you that they were envisioning this type of economic deterioration i think that they're lying you know i think that we were not expecting this type of contraction you know the magnitude that we were seeing if you look at how every single analyst updates its The forecast for the mexican economy every week you get to see the downward adjustments so so i think that it does not surprise us you know we mentioned that given this this deterioration of a economic activity we think it's just a slight deterioration okay but as mentioned we will get to see the final impact or the final impact of the economic activity we think it's just a slight deterioration okay but as mentioned we will get to see the final impact or the final impact of the economic activity we think it's just a slight deterioration okay but as mentioned we will get to see the final impact or the final impact of the economic activity we think it's just a slight deterioration okay but as mentioned we will get to see the final impact or the final impact of the economic activity we think it's just a slight deterioration final numbers probably in the next two or three quarters you know it's not only you know what happens the rest of the year i think that this this the impact of the pandemic at least from mexico has a possibility of you know going further than just twenty twenty so we'll get to see that okay i think it's it's quite early to to have a definitive view on complete impact on a on a full year so we'll get to see that okay i think it's it's quite early to to have a definitive view on complete impact on a on a full year so we'll get to see that okay i think it's it's quite early to to have a definitive view on complete impact on a on a full year so we'll get to see that okay i think it's it's quite early to to have a definitive Quality. okay, okay. thank you very much. the last question comes from beka lutschashvili from bpctwll. please go ahead. hi, everyone. my questions were already answered. thank you very much. There are no further questions in the queue, and i'd like to turn the floor back over to mr. jorge chavez for any closing remarks. thank you, operator. and thanks, everyone, once again, for joining santander mexico on this call. as always, we wish to maintain an open dialogue with all of you in the financial community. so if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to call or email us directly. until our next call, please stay safe. good afternoon.
