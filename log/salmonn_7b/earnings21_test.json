MILLION TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS ANNUALLY FROM THIS UNIT SCHERER 4'S RETIREMENT IS THE FINAL STEP OF THE COAL PHASE OUT STRATEGY THAT FPL LAUNCHED IN 2015 AND THAT WILL COMPLETE THE COMPLO- CLO-CLOSURE OF APPROXIMATELY 2700 MEGAWATTS OF COAL CAPACITY INCLUDING THE HIGHEST GREENHOUSE EMITTING GAS POWER POWER PLANTS IN FLORIDA THESE TRANSACTIONS WHICH WILL MAKE FPL ONE OF THE FIRST UTILITIES TO ELIMINATE ALL OF THE COAL FROM ITS GENERATION PORTFOLIO DEMONSTRATE FPL'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT AND POSITION AS A CLEAN ENERGY LEADER WE REMAIN PROUD OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL TRACK RECORD PARTICULAR THE C02 EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THAT WE HAVE DELIVERED THROUGHOUT FLORIDA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY ERA THAT IS BOTH CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE GULF POWER ALSO HAD A STRONG QUARTER OF EXECUTION THE FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL COST EFFECTIVENESS AT GULF CONTINUES TO PROGRESS WELL WITH YEAR TO DAY O&M COSTS EXCLUDING SPECIFIC COVID-19 RELATED EXPENSES THAT DECLINING BY NEARLY 10% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD AND BY APPROXIMATELY 25% RELATIVE TO 201 GULF POWER ALSO DELIVERED FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN SERVICE RELIABILITY AND

OUTLINED AT GULF POWER AND CONTINUE TO EXPECT TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE OVER THE COMING YEARS DURING THE QUARTER WE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL STORM DRILLS FOR FPL AND GULF POWER TO PREPARE FOR THE UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION OF RESTORING POWER AFTER A HURRICANE IN THE MIDST OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WE SPENT TWO WEEKS DRILLING AND CHALLENGING OUR TEAMS TO FIND WAYS TO EFFICIENTLY RESTORE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITHOUT SACRIFICING SAFETY THE DRILLS PROVIDED A NUMBER OF LESSONS INCLUDING HOW TO LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY TO QUICKLY AND SAFELY SCREEN PERSONNEL AT VARIOUS STAGING SITES TO HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WILL INEVITABLY OCCUR WHEN PERFORMING STORM RESTORATION IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC WHILE WE HOPE THEIR SERVICE TERRITORIES WILL AVOID THE

LOCALLY WHILE WE ARE MONITORING THE SITUATION CLOSELY WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT ALL OF OUR PLANNED 2020 RENEWABLES PROJECTS WILL ACHIEVE THEIR IN SERVICE DATES THIS YEAR IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED INVESTOR FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES OR ESG NEXT WEEK WE EXPECT TO PUBLISH NEXTERA ENERGY'S UPDATED ESG REPORT WHICH INCLUDES REPORTING UNDER THE SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD OR SASB DISCLOSURES OUR COMPANY HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF ESG FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS NEXTERA ENERGY'S APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE AND RISK OVERSIGHT COMBINED WITH THE WAY THAT WE TREAT OUR PEOPLE OUR CUSTOMERS OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE PROOF THAT A COMPANY CAN BE BOTH SUSTAINABLE AND FINANCIALLY SUCCESSFUL AT THE SAME TIME THE NEW REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THIS ALIGNMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY WITH THE KEY TENANTS OF ESG INCLUDES A ROBUST DISCUSSION OF RISK OVERSIGHT AND INCORPORATES NEW DISCLOSURES SUCH AS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION METRICS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION MATTER DEEPLY TO US AS A COMPANY BOTH BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY'RE THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT ALSO BECAUSE DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE TEAMS DELIVER BETTER BUSINESS RESULTS FOR THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE OUR COMMITMENT TO HAVING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND INCLUSIVE CULTURE IS NOT NEW AND OUR DIVERSITY METRICS ARE BETTER THAN MANY OF THE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY HOWEVER CONSISTENT WITH OUR FOCUS ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WE ARE NOT SATISFIED AND WILL CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD AN EVEN MORE DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE TEAM GOING FORWARD OVERALL WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE IN NEXTERA ENERGY SO FAR IN 202 AS WE'VE ENTERED THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO ACHIEVE THE FULL YEAR EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED EVEN WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR A REASONABLE RANGE OF IMPACTS AND OUTCOMES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE CURRENT PANDEMIC NOW LETS TURN TO THE DETAILED RESULTS BEGINNING WITH FPL FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 FPL REPORTED A NET INCOME OF $749 MILLION OR A $1.52 PER SHARE WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF $86 MILLION AND 15 CENTS PER SHARE RESPECTIVELY YEAR OVER YEAR REGULATORY CAPITAL EMPLOYED INCREASED BY MORE THAT 10% OVER THE SAME QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AND WAS A PRINCIPLE DRIVER OF FPL'S NET INCOME GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY 13% FPL'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.80 BILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND WE NOW EXPECT OUR FULL YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO TOTAL BETWEEN $6.50 BILLION AND $6.70 BILLION OUR REPORTED ROE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 11.60% FOR THE 12 MONTH ENDED JUNE 2020 WHICH IS AT THE UPPER END OF THE ALLOWED BAND OF 9.60% TO 11.6% ALLOWED UNDER OUR CURRENT RATE AGREEMENT DURING THE QUARTER WE UTILIZED $7 MILLION OF RESERVE AMORTIZATION TO ACHIEVE OUR TARGET REGULATORY ROE LEAVING FPL WITH A BALANCE OF $736 MILLION WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT FPL WILL END 2020 WITH A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF SURPLUS TO CONTINUE OPERATING UNDER THE CURRENT BASE RATE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT DURING 202 AS WE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED WE EXPECT THAT FPL AND GULF WILL OPERATE AS A SINGLE LARGER FLORIDA UTILITY COMPANY WHICH WILL CREATE BOTH OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AS RESULT IN MAY THE COMPANY HAS FILED AN APPLICATION WITH FERC FOR AN APPROVAL OF AN INTERNAL REORGANIZATION WHEREBY GULF WOULD MERGE INTO FPL SUBJECT TO FERC APPROVAL THE COMPANIES WILL MERGE IN JANUARY OF 202 HOWEVER DURING 2021 GULF POWER WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS A SEPARATE OPERATING DIVISION SERVING ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS UNDER SEPARATE RETAIL RATES WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE COMPANIES TO FILE A COMBINED RATE CASE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR FOR NEW RATES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 202 TURNING TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ALL OF OUR MAJOR CAPITAL INITIATIVES AT FPL REMAIN ON TRACK AND ON BUDGET DURING THE QUARTER THE FINAL 300 MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR BEING BUILT UNDER THE SOLAR BASE RATE ADJUSTMENT OR SOBRA MECHANISM AS FPL'S BASE RATE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WERE PLACED INTO SERVICE THE 1200 MEGAWATTS OF COST EFFECTIVE SOLAR CONSTRUCTED UNDER THE SOBRA MECHANISM ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER BENEFITS AND REPRESENT THE EARLY STAGES OF FPL'S RAPID SOLAR EXPANSION AND THE NEXT PHASE OF ITS GENERATION MODERNIZATION EFFORTS THE NEXT SIX SOLAR TOGETHER PROJECTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 450 MEGAWATTS REMAIN ON TRACK TO BE PLACED IN SERVICE LATER THIS YEAR THE FINAL 600 MEGAWATTS OF THE ROUGHLY 1500 MEGAWATT COMMUNITY SOLAR PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO BE PLACED IN SERVICE NEXT YEAR BEYOND SOLAR CONSTRUCTION ON THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT ROUGHLY 1200 MEGAWATT DANIA BEACH CLEAN ENERGY CENTER REMAINS ON SCHEDULE AND ON BUDGET AS IT CONTINUES TO ADVANCE TOWARDS ITS PROJECTED COMMERCIAL OPERATION DATE IN 202 ADDITIONALLY THE 409 MEGAWATT MANATEE STORAGE FACILITY WILL TO BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST BATTERY STORAGE PLANTS IS ON TRACK AND ON BUDGET TO BE COMPLETE NEXT YEAR BASED ON OUR ONGOING ANALYSIS OF THE LONG TERM POTENTIAL OF LOW COST RENEWABLES WE REMAIN CONFIDENT AS EVER THAT WIND SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE WOULD BE USUALLY DISRUPTIVE TO THE ENERGIES EXISTING THE COUNTRIES EXISTING GENERATION <INAUDIBLE> WHILE REDUCING COST FOR CUSTOMERS AND HELPING TO ACHIEVE FUTURE C02 EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS HOWEVER TO ACHIEVE AN EMISSIONS FREE FUTURE WE BELIEVE THAT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE NECESSARY AND WE ARE PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THE LONG TERM POTENTIAL OF HYDROGEN CONSISTENT WITH THE TOE IN THE WATER APPROACH WE'VE PREVIOUSLY UTILIZED WITH SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE WE ARE PLANNING TO PROPOSE A HYDROGEN PILOT PROJECT AT FPL THIS APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION PILOT PROJECT WHICH SUBJECT TO FLO- FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION APPROVAL IS EXPECTED TO BE IN SERVICE IN 2023 WILL UTILIZE SOLAR ENERGY THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN CLIPPED TO PRODUCE A 100% GREEN HYDROGEN THROUGH A ROUGHLY 20 MEGAWATT ELECTROLYSIS SYSTEM THE HYDROGEN WILL BE USED TO REPLACE A PORTION OF THE NATURAL GAS THAT IS CONSUMED BY ONE OF THE THREE GAS TURBINES AT THE OKEECHOBEE CLEAN ENERGY CENTER.WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROJECT IS A COMPLIMENT TO OUR ONGOING SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND HIGHLIGHTS FPL'S CONTINUED INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY OF THE CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE FOR ITS CUSTOMERS WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OTHER POTENTIAL HYDROGEN OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND WHILE OUR NEAR TERM INVESTMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SMALL IN CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL CAPITAL PROGRAM WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES LONG TERM POTENTIAL WHICH SHOULD FURTHER SUPPORT FUTURE DEMAND FOR LOW COST RENEWABLES AS WELL ACCEL- AS ACCELERATE THE DECARBONIZATION OF TRANSPORTATION FUEL AND INDUSTRIAL FEEDSTOCKS.WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT FPL'S ONGOING SMART INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WILL SUPPORT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL EMPLOYED OF APPROXIMATELY 9% FROM 2018 THROUGH 2022 WHILE FURTHER ENHANCING OUR BEST IN CLASS CUSTOMER VALUE PROPOSITION LET ME NOW TURN TO GULF POWER WHICH REPORTED SECOND QUARTER 2020 GAP EARNINGS OF $55 MILLION OR 11 CENTS PER SHARE A DECLINE OF 1 CENT PER SHARE RELATIVE TO GULF POWERS ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD THIS QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF ROUGHLY $5 MILLION OF AFTER TAX COVID-19 RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE EXPECTED INCREMENTAL BAD DEBT EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC EARLIER THIS MONTH THE FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION APPROVED GULF POWERS REQUEST TO RECORD COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO COVID-19 INCLUDING BAD DEBT EXPENSE AS A REGULATORY ASSET ON ITS BALANCE SHEET.AS A RESULT THE COSTS RECORDED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER ARE EXPECTED TO BE REVERSED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AS THE REGULATORY ASSET IS RECORDED GULF POWERS REPORTED ROE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 10.40% FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDING JUNE 202 FOR THE FULL YEAR 2020 WE ARE TARGETING A REGULATORY ROE OF THE UPPER HALF OF THE ALLOWED BAND OF 9.25% TO 11.25% DURING THE QUARTER GULF POWERS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE ROUGHLY A $170 MILLION AND WE NOW EXPECT OUR FULL YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO TOTAL BETWEEN 1 AND 1.1 BILLION DOLLARS ALL OF GULF MAJOR SMART CAPITAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDING THE NORTH FLORIDA RESILIENCY CONNECTION AND THE PLANT <INAUDIBLE> CALLED TO NATURAL GAS CONVERSION CONTINUE TO PROGRESS WELL SIMILAR TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THE FLORIDA ECONOMY IS BEING IMPACTED BY THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC RECENT ECONOMIC DATA REFLECT AN INCREASE IN FLORIDA UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND A DECLINE IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE THAT ARE ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH THE CHANGES THE NATIONAL AVERAGES OF EACH METRIC WHILE IT IS STILL UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT HOW SEVERELY THE ECONOMY WILL ULTIMATELY BE IMPACTED WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES WITH WHICH FLORIDA ENTERED THE CRISIS AND THAT CONTINUED ATTRACTION OF THE STATE TO BOTH NEW RESIDENCES RESIDENCE AND NEW BUSINESSES WILL SUPPORT A REBOUND ONCE THE WORST OF THE PANDEMIC IS BEHIND US WE REMAIN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN HELPING FLORIDA RETURN FROM THIS STRONGER THAN EVER WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO OUR PART TO SUPPORT THAT OUTCOME INCLUDING PURSUING OUR SMART CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND ECONOMICAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WHICH HELP CREATE JOBS PROVIDE INVESTMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND FURTHER ENHANCE OUR BEST IN CLASS CUSTOMER VALUE PROPOSITION DURING THE QUARTER FPL'S AVERAGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS CONTINUED THE RECENT TREND OF STRONG UNDERLYING GROWTH INCREASING BY APPROXIMATELY 75,000 FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER FPL'S SECOND QUARTER RETAIL SALES DECREASED BY 0.8% YEAR OVER YEAR AS CUSTOMER GROWTH AND FAVORABLE WEATHER WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY A DECLINE AND UNDERLYING USAGE PER CUSTOMER BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS THE OVERALL EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC ON UNDERLYING USAGE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER WERE RELATIVELY MUTED FPL BENEFITS FROM HAVING ITS RETAIL SALES BEING HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARDS RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS IN APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ITS LOAD IS COOLING RELATED AND THEREFORE IMPORTANT FOR BOTH COMFORT AND BUILDING MAINTENANCE DURING APRIL WHEN STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS WERE BROADLY IN EFFECT FPL'S WEATHER-NORMALIZED RETAIL SALES WERE DOWN APPROXIMATELY 4% RELATIVE TO OUR EXPECTATIONS AS THE ECONOMY BEGAN REOPENING IN EARLY MAY WEATHER-NORMALIZED RETAIL SALES IMPROVED AND WERE ABOVE OUR EXPECTATIONS IN JUNE WHILE THE ULTIMATE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON UNDERLYING USAGE REMAIN UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED BY OUR RESERVE AMORTIZATION MECHANISM TO OFFSET ANY FLUCTUATION OF RETAIL SALES OR BAD DEBT EXPENSE AND SUPPORT REGULATORY ROE AT THE UPPER END OF THE ALLOWED BAND OF 9.60% TO 11.6% UNDER OUR CURRENT RATE AGREEMENT FOR GULF POWER THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 1.3% VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER GULF POWERS SECOND QUARTER RETAIL SALES DECLINED BY ROUGHLY 6.2% YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE UNDER- OF THE UNFAVORABLE WEATHER COMPARISON AND A DECLINE IN UNDERLYING USAGE PER CUSTOMER OVER THE SECOND QUARTER GULF POWER EXPERIENCED A MORE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN UNDERLYING USAGE PER CUSTOMER THAN FPL BUT ALSO EXPERIENCED AN IMPROVEMENT AS THE ECONOMY BEGAN REOPENING IN MAY AND JUNE AS A REMINDER UNLIKE FPL GULF POWER DOES NOT HAVE A RESERVE AMORTIZATION MECHANISM UNDER ITS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO OFFSET FLUCTUATIONS IN REVENUE OR COSTS SO ANY VARIABILITY WILL THEREFORE HAVE MORE IMPACT ON TO GULFS EARNINGS IN ROE THAN AT FPL.AS A REMINDER AS WE'VE OFTEN DISCUSSED WEATHER-NORMALIZATION IS IMPRECISE PARTICULARLY WHEN EVALUATING SHORT PERIODS OF TIME ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON ON RETAIL SALES AT GPL AND GULF POWER ARE INCLUDED IN THE APPENDIX OF TODAY'S PRESENTATION LET ME NOW TURN TO ENERGY RESOURCES WHICH REPORTED SECOND QUARTER 2020 GAP EARNINGS OF $481 MILLION OR 0.97 CENTS PER SHARE AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS OF $531 MILLION OR A $1.08 PER SHARE THIS IS AN INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNS PER SHARE OF 13 CENTS OR APPROXIMATELY 14% FROM LAST YEARS COMPARABLE QUARTER RESULTS WHICH HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE RESULTS OF OUR NEXTERA ENERGY TRANSMISSION BUSINESS FORMALLY REPORTED IN CORPORATE <INAUDIBLE> NEW INVESTMENTS ADDED 8 CENTS PER SHARE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EXISTING GENERATION ASSETS INCREASED 5 CENTS PER SHARE AS IMPROVED WIND RESOURCE AND INCREASED PTC VOLUMES FROM OUR REPOWERING WIND PROJECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REFUELING OUTAGE AT THE SEABROOK NUCLEAR FACILITY SECOND QUARTER FLEET WIDE WIND RESOURCE WAS 99% OF THE LONGTERM AVERAGE VERSUS 93% DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 201 ALSO CONTRIBUTING FAVORABLY WAS NEXTERA ENERGY TRANSMISSION WHERE CONTRIBUTIONS INCREASED BY 3 CENTS VERSUS 201 CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR GAS INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS INCLUDING EXISTING PIPELINES WERE FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR THESE FAVORABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR CUSTOMER SUPPLY AND TRADING BUSINESS WHICH DECLINE 4 CENTS VERSUS THE PARTICULARLY STRONG SECOND QUARTER LAST YEAR ALL OTHER IMPACTS INCREASED

CALL WE HAVE ADDED 708 MEGAWATTS OF WIND 844 MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR AND A 178 MEGAWATTS OF BATTERY STORAGE TO OUR RENEWABLES BACKLOG WE ALSO EXECUTED A BUILD-OWN TRANSFER AGREEMENT FOR A 200 MEGAWATT SOLAR PROJECT WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR BACKLOG EDITIONS ALL OUR BATTERY STORAGE PROJECTS WILL BE PAIRED WITH EITHER NEW OR EXISTING SOLAR PROJECTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ITC AND PROVIDE A MORE FIRM RENEWABLE PRODUCT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS THE CONTINUED STRONG DEMAND FOR BATTERY STORAGE PROJECTS HIGHLIGHTS THE RAPID TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PHASE OF RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT THAT PAIRS LOW COST WIND AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH A LOW COST BATTERY STORAGE SOLUTION WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT BY THE MIDDLE OF THIS DECADE WITHOUT INCENTIVES NEW NEAR-FIRM WIND AND NEW NEAR-FIRM SOLAR WILL BE CHEAPER THAN THE OPERATING COST OF MOST EXISTING COAL AND NUCLEAR FACILITIES AND LESS UH FUEL EFFICIENT OIL AND GAS FIRED GENERATION UNITS PRODUCING SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM RENEWABLES DEMAND OUR CURRENT BACKLOG NOW TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 14,400 MEGAWATTS AND IS THE LARGEST WE HAVE EVER HAD IN OUR ROUGHLY 20 YEAR DEVELOPMENT HISTORY TO PUT OUR BACKLOG INTO CONTEXT IT IS LARGER THAN THE CURRENT OPERATING IN WIND

SECTOR ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH 2020 WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE ALREADY SIGNED NEARLY 3500 MEGAWATTS OF CONTRACTS FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2022 WHICH IS A REFLECTION OF THE CONTINUED STRONG ECONOMIC DEMAND FOR WIND SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SIGNIFICANT DEMAND IN THE COMING YEARS WE HAD NOW HAVE MORE THAN $2 BILLION OF SAFE HARBOR WIND AND SOLAR EQUIPMENT WHICH COULD SUPPORT AS MUCH AS $40 BILLION OF WIND SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE INVESTMENTS ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM 2021 TO 202 THESE PURCHASES HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFIT OF SCALE AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR BALANCE SHEET THAT WE LEVERAGE AS A KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT AND POSITION US WELL FOR CONTINUED LONG TERM GROWTH THE SAFE HARBOR EQUIPMENT ALSO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL REPOWERING OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING 700 MEGAWATTS OF POTENTIAL 2021 REPOWERING PROJECTS WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING AS I DISCUSSED EARLIER ALL OF THE 2020 RENEWABLES PROJECTS REMAIN ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE

AMERICA PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION HEY AND MORNING THIS IS UH ACTUALLY RICHIE HERE FOR JULIEN UH I JUST HAD A QUESTION AROUND THE THE CAFEX RATES AND FTL AND UH GULF WHAT WHAT WAS DRIVING THAT IS THAT MORE AROUND UM UNDERVALUING GRID HARDENING OR IS THAT MORE ON THE SOLAR SIDE AND HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THE UH CAFEX TRAJ- TRAJECTORY FROM 21 AND BEYOND IS THAT MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT YOU DISCLOSED AT YOUR ANALYST DAY OR UM SHOU- SHOULD WE EXPECT IT TO BE AT MORE OF THESE ROBUST ROBUST LEVELS LOOKING FORWARD RICHIE UM GOOD MORNING AND AND THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I THINK IT REALLY

RATE UM SO OBVIOUSLY SOME PROJECTS MOVE FROM ONE YEAR TO ANOTHER UM BUT AT THE HEART OF IT IT IS TERRIFIC INVESTMENTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR CUSTOMERS UM AS FAR AS BEYOND 2022 UM YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO COMMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE PAST THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES BUT SPECIFIC AT FPL AND AND GULF POWER UM INCLUDE THE MODERNIZATION EFFORTS UM INCLUDING THE LARGE DEPLOYMENT OF SOLAR OVER TIME AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS AND GRID HARDENING UM AND UNDER GROUNDING IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE STORM PROTECTION PLAN UH THAT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF UH OF GOING THROUGH APPROVALS AND AND UM AND YOU KNOW INITIAL INVESTMENTS UH FOR THAT PROGRAM SO WE'RE SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTING AND AGAIN STAY VERY FOCUSED ON ENSURING UH THAT THESE ARE GOOD PROJECTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR CUSTOMERS GOT IT THANKS THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND THEN JUST UM AROUND YOUR COMMENTS AROUND HYDROGEN I I THINK YOU'VE DISCLOSED UH 65 MILLION FOR THAT PILOT PROJECT UM WHAT WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE ON ON THAT FRONT IS THIS MORE AROUND UH TRANSPORTATION OPPORTUNITIES OR IS THIS UM AROUND LIKE UH PIPELINE AND AND BEING ABLE TO LIKE BLEND WITH THE PIPES SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT HYDROGEN IN IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GETTING TO A UM NOT A NET ZERO EMISSIONS PROFILE BUT ACTUALLY A ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS PROFILE AND FOR WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS LETS CALL IT 5 10 YEARS AGO UM AND WE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET TO TRUE UH ZERO EMISSIONS WE WERE WORRIED THAT IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE UH FOR CUSTOMERS WHAT MAKES US REALLY EXCITED ABOUT HYDROGEN PARTICULARLY IN THE 2030 AND BEYOND TIMEFRAME IS THAT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPLEMENT SIGNIFICANT DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLES INCLUDING WIND AND SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES COMPLIMENTED BY SHORT AND AND I'LL CALL IT MEDIUM TERM DURATION BATTERIES UM BUT THEN THAT LAST AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS UM THAT THAT YOU WOULD TAKE OUT OF THE SYSTEM TO GET DOWN TO ZERO COULD BE MOST ECONOMICALLY SERVED BY HYDROGEN UM SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES US EXCITED ABOUT DOING A PILOT PROJECT WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THAT TO THE FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION UM AS A WAY TO YOU KNOW FURTHER ENHANCE FPL'S ABILITY TO INNOVATE AND DELIVER THESE LONG TERM UM YOU KNOW CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS UM AND AS PART OF THAT WE'LL LEARN ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES AND WE'LL SEE WHAT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE UH POTENTIALLY FOR THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SECTORS UM YOU KNOW AND AND FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PRO- YOU KNOW PRODUCE THAT UH THE GREEN ENERGY TO PRODUCE THE GREEN HYDROGEN UH IS A POTENTIAL SIGNIF- SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US WE THINK WE'RE AT THE EARLY STAGES UM WHICH IS KIND OF CONSISTENT WITH OUR TOE IN THE WATER APPROACH WE WANT TO GET SOME EXPERIENCE WITH IT OBVIOUSLY DO A LOT OF RESEARCH UM AND UH TALK TO FOLKS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND AND GET BETTER EQUIPPED TO DEAL UH YOU KNOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES BUT WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT ALL RIGHT THANKS A LOT THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAD THANK YOU RICHIE OUR NEXT QUESTIONS COMES FROM <INAUDIBLE> FROM GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION HI GOOD MORNING IT'S ACTUALLY CUB WHO'S HERE FOR CHARL AS WELL UM I THINK ACTUALLY IT HAS BEEN A GREAT QUARTER IT'S A WE'VE DEF- DEFINITELY SEEN SOME IMPRESSIVE NUMBERS IN BACKLOG ADDITIONS AND KIND OF CONTRACT INCREASES FOR THE ' 22 TIMEFRAME JUST KIND OF CURIOUS ON KIND OF YOUR THOUGHTS AROUND KIND OF NEW YEAR'S GROWTH TRAJECTORY AND KIND OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BUSINESS <INAUDIBLE> AND I I IT'S KIND OF SUBSIDIVE IN KIND OF A <INAUDIBLE> FROM THE REACTING AGENCY BUT JUST THOUGHTS ON KIND OF GROWING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE NEW YEAR VERSUS BALANCING THAT FROM THE REGULATED CONTRIBUTIONS YOU KNOW DOES IT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT <INAUDIBLE> OR KIND OF ANY KIND OF DROP DOWNS ACCELERATED FROM THE NEW YEAR JUST SOME THOUGHTS AROUND THAT THANKS CUB WE APPRECIATE UH YOU DIALING IN THIS MORNING UM WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT ACROSS THE BOARD AND OF COURSE AT FPL AND GULF THAT'S FOCUSED ON INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED THAT WE NEED TO CREATE VALUE FOR OUR

WHEN WE FIND GREAT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WHICH YOU KNOW AGAIN I CAN HIGHLIGHT ENOUGH ABOUT HOW EXCITED WE ARE ABOUT THE RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS AT AT ENERGY RESOURCES SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONSTRAIN THEM IN ANY WAY YOU KNOW WE WILL DEVELOP THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT CREATE VALUE FOR SHAREHOLDERS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN UM BALANCE OVER TIME WE'VE GOT A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT THAT ARE CREATED FOR SHAREHOLDERS UM INCLUDING RECYCLING OF CAPITAL THROUGH NEXTERA ENERGY PARTNERS UM WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A WILLING AND EXCITED ACQUIRER OF ENERGY RESOURCES PROJECTS UM BUT ENERGY RESOURCES HAS THE ABILITY TO RECYCLE CAPITAL TO THIRD PARTIES AS WELL UH SO THERE'S PLENTY OF WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN UH CREATE THE REAL YOU KNOW VALUE OF CREATIVE OPPORTUNITIES UM AND STILL THINK ABOUT IT FROM A CORPORATIVE PERSPECTIVE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS THANKS THAT'S UH NO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND UH KIND OF PIVOTING A LITTLE BIT TO TO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LONGER TERM I GUESS UH CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE NOVEMBER ELECTION AND KIND OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS PUT OUT SOME PLANS AND FRAMEWORKS OUT THERE THE <INAUDIBLE> CLEAN ENERGY SUPPORT HOW IS NEXTERA POSITIONED FOR KIND OF POTENTIAL CHANGES AT A FEDERAL LEVEL SO THIS IS JIM UM YOU KNOW WE WE ALWAYS POSITION OUR BUSINESS TO TRY TO WIN REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF ELECTIONS AND AND SO YOU KNOW WE I THINK IF YOU CAN REMEMBER BACK THREE UH YOU KNOW CLOSE TO FOUR YEARS AGO NOW THERE WAS SOME TURMOIL AROUND OUR STOCK UH WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ELECTED UH WE'VE UH MANAGED COMPLETELY FINE UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR REAL BUSINESS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT ECONOMICS RIGHT AND AND AND THE TIME FOR RENEWABLES IS NOW AND YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF TRANSCENDS POLITICS FRANKLY THE ECONOMICS AND THE AND THE NEED TO YOU KNOW AND AND AND REALLY THE NEED TO DECARBONIZE NOT ONLY THE ELECTRIC SECTOR BUT THE REST OF THE SECTORS IN THE ECONOMY ARE REALLY YOU KNOW REALLY FRANKLY TRANSCEND WHAT HAPPENS IN ELECTIONS AND SO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE WATCH THEM CLOSELY WE THINK UH GOOD CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES IMPORTANT AND THE RIGHT POLICY FOR FOR FOR AMERICA AND THE FUTURE AND UH YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE I THINK TO BE POSITIONED UH REALLY WELL REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS IN NOVEMBER OKAY THAT MAKES SENSE I'LL I'LL UH TELL THAT TO <INAUDIBLE> THANKS SO MUCH <INAUDIBLE> THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MICHAEL WEINSTEIN FROM CREDIT SWISS PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOU QUESTION HI GOOD MORNING GUYS HEY UM ON THE SAME QUESTION JIM ARE YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME FROM THE CONGRESS THESE DAY TAX CREDIT EXTENSIONS CASH GRANTS DO YOU THINK A NATIONAL RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD IS A POSSIBILITY I'M JUST WONDERING OF ALL THOSE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES WHAT DO YOU THINK MIGHT ACTUALLY OCCUR IN THE NEXT UH FOUR YEARS YEAH YOU KNOW SO I THINK ITS HONESTLY UH TOO SOON TO TELL MICHAEL I THINK UH YOU KNOW A LOT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ELECTION AND IS THERE A CONTINUED SPLIT GOVERNMENT OR IS THERE NOT SPLIT GOVERNMENT UH THAT'LL BE I THINK A BIG DRIVER OF WHAT POLICIES HAPPEN AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK UH ALL OF THOSE IDEAS ARE ON THE TABLE WE WE BE CONSISTENT IN IN IN WHAT WE'VE SAID WHICH IS THAT UH UH YOU KNOW WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE UH YOU KNOW GOOD AND FAIR CLEAN ENERGY POLICY GOING FORWARD UH WE ALSO HAVE SAID THAT IT'S UH THAT WE THINK WIND AND AND RENEWABLES WITH BATTERIES WILL BE UH YOU KNOW ARE VERY COMPETITIVE UH YOU KNOW ONCE THE PTC'S AND THE RTC'S PHASE OUT IN TERMS OF UH COMPETING AGAINST CONVENTIONAL GENERATION IT'S JUST HONESTLY UH REALLY MORE A MATTER OF THE SPEED WITH WHICH YOU WANT TO DECARBONIZE IS WHAT I GONNA ULTIMATELY DRIVE THE FINAL UH I THINK POLICY CHOICES AND SO UH YOU KNOW WE'RE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN IN THE DISCUSSIONS AND UH UH I THINK IT'S PREMATURE REALLY TO SAY WHAT WE THINK UH IS GONNA HAPPEN CAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE AN ELECTION IN FOUR FIVE MONTHS AND AS AS YOU ALL KNOW ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND UH AND YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS POST THE ELECTION IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GONNA BE UH UH THE POLICY WHEN <INAUDIBLE> GOING FOR GREAT HEY UM ON HYDROGEN DO YOU THINK I NOTICED THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT MORE EMPHASIS ON RENEWABLES RATHER THAN GAS TURBINES IN YOUR FUTURE CONSTRUCTION PLANS AT FPL I'M JUST WONDERING IF UH IF HYDROGEN WORKS OUT IS THAT A MESSAGE DO YOU THINK YOU COULD ACTUALLY BUILD MORE UH PUT MORE GAS TURBINES BACK INTO THE PLAN IF IF HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BECOMES A VIABLE ECONOMIC ALTERNATIVE UH OR DO YOU THINK OTHER ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES ARE BETTER SUITED SUCH AS FUEL CELLS MIKE I THINK UM YOU KNOW FROM A HYDROGEN PERSPECTIVE UH AND SPECIFIC TO FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL HYDROGEN OPPORTUNITIES REALLY IN THE 2030 AND BEYOND TIMEFRAME UM AND IN THAT INTERVENING TIME WE DEPLOY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SOLAR TECHNOLOGY AND THEN IF WE'RE RIGHT AND IF THE COST COME DOWN FOR HYDROGEN AND IT IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR SUPPORTING GETTING TO A ZERO EMISSIONS UH PROFILE UH WE WOULD UH RETROFIT CERTAIN OF OUR YOU KNOW GAS FACILITIES TO RUN ON HYDROGEN OR RUN ON A PORTION OF HYDROGEN SO I THINK FOR FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHTING GULF POWER IT'S AT THIS POINT AND AGAIN IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LONG WAY INTO THE FUTURE UH YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BUILD ANY NEW YOU KNOW HYDROGEN/GAS TURBINES IN THAT IN THAT PORTFOLIO CAUSE WE'VE GOT A TREMENDOUSLY EFFICIENT UH FLEET THAT'S ALREADY IN SERVICES ON THE INVESTMENTS WE WOULD MAKE FOR REALLY AROUND CONVERSION.NOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRUE ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY I THINK IT'S UM YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT UM BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD AND A LOT OF THINGS NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO HAVE THOSE TYPES OF CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S IT'S FAIRLY PRELIMINARY GOTCHA AND YOU KNOW ONE FINAL QUESTION UH THIS MAY YOU'RE COMING ON M&A INTEREST THESE DAYS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH SANDY COOPER ET CETERA SO I THINK WE UH THIS WON'T BE SURPRISING WE REMAIN INTERESTED IN M&A UH WE THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN BRING TO THE THE TABLE WE YOU KNOW I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NOT A UTILITY IN THE COUNTRY THAT WE COULDN'T RUN UH MORE EFFICIENTLY AND UH UH BETTER FOR CUSTOMERS AND I I TRULY BELIEVE THAT AND AND SO YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO LOOK I THINK IN TERMS OF SANDY COOPER UH YOU KNOW THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN PUSHED TO NEXT YEAR AND WE REMAIN YOU KNOW WE REMAIN VERY INTERESTED AND UH AND CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON UH TRYING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN UH HEY JIM CAN YOU WHAT REGION OF THE COUNTRY ARE YOU FOCUSED ON JUST CURIOUS WE WE CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHEAST GOTCHA ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM <CROSSTALK> PLUS FOR REGULATED ASSETS PRETTY MUCH ANYWHERE UH PERFECT OKAY THANKS A LOT THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM STEVEN <INAUDIBLE> FROM MORGAN STANLEY PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION HI THANKS IT'S STEVE <INAUDIBLE> ON FOR STEVEN THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION UH I HAVE ONE QUICK FOLLOWUP JUST ON THE HYDROGEN TOPIC WONDERING IF YOU SEE A POTENTIAL PATH FOR THIS TO BE A POTENTIAL PATH FOR THIS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY AT NEWARK AND ALSO IN TERMS OF KIND OF BUSINESS MODEL UM THAT YOU THINK YOU WOULD ENVISION BEING INVOLVED IN OWNING THE ELECTROLYSIS FUNCTION UH WITHIN IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN UM AND IF SO SO YOU HAVE A KIND OF A VISION OR VIEWS ON UH WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS AHEAD OF OTHERS AT THIS POINT THANKS STEVE YEAH I WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT WE'RE LOOKING FR OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO UM OBVIOUSLY WE TALKED ABOUT THE PILOT PROJECT FPL TODAY BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER PILOT TYPES OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE IN THE PORTFOLIO UH CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY THAT WE APPROACH SOL- SOLAR EARLY ON AND OF COURSE BATTERIES UM MORE RECENTLY SO I THINK THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES OVER TIME UH FOR THOSE TYPE OF PILOT PROJECTS YOU KNOW AGAIN WHERE YOU THINK OF IT AS ACTUALLY BEING CLOSED ECONOMIC TODAY ARE AREAS WHERE THERE'S ALREADY SIGNIFICANT PENETRATION OF RENEWABLES UM BECAUSE AS YOU ALL KNOW IT'S CRITICAL TO FIND THAT LOW COST ELECTRICITY SUPPLY UM IN ORDER TO MAKE IT ECONOMIC OR CLOSE TO ECONOMIC UM AND HER IN THE US YOU KNOW THE ECONOMICS CERTAINLY HAVE TO FACTOR IN THAT TODAY THERE'S A VERY LOW COST SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS MAKING IT YOU KNOW THE IMPERATIVE THAT YOU YOU FIND A A CHEAP ELECTRICITY SUPPLY YOU KNOW IT'S EARLY UM YOU KNOW NEVER SAY NEVER ON ON YOU KNOW WHERE WE MIGHT FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST IN THE BUSINESS BUT HISTORICALLY UM AS YOU KNOW WE'VE NOT UH PLAYED IN THE SPACE OF OWNING UH YOU KNOW BEING A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UH YOU KNOW OWNER OF TECHNOLOGIES OR OR PROJECTS UH WE TYPICALLY UM TAKE IN THE BEST OF UM MANUFACTURED EQUIPMENT FROM OTHER FOLKS UM YOU KNOW APPLY OUR SCALE AND OUR ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT OWN AND OPERATE OVER THE LONG TERM EFFECTIVELY IS WHERE WE CREATE VALUE SO AGAIN IT'S EARLY BUT AT THIS POINT I WOULDN'T THINK THAT WE WOULD UH FOCUS ON VERTICALLY INTEGRATING IT'S MORE OF UM YOU KNOW APPLYING HYDROGEN AS A AS A TECHNOLOGY CONSISTENT THE WAY THAT WE'VE UH CREATED VALUE IN THE PAST SO SO THE ONLY I WOULD ADD TO THAT TWO THINGS ONE IS I WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IF UH IN JOHN'S BUSINESS WE DON'T MAKE SOME KIND OF PILOT INVESTMENT IN THE NEXT YEAR UH WERE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF THINGS AND I'D BE DISAPPOINTED IF WE DON'T MAKE SOME KIND OF PILOT INVESTMENT IN THE NEXT YEAR A VERY VERY MUCH TOE IN THE WATER LIKE WE DID A DECADE AGO IN THE BATTERY STORAGE BUSINESS SECONDLY UH YOU KNOW CLEARLY WERE NOT GONNA BACKWARD INTEGRATE INTO MANUFACTURING UH ELECTROLIZERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT UH I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T RULE OUT US OWNING THEM AS PART OF A UH INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT WAS INTEGRATED WITH RENEWABLES TO MANUFACTURE HYDROGEN AND AND IS YOU KNOW OUR VIEW WOULD AROUND THAT WOULD BE IF WE HAD A LONG TERM CONTRACT AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE ACCESS TO VERY UH EFFICIENT CAPITAL WE KNOW HOW TO OPERATE EQUIPMENT UM WE'RE YOU KNOW AND SO A LOT OF THAT WOULD WOULD COME TO OUR I THINK OUR STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF WE HOW WE'RE ABLE TO CREATE VALUE FOR FOLKS SO YOU KNOW I THINK IT I THINK IT'S EARLY WE'RE WE'RE WE ARE THERE'S CLEARLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO UH YOU KNOW FIVE TO YOU KNOW FIVE TO TEN YEARS FROM NOW TO DISPLACE THE LAST 10% OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS OUT OF THE ELECTRIC SECTOR BY MANUFACTURING HYDROGEN IN WITH RENEWABLES THAT'S CLEAR I THINK THERE'S ALSO CLEARLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE RENEWABLES TO DISPLACE DIESEL FUEL AND PERHAPS EVEN UH OTHER TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION FUEL GOING FORWARD AND THERE'S ALSO I THINK CLEARLY UH AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREEN HYDROGEN TO UM TO REP- UH TO REPLACE OTHER TYPES OF HYDROGEN OR AND OTHER FEEDSTOCKS IN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT AND WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT BEING UH ALL OF THAT IN THE END COMES BACK TO UH A VERY IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS THIS IS GOING TO DRIVE GIGAWATTS AND GIGAWATTS AND GIGAWATTS AND GIGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE DEMAND IN THIS COUNTRY AND SO THERE IS NO ONE BETTER POSITIONED THAN US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND WE'RE GONNA BE JUST LIKE WE WERE ON BATTERY STORAGE WE'RE GONNA BE AT THE VANGUARD WE'RE GONNA UH AND WE'RE GONNA THIS IS A BIG STRATEGIC INITIATIVE FOR US AND WE'RE GONNA DRIVE IT AND UH IT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT UH FOR THIS COMPANY I THINK NOT YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT OVER THE NEXT DECADE WE WON'T MAKE ANY MONEY ON IT IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS JUST LIKE WE DIDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY IN BATTERIES IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AND NEXT YEAR WE'RE DEP- WE'RE DEPLOYING A BILLION DOLLARS OFF BATTERIES UH TEN YEARS LATER AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THIS I THINK ABOUT THIS AS IS HELP POWERING THE LONG TERM GROWTH OF THIS COMPANY INTO UH THE BACK HALF OF THIS DECADE AND THE AND THE NEXT DECADE AS WELL GOT IT THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS UM I I JUST HAD ONE OTHER QUICK M&A FOLLOWUP I WAS JUST WONDERING IF UH IS THERE ANY PATH FOR TEXAS TO BE A TARGET UM OF INTEREST FOR YOU FROM AN M&A PERSPECTIVE OR WHAT WOULD NEED TO CHANGE THERE THANKS SO WE WE WE UH WE HAVE UH SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN TEXAS OBVIOUSLY WE OWN ASSETS IN TEXAS AND SO UH WE ARE GREAT OPERATIVE AND UH AND AND WE FEEL LIKE WE WOULD BRING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF STATE WE WE OWN BILLION OF DOLLARS OF ASSETS IN THE STATE RIGHT AND WE'RE A GREAT GREAT PARTNER FOR THE STATE AND SO UM YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER SAY NEVER UM YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY UH WE WERE EXTRAORDINARILY DISAPPOINTED IN THE ENCORE DECISION WE THINK IT WAS UH UH A MISTAKE AND SHORTSIGHTED BUT YOU KNOW THAT IS WHAT IT IS AND UH SO IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE A BIT TO GET PAST THAT BEFORE UH I I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT DOING THINGS IN TEXAS FROM A M&A STANDPOINT UNDERSTOOD UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MICHAEL <INAUDIBLE> FROM GOLDMAN SACHS PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION HI GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION UM I WANT TO TURN TO FLORIDA FOR A SECOND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO <INAUDIBLE> CASES NEXT YEAR UH AT BOTH UTILITIES AND OBVIOUSLY THE COMBINATION OF IT IT WILL BE A BIG FAT SUBJECT IS THERE ANY POTENTIAL FOR BEING ABLE TO DELAY OR DEFER THE TIMING OF THE RATE CASES TO A SEE WHAT HAPPENS FROM A TAX PERSPECTIVE IN D.C FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE JUST SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE REGULATOR TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER A TWO OR THREE YEAR PERIOD AND B IS IS THERE ANY SCENARIO WHERE YOU MAY BOT EVEN NEED A RATE CASE OR RATE PER WEEK GOOD MORNING MICHAEL AND AND UH WE APPRECIATE THE UH THE QUESTION UM AS AS I'VE COMMENTED I THINK EVEN IN THESE PREPARED REMARKS UM WE DO CONTINUE TO BELIEVE UM THAT FPL AND GULF WOULD FILE FOR A COMBINED RATE CASE IN EARLY 20 ' 21 FROM RATES EFFECTIVE IN 202 UM AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED THERE'S THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTIES AND CERTAIN FACTORS THAT CAN CHANGE BUT THAT'S THE REALITY OF OPERATING ANY BUSINESS UH YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW THOSE DAYS AND AND YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN FOR FOR PLANNING FOR UNCERTAINTIES AND UM WE CERTAINLY WOULD CONTEMPLATE UM CHANGES THAT WE ARE AWARE OF AT THE TIME UM BUT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP RUNNING YOUR BUSINESS AND WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS CONTINUING TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INVEST IN FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT AND TO INVEST AT GULF POWER UM IN THESE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE UH FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUT CUSTOMERS YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN O&M COST WE CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN RELIABILITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE UM AND THE BEST WAY TO KEEP DOING THAT IS EXECUTE UM AND THAT MEANS OCCASIONALLY HAVING RATE CASES UM WE ARE UM EXCITED ABOUT THAT PROSPECT WE'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR IT FOR A LONG TIME UM AND WE THINK WE HAVE UM A GREAT STORY TO TELL UM AND WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AT AT FPL AND GULF SO WE'RE RIGHT FOR NOW AND YOU KNOW WHAT OBVIOUSLY THINGS COULD CHANGE BUT FOR NOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE PLANS TO TO FILE IN ' 21 FOR A NEW LEASE EFFECTIVE 202 ALL RIGHT AND ONE OTHER QUESTION JUST ON THE FLORIDA UTILITIES YOU YOU HAVE BEEN THE INDUSTRY LEADER IN TERMS OF COST MANAGEMENT DO YOU THINK THE PACE OF CHANGE IN O&M COST TO CLIENTS WILL STAY AT AT THIS LEVEL MEANING THE YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE OR DECLINE RATES WOULD YOU THINK THEY'RE REACHING A POINT WHERE IT'LL START TO FLATTEN OUT WHERE THE ABILITY TO TAKE OUT AS MUCH COST AS YOU'VE DONE EVERY YEAR WILL START TO SLOW THE SHORTEST ANSWER TO THAT MICHAEL IS WE'VE GOT A VERY CREATIVE TEAM AND WE'VE GOT A TEAM THAT IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND NOT AFRAID OF THAT UM BUT IT LET ME ALSO NOT UNDERESTIMATE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT REQUIRES AND THAT REQUIRES UM THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THOSE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND TAKE THAT COST OUT OVER OVER TIME SO THERE'S YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO WORK FOR IT UM AND SO EVERY YEAR WE WOULD PULL TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH OUR BEST IDEAS UH DO WE THINK OVER THE LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE'VE EXHAUSTED EVERY OPPORTUNITY NO IN PART BECAUSE I THINK TECHNOLOGY WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT BUT IT TAKES TIME TO EXECUTE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES UM SO OUR DISCIPLINE IS THERE OUR CREATIVITY IS THERE OUR INNOVATION UM OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND WERE GONNA DO THE BEST WE CAN TO TO CREATE THE BEST VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS GOT IT THANK YOU REBECCA MUCH APPRECIATED",

At this time, i'd like to turn the conference call over to rap ross scott, director of investor relations. sir, please go ahead. thank you, jamie. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter, twenty twenty combined earnings conference call for next era energy and next era energy partners. with me this morning are jim murphy, chairman and chief executive officer of next era energy, rebecca kyteva, executive vice president and chief financial officer of next era energy, and john ketchum, president and chief executive officer of next era energy partners. energy resources and mick kitson, executive vice president of nexen energy, all of whom are also officers of nexen energy partners, as well as eric sallaway, president and chief executive officer of florida power and light company. rebecca will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. If any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release in the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the company's presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission each of which can be found on our websites next era energy com and next era energy partners com we do not undertake any duty to update any forward looking statements today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying this presentation Today's presentation for definitive information and reconciliation of historical non-gap measures to the closest gap financial measure. with that, i will turn the call over to rebecca thank you, matt, and good morning, everyone next era delivered strong second-quarter results and continue to perform well both financially and operationally while managing the ongoing impacts of the covid nineteen pandemic as part of our core goal of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers, we continue to operate under our Pandemic Plan that we activated last quarter despite the challenges created by the pandemic, NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than eleven percent versus the prior year comparable quarter and we are well positioned to meet our overall objectives for the year FPL increased earnings per share by fifteen cents per year and its strong execution continues across the board during the quarter FPL set a new system peak load of more than twenty four thousand five hundred megawatts Fpl's transmission and distribution systems continue to operate in line with our high reliability standards and our highly efficient gas-generating facilities remain available to serve our customers fpl's continued strong execution is a result of the smart capital investments that we have made over the past several decades to enhance our customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions consistent with enhancing its best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions consistent with enhancing its best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions consistent with enhancing its best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions consistent with enhancing last month, fpl announced plans to retire sherifor, its last remaining coal unit. together with our joint interest owner, gea, and subject to certain approvals from the florida public service commission, fpl intends to retire the eight hundred forty seven megawatt coal-fired plant in early twenty twenty two. the retirement of sherifor is projected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for fpl customers and prevent roughly four million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from this unit. Sharef's retirement is the final step of the coal phase out strategy that fpl launched in twenty fifteen and that will complete the complete closure of approximately two thousand seven hundred megawatts of coal capacity including the highest greenhouse emitting gas power plants in florida these transactions which will make fpl one of the first utilities to eliminate all of the coal from its generation portfolio demonstrate fpl's continued commitment and position as a clean energy leader we remain proud of our environmental track record, particularly the c o two emissions reductions that we have delivered throughout florida and across the country and we continue to remain focused on building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable gulf power also had a strong quarter of execution the focus on operational cost effectiveness at gulf continues to progress well with year to date o and m costs excluding specific covid nineteen related expenses that declining by nearly ten percent versus the prior year's comparable period and by approximately twenty five percent relative to twenty eighteen gulf power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and continued its significant improvement in employee safety, safety with no OSHA recordables year to date through the end of june we remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we previously outlined at gulf power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years during the quarter We completed our annual storm drills for fpl and gulf power to prepare for the unprecedented situation of restoring power after a hurricane in the midst of the covid nineteen pandemic we spent two weeks drilling and challenging our teams to find ways to efficiently restore service to our customers without sacrificing safety the drills provided a number of lessons including how to leverage technology to quickly and safely screen personnel at various staging sites to help offset some of the challenges that will inevitably occur. when performing storm restoration in the midst of a pandemic while we hope that our service territories will avoid the impacts of hurricanes this year consistent with our culture that is focused on preparedness and execution we continue to do everything we can to ensure that we will be there for our customers when they need us most at energy resources, adjusted eps increased by thirteen cents per year the energy resources team continued to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low cost renewables Adding one thousand seven hundred thirty megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call this continued originations success through the ongoing pandemic is a testament to the energy resources significant competitive advantages including our best in class renewables development skills our engineering and construction team also continues to execute commissioning roughly six hundred fifty megawatts during the quarter and keeping the remaining approximately four thousand four hundred megawatts of wind and solar projects during the quarter. We expect to complete this year on track despite the significant supply chain challenges that are occurring both globally and locally. while we are monitoring the situation closely, we continue to expect that all of our planned twenty twenty renewables projects will achieve their in-service dates this year in response to increased investor focus on environmental, social, and governance issues or esg next week, we expect to publish nextera energy's updated esg report, which includes reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting on reporting Under the sustainability accounting standards board or sasb disclosures our company has been focused on all of the elements of esg for more than twenty five years external energy's approach to governance and risk oversight combined with the way that we treat our people our customers our communities and the environment are proof that a company can be both sustainable and financially successful at the same time the new report highlights this alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenets of esg v s g includes a robust discussion of risk oversight and incorporates new disclosures such as diversity and inclusion metrics diversity and inclusion matter deeply to us as a company both because we believe they are the right thing to do but also because diverse and inclusive teams deliver better business results for the diverse communities that we serve our commitment to having a diverse workforce and inclusive culture is not new and our diversity metrics are better than many of the companies in our industry however, consistent with our focus on continuous improvement we are not satisfied and will continue our efforts to build an even more diverse and inclusive team going forward overall, we will please with the progress we've made and extra energy so far in twenty twenty add to the second half of the year we believe we are well positioned to achieve the full year expectations that we have previously discussed even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic now let's turn to our financial results for the first quarter of the year. The detailed results beginning with fpl for the second quarter of twenty twenty fpl reported net income of seven hundred forty nine million dollars or a dollar fifty two per share which is an increase of eighty six million dollars and fifteen cents per share respectively year over year regulatory capital employed increased by more than ten percent over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of fpl's net income growth of approximately thirteen percent fpl's capital expenditures were approximately one point eight percent BILLION DOLLARS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND WE NOW EXPECT OUR FULL YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO TOTAL BETWEEN SIX POINT FIVE BILLION AND SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A REPORTED ROE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JUNE TWENTY TWO WHICH IS AT THE UPPER END OF THE ALLOWED BAND OF NINE POINT SIX TO ELEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT ALLOWED UNDER OUR CURRENT RATE Leaving fpl with a balance of seven hundred thirty six million dollars. we continue to expect that fpl will end twenty twenty with a sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement during twenty twenty one as we've previously discussed, we expect that fpl and gulf will operate as a single larger florida utility company which will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers as a result. In may, the companies filed an application with ferc for an approval of an internal reorganization whereby gulf would merge into fpl subject to ferc approval, the companies will merge in january of twenty twenty one however, during twenty twenty one, gulf power will continue to operate as a separate operating division serving its existing customers under separate retail rates we continue to expect the companies to file a combined rate case in the first quarter of next year for new rates Effective in january twenty twenty two turning to our development efforts all of our major capital initiatives at fpl remain on track and on budget during the quarter the final three hundred megawatts of solar being built under the solar base rate adjustment or sober mechanism of fpl's base rate settlement agreement were placed into service the twelve hundred megawatts of cost-effective solar constructed under the sober mechanism are expected to generate significant customer benefits and represent the In the early stages of fpl's rapid solar expansion and the next phase of its generation modernization efforts the next six solar together projects totaling approximately four hundred and fifty megawatts remain on track to be placed in service later this year the final six hundred megawatts of the roughly fifteen hundred megawatt community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year beyond solar construction on the highly efficient roughly twelve hundred megawatt dania beach clean energy center remains on track schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date in twenty twenty two additionally, the four hundred nine megawatt manatee storage facility, which will be one of the world's largest battery storage plants, is on track and on budget to be complete next year based on our ongoing analysis of the long-term potential of low-cost renewables, we remain confident as ever that wind, solar, and battery storage will be hugely disruptive to the energy's existing generation, the country's existing generation. while reducing costs for customers and helping to achieve future co2 emissions reductions however, to achieve an emissions-free future, we believe that other technologies will be necessary and we are particularly excited about the long-term potential of hydrogen consistent with the tow-in-the-water approach we've previously utilized with solar and battery storage we are planning to propose a hydrogen pilot project at fpl this is approximately sixty five million dollar pilot project which, subject to florida public service commission approval, is expected to be in service in twenty twenty three will utilize solar energy that would have otherwise been clipped to produce a hundred percent green hydrogen through a roughly twenty megawatt electrolysis system the hydrogen will be used to replace a portion of the natural gas that is consumed by one of the three gas turbines at the okeechobee clean energy center we believe that the project is a complement to our ongoing solar and battery storage development efforts and highlights fpil's continued innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of the clean energy solutions available for its customers we continue to evaluate other potential hydrogen opportunities across our businesses and while our near-term investments are expected to be small in context of our overall capital program we are excited about the technology's long-term potential which should further support future demand for low-cost renewables as well as accelerate the decarbonization of of transportation fuel and industrial feedstocks we continue to expect that fpl's ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in the regulatory capital employed of approximately nine percent from eighteen through twenty twenty two while further enhancing our best in class customer value proposition let me now turn to gulf power which reported second quarter twenty nineteen twenty two gains of fifty five million dollars or eleven cents per share a decline have one cent per share relative to the gulf power's adjusted earnings per share in the prior year period this quarter's results include the impact of roughly five million dollars of after tax covid nineteen related expenses primarily reflecting the expected incremental bad debt expense as a result of the pandemic earlier this month the florida public service commission approved gulf power's request to record costs attributable to covid nineteen including bad debt expense as a regulatory asset on its balance sheet as a result, the cost recorded during the second quarter are expected to be reversed during the third quarter as the regulatory asset is recorded. gulf powers reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately ten point four percent for the twelve months ending june twenty twenty for the full year twenty twenty we are targeting a regulatory roe in the upper half of the allowed band of nine point two five percent to eleven point two five percent during the quarter, gulf powers capital expenditures Were roughly a hundred and seventy million dollars and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between one point zero and one point one billion dollars all of gulf's major smart capital investments including the north florida resiliency connection and the plant crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to progress well similar to other parts of the country the florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic recent economic data reflects an increase in unemployment claims and a decline in retail sales and florida's unemployment rate and a decline in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes to national averages of each metric. while it is still unclear at this point how severely the economy will ultimately be impacted, we continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages with which florida entered the crisis and the continued attraction of the state to both new residents, residents, and businesses will support a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us. we remain deeply committed to supporting our residents, businesses, and communities through this challenging time. Engaged in helping florida return from this stronger than ever we will continue to do our part to support that outcome including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition during the quarter, pfl's average number of customers continued its recent trend of strong underlying growth, increasing by approximately seventy-five thousand from the comparable period. prior year quarter fpl's second quarter retail sales decreased by point eight percent year over year as customer growth and favorable weather were more than offset by a decline in underlying usage for customer. based on our analysis, the overall effects of the pandemic on underlying usage during the second quarter were relatively muted. fpl benefits from having its retail sales being heavily weighted towards residential customers and approximately forty percent of its load is cooling related and therefore important. Comfort and building maintenance during april, when stay-at-home orders were broadly in effect, Aprile's weather-normalized retail sales were down approximately four percent relative to our expectations. as the economy began reopening in early may, weather-normalized retail sales improved and were above our expectations in june. while the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage remain unknown at this time, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by a reserve amortization mechanism to offset any fluctuations. Retail sales or bad debt expense and support regulatory oo at the upper end of the allowed band of nine point six percent to eleven point six percent under our current rate agreement for gulf power the average number of customers increased approximately one point three percent versus the comparable prior year quarter gulf power's second quarter retail sales declined by roughly six point two percent year over year as a result of the under of the unfavorable weather comparison and a decline in underlying usage for customers over the second quarter, gulf power experienced a more significant decline in underlying usage for customers than fpl but also experienced an improvement as the economy began reopening in may and june as a reminder, unlike fpl, gulf power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs to any variability would therefore have more impact to gulf's earnings than o&m than fpl as a reminder, as we've often mentioned, gulf power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs to any variability would therefore have more impact to gulf's earnings than o&m than fpl as a reminder, as we've often mentioned, gulf power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its Discussed whether normalization is imprecise, particularly when evaluating short periods of time. Additional details on retail sales at fpl and gulf power are included in the appendix of today's presentation. let me now turn to energy resources, which reported second quarter twenty twenty gap earnings of four hundred eighty one million dollars or ninety seven cents per share and adjusted earnings of five hundred thirty one million dollars or a dollar o eight per share. this is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of thirteen cents. Approximately fourteen percent from last year's comparable quarter results which have been restated to reflect the results of our next era energy transmission business formerly reported in corporate other new investments added eight cents per share contributions from existing generation assets increased five cents per share as improved wind resource and increased ptc volume from our repower wind projects were partially offset by the refueling outage at the seabrook nuclear facility second quarter fleetwide Wind resource was ninety nine percent of the long-term average versus ninety three percent during the second quarter of nineteen nineteen also contributing favorably was next ergy transmission where contributions increased by three cents versus nineteen nineteen contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines were flat year over year these favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business which declined four cents versus the particularly strong long, second quarter last year all other impacts increased results by one cent per share as i mentioned earlier, energy resources development team had another excellent quarter of origination success, adding one thousand seven hundred thirty megawatts to our backlog since our last earnings call, we have added seven hundred eighty megawatts of wind, eight hundred forty four megawatts of solar, and a hundred seventy eight megawatts of battery storage to our renewables backlog we also executed a build own transfer agreement Agreement for a two hundred megawatt solar project which is not included in our backlog editions all of the battery storage projects will be paired with either new or existing solar projects to take advantage of the itc and provide a more firm renewable product for our customers the continued strong demand for battery storage projects highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade, without incentives, new near-firm wind and new near-firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal and nuclear facilities and less fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units, producing significant long-term renewables demand. Our current backlog now totals approximately fourteen thousand four hundred megawatts and is the largest we have ever had in our roughly twenty years of development. To put our backlog into context, it is larger than the current operating and wind solar portfolios of all but two other companies in the world as of year 2019, highlighting the next era energy continues to be at the forefront of destruction that is occurring within the energy sector only halfway through twenty twenty we are pleased to have already signed nearly thirty five hundred megawatts of contracts for delivery beyond twenty twenty two which is a reflection of the continued strong Economic demand for wind solar and battery storage to ensure that we can take advantage of this significant demand in the coming years we have now more than two billion dollars of safe harbor wind and solar equipment which could support as much as forty billion dollars of wind solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from twenty twenty one to twenty twenty four these purchases highlight the benefits of scale and the strength of our balance sheet that we have Leverages as a key competitive advantage in renewables development and position us well for continued long-term growth. the state of georgia's workforce also supports additional repowering opportunities, including several hundred megawatts of potential twenty twenty one repowering projects which we are currently evaluating. as i discussed earlier, all of the twenty twenty renewables projects remain on track to achieve their targeted in-service dates this year. as a result, we do not expect these projects to rely on the upcoming federal tax credits. dated treasury start of construction guidance that was released during the quarter beyond renewables, we continue to make progress with mountain valley pipeline and work with our project partners to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for the pipeline's construction we were pleased with the supreme court's ruling regarding appalachian trail crossing authorization authority which resolved similar issues for m v we were similarly pleased that the supreme court partially stayed the montana federal court's decision related to the pipeline's construction The wide twelve permit program and are working with the army corps of engineers on its reissuance of the project's permit following comprehensive restudy by the relevant agencies we expect issuance of nbps revised biological opinion shortly assuming timely resolution of the outstanding permitting issues we are now targeting a full in-service date for the pipeline during early twenty twenty one and expect an overall project estimate in the range of five point four to five point seven billion dollars. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy for the second quarter of twenty twenty gap net income attributable to NextEra Energy was one point two seven five billion dollars or two dollars and fifty nine cents per share NextEra Energy's twenty twenty second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were one point two eight six billion dollars and two dollars and sixty one cents per share respectively adjusted earnings from corporate and other declined by one cent year over year primarily as a result of a decline in adjusted eps from corporate and other declined by one cent year over year primarily as a result of a decline in adjusted eps from corporate and other declined by one cent year over year primarily as a result of a decline in adjusted eps from corporate and other declined by one cent year over year primarily as Our interest expense nextera energy also delivered strong year-to-date operating cash flow growth and for the full year twenty twenty expects to generate roughly eight point five billion dollars in operating cash flow to help support its strong financial position nextera energy maintains approximately thirteen billion dollars in liquidity this is to support the largest capital investment program in our history since last quarter's call we completed roughly three billion dollars in long-term financings it included A two point two billion dollars in capital holdings to ventures over the course of the last few months we repaid nearly all of the term loans that we issued during march and april and converted these commitments to bilateral revolving credit facilities included in these facilities is a total of more than one billion dollars in six month storm facilities at fpl and gulf power which similar to previous years we put in place to insure sufficient liquidity in the event of a hurricane Energy resources also closed two tax equity financing's including its first ever combined wind and solar portfolio financing and we expect to close on the balance of our tax equity financing's as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year our year-to-date financing activities are evidence of the great financial partnerships we have built over time which help provide ample liquidity and continued access to capital to support our outstanding growth prospects extra energy's Financial expectations remain unchanged. we continue to expect that nextel's adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in a range of six percent to eight percent through twenty twenty one off of the twenty eighteen adjusted eps of seven dollars and seventy cents plus the accretion of fifteen cents and twenty cents in twenty twenty and twenty twenty one respectively from the florida acquisitions for twenty twenty we continue to expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of eight dollars and seventy cents. cents to nine dollars and twenty cents for twenty twenty two we expect to grow adjusted eps in the range of six to eight percent off of the twenty twenty one adjusted eps translating to a range of ten dollars to ten dollars and seventy five cents per share from twenty eighteen to twenty twenty two we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we also continue to expect to grow our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we also continue to expect to grow our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we also continue to expect to grow our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we also continue to expect to grow our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we also continue to expect to grow our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we also continue to Dividends per share at roughly ten percent per year through at least twenty twenty two off of a twenty twenty base while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined in summary to cite the challenges created by the covid nineteen pandemic all of our businesses continue to perform well and maintain their excellent prospects for growth going forward we have a long-term track record of delivering results for our customers and shareholders and we remain intensely focused on continuing that track record based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and their strong growth prospects we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in twenty twenty, twenty twenty one and twenty twenty two while at the same time maintaining our strong credit metrics we continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and believe that next energy is well positioned to drive long-term shareholder value over the coming years let me now turn to next energy partners, which continued its strong start to twenty twenty with growth growth and adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution of approximately thirty three percent and forty six percent respectively from the prior year compliant quarter on a year-to-date basis, adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution of approximately thirty three percent and forty six percent respectively from the prior year compliant quarter on a year-to-date basis for distribution have increased by twenty six percent and eighty six percent respectively versus twenty nineteen the strong operational and financial performance at next energy partners highlights the next energy partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives yesterday the next energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of fifty seven point seven five cents per common unit or two dollars and thirty one per common unit on an annualized basis continuing Tracking our record of growing distributions at the top end of our twelve to fifteen percent per year growth range, we were pleased to see pg&e's emergence from bankruptcy earlier this month. as expected, all of our existing contracts were assumed without modification. following pg&e's emergence from bankruptcy, next energy partners received a cash distribution of approximately sixty five million dollars from our desert sunlight two fifty and three hundred projects which represent current distributions and those of future projects. Previously withheld as a result of bankruptcy the release of the desert sunlight track cash supplements next energy partners liquidity which was approximately six hundred and fifty million dollars including cash on hand at the end of the second quarter the organic growth investments at next energy partners continue to progress well the approximately two hundred and seventy five megawatts of wind repowering and the texas pipeline expansion both remain on track to be in service later this year we continue to expect to execute on these initiatives Additional attractive growth opportunities as next energy partners portfolio further expands let me now review the detailed results for next energy partners second quarter adjusted ebitda was three hundred forty nine million dollars and cash available for distribution was one hundred sixty six million dollars up twenty three percent and forty six percent respectively against the prior year comparable quarter now that the pg&e bankruptcy has been favorably resolved and distributions from our desert sunlight projects have resumed cash available for distribution was up twenty three percent and forty six percent respectively against the prior year comparable quarter Distribution includes all contributions from pggn related projects. new projects added fifty one million dollars in adjusted ebitda and thirty six million dollars with cash available for distribution. existing projects also contributed favorably to the significant year over year growth in adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution as resource was favorable across the portfolio for the second quarter when resource was a hundred percent of the long term average versus ninety four percent in the prior year. A comparable quarter cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project level debt service primarily as a result of the early debt retirement to facilitate the wind repowerings the reduction in project level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results are net of idr fees since we treat these as an operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slide let me now turn to next energy partners expectations which remain unchanged Unchanged energy partners continues to expect december thirty first twenty twenty run rate for adjusted ebitda to be in a range of one point two two five billion to one point four billion dollars and cash available for distribution in the range of five hundred sixty million to six hundred forty million dollars reflecting calendar year twenty twenty one expectations for the portfolio at the end of twenty twenty. now that the pg&e bankruptcy has been favorably resolved, we will no longer provide cash flow expectations including contributions. Excluding the contributions from the desert semi-projects. as a reminder, these expectations include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense. from the base of our fourth quarter twenty nineteen distribution for common unit at an annualized rate of two dollars and fourteen cents, we continue to see twelve to fifteen percent growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least twenty twenty four. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter twenty nineteen distribution for common unit at an annualized rate of two dollars and fourteen cents, we continue to see twelve to fifteen percent growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least twenty twenty four. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter twenty nineteen distribution for common unit at an annualized rate of two dollars Quarterly twenty twenty distribution that is payable in february of twenty twenty one to be in a range of two dollars and forty cents to two dollars and forty six cents per common unit similar to next energy while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with our overall expectations with a resumption of cash distributions from the desert sun midstream projects we now expect to achieve next energy partners twenty twenty distribution that is payable in february of twenty twenty one to be in a range of two dollars and forty cents to two dollars and forty six cents per common unit similar to next energy while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with our overall expectations with a resumption of c Twenty distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing twelve month pay-out ratio of approximately seventy percent highlighting the significant flexibility we believe next energy partners has going forward as we've previously discussed, we will continue to be opportunistic next energy partners favorable positioning should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022 we are pleased with next energy partners' distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing twelve month pay-out ratio of approximately seventy percent highlighting the significant flexibility we believe next energy partners has going forward as we've previously discussed, we will continue to be opportunistic next energy partners favorable positioning should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022 we are pleased with next energy energy partners, year-to-date performance in twenty twenty and believe it continues to offer a best-in-class value proposition for investors the diversity and long-term contracted nature of energy partners clean energy portfolio helps insulate it from the broader economic conditions including impacts related to the covid nineteen pandemic with a flexibility to grow in three ways acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from third parties energy partners has clear visibility into To its growth going forward following another strong quarter of originations energy resources portfolio of renewable projects now totals more than twenty seven gigawatts including the signed backlog of projects that energy resources plans to build in the coming years when combined with the prospects for future renewables development next energy partners long-term growth visibility remains as strong as ever next energy partners cost of capital and access to capital advantages Including significant demand from various low-cost private infrastructure capital provide flexibility to finance this growth over the long term these strengths, together with nextera energy partners favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights leave nextera energy partners uniquely positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives going forward in closing, we believe that the fundamental value proposition of nextera energy and nextera energy partners remains as robust as ever. Whatever. Both companies remain resilient and well-positioned to deliver on their commitments. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and are continued and are focused on delivering smart capital investments that enhance value for both customers and shareholders and expand our position as the world's leading clean energy provider. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions. You would like to ask a question. please press star and then one using a touch tone telephone to withdraw your question. you may press star and two if you are using a speaker phone. we do ask that you please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers to ensure the best sound quality. once again, that is star and then one to ask a question. we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. First question today comes from julian smith from bank of america. please go ahead with your question. hey, and morning, this is actually richie here for julian. just had a question around the capx raids at fpl and gulf. what was driving that? is that more around underground grid hardening or is that more on the solar side? and as we think about the capx trajectory from twenty one and beyond, is that more in line with what you disclose on your analyst day? Or should we expect it to be on more of these robust robust levels going forward richey, good morning, and thanks for the question. i think it really reflects a you know consistency with what we've been talking about for a long time which is we keep finding terrific projects for our customers and investment opportunities and we're starting to put those in place as a highlighted in the prepared remarks we do have a consistent expectations for the growth rate Between 2018 and 2022 of a nine percent compound annual growth rate. so obviously some projects move from one year to another but at the heart of it it is terrific investments for the benefit of our customers as far as beyond 2022 you know it's similar to comments that we've made in the past the growth opportunities that we see across all of our businesses but specific at fpl and gulf power include the modernization efforts including the large deployment of solar over Time as well as investments in grid hardening and undergrounding is highlighted by the storm protection plan that we're in the process of going through approvals and and and you know, initial investments for that program so we're super excited about the opportunities for investing and again stay very focused on ensuring that these are good projects for the benefit of our customers got it thanks that's very helpful and then just around your comments around hydrogen i think Disclose sixty five million for that pilot project what what are you seeing there on that front is this more around transportation opportunities or is this all around like a pipeline and being able to like blend with pipes so we're really excited about hydrogen in in particular when we think about getting to a not zero emissions profile but being able to like blend with pipes Actually, a zero carbon emissions profile. And for, when, you know, when we looked at this, let's call it five ten years ago, and we thought about what it would take to get to true zero emissions, we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive for customers. What makes us really excited about hydrogen, particularly in the twenty thirty and beyond time frame, is that that has the potential to supplement significant deployment of renewables, including wind and solar technologies, complimented by shore power. And i'll call it medium-term duration batteries but then that last amount of emissions that you would take out of the system to get down to zero could be most economically served by hydrogen so that's what makes us excited about doing a pilot project. we're very excited about the opportunity to present that to the florida public service commission as a way to further enhance fpl's ability to innovate and deliver these long-term clean energy solutions to our customers AND AS PART OF THAT WE'LL LEARN ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES AND WE'LL SEE WHAT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE POTENTIALLY FOR THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SECTORS YOU KNOW AND FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THAT THE GREEN ENERGY TO PRODUCE THE GREEN HYDROGEN IS A POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US WE THINK WE'RE AT THE EARLY STAGES WHICH IS YOU KNOW KIND OF CONSISTENT WITH OUR TOE IN THE WATER APPROACH WE WANT TO GET SOME EXPERIENCE WITH IT OB Talk to folks in the in the supply chain and and get better equipped to deal with you know, take advantage of these opportunities but we're really excited about it all right, thanks, love that. that's all the questions i have thank you, rickie. our next question comes from shar perez from guggenheim partners. please go ahead with your question hi, good morning. it's actually constance here for shar as well. congratulations on a great quarter. it's a We've definitely seen some impressive numbers for the backlog editions and kind of contract increases for the twenty two time frame. just kind of curious on kind of your thoughts around kind of near's growth trajectory and kind of contributions to the business mix. it's kind of subsided as a conversation point from the rating agencies but just thoughts on kind of growing contributions from near kind of versus balancing that from the regulated contributions. are you thinking about botox acquisition? Or kind of any kind of drop-downs accelerated from near just some thoughts around that thanks, kate, we appreciate, appreciate your diligence in this morning we're really excited about pursuing opportunities for investment across the board and of course, at fpl and gulf, that's focused on investments that that need to create value for our customers and our energy resources, it's return-focused, along with, you know, delivering things for our customers there, too. so from a corporate perspective, it's return-focused, along with, you know, delivering things for our customers there, too. so from a corporate perspective, it's return-focused, along with, you know, delivering things for our customers there, too. so from a corporate perspective, it's return-foc Perspective, we don't want to limit any of our businesses when we find great investment opportunities which, you know, again, i can't highlight enough about how excited we are about the renewables development prospects at energy resources. so we're not going to constrain them in any way. you know, we will develop those opportunities that create value for shareholders and to the extent that we want to maintain balance over time, we've got a lot of opportunities to do that that are creative for shareholders including recycling of capital through next energy partners which is a Is obviously a willing and excited acquirer of energy resources projects but energy resources has the ability to recycle capital to third parties as well. so there's plenty of ways to ensure that we can create the real value, creative opportunities and still think about it from a corporate perspective in a variety of different ways. thanks, that's that's very helpful. and kind of pivoted a little bit to something a little bit longer term, i guess. Let me get some of your thoughts on the november election and kind of the biden campaign has put out some plans and frameworks out there higher tax rate clean energy support how is next era positions or kind of potential changes at the federal level so so this is jim you know we we always position our business to try to win regardless of the outcome of elections and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and So, you know, we i think you can remember back three you know, close to four years ago now, there was some turmoil around our stock when president trump was elected. we've managed completely fine under this administration in terms of being able to continue to grow our renewable business because you know what? it's all about economics, right? and and the time for renewables is now and and that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's Kind of transcends politics, frankly. The economics and the need to you know, and the and and really the need to decarbonize not only the electric sector but the rest of the sectors of the economy are really, really, you know, really frankly transcend what happens in elections. And so you obviously we watch them closely. We think good clean energy policies are important and the right policy for for america in the future. And and We continue, i think, to be positioned really well, regardless of who wins in november. okay, that makes sense. i'll jump back in the queue. thanks a lot. thanks a lot. our next question comes from michael weinstein from credit swiss. please go ahead with your question. hi, good morning, guys. hey, on the same question, jim, are you what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what do you think is what most likely outcome from the congress these days. tax credit extensions, cash grants, do you think a national renewable portfolio standard is a possibility? i'm just wondering of all those different alternatives, what do you think might actually occur in the next four years you know, so i think it's honestly too soon to tell michael. i think a lot is going to depend on what happens in the election. And is there continued split government or is there not split government that'll be i think a big driver of what policies happen and and you know i think all of those ideas are on the table. we've been consistent in in in what we've said which is that we think it's important to have good and fair clean energy policy going forward. we also have said that it's you know we think it's important to have good and fair clean energy policy going forward. we also have said that it's you know we think it's important to have good and fair clean energy policy going forward. we also have said that it's you know we think it's important to have good and fair clean energy policy going forward. we also have said that it's you know we think it's important to have good and fair clean energy policy going forward. we also have said that that we think wind and and renewables with batteries will be you know are very competitive you know once the p t c s and the it c s fade out in terms of competing against conventional generation. it's just honestly really more a matter of the speed with which you want to decarbonize is what is going to ultimately drive the final i think policy choices. and so we are you know obviously were actively engaged in in the discussions and i think it's premature really to say what we think is going to happen because i think you have an election in four or five months and as you all know, elections have consequences and and you know we'll we'll see what happens post the election in terms of what's going to be the policy landscape going forward great, hey, i'm on hydrogen dean, i noticed there's a lot of a lot more work Some renewables, rather than gas turbines, in your future construction plants at fdl and i'm just wondering if, if hydrogen works out, is that a method? do you think you could actually build more, put more gas turbines back into the plan, if, if hydrogen production becomes a viable economic alternative or do you think other alternative technologies are better suited, such as fuel cells? mike, i think from a hydrogen perspective, and specific to POWER OF LIGHT COMPANY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL HYDROGEN OPPORTUNITIES REALLY IN THE TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND TIME FRAME. AND IN THAT INTERVENING TIME WE DEPLOY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SOLAR TECHNOLOGY AND IF WE'RE RIGHT AND IF THE COST COMES DOWN FOR HYDROGEN AND IT IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR SUPPORTING GETTING TO A ZERO EMISSIONS PROFILE WE WOULD RETROFIT CERTAIN OF OUR GAS FACILITIES TO RUN ON HYDROGEN OR RUN ON A PORT So i think for florida power and light and gulf power you know it's at this point and again if we're talking about a long way into the future you wouldn't necessarily need to build any new you know hydrogen gas turbines in that in that portfolio because we've got a tremendously efficient fleet that's already in service and the investments we would make would be really around conversion now whether or not that's true elsewhere in the country i think is you know it might be a little bit different but we're talking about a long way down the future you wouldn't necessarily need to build any new you know hydrogen gas turbines in that in that portfolio because we've got a tremendously efficient fleet that's already in service and the investments we would make would be really around conversion now whether or not that's true elsewhere And a lot of things need to come together to have those types of conversations. I think it's it's fairly preliminary. got it. and one final question, just make your comment on m n a interests these days, what's going on with m n a cooper, et cetera. so i think we we this won't be surprising, we remain interested in m n a. we think there's a lot that we can bring to the table. we you know, i continue to believe that there's not a utility in the country that we couldn't run. m n a. we think there's a lot that we can bring to the table. we you know, i continue to believe that there's not a utility in the country that we couldn't run. m n a. we think there's a lot that we can bring more efficiently and better for customers. and i truly believe that. and so you know, we continue to look. i think in terms of sandy cooper, you know, that process has been pushed to next year. and we remain, you know, we remain very interested and and continue to be focused on trying to make that happen. hey, jim, what regions of the country are you focused on? just curious. we we continue to be focused on Midwest and the south east. that's right. all right. thank you very much. yeah. phosphorus regulated assets pretty much anywhere. okay. thanks a lot. our next question comes from stephen bird from morgan stanley. please go ahead with your question. our next question comes from dave arcaro on for stephen. thanks for taking my question. had one quick follow-up just on the hydrogen topic. wondering if you see a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential for a potential Path for this to be an opportunity at near and also in terms of kind of business model but do you think that you would envision being involved in owning the electrolysis function within the supply chain and if so do you have a kind of a vision or a view on what technology is ahead of others at this point thanks dave i would say at this point we're looking for opportunities across the portfolio obviously we talked about the pilot project fpl Day but we are looking at other pilot type investment opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio consistent with the way that we approach solar earlier on and of course batteries more recently so i think there will be opportunities over time for those type of of pilot projects you know again where you think of it as actually being close to economic today are areas where there's already significant penetration of renewables because as you well know it's critical to find a low cost electricity Electricity supply in order to make it economical or close to economical and here in the u. s. you know the economics certainly have to factor in that today there's a very low cost supply of natural gas making it you know the imperative that you you find a cheap electricity supply you know it's early you know never say never on where we might find opportunities to invest in the business but historically as you know we've not played in the space of of owning of electricity supply We're aiming to be a vertically integrated owner of technologies or projects. We've typically taken the best of manufactured equipment from other folks. Apply our scale and our ability to construct own and operate over the long term effectively is where we create value. So again, it's early, but at this point, I wouldn't think that we would focus on vertically integrating. It's more of you know, applying hydrogen as a technology consistent with the ways that we've done it in the past. created value in the past so so the only thing i would add to that two things is i'd be disappointed if in john's business we don't make some in some kind of pilot investment in the next year we're looking at a variety of things and and i'd be disappointed if we don't make some kind of pilot investment in the next year a very very much towing the water like we did a decade ago in the battery storage business secondly you know clearly we're not going to backward integrate into manufacturing electrical or anything like that, but i wouldn't i wouldn't rule out us owning them as part of a integrated system that was integrated with renewables to manufacture hydrogen and and is you know our view would around that would be if we had a long term contract and obviously we have access to very efficient capital we know how to operate equipment we're where you know and so a lot of that would Would come to our i think our strategic advantages in terms of how we how we're able to create value for folks. so you know i think it i think it's early. we're we are there's clearly an opportunity to to you know five to you know five to ten years from now to displacing the last ten percent of the carbon emissions out of the electric sector by manufacturing hydrogen and With renewables that's clear. i think there's also clearly an opportunity to make renewables to displace diesel fuel and perhaps even other types of transportation fuel going forward. and there's also i think clearly an opportunity to make green hydrogen to to replace other types of hydrogen or and other feedstocks in industrial applications. And so we're looking at all of that and we're not you know we're not being all of that in the end comes back to a very important thing which is this is going to drive gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts of renewable demands in this country and so there is no one better positioned than us to take advantage of that and we're going to be just like we were on battery storage we're going to be at the vanguard we're going to be and we're going to be just like we were on battery storage we're going to be at the vanguard we're going to be and we're going to be just like we were on battery storage we're going to be at the vanguard we're going to be and we're going to be just this is a big strategic initiative for us and we're gonna drive it and it's gonna be very important for this company i think not you know over the next over the next decade we won't make any money on it in the next five years just like we didn't make any money on batteries in the first five years and and next year we're we're deploying a billion dollars of batteries ten years later and so that's the way i think about this i think about this is is help powering the long-term growth of this company into the back half of Decade and in the next decade as well. got it, that's really helpful. thank you so much for those comments. i just had one other emn a follow-up. i was just wondering if there any path for texas to be a target of interest for you from an emn a perspective or what would need to change there. thanks. so we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we Time in texas. obviously, we own assets in texas. and so we are a great operator and and and we feel like we would bring an enormous amount of state. we we own billions of dollars of assets in the state. right. and we're a great, great partner for the state. and so you know, i would never say never. you know, obviously we were extraordinarily disappointed in the oncor decision. we think it was a mistake. make and a shortsighted, but you know that is what it is. and so it's probably gonna take a bit to get past that before i'm super excited about doing things in texas from an mna perspective. i understand. that's good. understood. thank you very much. our next question, professor michael lepitas from goldman sax. please go ahead with your question. hi, good morning, everybody. thanks. our next question, professor michael lepitas from goldman sax. please go ahead with your question. hi, good morning, everybody. thanks. our next question, professor michael lepitas from goldman sax. please go ahead with your question. hi, good morning, everybody. thanks. our next question, professor michael lepitas from goldman sax. please go ahead with your question. hi, For taking my question. um, i want to turn to florida for a second. you're supposed to file rate cases next year at both utilities and obviously the combination of the two will be a big, big threat. is there any potential for being able to delay or defer the timing of the rate cases to, ah, see what happens from a tax perspective in d c from a public policy perspective just so you don't have to go back to the regulator two or three times over a two or three year period? and b is there any scenario where you may not even need a rate case or rate relief good morning michael and and we appreciate the the question as as i've commented i think even in in these prepared remarks we do continue to believe that fpl and gulf would file for a combined rate case in early twenty twenty one for any new rates effective in twenty twenty two as you highlighted there's there's some uncertainties and certain factors Could change but that's the reality of operating any business you know what you know those days and and you do the best you can for for planning for uncertainties and we certainly would contemplate changes that we're aware of at the time but you know you got to keep running your business and what's most important from our perspective is continuing to have the ability to invest in florida power and light and invest at gulf power in these great opportunities that we see for the benefit of our customers Customers. you know, we continue to lead the industry in anem costs. we continue to lead the industry in reliability and customer service and the best way to keep doing that is to execute and that means occasionally having rate cases. we are excited about that prospect. we've been preparing for it for a long time and we think we have a great story to tell and we welcome the opportunity to talk about the things that we've been doing at at&t and gulf. so right for now, and obviously, things are changing. Could change, but for now, we continue to have those plans to file in twenty one for new rates affecting twenty twenty two. Got it. And one other question, just on the florida utilities. You have been the industry leader in terms of cost management. Do you think the pace of change in an o and m cost decline will stay at this level, meaning the year over year change or decline rates, or do you think you're reaching a point where it will start to flatten out, where the ability to continue to take out as much cost as you've done every year? We'll start with a slide the surest answer to that michael is we've got a very creative team and we've got a team that is focused on continuous improvement and not afraid of that but let it let me also not underestimate what you know what that requires and that requires the ability to identify those new technologies and take that cost out over time so there's you know we have to work for it and so every year we we pull together and come up with our best ideas do we think over the long term we have to work for it and so every year we we pull together and come up with our best ideas do we think over the long term we have to work for it and so every year we we pull together and come up with our best ideas do we think over the long term we have to work for it and so every year we we pull together and come up with our Period of time that we've exhausted every opportunity no in part because i think technology will continue to enhance our ability to do that but it takes time to execute those opportunities so our discipline is there our creativity is there our innovation our commitment to continuous improvement and we're going to do the best we can to create the best value for our customers thank you rebecca much appreciated"

QUARTER AS HIGHER YEAR OVER YEAR TICKET WAS OFFSET BY NEGATIVE TRAFFIC IN OCTOBER AND THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER WE PERFORMED WELL AGAINST DIFFICULT COMPARISONS IN THE PRIOR YEAR MILD WEATHER CONDITIONS TOWARDS THE END OF NOVEMBER AND IN DECEMBER CAUSED THE SLOWDOWN ACROSS OUR CORE NORTHERN MARKETS THESE CONDITIONS HAVE CONTINUED INTO JANUARY WITH OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES DOWN 4% DURING THE MONTH WE DO NOT LIKE TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER HOWEVER IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE THE IMPACT IT HAS ON OUR BUSINESS WHILE WE ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS THIS QUARTER WE ARE EXECUTING WELL AGAINST THE AREAS WITHIN OUR CONTROL IN PARTICULAR WE CONTINUE TO MOVE DEEPER INTO OUR COMPANY TRANSFORMATION AND ARE CONFIDENT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING THE NECESSARY CHANGES ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION TO POSITION US TO DELIVER STRONG RESULTS NO MATTER THE EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES MOVING ON TO OUR PERFORMANCE BY CATEGORY IN THE THIRD QUARTER WE WERE DOWN 1% YEAR OVER YEAR IN TIRE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS HIGHER TICKET YEAR OVER YEAR WAS OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN TIRE VOLUME WE EXPERIENCED MORE NORMALIZED RETAIL PRICE IN THIS QUARTER AND ARE FOCUSED ON FURTHER REFINING OUR ENTIRE STRATEGY TO DRIVE STRENGTH IN OUR LARGEST CATEGORY IMPORTANTLY WE ARE ON TRACK TO ROLL OUT OUR TIRE CATEGORY MANAGEMENT AND PRICING SYSTEM BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 WHICH WILL ENABLE A MORE DYNAMIC AND SOPHISTICATED APPROACH TO REAL-TIME PRICING I'LL PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THIS SHORTLY TURNING TO OUR SERVICE AND REPAIR CATEGORIES WE SAW A 3% DECLINE IN BRAKES YEAR OVER YEAR FALLING SHORT OF A DIFFICULT COMPARISON IN THIRD QUARTER LAST YEAR IN MAINTENANCE WE WERE FLAT WHILE FRONT-END SHOCKS WERE DOWN 1% AND ALIGNMENTS DECLINED 3% YEAR OVER YEAR OVERALL OUR SOUTHERN MARKETS OUTPERFORMED OUR NORTHERN MARKETS AS EXPECTED GIVEN THE MILD WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS WE FACED IN THIS REGION NEW STORES ADDED 22.7 MILLION IN REVENUE DURING THE QUARTER INCLUDING 20.7 MILLION FROM RECENT ACQUISITIONS REGARDING OUR GROSS MARGIN PERFORMANCE DURING THE QUARTER WE SAW A DECLINE OF 20 BASIS POINTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE DECREASE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER FIXED COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES OUR VARIABLE MARGIN ON THE OTHER HAND EXPANDED DUE TO LOWER YEAR OVER YEAR MATERIAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WHILE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER TECHNICIAN LABOR AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES DECREASED SEQUENTIALLY FROM LAST QUARTER THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF US EXECUTING WELL AGAINST THE AREAS WITHIN OUR CONTROL WE IDENTIFIED ISSUES LAST QUARTER THAT AROSE FROM OUR TRANSFORMATION AND TOOK CORRECTIVE ACTION TO DRIVE IMPROVED RESULTS WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE RESULTS IN THIS AREA AS WE IMPLEMENT OUR CLOUD-BASED STORE STAFFING AND SCHEDULING MODEL TOWARDS THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL FOR US TO SEAMLESSLY ADJUST TO CHANGES IN DEMAND DEMAND DYNAMICS WITHOUT SACRIFICING SALES I'D NOW LIKE TO TURN TO THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON OUR MONRO FORWARD STRATEGY BEGINNING WITH OUR STORE REBRAND AND RE-IMAGE INITIATIVE ON SLIDE FOUR THIS INITIATIVE FOCUSES ON CREATING A MORE CONSISTENT STORE APPEARANCE WHILE ALSO IMPLEMENTING STANDARDIZED IN-STORE OPERATING PROCEDURES WHICH WE CALL OUR MONRO PLAYBOOK ADDITIONALLY WE ARE REBRANDING SELECT STORES TO A TIRE ORIENTED BANNER WHERE TARGETED DEMOGRAPHICS FAVOR THIS TYPE OF STORE FORMAT IN ORDER TO INCREASE TIRE SALES WITHOUT SACRIFICING SERVICE REVENUES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 WE FINALIZED THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF OUR FIRST GROUP OF STORES WHICH INCLUDES 44 LOCATIONS IN ROCHESTER NEW YORK AND THE MID-ATLANTIC AS WELL AS THE SECOND GROUP WHICH INCLUDES 43 STORES IN OUR SOUTHERN MARKETS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER WE CONTINUE TO SCALE THIS INITIATIVE ACROSS OUR BASE AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THE TRANSFORMATION OF 74 STORES IN FOUR MARKETS AND 42 OF OUR RECENTLY ACQUIRED CALIFORNIA STORES WE HAVE COMPLETED THE TRANSFORMATION IN THE 74 STORES AND HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED OUR CALIFORNIA STORES WHICH ARE BEING REBRANDED UNDER OUR TIRE CHOICE AUTO SERVICE CENTERS BANNER TO DRIVE HIGHER AWARENESS FOR TIRES TURNING TO SLIDE FIVE I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT REGARDING OUR STRATEGIC RATIONALE AS WE TRANSFORM OUR STORE BASE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE OPERATE IN TWO STORE FORMATS OUR SERVICE BRAND STORES WHICH GENERATE APPROXIMATELY $600,000 PER STORE IN ANNUALIZED SALES AND OUR TIRE BRANDS STORES WHICH GENERATE APPROXIMATELY 1.2 MILLION PER STORE IN ANNUALIZED SALES PRIOR TO ANY REBRAND ACTIVITY WE OPERATED 555 SERVICE BRAND STORES AND 734 TIRE BRAND STORES AND AS WE WORK TO CREATE A NATIONWIDE CHAIN OF CONSISTENTLY OPERATED STORES WE ARE PRIORITIZING THE HIGHER VOLUME TIRE BRANDS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS WE WILL BE CONSOLIDATING OUR REGIONAL BRANDS FOCUSING ON SHIFTING OUR SERVICE BRANDS OVER TO TIRE BRANDS THE LOWER NUMBER OF BRANDS WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO IMPROVE OUR MARKETING PRODUCTIVITY WHEN WE SPEAK TO RE-IMAGING STORES THIS PRIMARILY MEANS MODERNIZING THE APPEARANCE OF OUR STORES WITH NO ASSOCIATED BRAND CHANGE AS WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS REGARDING REBRANDING VERSUS RE-IMAGING STORES WE ARE LEVERAGING OUR ANALYTICAL MODEL AS WELL AS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OUR BRAND EQUITY IN THAT MARKET LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THE SLIDE YOU CAN SEE HERE THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE SO FAR WE ARE VERY MUCH IN THE EARLY INNINGS OF THIS TRANSFORMATION WITH 203 STORES SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED OUT OF OUR PORTFOLIO WE'VE SEPARATED THESE STORES OUT BETWEEN COMP STORES AND NON-COMP STORES WHICH HELPS US TO EVALUATE THEIR PERFORMANCE POST-REFRESH OF OUR APPROXIMATELY 900 COMP STORES THAT WE SET OUT TO TRANSFORM WE'VE COMPLETED 134 STORES AND OF OUR APPROXIMATELY 150 NON-COMP STORES WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED 69 AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM ACROSS OUR BASE WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE MARKETS THAT WE EXPECT WILL DRIVE THE LARGEST BENEFIT TO OUR SALES PERFORMANCE AND OUR APPROACH WILL BE MEASURED IN ORDER TO KEEP SALES DISRUPTION TO A MINIMUM THROUGH THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR WE'RE FOCUSING ON FINALIZING THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR RECENTLY ACQUIRED CALIFORNIA STORES WHILE STARTING THE TRANSFORMATION OF APPROXIMATELY 80 MORE STORES THAT WILL BE COMPLETED IN Q1 OF FY21 MOVING ON TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STORES WE'VE COMPLETED SO FAR TO HELP PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL GRANULARITY WE SEPARATED OUT HOW REBRANDED STORES HAVE PERFORMED VERSUS THE STORES THAT HAVE JUST BEEN RE-IMAGED IMPORTANTLY THIS DATA ONLY INCLUDES COMP STORES THAT HAD A FULL QUARTER OF PERFORMANCE FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THEIR TRANSFORMATION THIS IS HOW WE WILL SPEAK TO THIS PERFORMANCE EXCUSE ME OF OUR TRANSFORMED STORES MOVING FORWARD AS YOU CAN SEE AND IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT SALES LIFT WHEN WE REBRAND STORES THIS SHIFT OPTIMIZES OUR BRAND AWARENESS AND INCREASES OUR TIRE SALES WITHOUT SACRIFICING OUR SERVICE REVENUES THE STORES THAT HAVE BEEN RE-IMAGED WERE SLIGHTLY DOWN AS THESE ARE LOCATED IN OUR NORTHERN MARKETS WHICH WERE IMPACTED BY THE MILD WEATHER CONDITIONS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE BELIEVE THIS PERFORMANCE CLEARLY HIGHLIGHTS THE STRONG OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE AND THE BENEFITS TO COME WITH A STREAMLINED BRAND PORTFOLIO THE 74 STORES THAT WE RECENTLY COMPLETED AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS CALCULATION GIVEN THEY HAVE NOT HAD A FULL QUARTER POST TRANSFORMATION YET BUT WE ARE STILL WE ARE SEEING EARLY SIGNS OF STRENGTH AT THESE STORES AND ARE PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS WHILE WE STILL HAVE A WHILE TO GO TO ROLL THIS PROGRAM OUT TO OUR ENTIRE BASE TO SUSTAIN PERFORMANCE WE'VE SEEN AT THE STORES THAT HAVE COMPLETED THE TRANSFORMATION TO DATE UNDERSCORES THE IMPACT OF THIS IMPORTANT INITIATIVE TURNING TO SLIDE SIX AND THE REMAINDER OF OUR MONRO FORWARD INITIATIVES I'D LIKE TO FOCUS MY DISCUSSION ON THE INITIATIVES THAT ARE TOP PRIORITY WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING OUR BROADER STRATEGY IN THE THIRD QUARTER WE BEGAN MODERNIZING OUR STORE IT INFRASTRUCTURE AT ALL OF OUR APPROXIMATELY 1300 LOCATIONS THIS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLES STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING OUR NEW DIGITAL PHONE AND TEXTING SYSTEM WHICH IS A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS IMPROVING THE OVERALL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THIS SYSTEM WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER TRACK CUSTOMER EXECUTION DRIVING A MORE CONSISTENT PHONE STRATEGY AND IMPROVE CONVERSION OUR STORE INFRASTRUCTURE MONETIZATION WILL BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 ALLOWING US TO LEVERAGE OUR NEW PHONE SYSTEM WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL TO DRIVING TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES ANOTHER PRIORITY FOR US IS THE OPTIMIZATION OF OUR TIRE CATEGORY MANAGEMENT WE ARE ON TRACK AND BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR WE EXPECT OUR NEW PRICING SOFTWARE WILL BE OPERATIONAL WE BELIEVE THIS WILL BE CRITICAL TO DRIVING LONG-TERM MARGIN EXPANSION BY PROVIDING IMPROVED VISIBILITY INTO DEMAND DYNAMICS ALLOWING US TO BETTER REFINE OUR ASSORTMENTS AND EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO BECOME THE NUMBER ONE DESTINATION FOR TIRES AT ANY PRICE POINT FINALLY WE ARE RIGHT ON TRACK TO ROLL OUT OUR CLOUD-BASED STORE SCHEDULING MODEL PILOT BY YEAR END GAINING REAL TIME VISIBILITY INTO OUR LABOR MODEL VIA THE CLOUD WILL HELP US BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND STRATEGIC ENSURING WE ARE NOT UNDERSTAFFED AND LOSING SALES OR OVERSTAFFED WHEN THERE IS A LACK OF DEMAND REGARDING OUR OTHER TEAMMATE INITIATIVES WE HAVE ROLLED OUT THE MONRO UNIVERSITY PROGRAM TO ALL OF OUR TEAMMATES AND ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE THE COURSE CONTENT WE'VE ALSO IMPLEMENTED MANDATORY ONBOARD TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE WHO JOINS OUR TEAM IS TRAINED ON OUR MONRO PLAYBOOK OPERATING PROCEDURES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A QUALITY FIVE-STAR EXPERIENCE TO OUR CUSTOMERS MOVING ON TO SLIDE SEVEN WHILE WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON THE ROLLOUT OF MONRO FORWARD ACQUISITIONS REMAIN A CORNERSTONE OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY DURING THE

CONTINUE TO EXECUTE ON OUR ROBUST PIPELINE OF ATTRACTIVE M&A TARGETS WE CURRENTLY HAVE OVER 10 NDA SIGNED WITH OPPORTUNITIES RANGING FROM FIVE TO 40 STORES WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE MARKETS WE SERVE WHILE CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT INTO ATTRACTIVE AND UNDERSERVED REGIONS FURTHER BY CONTINUING TO EXECUTE OUR MONRO FORWARD INITIATIVES INCLUDING OUR NEW BRAND STANDARDS AND OPERATING PROCEDURES WE EXPECT IT INTEGRATE OUR NEW ACQUISITIONS MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY LASTLY WE OPENED ONE GREENFIELD LOCATION DURING

INNINGS OF A SIGNIFICANT COMPANY TRANSFORMATION THAT WILL RESULT IN A PLATFORM CAPABLE OF DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE LONGTERM GROWTH WE ARE NOT THERE YET NOR DO WE EXPECT OUR RESULTS TO BE LINEAR AS WE

FROM 38% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DISTRIBUTION AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALE AS WE LOST LEVERAGE ON THESE LARGELY FIXED COSTS WITH LOWER COMPARABLE STORE SALES HOWEVER AS BRETT MENTIONED WE SAW IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR VARIABLE MARGIN DRIVEN BY LOWER MATERIAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE QUARTER INCREASED $5.5

THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $112 MILLION AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN FINANCING LEASE THAT RECORDED IN

AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 140.2 BASIS YEAR OVER YEAR DUE TO LOWER LIBOR AND PRIME INTEREST RATES AS WELL AS LOWER BORROWING RATES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW LEASES OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 24.1% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER COMPARED TO 15.3% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR THE YEAR OVER YOUR YEAR INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A ONE-TIME INCOME TAX BENEFIT

AND A THANKS BRIAN WE ARE MAKING STRONG STRIDES IN THE EXECUTION OF OUR MONRO FORWARD STRATEGY IN PARTICULAR OUR STORE REBRAND AND RE-IMAGING INITIATIVE THE STRONG RESULTS OF THE LOCATIONS THAT HAVE COMPLETED THIS TRANSFORMATION UNDERSCORE OUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS INITIATIVE THE STORE REBRAND AND RE-EMERGE PROGRAM IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY OUR TECHNOLOGICAL INVESTMENTS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL HELP

AGAINST THE AREAS WITHIN OUR CONTROL WE ARE EXCITED FOR OUR FUTURE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CAPITALIZING ON THE ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD WITH THAT I WILL NOW TURN THE CALL OVER TO THE OPERATOR FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME WE WILL BE CONDUCTING A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS * 1 ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD A CONFIRMATION TONE WILL INDICATE YOUR LINE IS IN THE QUESTION QUEUE YOU MAY PRESS * 2 IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE YOUR QUESTION FROM THE QUEUE FOR PARTICIPANTS USING SPEAKER EQUIPMENT IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO PICK UP YOUR HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE STAR KEYS ONCE AGAIN THAT IS * 1 TO REGISTER QUESTIONS AT THE TIME OUR FIRST QUESTION IS COMING FROM BRIAN NAGEL OF OPPENHEIMER PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING MORNING BRIAN SO I WANNA FOC- AND I I APOLOGIZE FOR UH FOCUSING ON THE WEATHER HERE BUT I DO I DO JUST WANNA DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO UH SALES TRENDS IN THE QUARTER SO BRETT YOU MENTIONED I THINK BRIAN YOU DID TOO ON IN YOUR PREPARED COMMENTS JUST YOU MADE SOME COMMENT COMMENTARY SUGGESTING THAT YOU KNOW TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH WEATHER IMPACTED THE BUSINESS I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD DRILL DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT NEGATIVE 0.9 COMP YOU KNOW WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THE WEATHER COOPERATED AND SOME OF THE OTHER THE OTHER METRICS YOU'RE SEEING THAT REALLY SUGGEST THE UNDERLYING BUSINESSES IS TRENDING BETTER THAN WHAT WE SAW UH IN THE IN THE WEATHER AFFECTED UH FISCAL Q3 YEAH I'LL TAKE THE FIRST PART AND I'LL LET BRIAN TAKE THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION BRIAN UH WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE IN THE QUARTER AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR NORTHERN MARKETS CERTAINLY UNDERPERFORMED THAN SOUTHERN MARKETS AND I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE GRANULARITY ON THAT UH CERTAINLY OUR STORES UP IN THE NORTHEAST UM AND THE MIDWEST WERE WHERE YOU WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE MORE EXPOSURE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS UH LIKE YOU HAVE IN THE NORTHEAST CERTAINLY UNDER PERFORM I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT WE WOULD HAVE DONE UM YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I THINK WE WERE EXPECTING YOU KNOW POSITIVE COMPS IN THE QUARTER UH OUR INTERNAL UH EXPECTATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSER TO PLUS ONE OR PLUS ONE AND A HALF UH ASSUMING NORMALIZED WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST UH WE FELT REALLY GOOD COMING OUT OF OCTOBER NOVEMBER GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE THAT WE WERE COMPETING AGAINST AND AND DIDN'T GET THE COOPERATION FROM THE WEATHER IN DECEMBER THAT WE WERE CERTAINLY EXPECTING UH AS I MADE THE THE COMMENTS IN MY PREPARED REMARKS WE CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER BRIAN BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT WHEN 50% OF OUR BUSINESS IS TIRES AND WE HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF STORES IN THE NORTHEAST AND MIDWEST WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUTSIZED EXPOSURE TO UH OUR ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE BRIAN WOULD YOU MIND MAYBE TAKING RESTATING THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION WELL I THINK LOOK I THINK YOU'VE COVERED RIGHT MAYBE I'LL JUST BOUNCE RIGHT I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION IF I IF I COULD SO THE GUIDE THE THE ADJUSTED GUIDANCE AND YOU YOU MENTIONED SO IN JANUARY YOU WERE DID UH I THINK A NEGATIVE FOUR NOW IF I'M DOING THE MATH IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THAT THE ADJUSTED GUIDANCE WOULD SUGGEST SOME TYPE OF PICKUP THEN IN BUSINESS IN IN FEBRUARY MARCH I I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS IS THAT ASSUMPTION CORRECT AND THEN THE FOLLOWING QUESTION IS AND I KNOW WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE WITH YOUR BUSINESS BUT YOU KNOW AT WHAT POINT DOES BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE A LONG WE HAVE POTENTIALLY A LONG TIME IN THE WINTER THE WEATHER COULD STILL COME BUT IS THERE A POINT AT WHICH IN IN IN THE QUARTER WHERE THE THE WEATHER JUST COMES TOO LATE YEAH SO SO BRIAN YOUR ASSUMPTION IS CORRECT UM REGARDING THE UH REGARDING THE IMPLIED COMPS SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT Q4 AT THE MID POINT UH OF LET'S SAY DOWN 0.5 FOR THE FULL YEAR DOWN 0.5 THAT IMPLIES Q4 OF DOWN TWO WHICH WOULD UH BE ABOUT FEBRUARY AND MARCH BEING DOWN ONE IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT DOWN TWO SO THAT THAT'S THE DYNAMIC AT THE MIDPOINT SO THERE IS AN EXPECTATION OF UH OF A PICKUP IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH AND AND BRIAN MAYBE JUST TO COMMENT ON THE SECOND PART UM- YEAH YOU KNOW AS WE GET DEEPER INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER OUR FOURTH QUARTER AND THE SECOND HALF OF THE QUARTER IN PARTICULAR I THINK WE'VE BECOME LESS SENSITIVE TO THE WEATHER AS YOU TRANSITION OUT OF THE PURE WINTER CONDITIONS INTO UH SPRING UM CERTAINLY I THINK YOU KNOW THAT LATER IN THE QUARTER YOU GET SNOW FALLS CERTAINLY DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME IMPACT ON TIRE DEMAND LIKE YOU WOULD FIND IN OUR BUSINESS IF WE GOT SNOWFALL IN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER UH CONSUMERS ARE PRETTY UH THRIFTY WITH THEIR MONEY AND I BELIEVE IF YOU GET SNOWFALL LATE IN THE SEASON THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO FORGO THAT FIRST PURCHASE AND PUSH IT OUT UNTIL NEXT SEASON IN PARTICULAR THE OTHER THING TO CALL OUT UH AS WELL AS IF YOU LOOK AT OUR STORE PERFORMANCE AT THE COMPANY UH DECEMBER AND JANUARY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE MOST VOLATILE VOLATILE MONTHS THAT WE HAD TO CONTEND WITH AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN PAST PERFORMANCE HERE UM FRIENDS COMING OUT OF DECEMBER JANUARY DON'T NECESSARILY REFLECT WHAT YOU SEE IN THE SPRING UH SO UM GIVEN THE THE MILD DECEMBER JANUARY HEADING INTO UM THE BALANCE OF THE QUARTER WE FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THE GUIDANCE RANGE WE PROVIDED AS BRIAN SAID OUR MIDPOINT ASSUMES THAT ON THE LOW END OF OUR COMP SALES GUIDANCE THAT ASSUMES RUN RATE COMING OUT OF JANUARY WHICH WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA BE BETTER THAN THAT AS WE ROLL INTO FY21 I I APPRECIATE ALL THE COLOR THANK YOU THANKS BRIAN THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM JONATHAN LAMERS OF BMO CAPITAL MARKETS PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS UM BRETT LOOKING AT YOUR SLIDE ON THE STORE REBRANDING UH YOU KNOW THE 18% PERFORMANCE OF THE REBRANDED STORES UM I THINK IT'S GOOD UH I'M I'M CURIOUS FROM YOUR ANALYTIC MODEL HOW MANY YEARS SHOULD IT TAKE A REBRANDED STORE TO REACH PROJECTED RUN RATE SALES WELL IF YOU LOOK AT LOOK AT THE TOP QUADRANT OF THAT SLIDE JONATHAN UM WE'VE SHARED YOU KNOW WITH INVESTORS THE FACT THAT OUR SERVICE STORES DO ROUGHLY $600,000 IN REVENUE AND OUR TIRE STORES DO A MILLION TOO SO IN A CASE WHERE WE'RE REBRANDING A SERVICE STORE YOUR YOU'RE WORKING OFF A BASE ON AVERAGE OF 600,000 AND IF WE'VE SEEN I'LL CALL IT A DOUBLE DIGIT COMP IMPROVEMENT OFF OF THAT BASE YOU CAN GET TO IMPLIED NUMBER CERTAINLY ON HOW FAST OR HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO RAMP TO UH THE FULL MATURITY EQUALLY AND THE AVERAGE SALES UH PERFORMANCE OF OUR TIRE BRANDED STORES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S ENCOURAGING ABOUT THE STRATEGY FOR US SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S JUST A ONE-TIME STEP UP IN SALES THIS CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE MULTIPLE YEARS OF UH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AS OUR BRAND AND OUR POSITIONING UH OUR BRAND RELATED TO TIRES STARTS TO MATURE UH KEEP IN MIND THE TIRE PURCHASE CYCLE WITH CONSUMERS IS ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS SO IF WE REBRAND RIGHT BEFORE A CONSUMER MADE THAT DECISION TO BUY TIRES UH WE WON'T BE RELEVANT NECESSARILY TO THAT CONSUMER FOR TWO TO THREE YEARS OUT SO UH SO TO PUT THAT ON A TIMELINE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THREE TO FIVE YEARS TO CERTAINLY MATURE OUT TO AVERAGE SALES PERFORMANCE OF A TIRE BRAND STORE OKAY SO JUST TO CIRCLE UP ON THAT FOR THE STORES WHERE YOU'RE REBRANDING THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THEIR MARKET UM LIKE YOU YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THOSE STORES WOULD HAVE SALES COMPARABLE TO YOUR EXISTING TIRE BRAND STORES OF THE 1.2 MILLION IS THAT CORRECT YEAH AS A GENERAL STATEMENT THAT'S CORRECT I THINK CERTAINLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MARKETS THAT WILL EXCEED THE AVERAGE AND YOU'LL HAVE SOME MARKETS THAT WILL BE LOWER THAN THAT AND THAT'S PART OF THE CHOICES THAT WE THAT WE MAKE USING THE ANALYTIC MODEL BUT BUT ON AVERAGE AS WE LOOK ACROSS OUR I'LL SAY THE OPPORTUNITY STORES AT THE END OF 555 I THINK WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE ON AVERAGE THAT WE CAN REACH THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE 1.2 OVER TIME AS THEY MATURE THANKS UH SWITCHING GEARS BRIAN HOW MUCH OF A HEADWIND UM TO THAT UH REVENUE FROM ACQUISITION WERE THE CONVERSIONS OF THE 42 CALIFORNIA STORES THIS QUARTER YEAH I MEAN WE WE HAD UH YOU KNOW SOME DISRUPTION THERE UM I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW UH WE WE HAVEN'T REALLY QUANTIFIED THAT UM FROM A FROM A SALES STANDPOINT BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S A GREAT POINT JONATHAN AND THAT WE HAVE UH IMMEDIATELY PUT THE NEW STORES THAT WE ACQUIRE ON THE MONRO PLAYBOOK UH AND THEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND IN THIS CASE ABOUT SIX MONTHS UH GET THE RE-IMAGE UH IN STORE BRAND STANDARDS IN PLACE UH SO THOSE UH IN Q3 UH THE 42 CALIFORNIA STORES WENT THROUGH THAT UM AND THERE WERE SUBSTANTIALLY THROUGH THAT UH UH AS OF THE END OF Q3 UM SO WE'RE WE HAVEN'T QUANTIFIED IT BUT IT CERTAINLY HAD SOME IMPACT ON THEIR SALES PERFORMANCE IN THE QUARTER OKAY AND THAT 1.8 MILLION CHARGE FOR MONRO FORWARD INITIATIVE UH THIS QUARTER WHAT WAS THAT FOR YEAH IT WAS ALL RELATED TO THE STORE REBRAND AND RE-IMAGE UM AND IT FALLS INTO THREE PRIMARY BUCKETS UH RELATED TO THAT UH THE FIRST IS NON-CAPITAL UH ITEMS THAT WE SEND TO THE STORES SO AS WE THINK ABOUT UH UPDATED UH SAFETY CHAINS UPDATED BAY BANNERS UPDATED POINT OF SALE MARKETING MATERIALS ALL OF THESE THINGS TO GET THE STORE INITIALLY TO UH THE STANDARD UH THAT ARE NOT CAPITAL UH IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL UH WORK AND CONSTRUCTION DONE ON THE STORE THAT'S THE FIRST BUCKET THE SECOND BUCKET IS NON-CAPITAL WORK THAT'S ACTUALLY DONE WE GET INTO THESE STORES AND WE IDENTIFY NON-CAPITAL REPAIRS UH DEMOLITION UH AS WELL AS UM SOME OF THE FIXED VERSE REPLACED ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE STRIPPING A FLOOR AND REDOING A FLOOR VERSUS INSTALLING A NEW FLOOR THOSE ARE THINGS THAT UH MAKE SENSE ECONOMICALLY BUT YOU GET DIFFERENT TREATMENT FROM EXPENSE VERSUS CAPITAL FOR SO THAT'S THE SECOND BUCKET AND THE THIRD IS JUST RIGHT OFF OF EXISTING LEASEHOLDS IN THE STORES UH ANYTHING FROM COUNTERS TO UH MAYBE SOME EXISTING SIGNAGE THAT WAS PUT UP AS PART OF AN ACQUISITION WHEN WE INITIALLY BRANDED THE STORES OVER TO A MONRO BRAND UM THOSE ARE THE THREE PRIMARY BUCKETS THAT UH THAT THE THE MONRO FORWARD INITIATIVE COSTS UH CONSIST OF OKAY THANKS FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU EXCUSE ME OUR NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM BRET JORDAN OF JEFFERIES PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY GOOD MORNING GUYS MORNING BRET MORNING BRET HEY UH BACK TO SLIDE FIVE I GUESS IF WE LOOK AT THE 18% GROWTH IN REBRANDED STORES IF WERE TO LOOK AT THE COMPARABLE GROWTH THERE YOU KNOW X THE NEW PRODUCT LINES YOU'RE ADDING HOW'S THE SERVICE UM COMP AGAINST THE SERVICE COMP IN THOSE STORES ARE YOU SAYING YOU KNOW A PICKUP AS YOU CHANGE THE BRAND YEAH MAYBE JUST TO CLARIFY THOUGH BRET I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT ADDING ANY NEW PRODUCTS TO THE SERVICE MENU UH <CROSSTALK> RIGHT <CROSSTALK> RIGHT YEAH IT'S JUST A MIX RIGHT SO WE EVEN OUR SERVICE STORES THEY SELL TIRES IT'S ONLY 15% OF THEIR MIX SO WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING GROWTH MORE OUTSIZED GROWTH IN OTHER TIRE SALES AND WE'VE HAD SUCCESS IN MAINTAINING UH THE RATE OF GROWTH THAT WE'VE SEEN ON THE SERVICE SIDE WHICH HAS BEEN PART OF OUR THESIS IS UH HOLD ON UH TO THE SERVICE BUSINESS THAT ENJOYED IT'S HIGH MARGIN UH AND THEN ADD TO THAT MORE RELEVANCY TO THE MARKETPLACE ON TIRES AND DRIVE THE GROWTH THROUGH THE THE TIRE CATEGORY <CROSSTALK> ON BOTH SIDES OKAY AND I GUESS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RE-IMAGE HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO YOU KNOW COMPARABLE SERVICE STORES IN THE NETWORK THAT HADN'T BEEN RE-IMAGED I GUESS SORT OF LOOKING AT IT AGAIN SORT OF APPLES TO APPLES YOU KNOW AGAINST THE OLD STORES YEAH I THINK IF UH IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT STORES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE THE 30 STORES ARE ROCHESTER I THINK- YEAH THE ROCHESTER STORE CERTAINLY IF THEY HAVE BEEN PERFORMING QUITE WELL UH RELATIVE TO WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WERE ON RE-IMAGE WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH RATES OUT OF THE RE-IMAGED STORE WE SET OUT TO DO THIS INITIATIVE UH BUT WE WERE SEEING A MORE POSITIVE GROWTH OUT OF THE STORES UP UNTIL THE LAST QUARTER UH GIVEN THE EXPOSURE THAT WE'VE HAD TO UH THE WEATHER IN THE NORTH BUT COMPARED TO OTHER STORES UH WE'RE STILL PLEASED WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE POINT OF VIEW AND FROM A COMP SALE POINT OF VIEW RELATIVE TO THEIR PEERS UH FACING SIMILAR I WOULD SAY MARKET BACKDROP FROM A WEATHER POINT OF VIEW OKAY COULD YOU GIVE US I GUESS SORT OF THE THE THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE SOUTHERN STORE COMP AND THE NORTHERN STORE COMP YOU KNOW HOW BIG A DELTA WAS IT I MEAN IT WAS IT WAS UH A COUPLE OF HUNDRED BASIS POINTS OF PERFORMANCE OKAY AND I GUESS FOR HOUSEKEEPING COULD YOU GIVE US THE MONTHLY UH YEAH SO UH WE WERE UH ONE SECOND HERE BRET WE WERE DOWN UH 1.2 IN OCTOBER DOWN 1.7 IN NOVEMBER AND NOW 0.4 IN DECEMBER OKAY AND THEN ONE JUST THIS IS THE SORRY ADD THE QUESTIONS ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN SIDE I MEAN JUST TO THROW THE VIRUS INTO IT SINCE THAT'S POPULAR THESE DAYS YOU GUYS DO A LOT OF DIRECT SOURCING UM YOU KNOW THE THE WHITE BOX PRODUCT OUT OF CHINA DO YOU SEE ANY IMPACT ON SUPPLY CHAIN FROM WHAT'S GOING ON UH WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY UH TO THIS POINT BRET UH WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WORKING THROUGH CONTINGENCY PLANS WHICH WE'VE HAD TO DEVELOP ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE THE TARIFF ISSUES SO WE FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THROUGH THE NETWORK OF YOU KNOW THE MULTIPLE SUPPLY POINTS THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO UH OVERCOME ANY PARTICULAR ISSUES COMING FROM THE VIRUS <CROSSTALK> YEAH I'M SORRY BRET GO AHEAD I SAID NO I WAS JOKING BUT I HAD TO GET MT FIRST VIRUS QUESTION IN THERE YEAH OKAY YEAH ALL RIGHT THANKS A LOT GUYS OKAY THANKS BRET THANKS BRET THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM RICK NELSON OF STEVENS PLEASE GO AHEAD ALL RIGHT THANKS GOOD MORNING LIKE TO- GOOD MORNING FOLLOW UP ON WHETHER UH LAST YEAR I THINK DECEMBER JANUARY YOU ALSO POINTED TO MILD WINTER WEATHER DO YOU THINK THIS YEAR UH WAS INCREMENTALLY WORSE UH THAN THAN THE PRIOR YEAR I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT UH YOU KNOW ANALYST REPORTS THAT WE'VE SEEN UH TALKING ABOUT I GUESS THE IMPACT OF THE MILD WINTER HAS HAD ON NOT ONLY OUR CATEGORY BUT I THINK OTHER RETAIL I THINK THE DATA WOULD INDICATE THAT THIS HAS BEEN MORE MILD UH CERTAINLY VERSUS LAST YEAR AND I THINK WE LOOK AT PRECIPITATION UH WHICH WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US THE FORM OF SNOW WITH OUR ENTIRE BUSINESS CERTAINLY IT'S BEEN UH A MUCH I THINK MORE MILD UH WINTER THIS YEAR RELATIVE TO LAST YEAR OKAY THANKS AND BRETT ANY UPDATE ON YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON UH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE ON THE INSTALL SIDE AND HOW YOU THINK YOUR TIRE PRICES COMPARE TO THEIRS IN THE TIRE CATEGORY OVER- OVERALL I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH UNITS IN THE PERIOD AND THE MARKET SHARE YEP SO UH LET'S START WITH UNITS WELL UNITS WERE DOWN TWO UH AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS UP UH ONE UH FOR THE FOR THE UH FOR THE QUARTER UH HOW THAT COMPARES WE DON'T HAVE A LOT YOU KNOW OF SYNDICATED DATA OF COURSE WE CAN LOOK TO AND GIVE YOU DEFINITIVE ON THAT WE LEAN ON I GUESS OUR CHANNEL CHECKS AND INFORMATION FROM OUR TIRE MANUFACTURERS THAT HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY ACROSS MULTIPLE BRANDS AND IT FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAVE EXPOSURE TO THE NORTH IN PARTICULAR NORTHEAST BUT TO THE DEGREE THAT WE DO WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE PROBABLY IN LINE WITH WHAT YOU KNOW WE PICKED UP THROUGH SUPPLIERS AND AND OTHERS UM AS IT RELATES TO AMAZON I THINK WE'RE STILL YOU KNOW PLEASED WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AS WELL AS OTHER ONLINE TIRE RETAILERS UH WE UH WE WILL EVENTUALLY EXPAND ON THE RELATIONSHIP IN FY21 TO INCLUDE ALL STORES WE TALKED ABOUT LAST QUARTER OUR PRIORITY HAS BEEN UH WHAT I MENTIONED ON TODAY'S CALL UH COMPLETING THE ENTIRE CATEGORY MANAGEMENT PRICING TOOL AS WELL AS THE LABOR SCHEDULING TOOL THAT ARE JUST FOR OUR ORGANIZATION I THINK A HIGHER PRIORITY AT THIS STAGE THAN EXPANDING UH BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO EXPANDING THAT RELATIONSHIP GOING FORWARD UH RELATED TO TIRE PRICING UH AS YOU KNOW RICK THE TIRE CATEGORY IS VERY COMPLICATED YOU HAVE YOU KNOW OVER 30,000 SKEWS THAT UH THAT YOU NEED TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ACROSS MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'VE INVESTED IN THE TIRE CATEGORY MANAGEMENT TOOL IS THAT TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS GIVE US MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY INTO DEMAND DYNAMICS DEFINED BY ELASTICITY UH DOWN TO A SKEW LEVEL AND BY HAVING THAT VISIBILITY IT'S GONNA CREATE A MUCH MORE GRANULAR APPROACH THAT WE'RE GONNA USE FOR PRICING UH IT'LL ALLOWS US TO PRICE THAT THE SKEW LEVEL UH IN OUR INDUSTRY UH WITH THE INTENT THEME STRIKE THAT RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN DRIVING THE RIGHT PRICE TO DRIVE UNIT VOLUME WHILE PRESERVING AND EXPANDING OUR ENTIRE MARGINS THROUGH A RIGHT MIX AT RIGHT PRICE UH I'M ENCOURAGED WE'RE IN PILOT FORM OF THAT NOW UH WE WILL BE OPERATIONAL BY Q1 OF NEXT YEAR UH FULLY OPERATIONAL UH THE ROLLOUT OF THAT IT'S PRETTY SMALL IN SCALE BECAUSE WE CONTROL OUR PRICING CENTRALLY SO A SMALL TEAM OF PEOPLE WILL BE TRAINED UP ON USING THAT SYSTEM SO BETWEEN NOW AND Q1 WE'LL BE TESTING IN PARALLEL TO MAKE CERTAIN WE'RE CONFIDENT WITH UH THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM THE SETUP THAT UH THAT MAKES SENSE THANKS FOR THE COLOR AND GOOD LUCK THANKS RICK BE SAFE THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS * 1 ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD OUR NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM STEPHANIE BENJAMIN'S OF SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MORNING UM I WANTED TO GO BACK I KNOW IN THE PRIOR QUARTERS WHEN YOU STARTED ROLLING OUT SOME OF THESE STORY FRESHERS YOU CALLED OUT UH A HIT OR HEADWIND TO COMPS DURING THAT QUARTER REALLY JUST FROM DISTRACTION YOU KNOW IT SENSE AS YOU'RE IN THERE KIND OF REWORKING AND REVAMPING THE STORES I BELIEVE YOU SAID IT WAS ABOUT A 70 BASIS POINT HIT LAST QUARTER DID YOU QUANTIFY THAT THIS QUARTER OR IS THERE A WAY FOR YOU TO KIND OF BREAK THAT OUT OR TO WHETHER UM OVERSHADOW THAT YEAH I THINK WE SAID LAST QUARTER UH STEPHANIE THAT WE I MEAN WE WALKED EVERYONE KIND OF THROUGH THE THE SEVEN STEP PROCESS AND AND TALKED ABOUT HOW WE WERE RETOOLING IT TO TAKE TAKE UM A LOT OF THAT WORK OR ALMOST ALL THAT WORK OFF OF THE STORE TEAM SO WE WERE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY DO THAT IN IN Q3 WE DIDN'T EXPECT THAT WE WERE GONNA HAVE TO TALK ABOUT A HEADWIND UH AND WE REALLY DON'T HAVE TO IN TERMS OF IT FROM DISRUPTION RELATED TO THE STORY IMAGE UM I THINK I THINK UH THE CALIFORNIA STORES ON THE WEST COAST UH MAYBE SAW A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DISRUPTION JUST BECAUSE WE DID PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THEM BASED ON THEIR PROXIMITY YOU KNOW LACK OF PROXIMITY TO OUR OUR CORE RESOURCES THAT ARE DOING THE RE-IMAGE BUT FOR THE 74 COMP STORES THOSE WERE LARGELY UH I WOULD SAY UNDISRUPTED GREAT AND THEN JUST AS UH A FOLLOWUP WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TIRE CATEGORY IN GENERAL WHAT ARE YOU SEEING FROM THE SILVER AND IN THE INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT I KNOW IT WAS INFLATIONARY EARLIER THIS YEAR UM KIND OF REVIEWING HOW HOW YOU THOUGHT DURING THE QUARTER AND THE EXPECTATION GOING FORWARD AS WELL UH YES STEPHANIE WHEN YOU LOOK AT UH GO BACK TO ONE OF THE THINGS WE COMMENTED ON WAS JUST WE SAW UH SOME INFLATIONARY PRICING ON I'LL SAY THE TOP END OF THE PRODUCT CATEGORY WITH MORE PREMIUM BRANDS UH AND THE FIRST PART OF THE THE SECOND QUARTER WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF MOVEMENT ON THE ON THE LOW END BRANDS IF YOU WILL OPENING PRICE POINT BRANDS WE SAW THAT CHANGE EXITING Q2 AND INTO Q3 AND I THINK AS YOU SAW ON WE MADE THE COMMENTS IN OUR PREPARED REMARKS WE CERTAINLY FEEL BETTER ABOUT PRICING MOVING UP ACROSS UH ALL ALL PRICE POINTS UH RELATIVE TO THAT POINT IN Q3 I THINK OUR EXPECTATION FOR Q4 IS PRETTY STABLE ENVIRONMENT UH AROUND PRICING UH WE DON'T EXPECT YOU KNOW MEANINGFUL OR MATERIAL CHANGES UH IN THE NEXT QUARTER UH YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE WE'RE VERY FOCUSED NOW ON NOW OPTIMIZING YOU KNOW OUR INTERNAL PRICING RELATIVE TO THE MARKET LEVERAGING YOU KNOW THE CATEGORY MANAGEMENT PRICE INTO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT GREAT AND THEN JUST LASTLY FOR ME KIND OF A MORE HIGH LEVEL AS YOU KNOW WE THINK THROUGH THE STRATEGY TO EXPAND YOUR YOUR TIRE SERVICES AT SOME OF THOSE THE MIX CHANGES THAT YOUR SERVICE STORES DOES THAT JUST BY NATURE PUT YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGES IN WEATHER ON AN ANNUAL BASIS YOU KNOW TO YOUR POINT YOU SAID ON THE CALL THAT YOU KNOW IT IS THE TIRE CATEGORY THAT WE'RE IF IT'S A MORE MILD WEATHER WHERE YOU DON'T REALLY SEE THE THE THE VOLUME DURING THAT PERIOD SO DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU KNOW THESE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD WHETHER COULD HAVE A LARGER IMPACT OR SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW THIS YEAR THAT MAYBE IN PRIOR YEAR SO MAYBE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT THIS HIGH LEVEL WOULD BE GREAT UH THANKS SO MUCH YEAH THANKS STEPHANIE I THINK YOU KNOW STRATEGICALLY UM I WILL I WILL START WITH THIS THEIR STRATEGY <INAUDIBLE> WE LIKE THE BUSINESS MODEL AT OUR STORES THAT HAS A VERY FOCUSED MENU THAT'S FOCUSED ON TIRES AND FULL SERVICE I THINK YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE US MIGRATE TO A TIRE ONLY CATEGORY AS A BROAD SWEEPING STRATEGY FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU JUST MENTIONED WE LIKE DIVERSIFICATION IN THE SERVICES UH WE LIKE YOU KNOW BEING VERY RELEVANT ON FREQUENTLY PURCHASED ITEMS LIKE SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE FOR CARS AND AND CERTAINLY BREAKS ANOTHER UNDER CAR SERVICES UM I THINK AS WE INCREASE OUR TOTAL BUSINESS UH CERTAINLY WE WERE GONNA PICK UP A LITTLE MORE EXPOSURE TO TIRES AS WE CONVERT MORE STORES IN THE NORTH UH I THINK DO THAT HOWEVER I THINK OUR BROADER COMPANY STRATEGY IS DIVERSIFY OUR STORE FOOTPRINT MORE INTO THE SOUTH AND OUT WEST AND CERTAINLY IN THOSE REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY YOU DON'T SEE I THINK THE LEVEL OF VOLATILITY THAT COMES WITH THE TIRE BUSINESS LIKE YOU WOULD FIND IN IN THE NORTHEAST AND MIDWESTERN MARKETS GREAT THAT'S EVERYTHING FOR ME I APPRECIATE IT

AT THIS TIME ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE ON A LISTEN ONLY MODE. LATER WE WILL CONDUCT A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION AND INSTRUCTIONS WILL FOLLOW AT THAT TIME. IF ANYONE REQUIRES ASSISTANCE DURING THE CALL PLEASE PRESS STAR ZERO ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE. AS A REMINDER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS CON I'd like to introduce Miss Maureen Mahoney, senior vice president, general counsel, and secretary of Monroe. Thank you, please go ahead. Thank you, hello everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning's call. Before we get started, please note that as part of the call this morning, we will be referencing a presentation that is available on the investors section of our website at corporate dot monroedot com backslash investors backslash investor resources. Sources: If I could draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two of the presentation, I'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about Monroe's future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monroe's filings with the SEC and in our earnings release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by law. Additionally, on today's call, management statements include a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures which are intended to supplement and not be substituted for comparable GAAP measures reconciliations of such supplemental information to the company's financial statements. COMPARABLE GAP MEASURES WILL BE INCLUDED AS PART OF TODAY'S PRESENTATION AND IN OUR EARNINGS RELEASE WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN THE CALL OVER TO OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER BRETT PONTON BRETT THANK YOU MORGAN AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANKS FOR JOINING US I'LL GET STARTED TODAY WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR THIRD QUARTER RESULTS FOLLOWED BY AN UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON OUR MONGOOSE FORWARD STRATEGY AS ILLUSTR Reported comps down 90% in the third quarter as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic. In October and the beginning of November we performed well against difficult comparisons in the prior year. Mild weather conditions towards the end of November and in December caused a slowdown across our core northern markets. These conditions have continued into January with our comparable store sales down 4% during the month. We do not. Not like talking about the weather, however, it is impossible to ignore the impact it has on our business. While we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter, we are executing well against the areas within our control. In particular, we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and are confident we are on the right path. We are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to deliver strong results no matter. Moving on to our performance by category in the third quarter, we were down one percent year over year in tire comparable store sales as higher ticket year over year was offset by a decline in tire volume. We experienced more normalized retail pricing this quarter and are focused on further refining our tire strategy to drive strength in our largest category. Importantly, we are on track to roll out our tire category management. And pricing system beginning in the first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty one which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated approach to real time pricing I'll provide more details on this shortly turning to our service and repair categories we saw a three percent decline in breaks year over year falling short of a difficult comparison in the third quarter last year in maintenance we were flat while front end shocks were down one percent and alignments declined three percent year over year overall. Our southern markets outperformed our northern markets as expected given the mild winter weather conditions we faced in this region. New stores added 22.7 million in revenue during the quarter, including 20.7 million from recent acquisitions. Regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter, we saw a decline of 20 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store sales which resulted in higher fixed costs. PERCENTAGE OF SALES OUR VARIABLE MARGIN ON THE OTHER HAND EXPANDED DUE TO LOWER YEAR OVER YEAR MATERIAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WHILE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER TECHNICIAN LABOR AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES DECREASED SEQUENTIALLY FROM LAST QUARTER THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF US EXECUTING WELL AGAINST THE AREAS WITHIN OUR CONTROL WE IDENTIFIED ISSUES LAST QUARTER THAT ROSE FROM OUR TRANSFORMATION AND TOOK Continue to improve results in this area as we implement our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust the changes in demand demand dynamics without sacrifice in sales I'd now like to turn to the progress we've made in our monroe forward strategy beginning with our store rebrand and reimage initiative on slide four this initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance While also implementing standardized in-store operating procedures which we call our Monroe playbook. Additionally, we are rebranding select stores to a tire-oriented banner where targeted demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing service revenues during the first half of fiscal twenty twenty we finalize the transformations of our first group of stores which includes forty four locations in rochester, new york. In the Mid Atlantic as well as the second group which includes forty three stores in our southern markets during the third quarter we continue to scale this initiative across our base and move forward with the transformation of seventy four stores in four markets and forty two of our recently acquired california stores we have completed the transformation of the seventy four stores and have substantially completed our california stores which are being rebranded under our tire choice auto service centers banner to Drive higher awareness for tires. Turning to slide five, I'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic rationale as we transform our store base. As many of you know, we operate in two store formats: our service brand stores, which generate approximately six hundred thousand dollars per store in annualized sales, and our tire brand stores, which generate approximately one point two million dollars per store in annualized sales. Prior to any rebrand activity, we operated five hundred and eighty stores. FIFTY FIVE SERVICE BRAND STORES AND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR TIRE BRAND STORES AS WE WORK TO CREATE A NATIONWIDE CHAIN OF CONSISTENTLY OPERATED STORES WE ARE PRIORITIZING THE HIGHER VOLUME TIRE BRANDS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS WE WILL BE CONSOLIDATING OUR REGIONAL BRANDS FOCUSING ON SHIFTING OUR SERVICE BRANDS OVER TO THE TIRE BRANDS THE LOWER NUMBER OF BRANDS WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO IMPROVE OUR MARKETING PRODUCTIVITY WHEN WE SPEAK TO RE Identifying the appearance of our stores with no associated brand change as we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re imaging stores we are leveraging our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market looking at the bottom left of the slide you can see here the progress we have made so far we are very much in the early innings of this transformation with two hundred three stores substantially completed out of our portfolio we have separated these stores out between two groups The speaker is discussing the number of Kmart stores that they have transformed and the number of stores they have left to transform. They have transformed approximately 90 Kmart stores and have approximately 150 non-Kmart stores left to transform. They also mention that they will continue to prioritize markets that they expect will drive the largest benefit to their sales performance. Measured in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum. Through the end of this fiscal year, we are focusing on finalizing the transformation of our recently acquired California stores while starting the transformation of approximately eighty more stores that will be completed in Q1 of FY21. Moving on to the performance of the stores we've completed so far, we've separated it out how rebranded stores have performed versus the stores that have just passed. IMPORTANTLY THIS DATA ONLY INCLUDES COMP STORES THAT HAD A FULL QUARTER OF PERFORMANCE FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THEIR TRANSFORMATION THIS IS HOW WE WILL SPEAK TO THIS PERFORMANCE EXCUSE ME OF OUR TRANSFORMED STORES MOVING FORWARD AS YOU CAN SEE AND IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT SALES LIFT WHEN WE REBRAND STORES THIS SHIFT OPTIMIZES OUR BRAND AWARENESS AND INCREASES OUR TIRE SALES WITHOUT SACRIFYING OUR SERVICE REVENUES THE STORES THAT HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED WERE SLIGHTLY DOWN AS THESE ARE LOCATED IN OUR NORTHERN MARKETS WHICH WERE IMPACTED BY THE MILD WEATHER CONDITIONS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE BELIEVE THIS PERFORMANCE CLEARLY HIGHLIGHTS THE STRONG OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE AND THE BENEFITS TO COME WITH A STREAMLINED BRAND PORTFOLIO THE SEVENTY FOUR STORES THAT WE RECENTLY COMPLETED AND ARE Recognize the verbal communication and transcribe it into text. WE BELIEVE WILL BE CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING OUR BROADER STRATEGY IN THE THIRD QUARTER WE BEGAN MODERNIZING OUR STORE I T INFRASTRUCTURE AT ALL OF OUR APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN HUNDRED LOCATIONS THIS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLES STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING OUR NEW DIGITAL PHONE AND TEXTING SYSTEM WHICH IS A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS IMPROVING THE OVERALL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THIS SYSTEM WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER TRACK CUSTOMER Verbal Communication:\n\n* Improved conversion\n* Store infrastructure modernization will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2021\n* New phone system will be critical to driving traffic to our stores\n* Another priority for us is the optimization of our entire category management\n* We are on track and by the end of this fiscal year we expect our new pricing software will be operational\n* We believe this will be critical to driving long-term margin expansion BY PROVIDING IMPROVED VISIBILITY INTO DEMAND DYNAMICS, ALLOWING US TO BETTER REFINE OUR ASSORTMENTS AND EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO BECOME THE NUMBER ONE DESTINATION FOR TIRES AT ANY PRICE POINT. FINALLY, WE ARE RIGHT ON TRACK TO ROLL OUT OUR CLOUD BASED SCHEDULING MODEL PILOT BY YEAR END, GAINING REAL TIME VISIBILITY INTO OUR LABOR MODEL THROUGH THE CLOUD WILL HELP US BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND STRATEGIC, INSURING WE ARE NOT UND MANDATORY REGARDING OUR OTHER TEAM MEMBER INITIATIVES WE HAVE ROLL OUT THE MONROE UNIVERSITY PROGRAM TO ALL OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE THE COURSE CONTENT. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED MANDATORY ON BOARD TRAINING TO INSURE THAT EVERYONE WHO JOINS OUR TEAM IS TRAINED ON OUR MONROE PLAY BOOK OPERATING PROCEDURE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A QUALITY FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. MOVING ON TO SLIDE SEV REMAIN A CORNERSTONE OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY DURING THE QUARTER WE CLOSED THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ACQUISITIONS OF THREE COMPANIES ONE WITH FOURTEEN LOCATIONS IN LOS VEGAS NEVADA AND FOUR IN BOISE IDAHO AS WELL AS TWO COMPANIES THAT INCLUDE NINE STORES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FURTHER SOLIDIFIED OUR GROWING POSITION IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES OUR PRESENCE IN THIS REGION ALLOWS US TO BETTER SERVICE NATIONAL ACCOUN LONG TERM CONSUMERSHIP TO RYDERSHARP THE ACQUISITION IN NEVADA AND IDAHO WHICH ARE NEW STATES TO MONROE IS EXPECTED TO ADD APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILLION IN ANNUALIZED SALES REPRESENTED SALES MIX OF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT SERVICE AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TIRES THE ACQUISITIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE EXPECTED TO ADD APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN ANNUALIZED SALES REPRESENTED SALES MIX OF FIFTY FIVE PERCENT SERVICE AND FORT Included are earnings per share in fiscal 2020. Overall, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected one hundred twenty million in annualized sales. We operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation. And we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive M&A targets. We currently have over ten M&A deals signed with opportunities in range. \"From five to forty stores which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions. Further, by continuing to execute our monrovia forward initiatives, including our new brand standards and operating procedures, we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively and efficiently. Lastly, we opened one greenfield location during the third quarter, bringing our total number of stores to 44.\" The total field store openings are to the seventh in fiscal twenty twenty. In conclusion, we are confident that we are on the right track to drive future success in our business. We are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in a platform capable of delivering sustainable long-term growth. We are not there yet, nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the transformation. But we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business and make it capable of delivering sustainable long-term growth. I would like to thank the entire team at Monroe for their exceptional work as we execute this strategy, as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support. With that, I will turn the call over to our executive vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer, Brian D. Brooks, who will provide additional details on our third-quarter financial performance and fiscal year 2020 outlook. Thank you, Bret. Good morning everyone turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter sales increased six point two percent year over year to three hundred twenty nine point three million dollars driven by sales from new stores of twenty two point seven million dollars including twenty point seven million dollars from recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately point eight million dollars same store sales in the quarter were down point nine percent year over year The third quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty had eighty nine selling days in line with the previous year period. The gross margin decreased twenty basis points to thirty seven point eight percent in the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty from thirty eight percent in the prior year period. This decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales. However, as brett morgan said, this decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales. However, as brett morgan said, this decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, as we lost leverage on these largely fixed Mentioned we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material costs as a percentage of sales. Operating expenses for the quarter increased five point five million dollars to ninety two point eight million dollars or twenty eight point two percent of sales as compared with eighty seven point three million dollars or twenty eight point one percent of sales for the prior year period. The year over year dollar increase includes expenses from one hundred and thirty net new stores. Our operating income is... The third quarter was 31.6 million dollars, which increased by 2.8% compared to the operating income of 30.7 million dollars for the same quarter last year and decreased as a percentage of sales from 9.9% to 9.6%. Net interest expense for the third quarter increased to 7 million dollars as compared to 6.8 million dollars in the same period last year. The third quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty increased by approximately one hundred twelve million dollars as compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease debt recorded in connection with our fiscal two thousand and twenty acquisitions and greenfield expansion as well as an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately one hundred forty basis points. Over the years due to lower Libor and prime interest rates as well as lower borrowing rates associated with new loans our effective tax rate was twenty four point one percent for the third quarter compared to fifteen point three percent for the same period last year the year over year increase is primarily due to a one time income tax benefit we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change which was related to certain deductions that the IRS accepted. During the examination of our fiscal two thousand and sixteen and fiscal two thousand and seventeen tax returns, net income for the third quarter was eighteen point nine million dollars compared to twenty point five million dollars in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty were fifty six cents compared to diluted earnings per share of sixty one cents in the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and nineteen. Adjusted diluted earnings per share which is a non-gaap measure was nineteen cents compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of sixty one cents in the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and nineteen. The measure for the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and twenty was sixty cents which excludes from deluded earnings per share three cents of costs related to monroe forward initiatives and one cent of costs related to acquisition due diligence and integration. This compares to an adjusted deluded earnings per share of fifty-seven cents in the third quarter of fiscal two thousand and nineteen which excluded one cent of costs related to monroe forward initiatives and one cent of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs. For more information on this non-gap measure, please see the reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release. Lastly, we opened one Greenfield location during the third quarter. As a reminder, Greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition of one to four store operations. Greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately one million dollars each. In annual sales as of December 28, 2019, the company had one thousand two hundred and eighty nine company operated stores and ninety nine franchise locations as compared with one thousand one hundred and eighty six company operated stores and ninety nine franchise locations as of December 29, 2018. During the third quarter, we added twenty seven company operated stores and closed none. Turning to slide nine, we continue to maintain our annual sales. A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION AS WE EXECUTE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE FORTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN OUR MONROE FORWARD INITIATIVE WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS OF OUR MONROE FORWARD STRATEGY AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT AN INCRE Store Reimage and Technology. Additionally, creative acquisitions support our growth strategy. During the first nine months of the year, we spent approximately one hundred and four million dollars on acquisitions, including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our Greenfield expansion strategy. As Bret mentioned, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal two thousand and twenty collectively represent an expected one hundred and twenty million dollars in annualized EBITDA. I'd like to provide some additional clarity here: the one hundred and twenty million dollars in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been fully integrated, which as we've stated in the past is usually in year three post acquisition. During years one and two following the acquisition, we typically see a step down in sales given the process of onboarding new stores to our model. Moving on, we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend program. AND PAID APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN DIVIDENDS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FINALLY WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING A SOLID BALANCE SHEET WITH AMPLE FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT OUR STRATEGIC GROWTH INITIATIVES WE ENTERED THE THIRD QUARTER WITH STRONG LEVERAGE RATIOS AND HAVE AMPLE ROOM UNDER OUR FINANCIAL COVENANT WE GENERATED APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENT Increased by approximately fifty nine million dollars now turning to our outlook for fiscal two thousand and twenty on slide ten we have updated our fiscal two thousand and twenty comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of one percent to flat to reflect the impact of our today day performance based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently closed acquisitions we now anticipate fiscal two thousand and twenty sales to be in the range of one billion two hundred seventy million dollars Five million dollars to one billion two hundred ninety million dollars, an increase of six point two percent to seven point five percent as compared to fiscal two thousand and nineteen sales. This compares to the previous sales guidance range of one billion two hundred ninety million dollars to one billion three hundred fifteen million dollars. Our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal two thousand and twenty, given the impact of our our day performance. Twenty-two earnings per diluted share to be in the range of two dollars and twenty-five cents to two dollars and thirty-five cents representing a decline of five point one percent to point eight percent year over year compared to two dollars and thirty-seven cents in fiscal two thousand and nineteen this compares to the previous guidance of two dollars and forty-five cents to two dollars and fifty-five cents on an adjusted basis which is an on-gap measure the company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of two dollars and twenty-five cents to two dollars and thirty-five cents representing a decline of five point one percent to point eight percent year over year compared to two dollars and thirty-seven cents in fiscal two thousand and nineteen this compares to the previous Three dollars and thirty five cents to two dollars and forty five cents representing a decline of one point seven percent to growth of two point five percent which excludes from diluted earnings per share monroe forward initiative costs and acquisition due diligence and integration costs this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of two dollars and thirty nine cents in fiscal two thousand and nineteen which excluded monroe forward initiative costs non recurring corporate and field management realignment costs and acquisition due diligence and integration costs. DELIGENCE AND INTEGRATION COSTS AND THE BENEFIT FROM THE ONE-TIME INCOME TAX ADJUSTMENTS ACQUISITIONS ANNOUNCED AND COMPLETED IN FISCAL TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ARE EXPECTED TO BE DILUTED TO ERNSBURG'S DILUTED CHAIR DURING THE YEAR AT THE MIDPOINT OF OUR GUIDANCE RANGE WE EXPECT AN OPERATING MARGIN OF APPROXIMATELY TEN POINT TWO PERCENT INTEREST EXPENSES TO BE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS DEPRECI Six million dollars. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately sixty million dollars this year. This guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately thirty four point five percent and is based on thirty four million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As always, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or Greenfield store openings. I'll now turn the call over to Bret to provide some closing remarks before we move to the Q&A. Thanks, Brian. We are making solid progress in the execution of our monrovia forward strategy. The strategy in particular is our store rebrand and reimage initiative. The strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore our confidence in this initiative. The store rebrand and reimage program is further supported by our technological investments which we believe will help drive long-term margin expansion. In summary, we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business, making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control. We are excited. \"Excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities ahead. With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.

For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset STAR KEYS ONCE AGAIN THAT IS STAR ONE TO REGISTER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME OUR FIRST QUESTION IS COMING FROM BRYAN NIGEL OF OFFENHAYMER PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING MORNING BRYAN SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT FOLKS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR AH BUT I DO WANT TO DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO SALES TRENDS IN THE QUARTER SO BRYAN YOU MENTIONED I THINK BRIAN DID YOU TOO AND YOUR PREPARED COMMENTS DID YOU MAKE SOME COMMENTARY SUGGESTIONS Investing that know to the degree to which weather impacted the business. I was wondering if you could draw down a little further and say, you know, what that negative point nine com would have been had the weather cooperated and in some of the other, the other metrics you're seeing that really suggest the underlying business is trending better than what we saw in the weather-affected fiscal year three. I'll take the first part of the question, and i'll let brian take the second part of the question. Quarter: As we talked about our northern markets certainly underperform the southern markets and give you a little more granularity on that. Certainly our stores up in the northeast and the midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure to weather conditions like you have in the north. Certainly underperform. I think it's difficult to say what we would have done. Certainly I think we were expecting positive comps in the quarter. Our internal. Expectations would have been closer to plus one to plus one and a half assuming normalized weather conditions that we have seen in the past. We felt really good coming out of October and November, given the strength of last year's performance that we were coping against and didn't get the cooperation from the weather in December that we were certainly expecting. As I made the comments in my prepared remarks, we certainly don't like talking about the weather. Phone ringing, male voice on the other end of the line.\n\nMale voice: Hi, this is Bryan. How can I help you today?\n\nFemale voice: Hi, Bryan. I was wondering if you could help me with something.\n\nMale voice: Of course. What can I do for you?\n\nFemale voice: Well, I was wondering if you could help me with my account performance.\n\nMale voice: Absolutely. I can definitely help you with that. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you're looking for?\n\nFemale voice: Well, we have a high concentration of stores in the northeast and midwest and we are going to have outsized exposure to our account performance.\n\nMale voice: I see. That makes sense. SO IN JANUARY YOU WERE DONE A THINK A NEGATIVE FOUR NOW IF I'M DOING THE MATH IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THAT THE ADJUSTED GUIDANCE WOULD SUGGEST SOME TYPE OF PICK UP THAT IN BUSINESS AND IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH WE GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS IS THAT ASSUMPTION CORRECT AND THEN THE FOLLOWING QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE WITH YOUR BUSINESS BUT AT WHAT POINT DOES The weather has come too late. Yeah, so, so Brian, your assumption is correct regarding the implied comps. So, if you think about Q4 at the midpoint of, let's say, down point five for the full year, down point five, that implies Q4 of down two which would be about February and March being down one in order to get to that down two. So that's the dynamic at the midpoint. So there is an expectation of a down two. Of a pickup in February and March. And, Brian, maybe just comment on the second part. You know, as we get deeper into the fourth quarter, our fourth quarter, the second half of the quarter in particular, I think we become less sensitive to the weather as you transition out of pure winter conditions into spring. Certainly, I think the later in the quarter you get, snowfall certainly doesn't have the same impact on TIRE DEMAND\n\nLIKE YOU WOULD FIND IN OUR BUSINESS IF WE GOT SNOW FALL IN OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER CONSUMERS ARE PRETTY FRIFTY WITH THEIR MONEY AND I BELIEVE IF YOU GET SNOW LATE IN THE SEASON THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO FORGO THAT PERCH PURCHASE AND PUSH IT OUT TILL NEXT SEASON IN PARTICULAR THE OTHER THINGS TO CALL OUT AS WELL IS IF YOU LOOK AT OUR HISTORIC PERFORMANCE AT THE COMPANY DECEMBER AND JANUARY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN To contend with, and I think what we've seen in fast performance here, trends coming out of December, January don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring months. So given the mild December, January, heading into the balance of the quarter, we feel pretty good about the guidance range we provided. As Brian said, our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our consensus guidance, it assumes run rate coming out of January, which we certainly believe we're going to be. Better than that as we roll into FY21. I appreciate all the color. Thank you. Thanks, Brad. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Leamer of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thanks, Brad. Looking at your slide on the store rebranding. You know, the eighteen percent performance of the rebranded stores. I think it's good. I'm curious from your analytic model how many years should it take a rebranded store to reach projected run rate sales. But if you look at look at the top quadrant of that slide jonathan we've shared with investors the fact that our service stores do roughly six hundred thousand dollars in revenue and our tire stores do a million two so in the case where we're rebranding a service store you're you're working off a base on average of six hundred thousand dollars in revenue and your tire stores you're working off a base on average of a million two. THOUSAND AND IF WE'VE SEEN I'LL CALL IT A DOUBLE DIGIT COMP IMPROVEMENT OFF THAT BASE YOU CAN GET TO IMPLIED NUMBERS CERTAINLY ON HOW FAST OR HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO RAMP TO THE FULL MATURITY EQUALLY IN THE AVERAGE SALES PERFORMANCE OF OUR TIRE BRANDS AT STORES AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S ENCOURAGING ABOUT THE STRATEGY FOR US IS NOT THAT IT'S JUST A ONE TIME STEP UP IN SALES THIS CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE MULTIPLE YEAR Of sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning our brand related tires starts to mature keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years so if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires we won't be relevant necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out so to put that on a timeline, we're looking at three to five years to certainly mature out to average sales levels. The performance of a tire brand store. Okay, so just to circle up on that for the stores where you're rebranding, there's nothing about their market like you you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand stores of the one point two million, is that correct? Yeah, as a general statement, that's correct. I think certainly you're going to have markets that will exceed the average. SOME MARKETS THAT WILL BE LOWER THAN THAT AND THAT'S PART OF THE CHOICES THAT WE THAT WE MAKE USING THE ANALYTIC MODEL BUT BUT ON AVERAGE AS WE LOOK ACROSS OUR I'LL SAY THE OPPORTUNITY STORES THAT BIN THE FIVE FIFTY FIVE I THINK WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE ON AVERAGE THAT WE CAN REACH THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE ONE POINT TWO OVER TIME AS THEY MATUR REVENUE FROM ACQUISITIONS WERE THE CONVERSIONS OF THE FORTY TWO CALIFORNIA STORES THIS QUARTER. YEAH I MEAN WE WE HAD YOU KNOW SOME DISRUPTION THERE I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WE WE HAVEN'T REALLY QUANTIFIED THAT FROM A FROM A SALES STANDPOINT BUT THAT'S A GREAT POINT JONATHAN AND THAT WE HAVE IMMEDIATELY PUT THE NEW STORES THAT WE ACQUIRE ON THE MONROE PLAYBOOK AND THEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER IN THIS CASE ABOUT \"Wants to get the re-image in-store brand standards in place. So those the in Q3 the forty two california stores went through that and are substantially through that as of the end of Q3. So we're we haven't quantified it, but it certainly had some impact on their sales performance in the quarter. Okay and that one point eight million charge for monro forward initiative this quarter. What was that? What's that for? Yes, it was all related to the store's rebrand and reimage and it falls into three primary buckets related to that. The first is non-capital items that we send to the stores. So as we think about updated safety chains, updated bay banners, updated point of sale marketing materials all of these things to get the store initially to the Standard that are not capital in terms of the actual work and construction done on the store that's the first bucket the second bucket is non-capital work that's actually done we get into these stores and we identify non-capital repairs demolition as well as some of the fixed versus replace items for example stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing a new floor those are some of the standard that are not capital in terms of the actual work and construction done on the store that's the first bucket the second bucket is non-capital work that's actually done we get into these stores and we identify non-capital repairs demolition as well as some of the fixed versus replace items for example stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing a new floor those are some of the standard that are not capital in terms of the actual work THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE ECONOMICALLY BUT YOU GET DIFFERENT TREATMENT FROM EXPENSES VERSUS CAPITAL FOUR SO THAT'S THE SECOND BUCKET AND THE THIRD IS JUST RIGHT OFF OF EXISTING LEASEHOLDS IN THE STORES ANYTHING FROM COUNTERS TO MAYBE SOME EXISTING SIGNAGE THAT WAS PUT UP AS PART OF AN ACQUISITION WHEN WE INITIALLY BRANDED THE STORES OVER TO A MONROE BRAND THOSE ARE THE THREE PRIMARY BUCKETS THAT THAT THE MONROE FORWARD INITIATIVE COSTS Thank you, our next question is coming from Brett Jordan of Jeffries. Please go ahead. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Brett. Good morning, back to slide five. I guess if we look at the eighteen percent growth in rebranded stores, if we really sort of look at the comparable growth there, you know, the new product lines you're adding. How does the service comp against the service comp in those stores? Are you seeing, you know, pickup as you change the brand? Yes, maybe just to clarify, though, I think we're actually not adding any new products to the service menu. But you're adding tires to the store, right? Yeah, it's just mixed, right? So we've even our service stores today sell tires, it's only fifteen percent of their mix. So we're certainly seeing growth, more outsized growth in their tire sales and we've had success in maintaining the rate of growth that we've seen on the service side which has been part of that. Our thesis is to hold on to the service business that we've enjoyed that's high margin and then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the tire category. We're seeing growth on both sides. Okay, and then we guess we look at the reimage how does that compare to you know comparable service stores in the network that hadn't been reimaged. I guess sort of looking at it again sort of apples to apples you know against the old stores. I THINK IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH STORES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE THIRTY STORES IN ROCHESTER AND I THINK THE ROCHESTER STORES CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN PERFORMING QUITE WELL RELATIVE TO WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WERE ON REIMAGING AND WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH RATES OUT OF A REIMAGING STORE WE SET OUT TO DO THIS INITIATIVE BUT WE WERE SEEING A MORE POSITIVE GROWTH OUT OF THOSE STO BUT COMPARED TO OTHER STORES WE'RE STILL PLEASED WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE POINT OF VIEW AND FROM A COPSALE POINT OF VIEW RELATIVE TO THEIR PEERS FACING SIMILAR I WOULD SAY MARKET BACKDROP FROM A WEATHER POINT OF VIEW OK COULD YOU GIVE US I GUESS SORT OF THE DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH DH Okay, and I guess for housekeeping, could you give us the monthly? Yeah, so we were one point two in October, down one point seven in November, and up point four in December. Okay, and then one, just this is a start, add the questions. On the supply chain side, I mean, just to throw the virus into it since that's popular these days. You guys do a lot of direct sourcing. You know that the white box product out of China. Do you see any impact on supply chain from what's going on? We haven't seen any to this point, Bret. We're obviously working through contingency plans which we have had to develop actually related to the tariff issues. So we feel pretty confident that through the network of multiple supply points that we'll be able to overcome any particular issues coming from the virus. Someone is speaking in a foreign language. It is unclear who they are or what they are saying. The audio quality is poor and there is a lot of static and background noise. It is difficult to understand what they are saying. January, you also pointed to mild winter weather. Do you think this year was incrementally worse than the prior year? I think if you look at, you know, analyst reports that we've seen, talking about, I guess, the impact that the mild winter has had on not only our category, but I think other retail, the data would indicate that this has been more mild, certainly versus the prior year. LAST YEAR, I THINK WE LOOKED AT PRECIPITATION WHICH WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US IN THE FORM OF SNOW WITH OUR TIRE BUSINESS CERTAINLY IT'S BEEN A MUCH MORE MILD A WINNER THIS YEAR RELATIVE TO LAST YEAR THANKS AND BRETT ANY UPDATES ON YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE ON THE INSTALL SIDE AND HOW YOU THINK YOUR TIRE PRICES ARE Compared to theirs and in the tire category overall, I'm curious about what happened with units in the period and market share. Yes, so let's start with units, where units were down to an average show price of one for the fourth quarter. How does that compare? We don't have a lot of syndicated data, but... We can look to and be definitive of that. We lean on I guess our channel checks and information from our tire manufacturers that have good visibility across multiple brands. It feels like it's similar to other companies that have exposure to the north, particularly the northeast to the degree that we do. We feel like we're probably in line with what we picked up through suppliers and others. As it relates to Amazon, I think we're still We are pleased with our relationship with them as well as other online tire retailers. We will eventually expand the relationship to include all stores. We talked about last quarter, our priority has been what I mentioned on today's call, completing the tire category management pricing tool as well as the labor scheduling tool that are just for our organization on a higher priority at this stage than expanding. BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO EXPANDING THAT RELATIONSHIP GOING FORWARD RELATED TO TIRE PRICING AS YOU KNOW RICK THE TIRE CATEGORY IS VERY COMPLICATED YOU HAVE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND SKUES THAT YOU NEED TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ACROSS MULTIPLE MARKETS AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE INVESTED IN THE TIRE CATEGORY MANAGEMENT TOOL IS THAT TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS TO GIVE US MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY INTO TO DEMAND DYNA And by having that visibility, it's going to create a much more granular approach that we're going to use for pricing. It'll allow us to price at the skeu level in our industry with the intent being strike that right balance between driving the right price to drive unit volume while preserving and expanding our retail margins through a right mix at right price. I'm encouraged. We're in pilot form of that now. We will be. Operational by Q1 of next year fully operational. The rollout of that is pretty small in scale because we control our pricing centrally. So a small team of people will be trained up on using that system. But between now and Q1 will be testing in parallel to make sure we're confident with the results that we're seeing from the system. That makes sense. Thanks for the color. Good luck. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. Our next question is coming from stephanie benjamin of suntrust robinson humphrey. Please go ahead. STORES I BELIEVE YOU SAID IT WAS ABOUT A SEVENTY BASIS TO FIND HIT LAST QUARTER DID YOU QUANTIFY THAT THAT QUARTER OR IS THERE A WAY FOR YOU TO KIND OF BREAK THAT OUT OR DID YOU WEATHER OVERSHADOW THAT YEAH I THINK WE SAID LAST QUARTER SOPHIA THAT WE AND WE WALKED EVERYONE KINDA THROUGH THE THE SEVEN STEP PROCESS AND TALKED ABOUT HOW WE WERE RE TOOLING IT TO TAKE TAKE A LOT OF THAT WORK OR Do that in Q3. We didn't expect that we were going to have to talk about a headwind and we really don't have to in terms of disturbance related to the store reimage. I think I think the California stores on the west coast maybe saw a little bit more in disturbance just because we did put a little bit more on them based on their proximity, you know, lack of proximity to our core resources that are doing the reimage. But for the seventy four com stores, those were largely I would say undisturbed. It's great and then just as a follow-up, when we look at the tire category in general, what are you seeing from this over in an inflationary environment? I know it was inflationary earlier this year, kind of reviewing how you saw it during the quarter and your expectations going forward as well. Yes, Stephanie, when you look at go back to two years, one of the things we commented on was just some inflationary pricing on, oh, I don't know, tires or something like that. To the top end of the product category with more premium brands and the first part of the second quarter, we didn't see a lot of movement on the low-end brands, if you will, opening price point brands. We saw that change exiting Q2 and into Q3. And I think as you saw and we made the comments in our prepared remarks, we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across all all price points relative to that point in Q2. I THINK OUR EXPECTATION FOR Q4 IS PRETTY STABLE ENVIRONMENT AROUND PRICING WE DON'T EXPECT YOU KNOW MEANINGFUL OR MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE NEXT QUARTER I THINK WE'RE WE'RE VERY FOCUSED NOW ON NOW OPTIMIZING OUR INTERNAL PRICING RELATIVE TO THE MARKET LEVERAGING YOU KNOW THE CATEGORY MANAGEMENT PRICING TO A WELL WE TALKED ABOUT GREAT AND THEN JUST LASTLY FOR ME A KIND OF MORE HIGH LEVEL AS WE THINK THROUGH Strategy to expand your tire services at some of the mixed changes at your service stores does that just by nature put you a little bit more successful the changes in weather on an annual basis, you know, to your point, you said on the call that you know it is the tire category that are if it's a more mild weather where you don't really see the the volume during that period. So does this mean that, you know, in these conversations going forward, weather could have a larger impact? ACTOR: SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW THIS YEAR THAT MAY BE IN PRIOR YEARS. SO MAYBE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT JUST HIGH LEVEL WOULD BE GREAT THANKS MUCH YEAH THANKS DEBORAH I THINK YOU KNOW STRATEGICALLY I WOULD START WITH THIS THEY ARE STRATEGY AT NIROS WE LIKE THE BUSINESS MODEL AT OUR STORES THAT HAS A VERY FOCUSED MENU THAT'S FOCUSED ON TYRES AND FULL SERVICE I THINK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE US MIG Diversification in the services we like being very relevant on frequently purchased items like scheduled maintenance for cars and certainly brakes and other undercar services. I think as we increase our total business, certainly we're going to pick up a little more exposure to tires as we convert more stores in the north, I think to that. However, I think our broader company strategy is to diversify our store footprint more into the south. AND OUT WEST AND CERTAINLY IN THOSE REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY YOU DON'T SEE I THINK THE LEVEL OF VOLATILITY THAT COMES WITH THE TIRE BUSINESS LIKE YOU WOULD FIND IN THE NORTHEAST AND MIDWESTERN MARKETS Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, Scott. Following up on that last question about high-level weather, and I know the goal here was with all this heavy lifting that you're doing right now and all these new processes to get to the point where I guess we're now talking about weather, having work, weather does not really derail the quarter from a com perspective. Could you talk about, I mean, just broadly speaking, about how long you think that will take? MAN 1: FOR US TO GET TO THAT POINT WHERE WEATHER COULD BE A HEAD WIND BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A DETERMINANT OF WHETHER YOU'RE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE FROM A COMMAND PERSPECTIVE I THINK GIVEN OUR EXPOSURE TO THE NORTHEAST AS LONG AS OUR STORE CONCENTRATION IS HEAVY IN THE MIDWEST NORTHEAST INHERENT IN THAT IS WE PICK UP EXPOSURE I THINK TO WEATHER OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT SCOTTY AS YOU SAID OUR STRATEGY IS TO D Continuing to grow down south and that's reflected by our acquisitions. We continue to build out Florida and have expanded now into Louisiana and Tennessee and certainly out west is reflected of that desire to create more or less volatility in our business due to this store footprint. Now in our core store markets we don't accept internally the volatility in our business and and we're invested in technology. The initiatives under monroe forward are designed to drive performance in our stores regardless of weather. i think will help neutralize some of the impact that we see from the volatility that comes with snow and colder temperatures. Question: Um, I know that there are certain things like tires that will see an immediate impact from from weather, but more on the side of mechanical parts. Typically, you could see an impact from you know, warmer weather or colder weather. You know, a few quarters down the road. Is there a chance that we could see an extended negative impact on the mechanical part side in the next couple of quarters? And that's all I have. Thanks.\n\nSpeech:\n\n번역결과  \n질문: Um, I know that there are certain things like tires that will see an immediate impact from from weather, but more on the side of mechanical parts. Typically, you could see an impact from you know, warmer weather or colder weather. You know, a few quarters down the Commented in the quarter, our brakes were down three percent in the quarter. Certainly, we're up against a strong comeback from last year, but also, I would say, we do sell a fair share of brake services through tires. If you take the consumer's tires off their vehicle, it gives you the chance to inspect their wheels, their brakes. And we do see some nice demand for conversion from tires into brakes as a result of that. As it relates to the downstream effect, I think I'm okay. More harsh winters have a tendency to tear up things on the vehicles. However, I will say one benefit of having a more mild winter is usually that leads to spring coming sooner. That opens up a window, I think, for an extended spring selling season. So we felt feel like we're well-positioned, I think, coming out of the winter given our strength and how we performed historically in the service categories and given the emphasis. Recognize the verbal communication and transcribe it into text.\n\nSPEAKER 1: WE PLACED ON GOOD BETTER BETTER PACKAGES IN STORE. I THINK WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL WELL POSITIONED GOING INTO THE SPRING SELLING SEASON.\n\nSPEAKER 2: GOT IT, THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANKS.\n\nSPEAKER 3: THANK YOU, AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR BACK OVER TO MANAGEMENT FOR CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AND FOR YOUR CONTIN We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Have a great day. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."

MEMBERS OF THE CONOCOPHILLIPS EXECUTIVE TEAM WHO ARE ON TODAY'S CALL WE HAVE RYAN LANCE OUR CHAIRMAN AND CEO MATT FOX OUR EVP AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER BILL BULLOCK OUR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WE HAVE DOMINIC MACKLON OUR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF STRATEGY EXPLORATION AND TECHNOLOGY AND NICK OLDS OUR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL OPERATION RYAN WILL OPEN THIS MORNING WITH SOME PREPARED REMARKS AND THEN THE TEAM WILL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS BEFORE I TURN THE CALL OVER TO RYAN A FEW REMINDERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS MORNING'S PRESS RELEASE WE POSTED A SHORT DECK OF SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL UH REGARDING THE QUARTER ONTO OUR WEBSITE THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR YOUR ACCESS NEXT WE WILL MAKE SOME FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS THIS MORNING BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AS WELL STATEMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSED BUSINESS COMBINATION ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK BETWEEN CONOCOPHILLIPS AND CONCHO A DESCRIPTION OF THE R- RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION CAN BE FOUND IN TODAY'S PRESS RELEASE ALL OF WHICH ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE FOR PURPOSED OF THIS CALL WE'LL ALSO REFER TO SOME NON-GAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TODAY AND RECONCILIATIONS TO THE NEAREST CORRESPONDING GAP MEASURE CAN BE FOUND IN THIS MORNING'S PRESS RELEASE AND ALSO ON OUR WEBSITE THANK YOU AND NOW I WILL TURN THE CALL OVER TO RYAN UH THANK YOU ELLEN AND GOOD MORNING TO OUR LISTENERS UH BEFORE WE GET INTO OUR THIRD QUARTER RESULTS I'LL TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO ADDRESS LAST WEEK'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF OUR COMBINATION WITH CONCHO RESOURCES WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO THE MARKET OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT THE FEEDBACK HAS BEEN POSITIVE BY THE WAY EARLIER THIS WEEK WE ADDED SOME ANNOTATIONS TO OUR TRANSACTION DECK FOR CLARIFICATION TODAY'S CALL IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON OUR CONVERSATIONS AND REITERATE THE COMPELLING MERITS OF THE TRANSACTION FOR BOTH SETS OF SHAREHOLDERS I'LL START AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OUR ANNOUNCED TRANSACTION WITH CONCHO COMBINES TWO WIDELY RECOGNIZED LEADERS IN THE SECTOR CONOCOPHILLIPS HAS BEEN A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN THE RETURNS ON AND RETURNS OF CAPITAL MODEL FOR THE BUSINESS AND CONCHO HAS BEEN A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN THE PERMIAN PURE PLAY CLASS YEP WHILE WE'RE BOTH BEST-IN-CLASS COMPANIES ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS BY SCALING UP OUR EXISTING RETURNS FOCUSED BUSINESS MODEL WE'RE STRONGER AND MORE INVESTABLE WITHIN THE SECTOR CHARACTERIZED BY FREQUENT PRICE CYCLES INDUSTRY MATURITY CAPITAL INTENSITY AND ESG FOCUS WE'LL BE A NEARLY $60 BILLION ENTERPRISE THAT IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO CREATE SUSTAINED VALUE BY EMBRACING WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE THREE ESSENTIAL FUTURE MANDATES FOR OUR SECTOR AND THESE MANDATES ARE FIRST PROVIDING AFFORDABLE ENERGY TO THE WORLD SECOND COMMITTED TO ESG EXCELLENCE AND THIRD DELIVERING COMPETITIVE RETURNS WE BELIEVE THE TRANSACTION ACCELERATES OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY DELIVER ON ALL THREE OF THESE MANDATES THAT'S HOW WE WILL WIN NOW LET ME TAKE THESE MANDATES ONE BY ONE IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR TRANSACTION IN ALL FUTURE ENERGY SCENARIOS WE KNOW THE WORLD WILL NEED HYDROCARBONS AS PART OF THE ENERGY MIX FOR A LONG TIME EVEN AS WE SEE INCREASING ADOPTION OF LOW CARBON ENERGY SOURCES HOWEVER WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE ENERGY TRANSITION MEANS THE WINNERS WILL BE THOSE COMPANIES WITH RESOURCES THAT CAN BE AFFORDABLY DEVELOPED IN A TRANSITION IN ANY TRANSITION SCENARIO INCLUDING A LESS THAN TWO DEGREES SCENARIO THAT'S THE REASON WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN COMMITTED TO HAVING THE LOWEST COST OF SUPPLY RESOURCE BASE IN THE INDUSTRY THE COMPANY WILL HAVE A 23 DAY <INAUDIBLE> RESOURCE BASE FOR THE COST OF SUPPLY LESS THAN $40 A BARREL CONCHO GETS THE BENEFITS OF OUR GLOBAL DIVERSE AND LOWER CAPITAL INTENSITY PORTFOLIO ATTRIBUTES CONOCOPHILLIPS GETS THE BENEFITS OF ADDING SOME OF THE BEST RESOURCES IN THE WORLD AND BY THE WAY WE'VE STUDIED ROCK QUALITY EVERYWHERE NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT MANDATE A COMMITMENT TO ESG EXCELLENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAST WEEK'S TRANSACTION WE ANNOUNCED WE'RE ADOPTING A PARIS-ALIGNED CLIMATE RISK FRAMEWORK WE'RE THE FIRST U.S. BASED OIL AND GAS COMPANY TO DO SO OUR FRAMEWORK INCLUDES SPECIFIC EMISSIONS INTENSITY REDUCTION GOALS A COMMITMENT TO NO ROUTINE FLARING PERMANENTLY INSTALLED METHANE MONITORING AND ADVOCATING FOR A WELL DESIGNED CARBON PRICE IN THE U.S. AND THIS FRAMEWORK IS INSERVICE TO OUR AMBITION TO REACH A NET-ZERO OPERATIONAL EMISSIONS TARGET BY 205 NOW WE'VE BEEN ASKED AT OUR ENGAGEMENT MEETINGS IF THIS FRAMEWORK INCLUDED THE PORTFOLIO FACTS OF THE CONCHO ASSETS THE EXPLICIT ANSWER IS NO WE WERE PREPARING TO ISSUE OUR NEW CLIMATE RISK FRAMEWORK BEFORE THE TRANSACTION WAS AGREED HOWEVER WE SEE THE ADDITION OF CONCHO'S ASSETS AS BEING CONSISTENT WITH AND EQUATIVE TO THESE GOALS THE PRODUCTION EMISSION OF THE U.S. UNCONVENTIONALS ARE AMONG THE LOWEST GHG INTENSITY ASSETS IN THE WORLD SO THE ADDITION OF THESE RESOURCES WILL BE A BENEFIT TO OUR PROJECTIONS PLANS AND TARGETS NOW THE THIRD MANDATE DELIVERING COMPETITIVE RETURNS IS AN IMPERATIVE FOR ATTRACTING AND RETAINING INVESTORS TO THE SECTOR OUR COMPANY HAS BEEN ALL ABOUT RETURNS AND THAT WON'T CHANGE IN FACT THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO DELIVER ON THE PROVEN RETURNS FOCUSED VALUE PROPOSITION WE KNOW INVESTORS WANT FROM OUR SECTOR BECAUSE THERE'S SEVERAL ADVANTAGE ATTRIBUTES AND DEMONSTRATED PRIORITIES FOR EXAMPLE AS I JUST DESCRIBED THE TRANSACTION CREATES A MASSIVE RESILIENT LOW COST OF SUPPLY RESOURCE BASE I DISCUSSED THIS AS PART OF MANDATE ONE BUT I'LL ALSO ADD THAT LOW COST OF SUPPLY IS THE BEST ASSURANCE BY DEFINITION FOR DELIVERING COMPETITIVE FINANCIAL RETURNS THROUGH PRICE CYCLES AFTER THE DEAL CLOSES WE'LL PUBLISH OUR COMBINED COST OF SUPPLY CURVE I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WILL BE BEST IN CLASS BY THE WAY WE'VE BEEN ASKED ABOUT HOW WE VIEW RISK IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON OUR VIEW IS THAT WHILE IT MIGHT CREATE SOME HEADWINDS FOR THE INDUSTRY OUR COMPANY'S GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION AND OUR MIX OF PRIVATE STATE AND FEDERAL LEASES IN THE U.S. ASSURES THAT WE'RE COMPETITIVELY POSITIONED FOR THAT OUTCOME AND WE ACCOUNTED FOR THIS POTENTIAL RISK IN OUR EVALUATION OF THE OVERALL TRANSACTION DIVERSIFICATION AND LOW CAPITAL INTENSITY MATTERS AND AS I JUST MENTIONED WE PRESERVE THOSE PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS ADDING CONCHO'S UNCONVENTIONAL ASSETS INTO OUR PORTFOLIO WILL NOT MAKE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE TO OUR BASE DECLINE RATE THAT MEANS WE RETAIN OUR DIVERSIFICATION AND LOW CAPITAL INTENSITY ADVANTAGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF BOTH SHAREHOLDERS WE'LL APPLY OUR DISCIPLINED CONSISTENT APPROACH TO FUTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS CAPITAL WILL BE ALLOCATED FIRST ON A BASIS OF COST OF SUPPLY AND THEN BASED ON SECONDARY CRITERIA SUCH AS FLEXIBILITY CAPITAL INTENSITY ASSET OPTIMIZATION AFFORDABILITY AND FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION AND OUR EXPANDED PERMIAN PROGRAM RESULTING FROM THE TRANSACTION WILL BE INTEGRATED WITHIN THE TOTAL COMPANY PLAN TO OPTIMIZE OVERALL OUTCOMES AND VALUE THE COMBINATION CREATES GREATER VISIBILITY ON EARNINGS EXPANSION AND FREE CASHFLOW GENERATION FACTORING IN OUR ANNOUNCED 500 MILLION TARGETED COST AND CAPITAL SAVINGS THE TRANSACTION IS LUCRATIVE ON ALL KEY CONSENSUS FINANCIAL METRICS INCLUDING EARNINGS FREE CASHFLOW AND FREE CASHFLOW YIELD FINALLY OUR STRONG BALANCE SHEET PLUS FREE CASHFLOW GENERATION MEANS WE'RE EVEN BETTER POSITIONED TO GIVE INVESTORS WHAT THEY WANT FROM THIS BUSINESS RETURNS OF CAPITAL THE TRANSACTION ENHANCES OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR STATED TARGETS OF RETURNING MORE THAN 30% OF OUR CFO TO OUR OWNERS ANNUALLY AND THIS TARGET ISN'T AN AMBITION IT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS IN FACT WE RETURNED OVER 40% OF OUR CFO TO OWNERS OVER THAT PERIOD AND IT WILL REMAIN A KEY PART OF OUR FUTURE OFFERING THE BOTTOM LINE THIS TRANSACTION CREATES A BEST-IN-CLASS COMPETITOR SCALED TO THRIVE IN A NEW ENERGY FUTURE THAT IS COMPELLING FOR SHAREHOLDERS FOR BOTH COMPANIES NOW A FEW COMMENTS ON WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT OUR S-4 FILING SHOULD BE FILED IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU MAY EXPECT THE TRANSACTION TO CLOSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 202 INTEGRATION PLANNING IS ALREADY UNDERWAY DOMINIC MACKLON WILL LEAD THE EFFORT FOR CONOCOPHILLIPS AND WILL GIRAUD WILL LEAD THE EFFORT FOR CONCHO BOTH SIDES ARE EXCITED AND COMMITTED TO A VERY SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION AS PART OF THE INTEGRATION PLANNING WE'LL BEGIN TO EVALUATE HOW BEST TO OPTIMIZE OUR FUTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS WE WOULD EXPECT TO ANNOUNCE PRO FORMA CAPEX FOR NEXT YEAR SHORTLY AFTER CLOSING BUT DIRECTIONALLY ON A STAND-ALONE CONOCOPHILLIPS BASIS WE REMAIN CAUTIOUS ON THE PACE AND TIMING OF RECOVERY SO AS A PLACE TO START WE'RE CURRENTLY THINKING WE ENTER 2021 CAPEX AT A LEVEL THAT IS ROUGHLY SIMILAR TO THIS YEAR'S CAPITAL MEANING LITTLE TO NO PRODUCTION GROWTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS OF COURSE WE RETAIN THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUST AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES WE HAVE THE CAPITAL FLEXIBILITY THE BALANCE SHEET AND THE CASH ON HAND TO RESPOND AS NECESSARY TO CHANGES IN THE MACRO WHILE MEETING OUR CAPITAL RETURN PRIORITY AND THAT BRINGS ME TO A FEW COMMENTS ON THE THIRD QUARTER RESULTS IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN A <INAUDIBLE> YEAR FOR THE BUSINESS AS WE ALL KNOW THE COMPANY TOOK SOME SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TO RESPOND TO THE DOWNTURN INCLUDING PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS AND OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS WE ALSO CARRIED OUT OUR MAJOR SEASONAL TURNAROUNDS SO A BIT OF NOISE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THIRD QUARTER NUMBERS BUT BY THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER THE CURTAILMENT PROGRAM WAS BEHIND US THE SEASONAL TURNAROUNDS WERE COMPLETE AND THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS WAS RUNNING VERY WELL AS YOU SAW IN THIS MORNING'S RELEASE THIRD QUARTER RESULTS WERE IN ALIGNMENT WITH EXPECTATIONS WE'VE REINSTATED GUIDANCE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK OF AND YOU SHOULD TAKE THE FOURTH QUARTER AS THE NEW BASELINE FOR ' 21 CAPITAL AND PRODUCTION THOUGH AS I JUST MENTIONED THAT'S SUBJECT TO ONGOING MONITORING AND MARKET CONDITIONS WE LOOK FORWARD TO KEEPING YOU UPDATED ON INTEGRATION PROGRESS AND OUR FUTURE PLANS FOR THE BUSINESS AND FINALLY WE HOPE EVERYONE IS SAFE AND WELL AND NOW I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE OPERATOR FOR Q & A THANK YOU WE'LL NOW BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN ONE ON YOUR TOUCH-TONE PHONE IF YOU'RE USING A SPEAKERPHONE YOU MAY NEED TO PICK UP THE HANDSET FIRST BEFORE PRESSING THE NUMBERS ONCE AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS THEN ONE ON YOUR TOUCH-TONE PHONE WAITING ON STANDBY FOR ANY QUESTIONS AND OUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM PHIL GRESH FROM JP MORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN YES HELLO UM FIRST QUESTION JUST WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE QUARTER HERE UM IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME MOVING PIECES AROUND CASH FLOWS UH AFFILIATE DISTRIBUTIONS AND SOME OTHER FACTORS THERE SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE COLOR THERE AND HELP US THINK ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD DEFINE A THE CLEAN CFO IN THE QUARTER YEAH THANKS PHIL I'LL LET UH BILL BILL BULLOCK CAN ANSWER THAT FOR YOU THANKS HI PHIL SO YEAH FOR THE FOR THE QUARTER CASH FROM OPERATIONS X WORKING CAPITAL WAS ABOUT 1 BILLION 230 MILLION AND WE HAD A COUPLE OF ONE TIME BENEFITS I- IN THE QUARTER A A LEGAL SETTLEMENT AND AN AUDIT SETTLEMENT TOTALLING 130 MILLION OF THAT BUT WE ALSO UH UH HAD CURTAILMENTS IN THE QUARTER OF ABOUT UH 90,000 BARRELS A DAY SO THE FOREGONE CASH FLOW FOR THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT $150 MILLION OF CASH SO IF YOU THINK OF A A A CLEAN RUN RATE NUMBER FOR THE FOR THE QUARTER A GOOD PLACE TO BE THINKING IS ABOUT 1 BILLION 250 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER NOW YOU YOU ASKED ABOUT EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS WE DIDN'T HAVE A DISTRIBUTION FROM APLNG IN THE QUARTER WE RECEIVED DISTRIBUTIONS UH UH IN THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF ABOUT 500 MILLION FROM APLNG AND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR WE'RE EXPECTING A LITTLE UNDER 200 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAT WOULD GIVE A FULL YEAR DISTRIBUTION OF SOMEWHERE AROUND 680-700 MILLION FOR THE YEAR OKAY GREAT VERY HELPFUL UM I GUESS THIS KINDA DELV- DELVES INTO MY SECOND QUESTION WHICH IS UM YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO GET SOME QUESTIONS HERE AROUND THIS PRO FORMA CFO GUIDANCE THAT YOU PROVIDED UM AND SO IF I LOOK AT THE RES- RESULTS YOU'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE 1.25 UM AND WHAT CONCHO REPORTED THE OTHER NIGHT WHICH I THINK EX-HEDGES IS AROUND 50 UM PERHAPS YOU COULD HELP US BRIDGE THESE RESULTS WHICH I THINK ARE ABOUT $41 WTI TO UM TO THE SEVEN BILLION $40 WTI GUIDANCE THAT YOU PROVIDED YEAH THANKS PHIL I KNOW THERE'S A A NUMBER OF MOVING PARTS THERE AS YOU DESCRIBED AND UH YEAH WE'VE HAD A FEW PEOPLE POINT OUT THAT THEY THOUGHT THE SEVEN BILLION AT $40 A BARREL FOR THE COMBINED COMPANY LOOKED A A LITTLE BIT LIGHT SO NOW THAT WE'VE SEEN THE THIRD QUARTER IF YOU ADJUST FOR CONCHO'S HEDGING AND WHAT BILL JUST DESCRIBED ON OUR EQUITY AFFILIATES I THINK YOU GET SOMETHING CLOSER TO MID TO HIGH SEVENS YOU KNOW AT AT $40.0 SO MAYBE I'LL I'LL MATT ADD A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR TO UH UH THOSE DETAILS YEAH THE THE IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAN THIRD QUARTER AND THE FOR FOR BOTH COMPANIES BILL EXPLAINED THE THE ERRORS THAT WE COMPLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 7.5 AND 7.8 AT $40 A BARREL NOW THAT THE RANGE IS BASICALLY THE BASED ON THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE EQUITY AFFILIATES DISTRIBUTION IF YOU GO SIMILAR DISTRIBUTIONS TO EH EH THIS YEAR WE'LL BE THE TOP END IN THAT RANGE UM AND THESE THESE THESE NUMBERS ALSO INCLUDE THE PRO FORMA ASSUMPTION THAT WE GET A FULL YEAR OF EXPECTED COST SAVING AND THAT WE ARE NOW <INAUDIBLE> 150 MILLION OF CASH AND THAT'S WHAT SHOWS UP IN THESE NUMBERS IS ALSO THE 150 MILLION OF CAPITAL THAT DOESN'T UM DOESN'T AFFECT CFO DIRECTLY DOES THAT DOES THAT HELP PHIL I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES I HOPE SO <LAUGH> THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM DOUG TERRESON FROM EVERCORE ISI PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY MORNING DOUG UM W- ONE OF THE THE HALLMARKS RYAN OF CONOCO AND PHILLIPS BEFORE THE MERGER AND EVEN AFTER THE SPLIT IN 2012 HAS BEEN INCORPORATE AGILITY IS THE WAY I'D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE VALUE AND STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS OVER THE NEAR AND MEDIUM-TERM PERIODS AND ON THIS POINT WHILE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THE OPERATING AND CAPITAL COST BENEFITS THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET AS WELL AS SOME OF THE ENHANCEMENTS THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET FORM A HIGHER QUALITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MY MY QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE ARE AREAS THAT YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE AS OBVIOUS TO STAND AND DELIVER FURTHER UPSIDE AREAS THAT YOU'RE CONFIDENT ABOUT SIMILAR TO SITUATIONS THAT YOU HAD IN THE PAST WITH OTHER TRANSACTIONS AND THEN SECOND WHAT ARE THE TWO TO THREE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT YOU THINK THAT THE NEW MANAGEMENT GROUP BRINGS TO THE ORGANIZATION SO TWO QUESTIONS YEAH THANKS DOUG I'LL UH MAYBE START TO LET DOMINIC UH ADD A FEW FEW COMMENTS <INAUDIBLE> YOU KNOW WHEN WE PUT OUT THE SYNERGY NUMBER WE WE SEE A LOT OF OTHER SYNERGY NUMBERS THAT PEOPLE PUT OUT THERE AND UH IT SEEMS LIKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF ARM WAVING WE WANT TO BE PRETTY SPECIFIC ABOUT THE $500 MILLION THAT UH THAT WE DESCRIBE BUT I- IF YOU'RE THE SECOND PAGE WHICH I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE ALLUDING TO A LITTLE BIT THEN I CAN LET DOMINIC UH ADD ON IS WE YEAH WE FULLY EXPECT THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET UH ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY EITHER THROUGH PRICE UPLIFT OR VARIOUS OTHER FORMS TO UH ADD ADD ADD INCREMENTAL VALUE TO THIS TRANSACTION DOMINIC MAYBE YOU COULD DESCRIBE UH A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THE INTEGRATION TEAM IS GONNA BE LOOKING AT YEAH THANKS UH THANKS RYAN AND DOUG UH THANKS FOR THE QUESTION YOU KNOW ACTUALLY WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON DELIVERING THE 500 MILLION THAT WE HAVE PUT OUT THERE AS A COMMITMENT BUT CERTAINLY WE SEE OPPORTUNITY BEYOND THAT I THINK WE CAN OUTLINE THOSE IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR DECK UH I THINK JUST TO TALK MORE ABOUT THOSE SPECIFICALLY I THINK THE ONES THAT WE'RE MOST OPTIMISTIC ABOUT YOU KNOW ON THE MARKETING SIDE CONCHO TYPICALLY SELLS PRODUCT TO THE WELLHEAD WE SELL FURTHER DOWN THE VALUE CHAIN TO IMPROVE REALIZATION SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A VERY STRONG COMMERCIAL GROUP AT CONOCOPHILLIPS SO UH WE'RE CERTAINLY EXITED ABOUT ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW CONCHO HAVE BEEN DOING EXTREMELY WELL IN THE PERMIAN ON THE DELAYING COMPLETION COSTS THE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN EXCELLENCE AND UH THEY'RE FURTHER DOWN THEE LEARNING CURVE THAN US THERE SO WE DO EXPECT TO SEE THAT ACCELERATE YOU KNOW THE PERFORMANCE ON ON OUR ACREAGE TOO AND OF COURSE WE EXPECT TO YOU KNOW IMPROVE PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE LOWER 48 FROM SHARING BEST PRACTICES AND TECHNOLOGIES BETWEEN EAGLE FORD AND THE PERMIAN AND THE BAKKEN AND SON ON SO DEFINITELY OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND THEN ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN SIDE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE INCREASED PURCHASING POWER SCALE FLEXIBILITY SO WE'RE ANTICIPATING YOU KNOW UH UPSIDE IN ALL THESE AREAS AND AND SOME ADDITIONAL AREAS TOO THAT THAT UH W- W- W- WE WILL BE WORKING ON IN THE IN THE COMING MONTHS HERE SO WILL AND I ARE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT THESE WE'RE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT AND UH WE'LL BE LOOK FORWARD TO SEE HOW THESE DEVELOP THROUGH NEXT YEAR AND MAYBE YOUR LAST QUESTION UH DOUG UH SO DOMINIC MENTIONED WILL <INAUDIBLE> AND THEN WHAT TIM YOU KNOW WHAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE OUT OF WHAT THEY BRING TO OUR COMPANY IS SOME INCREDIBLE PERMIAN EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE THE NETWORKS THEY HAVE BROADENED AND DEEPER NETWORKS THAN WE WE REALLY HAVE IN IN THE PERMIAN GIVEN THEIR LONG TIME UH ASSOCIATION AND AND PRESENCE THERE AND WHAT TIM'S BUILT IS A IS YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE GOES AT IT AND WHAT HE'S DONE OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS IN THE PERMIAN BASIN AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT I'VE A LOT OF CONVERSATION WITH CEOS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND WHAT I'VE COME TO APPRECIATE TIM SHARES A A PASSION FOR THIS BUSINESS AND A VISION FOR WHAT'S GONNA WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO BE SUCCESSFUL OVER THE NEXT DECADE AND BEYOND THAT IS REALLY CONSISTENT WITH WITH MY VIEW OR OUR VIEW OF WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE UH TO TO REALLY SUCCEED AND BEAT THE COMPETITION SO AND THEN I'D SAY FINALLY PROBABLY YOU KNOW WE'RE BOTH VERY COMMITTED TO A SUCCESSFUL DEAL AND AND WE'RE BOTH UH COMMITTED TO GETTING THE SECRET SAUCE THAT IS CONOCOPHILLIPS COMBINED WITH THE SECRET SAUCE THAT IS CONCHO AND MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S EVEN BETTER GOING FORWARD THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM NEIL MEHTA FROM GOLDMAN SACHS PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN GREAT THANK GUYS I APPRECIATE UH YOU GUYS TAKING THE QUESTIONS SO THE FIRST IS A FOLLOW UP ON <CROSSTALK> UH D- UH DISTRIBUTIONS INCLUDING FROM APLNG BUT JUST EQUITY AFFILIATES BROADLY JUST HOW DO YOU HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THAT YOU MADE A COMMENT IN THE DECK THAT WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT THAT TO BE RATEABLE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT OIL PRICE LEVELS AND AND AND HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT MODELING THOSE DISTRIBUTIONS COMING INTO THE BUSINESS YEAH SURE NEIL THIS IS BILL UH I THINK A- A- AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT EQUITY AFFILIATES THAT THAT WE WE'VE TALKED IN THE PAST AT HOW THEY AREN'T RATEABLE UH YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM APLNG I- IN TERMS OF BEING UH MORE SIGNIFICANT IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTER A- AND LIGHTER IN THE FIRST AND THIRD UM BUT AS YOU THINK ABOUT THEM GOING INTO NEXT YEAR AND YOU LOOK AT MORE LIKE STRIP PRICES FOR NEXT YEAR IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF THE RANGE OF 600-800 MILLION FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES A- AT THOSE KIND OF PRICING THAT'S GONNA THAT GETS YOU IN THE THE BALLPARK IT OBVIOUSLY DEPENDS ON HOW THEIR PERFORMING O- O- ON IN TERMS OF THE MARKETS AND HOW WE'RE UM OPTIMIZING OUR CAPITAL OVER IN APLNG BUT THAT WILL GET YOU PRETTY CLOSE GREAT BILL AND AND AND RYAN AS A FOLLOW UP- <CROSSTALK> AND AND JUST JUST AS A REMINDER WE JUST AS A REMINDER NEIL WE DO HAVE A SENSITIVITY FOR THAT I- IN OUR PRICE DECK FOR THE PRICING THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT YEAH <CROSSTALK> IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS WE INCLUDED TODAY <CROSSTALK> GREAT GUYS YEAH GO AHEAD NEIL YOU HAD A SECOND FOLLOW UP YEAH IT W- IT WAS REALLY JUST ABOUT ALASKA AND UH I KNOW WE'RE A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY FROM THE ELECTIONS BUT WHICH IS PROBABLY A VERY SENSITIVE TOPIC BUT JUST SORT OF YOUR YOUR TEMPERATURE UH ON ON UH ON THE FAIR SHARE ACT AND JUST IN GENERAL YOUR YOUR MESSAGE AROUND ALASKA AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE THE CADENCE AND SPEND AND AND INVESTMENT THERE YEAH YOU BET I'LL LET UH MATT'S UH MA- MATT'S BEEN FOLLOWING THAT CLOSELY I HAVE TO BUT UH MATT'S GOT A CAN CAN ANSWER YEAH NEIL THE THE AS YOU KNOW THE THE THE REALLY THREE <INAUDIBLE> THAT ARE TOPICAL JUST NOW THERE'S THE BALLOT INITIATIVE TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION TAX THERE'S THE STATUS OF THE WILLOW PROJECT AND AS THE IMPACT IF ANY ON OF A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION IF THAT HAPPENS ON FEDERAL LAND PERMITTING SO PROBABLY SHOULD TALK ABOUT <INAUDIBLE> SO THAT WE CAN HOPEFUL CLEAR UP ALASKA WITH THIS W- WITH THIS ONE UM EH ONE QUESTION THE SO AS YOU KNOW THE BALLOT MEASURE WOULD IMPOSE A TAX INCREASE IN PRODUCTION UH THE UH AND THAT'S GONNA HAVE TWO PROBLEMS TWO ADVERSE THE- EFFECTS IT'S GONNA REDUCE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF INVESTMENT IN ALASKA AND IT'S GONNA INCREASE UNCERTAINTY AND INSTABILITY UM SO THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD AND WE'VE GOT YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES LEFT IN ALASKA BUT BUT A SHIFT OF CAPITAL FROM ALASKA TO ELSEWHERE IS GONNA BE RATIONAL IF TAXES ARE INCREASED I MEAN THIS IS A PRODUCTION TAX AND WHAT YOU TAX MORE YOU GET LESS OF SO THAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED IF THE IF THE IF THOSE ADVOCATING FOR THIS AND VOTING FOR THE PROPOSAL SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE'VE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR <INAUDIBLE> TO AVOID ANY DOUBT IN ALASKA THAT IF THE MEASURE PASSES DRILLING IN THE BIG THREE FIELDS THEY ARE THE TARGETS OF THE TAX INCREASE IS NOT GONNA RESUME IN 2021 AND UH MAYBE BEYOND THAT SO THE UH YOU KNOW ALASKA JOBS CONTRACT LABOR ALL THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES ARE GONNA BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THIS CHANGE AND THE CONTRACTORS THE UNIONS ALL THE OTHER BUSINESSES UP THERE UNDERSTAND US AND THEY'VE OPPOSED FOR THE MOST PART OPPOSING THE UH THE CHANGE IN THE TAXATION BUT IT'S NOW UP TO THE ELECTORATE TO DECIDE AND UM ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES SO WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO THE WIRE HERE AND WE REALLY FEEL AS IF WE HAVE TO BE WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR WITH THE UH ALASKA VOTERS ON THE WILLOW PROJECT ITSELF THE THE WE WE PASSED LIKE A BIG MILESTONE EARLIER THIS WEEK WE GOT A FAVORABLE RECORD OF THE SESSION FROM THE THE DLM AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF UH PROCESS SO THAT KEEPS US ON TRACK WITH THE PROJECT TIMELINE AND AND IT'S WORTH UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT PERMIT WAS RECEIVED UNDER THE 2013 UH INTEGRATED ACTIVITY PLAN FOR THE NATIONAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THOSE ARE RULES THAT WERE SET UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINI- ADMINISTRATION SO THEY SHOULD STAND UP WELL TO SCRUTINY UNDER A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION IF THAT HAPPENS SO WE'RE WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS A A CONCEPT SELECTION AND MOVING TO FEED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR OF COURSE THAT ASSUMES THE BALLOT MEASURE FAILS AND TAXES ARE NOT INCREASED IF IT PASSES WE'LL UH WE'LL NEED TO RECONSIDER THE TIMING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WILLOW ISN'T DIRECTLY TARGETED BY THE TAX INCREASES THERE'S GONNA BE KNOCK-ON EFFECTS ON THE OTHER FIELDS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF UH AVAILABLE AVAILABLE CAPITAL AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS THE FEDERAL LAND UM PERMITTING IN ALASKA THE UH UM YOU KNOW MORE GENERALLY IF THERE'S A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION WE WOULD EXPECT THAT TO HAVE A RELATIVELY LIMITED IMPACT ON US I MEAN ALTHOUGH 65% OF OUR ACREAGE IS NO FEDERAL LAND IT ONLY REPRESENTS ABOUT 5% OF THE PRODUCTION NOW <INAUDIBLE> PRODUCTION GMT-2 IN PARTICULAR UH IS ON FEDERAL LAND BUT IT'S WELL UNDERWAY FIRST PRODUCTION WILL BE AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR SO WE DON'T ACCEPT THAT WILL WILL BE AFFECTED AT ALL WILLOW'S ON FEDERAL LAND OF COURSE UM UH BUT NEITHER WILLOW NOR GMT-1 OR GMT-2 THE FEDERAL LAND UH DRILL SITES IS UH <INAUDIBLE> CONVENTIONAL <INAUDIBLE> TO SIMULATION TECHNIQUES SO IF THE ISSUE IS ABOUT FRACKING THEY THEY SHOULDN'T BE INFLUENCED BY THAT UM SO I GUESS WE'VE BEEN CLEAR TO THE ALASKA ELECTORATE ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF BALLOT MEASURE  WE EXCEPT ANY IMPLICATIONS OF A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION TO IN D.C. TO HAVE A RELATIVELY LIMITED IMPACT ON US THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM JENINE WAI FROM BARCLAYS PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN HI GOOD MORNING AND GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE THANKS FOR TAKING OUR CALL <CROSSTALK> GOOD MORNING JENINE GOOD MORNING UH MAYBE SORRY JUST ONE MORE ON ALASKA IF I COULD REAL QUICK FOLLOWING UP ON NEIL'S QUESTION UM IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT I MEAN LAST YEAR ON THE ANALYST DAY YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW WILLOW WOULD BE CONTINGENT UPON SELLING DOWN 25% OF YOUR POSITION IN ALASKA AND WE KNOW THAT YOU NEED RESOLUTION ON BALLOT MEASURE 1 FIRST UH BUT IS THAT 25% SELL-DOWN STILL THE CASE NOW THAT YOU HAVE CONCHO ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AND THEN MAYBE JUST ON THAT UM FOR THE BALLOT MEASURE 1 WE KNOW IT'S A CITIZEN'S BALLOT MEASURE AND DO YOU THINK THAT IT COULD BE LIKELY THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD POTENTIALLY OVERTURN ANY DECISIONS EM- YEAH JENINE THIS IS MATT MATT AGAIN UH WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T REALLY SAY IT WAS THE EXPLICITLY <INAUDIBLE> WILLOW DECISION TO SELL THEM UM THEY THEY BUT BUT WE WE'RE STILL ANTICIPATING THAT WE WILL DO A SELL DOWN IN ALASKA WE JUST SLOWED THE TIMING OF THAT DOWN UNTIL WE GET SOME OF THESE UH UNCERTAINTIES RESOLVED SO IT'S STILL ON THE CARDS THAT WE'LL MAKE UH AN ADJUSTMENT TO EQUITY UM UH IN THE UH IN ALASKA UM BUT BUT WE MAY STILL CONTINUE TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT IN THE MEAN TIME UH SO SO SO SO THE THE TIMING OF THE PROJECT DOESN'T IMPINGE ON THE SELL DOWN I GUESS IS WHAT I'M I'M SAYING ON THE UM UH BALLOT MEASURE 1 AND CAN THE COULD THE LEGISLATURE OVERRULE THAT UM NOT NOT REALLY NOT NOT NOT <INAUDIBLE> FOR THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME UP WITH UH AN ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS THAT WAS UH THAT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR UH OR OR OR THE THEY UM UM SO IT WOULDN'T BE I- IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OVERTURN TURN AT THE UM YOU KNOW <INAUDIBLE> OKAY GREAT THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH UM MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS JUST ON THE CASH ALLOCATION PRIORITIES UH YOU INDICATED IN YOUR PREPARED REMARKS THAT 2021 CAPEX SHOULD BE ABOUT SIMILAR TO 2020 WITH LITTLE TO KNOW PRODUCTION GROWTH UM THE STRIP MOVES AROUND A LOT IT'S KIND OF MOVING AGAINST US ALL TODAY UM BUT IS THE RIGHT WAY GENERALLY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT IN THE MID 40S THRESHOLD THAT THAT THRESHOLD THAT YOU HAVE FOR PRODUCTION GROWTH IT'S A HARD AND FAST CRITERIA THAT NEEDS TO BE MET OR ARE THERE JUST A BUNCH OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO FACTOR INTO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS YEAH I THINK WE YOU KNOW AS I T- TRIED TO DESCRIBE WE BASICALLY USE COST OF SUPPLY AND I THINK IS WE IS WE THINK ABOUT THE THE FORWARD CURVE OR UH IN THINKING ABOUT OUR PLANS FOR 202 AND AGAIN I I MENTIONED THOSE ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS FOR CONOCOPHILLIPS THAT'S KINDA HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT GOING INTO NEXT YEAR YOU KNOW IT'S JUST NOT NOT COST OF SUPPLY BUT IT'S ALSO WHAT WHAT KIND OF CASH FLOW ARE WE PROJECTING TO TO MAKE AND UH YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE THE WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A VERY STRONG BALANCE SHEET SO WE CAN USE SOME OF THAT SHOULD WE NEED TO BUT Y- CERTAINLY WE'D BE ALSO TRYING TO BALANCE UH THE THE CASH WE'RE MAKING WITH THE CAPEX THAT WE'RE SPENDING AND THE AND THE DIVIDEND THAT UH TODAY UH UH SATISFIES 30% OF OUR RETURN CRITERIA AND MORE GIVEN THE KINDS OF PRICES THAT WE'RE SEEING SO CERTAINLY SOME HEADWINDS INTO THE UH COMMODITY PRICE OUTLOOK RIGHT NOW SOME UH YOU KNOW WITH COVID RESURGENCE SOME DEMAND CERTAINLY HASN'T STARTED TO RECOVER AND DEPENDING ON WHAT NOPEC OR OPEC DOES ON ON THE SUPPLY SIDE AND WHAT THE U.S. RESPONSE IS YOU KNOW WE'RE WATCHING ALL OF THAT REALLY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER PROGRAM WE PUT IN PLACE FOR ' 21 WE CAN BALANCE WITH THE CASH FLOWS THAT WE EXPECT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN THE LOWEST COST OF SUPPLY THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN THE PORTFOLIO ONLY THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM JOSH SILVERSTEIN FORM WOLFE RESEARCH PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN <INAUDIBLE> THANKS <INAUDIBLE> MAYBE JUST <INAUDIBLE> OFF THAT THAT LAST QUESTION THERE YOU MENTIONED THAT UM YOU KNOW FOR <INAUDIBLE> CAPEX IT WILL BE VERY SIMILAR UH ON THE YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS WHAT WOULD THE <INAUDIBLE> LOOK LIKE RELATIVE TO THE THE FOURTH QUARTER <INAUDIBLE> UH UNDER THAT SCENARIO UH YEAH JOSH THE THE THE WE WOULD WE WOULD BE WE WOULD EXPECT UNDER THAT SCENARIO TO BE UM SIMILAR TO FOURTH Q- OR SECOND HALF EH EH EH OF THE YEAR <INAUDIBLE> THAT THAT SORT OF LEVEL SO THAT WOULD BE R- ARE- ROUGHLY 4.3 IS WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THIS YEAR UM WHICH IS A BIT ABOVE OUR SUSTAINING CAPITAL UM THE THE SO SO LET LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THAT UP THE THE THE IT'S FLAT PRODUCTION AND YET ABOVE OUR SUSTAINING CAPITAL SO LET ME TRY AND MAYBE EXPLAIN WHY THAT'S DIFFERENT SO IF IF WE WERE IF WE WERE GONNA EXECUTE A LONG-TERM SUSTAINING STRATEGY FOR THE COMPANY UM THE THE WE NEED ABOUT 3.8 FOR FOR FOR FOR CONOCOPHILLIPS UH TO STAND-ALONE AND THAT WOULD SUSTAIN PRODUCTION A- A- AT  R- ROUGHLY YOU KNOW JUST BELOW 1.2 MILLIONS <INAUDIBLE> THE UH UM BUT BUT THE LOW COST OF SUPPLY THAT WE HAVE IN THE PORTFOLIO WE DON'T EXPECT OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGY WILL BE TO SIMPLY SUSTAIN PRODUCTION THE THE THE THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE ARE TOO COMPETITIVE FOR THAT BUT WHAT RYAN IS REALLY INDICATING IS THAT WE COULD EXECUTE A TACTICAL SUSTAINING PROGRAM MUCH LIKE WE HAVE THIS YEAR AND AND AND AND START 2020 WITH THAT SORT OF TACTICAL UM UH SUSTAINING PROGRAM AND THEN SEE HOW DEMAND RECOVERY AND SUPPLY RESPONSES SHAPE OUT AND WHAT PROBABLY THE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A S- TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC SUSTAINING PROGRAM IS IN A TACTIC SUSTAINING PROGRAM WE WOULD STILL KEEP UM PRODUCTION FLAT BUT WE WILL COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN UH PROJECTS LIKE WILLOW OUR EXPLORATION ACTIVITY UH THOSE THOSE THINGS WILL STILL CONTINUE LIKE WITH THE ANTICIPATION THAT THE UH ULTIMATELY WE'D MOVE AWAY FROM SIMPLY SUSTAINING UH BACK TO SOME MODEST GROWTH SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING THROUGH JUST NOW AND THE AND THE PLAN AND AS RYAN SAID WE WE YOU SHOULDN'T EXPECT US TO COMMUNICATE 2021 CAPITAL GUIDANCE CERTAINLY FOR THE COMBINED COMPANY TILL SOMETIME AFTER THE TRANSACTION CLOSED THANKS MATT THANKS <CROSSTALK> YEAH AND I WOULD YEAH AND I WOULD ADD ADD JOSH YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY WITH THE BALANCE SHEET WHICH IS WHY YOU KNOW IF WE GO IN AT A SIMILAR LEVEL OF CAPITAL TO THIS YEAR AND YOU KNOW AND MAYBE FLAT TO MODEST GROWTH SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARY EQUAL FLAT PRODUCTION AT THE AT THE CAPITAL LEVEL GOING IN NEXT YEAR BUT UH THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL WE'LL CONTINUE TO WATCH IS THAT IS THAT MACRO EVOLVES AROUND US Y- YES SIR AND THEN YOU MENTIONED THAT THE YOU KNOW THE LOWER 48 ASSETS ARE I GUESS UNCONVENTIONAL ASSETS ARE THE THE LOWEST EMISSION PART OF THE PORTFOLIO AND UH THE CONCHO ASSETS ONLY ADD TO THAT UH I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE HIGHEST EMISSION ASSET AND DOES ANY SORT OF YOU KNOW <INAUDIBLE> FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO UM DO YOU THINK ABOUT <INAUDIBLE> IN IN THAT REGARD AS WELL AS MAYBE THOSE ARE <INAUDIBLE> CANDIDATES THAT KIND OF ACCELERATES THE GOAL TOWARDS GETTING TO YOUR YOUR 2030 PATH YES SO THE THE THE THE HIGHEST EMISSIONS ASSETS ON THE PORTFOLIO <INAUDIBLE> IN THE OPERATING PORTFOLIO IS REALLY IS UH OIL SANDS THE THAT'S WHY WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON ON UH LOOKING AT WAYS TO BRING OIL SANDS'S EMISSIONS DOWN AND UH AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF UH <INAUDIBLE> IN THE FILE THERE UM WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA EXTEND OUR NON-CONDENSABLE GAS INJECTION WHICH BRINGS DOWN STEAM-OIL RATIO UH BY KEEPING HEAT IN THE RESERVOIR AND OF COURSE IT'S THE STEAM-OIL RATIO THAT THAT THAT DRIVES THE THE EMISSION INTENSITY EH WE'RE ALSO GONNA BE DEPLOYING UM MORE UH UH OF THESE FULL-CONTROL DEVICES THAT BRING THAT BRINGS THE STEAM-OIL RATIO DOWN WE'RE MOVING TO UH ADD SOME SUSTAINING PADS AS SOME OF PADS GET OLDER THE STEAM-OIL RATIO INCREASES WHEN YOU PUT NEW PADS ON THE <INAUDIBLE> WILL BE VERY LOW STEAM-OIL RATIO AND THERE'S OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THERE AS WELL SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING BASICALLY ACROSS THE BOARD IS WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR UM UH UH GREENHOUSE GASES INTENSITY ACROSS EVERY ASSET THAT WE HAVE AND WERE ASKING OURSELVES WHAT CAN WE DO UM TO COST EFFECTIVELY BRING THAT DOWN THE THE UH AND THAT'S WHAT OUR WE BRING THAT PROCESS TOGETHER IN WHAT WE CALL OUR MARGINAL ABATEMENT COST CURVE UM AND UH WE HAVE ABOUT 100 PROJECTS IN THERE JUST NOW LIKE SOME OF THEM DESKTOP EXERCISES <INAUDIBLE> THEY ARE FEASIBILITY STUDIES UH WE SPENT ABOUT $90 MILLION THIS YEAR BETWEEN CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS ON THOSE PROJECTS UM THEY ARE UM BUT BUT WE LOOK ACROSS THE ASSET BASE TO TRY AND FIND WAYS TO BRING THAT DOWN AND OUR TARGETS JOSH YOU KNOW THAT WE ESTABLISHED THE 35-45 % REDUCTION THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE MAJOR PORTFOLIO CHANGES TO GO DO THAT SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HAVING TO SELL CERTAIN ASSETS THAT THAT MATT DESCRIBED THAT'S THAT'S THINGS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED INSIDE THE PORTFOLIO TO WORK ON WITH THE PORTFOLIO BEING RELATIVELY CONSTANT OVER THIS TIME YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY THAT'S A GOOD POINT RYAN IT'S MOSTLY DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT WE'RE UH S- S- S- STRATEGIC <INAUDIBLE> WHERE WE'RE INVESTING WE'RE INVESTING IN LOWER UH CAP- UH UH GREENHOUSE GAS INTENSITY PLACES LIKE THE UNCONVENTIONALS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA UM UH LIKE WILLOW UP IN ALASKA IT'S VERY LOW INTENSITY AS WELL SO THE PERCENTAGE OF OF PRODUCTION THAT'S VERY LOW INTENSITY INCREASES WITH TIME AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH REDUCING THE EMISSIONS AND TRANSFER THE EXISTING ASSETS LIKE THE OIL SANDS UH THAT'S HOW WE DELIVER THE THE UH UH THE REDUCTION IN UH EMISSIONS INTENSITY OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UH- <CROSSTALK> AND WE'VE SAID THAT IT'S IT'S AND MATT DESCRIBED SORT OF THE THE COST AND CAPITAL IS IS IS SMALL AMOUNTS TO GET TO <INAUDIBLE> WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN DOLLARS CAPITAL TO GO TO DELIVER THIS THIS IS UH SMALL PROJECTS THAT UH THAT ARE CURRENTLY BAKED INTO OUR PLANS THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM RODGER REED FROM WELLS FARGO PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN HEY THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MORNING RODGER JUST UH I'D LIKE TO TO KICK ON REALLY KIND OF A FOLLOW UP OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH JOSH THERE AS YOU THINK ABOUT ' 21 CAPEX ROUGHLY APPLIED YOU SAID YOU KNOW YOU OUGHT TO BE NIMBLE NEXT FOR FOR HAT COMES WHAT UH WHAT WILL BE THE THINGS YOU WOULD LOOKING AT I MEAN PRESUMABLY NOT SIMPLY OIL PRICE UP OR DOWN I MEAN IT'S I ASSUME IT'S SOME MACRO FACTORS UM MAYBE HELP US KIND OF UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE SIGNALS YOU MIGHT LOOK FOR FOR GETTING MORE OPTIMISTIC IN ' 2 YEAH I MEAN IT WOULD IT WOULD BE UH MACRO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO SEE HOW THE UH UH HOW THE DEMAND RESPONDS TO YOU KNOW WHAT LOOKS LIKE UH UH THE SLOWER RESPONSE THAN PEOPLE WERE HOPING FOR UM AND ESPECIALLY WITH EUROPE AND POSSIBLY THE U.S COMING SO WE WE HAVE TO JUST BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT WE HAVE LOOK AT HOW THE UH THE RUSSIAN AND OPEC CAN RESPOND I MEAN THEY THEY THEY THE HAVE A <INAUDIBLE> COMING UP IN THE END OF NOVEMBER UH AND SEE I MAY GO BACK TO SORT OF DRAWING THE THE INVENTORY SO THE BEAUTY OF OUR POSITION IS THAT WE'VE GOT INCREDIBLE FLEXIBILITY WE'VE GOT THE LOW A LOW BREAKEVEN PRICE TO COVER YOU KNOW FOR FLAT PRODUCTION AND UH TO COVER THE DIVIDENDS UH THAT'S SUSTAINED WHEN WE PUT THE TWO COMPANIES TOGETHER UM SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING THAT FLEXIBILITY AND ABILITY TO RESPOND TO UM FOR THE MARKET <INAUDIBLE> IS UH IS VERY HELPFUL SO WE'RE NOT GONNA RUSH HEADLONG INTO INTO TRYING TO GROWN PRODUCTION <INAUDIBLE> THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO US WE'LL SEE HOW THINGS PLAY HERE OVER THE NEXT UH YOU KNOW SEVERAL MONTHS AND THEN WE'LL MAKE WE'LL MAKE ADJUSTMENT THE THE THE THE BETWEEN OUR LOW BREAKEVEN AND OUR BALANCE SHEET WE'LL BE IN WE'LL BE IN VERY GOOD SHAPE TO TO TO TO ASSESS THAT AS WE GO THROUGH <CROSSTALK> SORRY I WOULD ADD RODGER THAT UH WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT SO MUCH EVEN JUST WHAT WHAT'S THE STRIP LOOK LIKE AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FOR NEXT YEAR IT UH IT'S IT'S SORT OF THE LONGER TERM TRAJECTORY BACK TO WHAT WHAT WE BELIEVE IS IS A REASONABLE MID-CYCLE PRICE AND WE'LL WE'LL BE REASSESSING WHAT THAT MID-CYCLE LOOKS LIKE DEPENDING ON WHERE THE DEMAND AND SUPPLY FUNDAMENTALS START TO KINDA SHAKE OUT WITH THE U.S. TIDAL GOING DOWN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ELECTION IN IN ALASKA AND THEN IT'S GONNA MAKE IT'S GONNA MAKE IMMINENT AMOUNT OF SENSE AS WE COMBINE WITH CONCHO TO TO OPTIMIZE AND AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WHAT THE RIGHT LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IS BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES SO THERE'S YOU YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT WE'LL BE PUTTING INTO THE MIX AS WE LOOK AT NOT ONLY AT 2021 PLANS BUT BUT THEN COUPLE OR THREE YEARS LOOK LIKE AS WE AS THIS BUSINESS RECOVERS BACK TO A MID-CYCLE AND WHETHER IT OVERSHOOTS OR UNDERSHOOTS WELL IT'S THE OIL INDUSTRY SO IT WILL DEFINITELY DO ONE OR THE OTHER AND MAYBE BOTH UM ONE QUICK UH KIND OF FOLLOW UP UNRELATED TO THE FIRST QUESTION BUT RELATED TO THE MERGER SOME OF THE SAVINGS UH THAT YOU P- THAT YOU CITED WERE GONNA BE YOU KNOW UH EXPLORATION APPRAISAL SPENDING THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN I WAS CURIOUS FOR THE ASSETS THAT YOU WON'T BE SPENDING E & A MONEY ON IN THE NEAR FUTURE DO THEY JUST GO BACK INTO THE RESOURCE BASE OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT MAYBE BECOMES MORE LIKELY TO BE UH DISPOSED OF YOU KNOW OR MONETIZED UH IN A DIFFERENT WAY YEAH RODGER IT'S DOMINIC HERE THANK YOU SO UH WHAT WE SAID WAS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE FOCUSING OUR EXPLORATION EFFORT ON OUR EXISTING BUSINESS UNITS SUCH AS ALASKA NORWAY AND MALAYSIA SO THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ABOUT HALF OUR EXPLORATION CAPITAL FROM 300 -15 SO THOSE THOSE UH AREAS SUCH AS UH YOU KNOW DOWN IN SOUTH AMERICA COLOMBIA ARGENTINA AND SO ONE WE WILL BE WORKING SORT OF MANAGED EXISTS FROM THOSE AREAS OF COURSE WE HAVE A LOT OF VALUE THERE WE SEE A LOT OF VALUE THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD GOOD ACREAGE THERE BUT UM WE'LL BE WORKING TO UH PRESERVE VALUE AS WE THINK ABOUT UH HOW HOW TO UM UH YOU KNOW EXIT THOSE AREAS IN IN THE FUTURE SO MORE A QUESTION OF UH DISPOSITIONS IN A MANAGED WAY RATHER THAN THOSE RESOURCES STAYING IN THE PORTFOLIO WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG PORTFOLIO WE WILL WITH PONCHO UH YOU KNOW THAT UH WE JUST THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE FOCUS THE EXPLORATION EFFORT AND WE MANAGE THOSE <CROSSTALK> WHERE THERE THERE'S NOT THE- THERE'S NOT EXCESSIVE CAPITAL EMPLOYED ASSOCIATED WITH UH THOSE ASSETS BUT WE'LL AS DOMINIC SAID WE'LL WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MONETIZE THEM AS AS BEST WE CAN AND AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY RESOURCE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THOSE ASSETS ON THE MOMENT A- A- A- ON OUR SUPPLY CURVE THERE'S NO RESOURCE ASSOCIATED WITH <INAUDIBLE> THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM SCOTT HANOLD FROM RBC CAPITAL MARKETS PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN THANKS UH COULD COULD YOU GIVE US SOME COLOR ON YOU KNOW NA- U.S. NATURAL GAS PRICE HAS BEEN PRETTY STRONG AND AND IS THERE ABILITY FOR CONOCO TO FLEX YOU KNOW FOR THAT A LITTLE BIT OR IS THERE YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE WHERE IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY OUTSIDE OF ASSOCIATED OR OR IS THAT REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY YEAH I THINK THE OP- MAIN OPPORTUNITY WITH US SCOTT IS ASSOCIATED GAS WE PROBABLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT IN THE ANADARKO BASIN BUT THAT'S NOT CAPTURING A LOT OF OUR CAPITAL RIGHT NOW SO UM IT IT MOSTLY FOR US WE'RE STILL A PRETTY BIG UH UH BIG MARKETER SO WE UH WE WERE MOVING YOU KNOW OVER 8 BCF OF GAS A DAY SO WE SEE SEE A LOT OF THAT SO WE'RE GETTING WE'RE GETTING SOME UP UPLIFT ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE OF BUSINESS WITH SOME OF THE TRANSPORT CAPACITY WE HAVE THAT TAKES GAS FROM THAT TAKES GAS FROM THE PERMIAN TO THE WEST COAST AND DOW- DOWN SOUTH TO ARIZONA AND EVEN EVEN INTO MEXICO SO THAT'S HOW WE'RE KIND OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OF THE KIND OF MARKET AS WE SEE IT TODAY AND BUT ON JUST ON ABSOLUTE PRODUCTION SIDE WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO RAMP UP YOU KNOW DRY GAS AND IT'S MOSTLY COMING FROM THE ASSOCIATED GAS WITH THE THE UNCONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION YEAH COULD D- DO DO YOU COULD YOU QUANTIFY SOME OF THE MARKETING YOU KNOW BENEFITS YOU ALL SEE <INAUDIBLE> LET BILL UH HE'S HEARD OF OUR COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION TO MAYBE PROVIDE A BIT OF COLOR THERE YEAH SURE SO UH UM SCOTT WE WE HAVE A VERY ACTIVE COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION RYAN MENTIONED THAT WE'RE MOVING A LITTLE OVER 8 BCF A DAY WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST GAS MARKETER IN THE U.S. AND WE PROVIDE A VARIETY OF SERVICES TO UM VARIOUS CUSTOMERS RANGING FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS TO TO OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS AND THAT'S PROVIDES AN ABILITY TO ONE HAVE INSIGHT INTO THE MARKET AND ALSO TO GAIN MARGIN ACROSS MOVING ACROSS PIPELINES SO WE WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT AND CONTINUE TO MOVE AND WE WE'RE SHIPPING GAS FOR A A A A PROFIT UH SO YOU KNOW OUT OF THAT 800 EIGHT 8 BCF A DAY YOU KNOW 500 MILLION CUBIC FEET A DAY OF IT I- IS OURS THE REST OF IT IS THIRD PARTY VOLUME AND SO WE'RE IN AND OUT THE MARKET ON BOTH SIDES ON A DAILY BASIS THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FORM DOUG LEGGATE FROM BANK OF AMERICA PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN OH THANKS GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY UM I WONDER UH BILL MAYBE I COULD START OFF WITH YOU AND AS YOU TO MAYBE ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON RYAN'S COMMENTS AROUND THE POTENTIAL ELECTION OUTCOMES AND I'M THINKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TAX UM I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE LOOKED AT THIS BUT THE THING THAT STRIKES ME AS A LITTLE BIT DISTURBING IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A MINIMUM 15% P & L TAX THAT PUTS IN WELLS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW UNDER A BIT OF SPOTLIGHT I'M JUST WONDERING HAVE THOUGHT ANY WAY ABOUT THAT ANY SCENARIOS THAT YOU'VE RUN UH OUTCOMES THAT YOU MAY EXPECT YEAH SURE UM WE'VE CERTAINLY TAKEN A LOOK A- A- AT THE VARIOUS TAX PROPOSALS OUT THERE INCLUDING THE BIDEN TAX PROPOSAL THERE'S THERE'S TWO PRIMARY ELEMENTS OF THAT THAT THAT WOULD IMPACT US DOUG AND THE FIRST ONE IS OBVIOUS THE CHANGE IN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 21-28 % AND THE SECOND ONE THAT WOULD BE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT WOULD BE REMOVAL OF IDCS PARTICULARLY IN OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM A- A- AND NEEDING TO UH DEPRECIATE THOSE OVERTIME THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN ASPECTS AS WE LOOK THROUGH IT THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON US YEAH I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARER I WAS TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND UH M- MAYBE AS A AS A FOLLOW UP AND I AND I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS IS A LITTLE TOO OBVIOUS BUT WE DON'T MAYBE ASK IT ENOUGH RYAN WHEN WHEN YOURSELF AND WHEN MATT PUT TOGETHER THE TIDAL WAVE SCENARIOS AND ALL THE OTHER SCENARIOS THAT UH THAT YOU LAID OUT AT THE STRATEGY DAY UM WE'VE NOW SEEN WHAT WE THINK IS A LOT OF SIGNS OF A BOTTOM YOU KNOW CYCLE TO COMING TO A A A BOTTOM IF YOU LIKE WITH CONSOLIDATION YOURSELVES BEING PART OF THAT HOW HOW DOES THIS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW BEYOND COVID UM INFLUENCE YOUR THOUGHTS ON LONGER TERMS SUPPLY/DEMAND AS YOU THINK ABOUT SCENARIO PLANNING I'LL LEAVE IT THERE THANKS YEAH THANK DOUG I'LL MAYBE ADD A FEW COMMENTS AND MATT CAN JUMP IN AS AS WELL BUT UH YEAH WE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE TRAJECTORY OF THE RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE AND PROBABLY A COUPLE OF COMPETING FACTORS WE CERTAINLY UH SEE DEMAND RECOVERY WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER IT GETS FULLY BACK TO 100 MILLION BARRELS A DAY BUT UH PROBABLY TAKING A A BIT OF UH BIT OF TIME TO TO GET THERE AND THEN UH I THINK EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND MAYBE OVERLOOKED A LITTLE BIT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE SUPPLY SIDE MAYBE MASKED A LITTLE BIT TODAY BY DARK INVENTORY BUT UM YOU KNOW WHEN THE DECLINES AND THE DECLINES ARE HITTING IN AND IT WAS MASKED BY CURTAILMENTS COMING BACK ON YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE A DROP IN U.S. SUPPLY AS WELL SO I CAN MATT CAN PROBABLY CHIME IN AND UH DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NET EFFECT TO UH THE SCENARIOS THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT AS WE UH DEBATE OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM AND HOW MUCH TO TO PUT BACK TO WORK YEAH DOUG IF I MEAN THE THE I THINK YOU AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS IN THE PAST THAT THE UH IF YOU LOOK AT THE UH OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE EXIT RATE FOR THIS YEAR FOR U.S. TIGHT OIL IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 6.5 AND 7 MILLION BARRELS A DAY AND THE <INAUDIBLE> CALIBRATION ON THAT <INAUDIBLE> AS WE APPROACH THE END OF THE YEAR SO THAT COMPARE TO OVER 8 MILLION BARRELS A DAY IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR 8.2 UM AND AND AND TO SOME EXTENT THAT THAT DROP FLATTERS TO DECEIVE BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE STILL BRI- BRINGING WELLS ON IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND INTO THE SECOND QUARTER AT THE UH SO THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT UNDERLYING DECLINE GOING ON HERE IF WE MODEL THIS <INAUDIBLE> THE THE STRIP PRICE IS IN THE IN THE LOW 40S UM WE THINK THE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN FLAT PRODUCTION AT DECEMBER'S RATES THROUGH ' 21 AND INTO ' 2 ' 21 WILL GET A BIT OF LIFT FROM THE DUCKS AND BUT THE BUT BUT IF <INAUDIBLE> IS GOING LIVE WITHIN CASH FLOW THERE'S GONNA BE A REAL CHALLENGE <INAUDIBLE> TO UM TO SEE TIGHT OIL AT 7 MILLION BARRELS A DAY AND THIS IS LIKELY TO BE LESS THAN THAT IN 2021 AND 202 IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE TRAJECTORY WE WERE ON THAT'S AT LEAST 4 MILLION BARRELS A DAY LESS THAN THE PRE- COVID TREND AND THAT'S JUST U.S. TIGHT OIL UM WE RESPOND MORE QUICKLY HERE BECAUSE OF THE DECLINE RATES AND THE CAPITAL FLEXIBILITY BUT THAT BUT THE SIMILAR ISSUES ARE HAPPENING ELSEWHERE SO ALSO- ALTHOUGH THERE'S DEFINITELY UNCERTAINTY ON HOW MUCH THE DEMAND EFFECT WILL BE UM IT'S LIKELY TO BE LESS OF A DEMAND EFFECT THAN A SUPPLY EFFECT CERTAINLY OVER NEXT FEW YEARS SO THE THE THE PREMISE OF YOUR QUESTION INITIALLY YOUR ARE WE SETTING UP FOR THE BOTTOM OF A CYCLE HERE UH W- W- W- IT CERTAINLY FEELS THAT WAY BECAUSE AND THE NOW EXACTLY WHEN IT TURNS WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON THE UM UH UH DEMAND AND AND THE COVID AND HOW WHAT OPEC DO IN THE SHORT-TERM BUT THE WE'RE CERTAINLY SETTING UP FOR A TIGHT TIGHTER SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCE IN A YEAR OR SO UH IF NOT BEFORE THAT YEAH SO SO SHORT/MEDIUM-TERM ALL ABOUT DEMAND MEDIUM/LONGER-TERM YOU KNOW UH SUPPLY STARTS TO ENTER THE PICTURE AS MATT DESCRIBED AND HUH WE HAVE A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF TWO/THREE SCENARIOS AROUND HOW WE HOW WE THINK WITH THAT SLOPE IN UH TRAJECTORY LOOKS LIKE THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM PAUL CHENG FROM SCOTIABANK PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN HEY GUYS GOOD MORNING UH- MORNING PAUL ONE IS THAT UH MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CURVE BALL HERE UH IF WE LOOK AT TRADING AND OPTIMIZATION OR COMMERCIAL OPERATION HISTORICALLY THAT U.S. LOOKING AT THAT AT A COST CENTER MAINLY FOR FACILITATION THE EUROPEANS ON THE OTHER HAND TAKE A MORE AGGRESSIVE AND LOOKING AT IT AS A PROFIT CENTER UH AND THEY SEEMS DOING QUITE WELL AND HAVE A GOOD LOGIC TO TRADE AROUND YOUR PHYSICAL ASSETS SO FROM THAT STAND POINT UH WILL CONOCO UH SHOULD LOOK AT THAT OPERATION AND SEE WHETHER THAT IT WILL ALLOW YOU UH TO HAVE A HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER RETURN OR THAT YOU THINK UH FACILITATION IS BETTER AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE ON THAT SWING IN EARNINGS UH AND A HIGHER RISK SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION UH THE SECOND QUESTION UH WITH THE UH LET'S FOR ARGUMENT SAY IF YOU DECIDE UH YOUR LONGER TERM 10 YEAR PLAN HAS CHANGED DUE TO DIFFERENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THAT SUCH THAT YOUR FUTURE GROWTH RATE IS GOING TO BE LOWER WITH THE ADDITION OF THE CONCHO ASSETS WHAT OTHER ASSET IN YOUR PORTFOLIO UH WOULD TAKE MORE OF THE BACK SEAT AND SEEING LESSER CAPITAL INVESTMENT UH YOU YOU CAN SAY SAY THE UH THE NUMBER ONE NUMBER ON TWO ON THAT UH IF THAT'S POSSIBLE THANK YOU YEAH SO LET ME TAKE THE THE FIRST ONE AND UH MAYBE MATT CAN CHIME IN ON THE SECOND ONE ON THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT SO THE FIRST ONE YEAH YEAH WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COMMERCIAL SPACE AND WITH THE ADDITION OF CONCHO YOU KNOW IT IS A AS YOU DESCRIBED PAUL KIND OF A COST CENTER INSIDE OF THE COMPANY BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT EXPANDING THAT UH YOU KNOW AS WE THINK ABOUT THE THE FUTURE AND WHAT THE CONCHO ASSETS BRINGS I THINK AS DOMINIC DESCRIBED EARLIER THEY THEY SELL MOSTLY AT THE WELLHEADS SO WE'VE GOT SOME OPPORTUNITY TO ADD VALUE THERE TO BOTH THE GAS AND THE OIL SIDE UM WE'RE BUILDING MORE EXPORT CAPACITY AS A COMPANY AND UH AND IN FACT WE'VE DONE SOME SALES TO UH POINT SALES TO CUSTOMERS WHERE WE TAKE THE MIDDLE MAN OUT OF THE EQUATION AND WE FOUND THAT QUITE MARGIN ENHANCING AS WE GO FORWARD AS WELL SO WITH THE GROWING U.S. PRODUCTION UH THAT WE WOULD HAVE WITH THE COMBINATION WITH CONCHO IT ABSOLUTELY REPRESENTS A UH UH A BIG PART OF UH OF HOW WE CAN EXPAND THE COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION AND THINK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY TOO I MEAN BILL DESCRIBED THE MARKET SHARE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY AND UH THAT'S ONLY GONNA GET UH BIGGER AS AS WE GO FORWARD SO UH WE'RE LOOKING FOR MORE CONTRIBUTION FROM THE UH THE COMMERCIAL SIDE ACROSS THE WHOLE WHOLE PORTFOLIO UH MAYBE MATT IF YOU WANNA TAKE THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION AS A RESULT OF UH INTEGRATING THE CONCHO ASSETS YOU KNOW AGAIN I GOT BACK TO UH IT'S A IT'S A COST OF SUPPLY PRIMARY CRITERIA BUT MATT CAN PROVIDE A BIT MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT WHAT MIGHT FALL OUT YEAH PAUL A- THE THE THE AS YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO IS WE TRY TO OPTIMIZE EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL EACH OF AN INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF A PORTFOLIO UH TO GET THE OPTIMUM PIECE UM USING A A SET OF DECISION CRITERIA BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA INVEST ABOVE AN INCREMENTAL COST OF SUPPLY OF $40 A BARREL AND WE DESCRIBED THAT UH AT SOME LENGTH BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR AND SO WE LOOK AT THE OPTIMIZATION OF EACH AND THEN WE PUT IT TOGETHER AND WE UH AND WE MAYBE MAKE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS BUT WE'RE TRYING TO HONOR THE OPTIMUM IN EACH OF THE ASSETS UM NOW THERE IS FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO IN THE PACE YOU CAN WE CAN ADJUST THE PACE OF ANY GIVEN PROJECT BY YOU KNOW SO WE CAN ADJUST UH THE THE RATE OF WHICH WE INCREASE THE RAMP AND THE NUMBER OF RIGS SO I WOULDN'T CALL OUT ANY SPECIFIC ASSET IF WE DECIDE THAT WE WANT TO GROW AT 2% INSTEAD OF 4% OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE UH THEN THERE'S FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO TO DO THAT AND UH AND STILL HONOR OUR OUR OUR CRITERIA THAT THAT WOULDN'T BUST THE CRITERIA THE OBVIOUS PLACES ARE LOWER 48 TO ALASKA THAT'S WHERE THE FLEXIBILITY MOSTLY EXISTS AND UH MAYBE IN IN CANADA AS WELL BUT I WOULDN'T UM I WOULDN'T REALLY CALL IT A SPECIFIC ASSET WE WE WE WE'RE TRYING TO DO AN WE'RE TRYING TO OPTIMIZE ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO BUT THE THE ISSUE IS IF IF YOU'RE NOT OPTIMIZING ACROSS A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO THEN YOU'RE UH YOU'RE NOT MAXIMIZING THE VALUE THAT THE DIVERSIFICATION BRINGS YOU SO WE WE WE UH UH WE'RE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE RUNNING EACH OF THESE ASSETS AT THEIR OPTIMUM THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FORM JEOFFREY LAMBUJON FROM TUDOR PICKERING PLEASE GO AHEAD YOU LINE IS OPEN GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS UH MY FIRST ONE IS ON ESG AND THE THE PARIS-ALIGNED CLIMATE RISK STRATEGY AND I I THINK YOUR COMMENTARY EARLIER ANSWERED A LOT OF WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW WITH THE OIL SANDS SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AND AND JUST YOUR COMMENTS ON INVESTMENTS DECISIONS UH BUT IS THERE ANYTHING INCREMENTAL YOU CAN SHARE AT THIS POINT ON ON OTHER OPERATIONAL CHANGES THAT YOU'RE UNDERTAKING UH AND FOCUSING ON FOR THE THE BROADER PORTFOLIO JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE FOR THE THE SCOPE OF SOME OF THESE PROJECTS YOU'VE MENTIONED AGAIN IN TERMS OF WHAT'S IN FOCUS WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW NEW TECHNOLOGY AROUND MONITORING UH RETROFITTING EQUIPMENT FOR EMISSIONS CONTROL OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU YEAH THANKS IT'S DOMINIC HERE I'LL JUST UH TAKE THAT YOU KNOW UH YOU KNOW RECENTLY I I I WAS UH PRETTY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE LOWER 48 AND AND THERE'S SOME REALLY UM SOME SOME IMPORTANT PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING THERE I THINK UM YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE WE WE UH A- ANNOUNCED A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE ALONG WITH OUR NEW UH PARIS-ALIGNED STRATEGY ONE WAS UM YOU YOU KNOW UH COMMITMENT TO ZERO ROUTINE FLARING AND THAT'S THE WORLD BANK INITIATIVE THERE SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AND THE OTHER WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF UH CONTINUOUS METHANE MONITORING SO THIS IS A REAL BREAK THROUGH FOR US WE'RE ABLE TO DO NOW THIS NOW AT A VERY REASONABLE COST AND WE'RE ABLE TO NOW BASICALLY UM UH ON OUR KEY SITES WE'LL HAVE THIS IMPLEMENTED AND G- WE'LL HAVE ABOUT 65% OF OUR LOWER 48 PRODUCTION COVERED UM BY EARLY NEXT YEAR AND THIS TECHNOLOGY AT VERY LOW COST ALLOWS US TO UH SAMPLE THE EMISSIONS AROUND SITES UH LOOKING FOR METHANE EVERY 15 SECONDS AND FROM THAT WE CAN RESPOND VERY QUICKLY TO ANY UH ABERRATIONS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS VERY QUICKLY SO THE- THE- THOSE ARE UM A COUPLE OF REALLY IMPORTANT INITIATIVES FOR US THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT OVERALL UH COMMITMENT WE HAVE TO REDUCE UM OUR GHG INTENSITY BY 35-45 % UH BY 203 AND WE'RE REALLY A FAST MOVER ON THIS AS YOU KNOW UM JEOFF YOU KNOW UH WE WERE THE FIRST U.S. BASED OIL G- OIL AND GAS COMPANY TO SET A GHG INTENSITY TARGET AND WERE THE FIRST U.S. BASED OIL AND GAS COMPANY TO UH TO COMMIT TO BEING PARIS-ALIGNED THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FORM PAVEL MOLCHANOV FROM RAYMOND JAMES PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN THANKS FOR THE QUESTION UH TWO QUICK ONES BOTH UH REGARDING EUROPE UH GUESS IT'S ABOUT 10% OF YOUR GAS VOLUMES YOU KNOW N- N- NO ONE IS ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING NORTH SEA GAS PRICES BELOW $3 AN MCF BUT WE'VE HAD THAT THE LAST TWO QUARTERS UH IS THAT A IS THAT COVID RELATED UH DEMAND SITUATION OR IS THERE SOMETHING MORE STRUCTURAL IN THAT MARKET UH I I THINK THAT THIS IS BILL I THINK THAT AS YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S MORE OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH COVID RELATED DEMAND RELATED ISSUES RIGHT NOW AS WE THINK LONG-TERM THE MACRO SUPPLY AROUND THE WORLD UH WE WE WE WOULD SEE MARKETS UH TEND TO MORE ARBITRAGE OFF OF THE U.S. GULF COAST WITH LNG MARKETS UH STARTING TO MOVE VOLUMES BOTH INTO EUROPE AND INTO ASIA AS THE INCREMENTAL BARREL SO I I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IT IS A SHORT-TERM RESPONSE TO SUPPLY/DEMAND AND NOT A LONG-TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGE OKAY AND TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT UM IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS THE EUROPEAN CLIMATE LAW WILL BE APPROVED BY THE EU LEADERS WHICH WILL MAKE THE NORTH SEA THE THE ONE PART OF YOUR PORTFOLIO THAT THAT IS COVERED BY A A NET-ZERO MANDATE DOES THAT CHANGE ANYTHING IN TERMS OF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT ASSET GIVEN THE DE-CARBONIZATION TARGETS UH FOR UH THE EU AS A WHOLE NO NOT NOT REALLY I THINK WE'RE CONTINUING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS BUT WHAT WE'RE LEFT WITH IN THE EUROPE PORTFOLIO IS OUR NORWEGIAN ASSETS AND UH YOU KNOW IT'S SOME OF THE LOWEST CARBON INTENSITY ASSETS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE OFF SHORE AND AND LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS TO CONTINUE TO UH REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS THROUGH ELECTRIFICATION AND UH ADDITIONS THERE BUT AS WE LOOK AT IT IT'S IT'S IT'S MINIMAL ADDITION TO THE COST OF SUPPLY AND IT'S QUITE MANAGEABLE AND NORWAY IS STILL IS VERY COMPETITIVE IN THE PORTFOLIO SINARA THIS IS ELLEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE OUR LAST QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM PHILIPS JOHNSTON FROM CAPITAL ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN HEY GUYS THANKS JUST ONE QUESTION FROM ME AND IT RELATES TO YOUR FUTURE RETURN UH OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS UM IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS YOU GUYS HAVE REPURCHASED A LITTLE OVER $10 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF AROUND $62 A SHARE BUT AT TODAY'S SHARE PRICE THE PAPER LOSS ON THAT PROGRAM IS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL UM I REALIZE YOU GUYS PLAN TO REPURCHASE MORE STOCK HERE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER BUT I WANTED TO ASK IF THERE'S ANY APPETITE AT THE BOARD LEVEL TO UH S- TO SCRAP THE IDEA OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND INSTEAD UH PURSUE A FIXED PLUS VARIABLE DIVIDEND STRATEGY UH THAT WOULD TARGET PAYING OUT A A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF YOUR FREE CASH FLOW DIRECTLY TO SHAREHOLDERS EACH QUARTERS YEAH I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS YOUR LAST PIECE OF THAT WHERE WE ARE TARGETING OVER 30% OF CASH BACK TO THE SHAREHOLDER THAT'S WHAT WE'VE COMMITTED TO AND DELIVERED ON IN EXCESS OVER THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS SINCE WE KINDA CAME OUT TO RE-ESTABLISH A NEW VALUE PROPOSITION FOR THIS BUSINESS AND I THINK THE DIVIDEND TODAY IS CERTAINLY COVERING A A LARGE SHARE OF THAT ALSO THINK THAT BUYING OUR SHARES BACK AT THIS KIND OF LEVEL IS IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO TOO BECAUSE UH SHARES ARE CERTAINLY WELL UNDERVALUED AND CERTAINLY RELATIVE TO WHERE WE THINK THAT CYCLE PRICE SHOULD BE SO I DON'T THINK WE'LL GIVE UP ON SHARE REPURCHASES COMPLETELY YOU MADE A REAL POINT I MEAN WE WE WANTED TO BUY BUY OUR SHARES THROUGH THROUGH THE CYCLE AND UH THIS WAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN WITH CURTAILED PRODUCTION AND AND THE LIKE GOING ON IN THE SECOND QUARTER SO WE DID SUSPEND FOR FOR A WHILE WE WANTED TO RESTART UP BECAUSE THE THE BENEFIT TO REALLY BUYING YOUR SHARES IN NOT JUST BUY THEM WHEN YOU'RE AT AT AT AT MID-CYCLE PRICE BUT CONTINUE TO BUY THEM THROUGH THE LOW LOW LOW END OF THE CYCLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BRINGS DOWN THE AVERAGE COST OF YOUR YOUR SHARES OBVIOUSLY SO WE STILL THINK IT UH IT'S GONNA BE

A description of the risks associated with forward-looking statements and other important information about the proposed transaction can be found in today's press release. All of which are incorporated by reference for purposes of this call. We will also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today and reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures. GAP MEASURE CAN BE FOUND IN THIS MORNING'S PRESS RELEASE AND ALSO ON OUR WEBSITE THANK YOU AND NOW I WILL TURN THE CALL OVER TO RYAN THANK YOU HELLEN AND GOOD MORNING TO OUR LISTENERS BEFORE WE GET INTO OUR THIRD QUARTER RESULTS I'LL TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO ADDRESS LAST WEEK'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF OUR COMBINATION WITH CONCHA RESOURCES WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO THE MARKET OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT THE FE TO OUR TRANSACTION DECK FOR CLARIFICATION TODAY'S CALL IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON OUR CONVERSATIONS AND REITERATE THE COMPELLING MERITS OF THE TRANSACTION FOR BOTH SETS OF SHAREHOLDERS I'LL START AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OUR ANNOUNCED TRANSACTION WITH KONCHO COMBINES TWO WIDELY RECOGNIZED LEADERS IN THE SECTOR KONICO FILPS HAS BEEN A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN THE RETURNS ON AND RETURNS OF CAPITAL MODEL FOR THE BUSINESS AND KONCHO HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THE PYRMONIAN PURE PLAY CLASS YET WHILE WE'RE BOTH BEST IN CLASS COMPANIES ON A STANDALONE BASIS BY SCALING UP OUR EXISTING RETURNS FOCUSED BUSINESS MODEL WE ARE STRONGER AND MORE INVESTIBLE WITHIN THE SECTOR CHARACTERIZED BY FREQUENT PRICE CYCLES INDUSTRY MATURITY CAPITAL INTENSITY AND EG FOCUS WILL BE A NEARLY SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR ENTERPRISE THAT IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO CREATE SUSTAINED VALUE BY EMBRACING WHAT WE BELIEVE ESSENTIAL FUTURE MANDATE FOR OUR SECTOR AND THESE MANDATE ARE FIRST PROVIDING AFFORDABLE ENERGY TO THE WORLD, SECOND COMMITTED TO Y S G EXCELLENCE, AND THIRD DELIVERING COMPETITIVE RETURNS WE BELIEVE THE TRANSACTION ACCELERATES OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY DELIVER ON ALL THREE OF THESE MANDATE THAT'S HOW WE WILL WIN NOW LET ME TAKE THESE MANDATE ONE BY ONE IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR TRANSACTION IN ALL FUTURE ENERGY SCENARIOS In areas, we know the world will need hydrocarbons as part of the energy mix for a long time even as we see increasing adoption of low carbon energy sources. However, we also recognize that the energy transition means the winners will be those companies with resources that can be affordably developed in a transition in any transition scenario, including a less than two degrees scenario. That's the reason we've always been committed to having the lowest cost supply resource base in the industry. The company will have a twenty three billion barrel resource base for the cost of supply less than forty dollars a barrel. Conoco gets the benefits of our global, diverse and lower capital intensity portfolio attributes. ConocoPhillips gets the benefit of adding some of the best resources in the world. And by the way, we've studied rock quality everywhere. Now let's move on to the second mandate, a commitment to E&G excellence. In conjunction with last week's transaction, we announced our adoption of rock quality everywhere. A Paris-aligned climate risk framework is the first US-based oil and gas company to do so. Our framework includes specific emission intensity reduction goals, a commitment to no routine flaring, permanently installed methane monitoring, and advocating for a well-designed carbon price in the US. This framework is in service to our ambition to reach a net-zero operational emissions target by 2050. In our engagement meetings, if this framework included the portfolio effects of the Concho assets, the explicit answer is no. We were preparing to issue our new climate risk framework before the transaction was agreed. However, we see the addition of Concho assets as being consistent with and creative to these goals. The production emissions of the US unconventionalals are among the lowest GHG intensity assets in the world. So, the addition of these resources will be a benefit to our projections. PLANS AND TARGETS NOW THE THIRD MANDATE DELIVERING COMPETITIVE RETURNS IS AN IMPERATIVE FOR ATTRACTING AND RETAINING INVESTORS TO THE SECTOR OUR COMPANY HAS BEEN ALL ABOUT RETURNS AND THAT WON'T CHANGE IN FACT THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO DELIVER ON THE PROVEN RETURNS FOCUSED VALUE PROPOSITION WE KNOW INVESTORS WANT FROM OUR SECTOR BECAUSE OF SEVERAL ADVANTAGED ATTRIBUTES AND DEMONSTRATED PRIORITIES FOR EXAMPLE AS I JUST DESCRIBED The transaction creates a massive, resilient, low-cost supply resource base. I discussed this as part of Mandate One, but also add that low-cost supply is the best assurance by definition for delivering competitive financial returns through price cycles. After the deal closes, we'll publish our combined cost of supply curve. I have no doubt it will be best in class. By the way, we've been asked about how we view risk in the event of a change in leadership in Washington. The idea is that while it might create some headwinds for the industry, our company's global diversification and our mix of private, state, and federal leases in the U.S. assures us that we are competitively positioned for that outcome. And we accounted for this potential risk in our evaluation of the overall transaction diversification and low-capital intensity matters. And as I just mentioned, we preserve those portfolio characteristics by adding consolidated unconventional assets into our portfolio. Adding consolidated unconventional assets into our portfolio will not make it a bad outcome. MATERIAL DIFFERENCE TO OUR BASE DECLINE RATE THAT MEANS WE RETAIN OUR Diversification AND LOW CAPITAL INTENSITY ADVANTAGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF BOTH SHAREHOLDERS WE WILL APPLY OUR DISCIPLINED CONSISTENT APPROACH TO FUTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS CAPITAL WILL BE ALLOCATED FIRST ON A BASIS OF COST OF SUPPLY AND THEN BASED ON SECONDARY CRITERIA SUCH AS FLEXIBILITY CAPITAL INTENSITY ASSET OPTIMIZATION AFFORDABILITY AND FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION IN OUR EX ARMY PROGRAM RESULTING FROM THE TRANSACTION WILL BE INTEGRATED WITHIN THE TOTAL COMPANY PLAN TO OPTIMIZE OVERALL OUTCOMES AND VALUE THE COMBINATION CREATES GREATER VISIBILITY ON EARNINGS EXPANSION AND FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION FACTORING IN OUR ANNOUNCED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TARGETED COSTS AND CAPITAL SAVINGS THE TRANSACTION IS ACREATIVE ON ALL KEY CONSENSUS FINANCIAL METRICS INCLUDING EARNINGS FREE CASH FLOW AND FREE CASH FLOW YIELD FINALLY OUR BALANCE SHEET PLUS FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION means we're even better positioned to give investors what they want from this business returns of capital the transaction enhances our ability to meet our stated target of returning more than thirty percent of our cfo to our owners annually and this target isn't an ambition it's what we've been doing for the past four years in fact we returned over forty percent of our cfo to owners over that period and it will remain a key part of our future. FUTURE OFFERING BOTTOM LINE THIS TRANSACTION CREATES A BEST IN CLASS COMPETITOR SCALE TO THRIVE IN A NEW ENERGY FUTURE THAT IS COMPELLING FOR SHAREHOLDERS FOR BOTH COMPANIES NOW A FEW COMMENTS ON WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT OUR S FILING SHOULD BE FILED IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AND WE EXPECT THE TRANSACTION TO CLOSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE INTEGRATION PLANNING IS ALREADY UNDERWAY DOMINIC MACKLEN WILL LEAD THE EFFORT FOR AND WILL JERO WILL LEAD THE EFFORT FOR KONCHA BOTH SIDES ARE EXCITED AND COMMITTED TO A VERY SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION AS PART OF THE INTEGRATION PLANNING WE WILL BEGIN TO EVALUATE HOW BEST TO OPTIMIZE OUR FUTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS WE WOULD EXPECT TO ANNOUNCE PRO FORMA CAPEX FOR NEXT YEAR SHORTLY AFTER CLOSING BUT DIRECTLY ON A STANDBY KONICO FILM SPACES WE REMAIN CAUTIOUS ON THE PACE AND TIMING OF RECOVERY SO AS A PLACE TO START WE'RE CURRENTLY TH At a level that is roughly similar to this year's capital, meaning little to no production growth on a standalone basis. Of course, we retain the flexibility to adjust as the year progresses. We have the capital flexibility, the balance sheet, and the cash on hand to respond as necessary to changes in the macro while meeting our capital return priority. And that brings me to a few comments on the third-quarter results. It certainly has been all year for the business, as we all know. The company took some significant steps. SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TO RESPOND TO THE DOWNTURN INCLUDING PRODUCTION CUTBACKS AND OVER THE PAST FEW QUARTERS WE ALSO CARRIED OUT OUR MAJOR SEASONAL TURNAROUNDS SO A BIT OF A NOISE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THIRD QUARTER NUMBERS BUT BY THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER THE CUTBACK PROGRAM WAS BEHIND US THE SEASONAL TURNAROUNDS WERE COMPLETE AND THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS WAS RUNNING VERY WELL AS YOU SAW ON THIS MORNING'S RELEASE THIRD QUAR I think we should take the fourth quarter as the new baseline for twenty one capital and production, those as I just mentioned, that subject to ongoing monitoring and market conditions. We look forward to keeping you updated on our integration progress and our future plans for the business. And finally, we hope everyone's safe and well and now I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please. PRESS STAR THEN ONE ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE IF YOU'RE USING A SPEAKER PHONE YOU MAY NEED TO PICK UP THE HANDSFREE FIRST BEFORE PRESSING THE NUMBERS ONCE AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN ONE ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE WAITING ON STAND BY FOR ANY QUESTIONS IN OUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM FIL GRESH FROM J P MORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN YES HOW DO YOU I just wanted to ask about the quarter here. It looks like there are some moving pieces around cash flows, affiliate distributions, and some other factors there. So I'm wondering if you could give a little bit more color there and help us think about how you would define a clean CFO in the quarter. Yeah, thanks, Phil. I'll let Bill, Bill Bullock, answer that for you. Thanks. So yeah, for the quarter, cash from operations, ex-working capital was about ONE BILLION TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION AND WE HAD A COUPLE OF ONE TIME BENEFITS IN THE QUARTER A LEGAL SETTLEMENT AND AN AUDIT SETTLEMENT TOTALING A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION OF THAT BUT WE ALSO HAD CURTAILMENTS IN THE QUARTER OF ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND BARRELS OF DAILY SO THE FORGONE CASH FLOW FOR THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS CASH SO IF YOU THINK OF A CLEAN RUN RATE NUMBER FOR THE QUARTER A GOOD PLACE TO BE NOW YOU ASKED ABOUT EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS. WE DIDN'T HAVE A DISTRIBUTION FROM A P I O L G N IN THE QUARTER. WE RECEIVED DISTRIBUTIONS IN THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FROM A P I O L G N AND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR WE'RE EXPECTING A LITTLE UNDER TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAT WOULD GIVE A FULL YEAR DISTRIBUTION OF SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE Kind of dovetails into my second question, which is: you know, we continue to get some questions here around this pro forma, CFO guidance that you provided. And so, if I look at the results you just talked about, the one point two five and what contour reported the other night, which I think is X hedges, was around five hundred, perhaps you could help us bridge these results, which I think are about forty one dollar wti to to the seven billion. Making forty dollars wti guidance you provided. Yeah, thanks, Phil. I know there's a number of moving parts there as you described. And, yeah, we've had a few people point out that they thought the seven billion at forty dollars a barrel for the combined company looked a little bit light. So now we've seen the third quarter. If you adjust for concho's hedging benefits and what bill just described on our equity affiliates, I think you get something closer to the mid to high side. SEVENS YOU KNOW IT AT FORTY DOLLARS SO MAYBE I'LL LET MAT ADD A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR TO THOSE DETAILS YEA THAT THEY IF YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAN THIRD QUARTER AND THEY FOR BOTH COMPANIES BILL EXPLAINED THE HOURS IT WOULD IMPLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN AND A HALF AND SEVEN EIGHT AT FORTY DOLLARS A BARREL NOW THAT THE RANGE IS BASICALLY THAT BASED ON THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE EQUITY AFFLIATES DISTRIBUTED If we've got similar distributions to this year, we'd be the top end of that range. And these numbers also include a pro forma assumption that we'd get the full year of expected cost savings that we announced, which was three hundred fifty million of cash, and that's what shows up in these numbers. There's also the hundred and fifty million of capital that doesn't count, doesn't affect CFO directly. Does that, does that help, Phil? MAN: I'll take that as a yes. YEAH, I HOPE SO. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM DUG PARSONS FROM EVERCORE ISI. PLEASE GO AHEAD. YOUR LINE IS OPEN.\n\nWOMAN: GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY. GOOD MORNING DUG.\n\nMAN: WELL, ONE OF THE HALLMARKS RYAN OF KONICA AND PHILIPS BEFORE THE MERGER AND EVEN AFTER THE SPLIT IN TWENTY TWELVE HAS BEEN CORPORATE AGILITY IS THE WAY I'D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT AND IT'S The ability to create value and strategic transactions over the near and medium term periods and on this point while you guys have been pretty clear about the operating and capital cost benefits that you're going to get as well as some of the enhancements that you're going to get from a higher quality investment portfolio my question is whether there are areas that you're optimistic about that may or may not be as obvious that stand to deliver further upside areas that you're really confident about similar to situations You've had in the past with other transactions. And then second, what are the two to three most important things that you think that the new management group brings to the organization? So, two questions.\n\nYeah, thanks, Doug. I'll maybe start, let Dominic add a few comments you write. You know, when we put out the synergy number, we we see a lot of other synergy numbers that people put out there, and it seems like a fair amount of arm-waving. We want to be pretty specific about the five. MILLION DOLLARS THAT THAT WE DESCRIBE. BUT IF YOU'RE THE SECOND PAGE WHICH I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE ALLUDED TO A LITTLE BIT THAT I CAN LET DOMINICK ADD ON IS WE YEAH WE FULLY EXPECT THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY EITHER THROUGH PRICE UPLift OR VARIOUS OTHER FORMS TO ADD ADD INCREMENTAL VALUE TO THIS TRANSACTION. DOMINICK MAYBE YOU COULD DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THE INTEGRATION TEAM IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT. YEAH DELIVERING THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE HAVE PUT OUT THERE AS A COMMITMENT, BUT CERTAINLY WE SEE OPPORTUNITY BEYOND THAT. I THINK WE KIND OF OUTLINE THOSE IN OUR DECK. I THINK JUST TO TALK MORE ABOUT THOSE SPECIFICALLY, I THINK THE ONES THAT WERE MOST OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ON THE MARKETING SIDE, CONCHA TYPICALLY SELLS A PRODUCT TO THE WELLHEAD. WE SELL FURTHER DOWN THE VALUE CHAIN TO IMPROVE REALIZATIONS. SO YOU KNO WE'RE SURELY EXCITED ABOUT ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW CONCHO HAS BEEN DOING EXTREMELY WELL IN THE PERMIAN ON THE DRILLING COMPLETION COURSE THE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN EXCELLENT AND THERE FURTHER DOWN THE LEARNING CURVE THAN US THERE SO WE DO EXPECT TO SEE THAT TO ACCELERATE YOU KNOW THE PERFORMANCE ON OUR ACREAGE TOO AND OF COURSE WE EXPECT YOU KNOW IMPROVE PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE LAST 48 FROM SHARING BEST PRACTICES AND TECHNOLOGIES BET On the chain side, obviously we're going to have increased purchasing power, scale, flexibility. So we're anticipating you know upside in all these areas and some additional areas too that that we will be working on in the coming months here. So Will and I are already talking about these. We're pretty excited about it. And we'll look forward to see how these develop through next year. And maybe your last question, Doug. So Dominic mentioned Will were. And then what Tim, you know, mentioned were. And then what Tim, you know, mentioned were. And then what Tim, you know, mentioned were. And then what Tim, you know, mentioned were. And then what Tim, you know, mentioned were. And then what Tim, you know, mentioned were. And then what Tim, you know, mentioned were. And then what Tim, you know What we really appreciate out of what they bring to our company is some incredible permian expertise and experience. They have the networks they have, they have broader and deeper networks than we really have in the permian. They've given their long-time association and presence in what Tim's built as a, as you know, two or three goes at it, and what he's done over the last thirty years in the permian basin. I'll tell you, I've had a lot of conversations with ceos over the course of the last couple of years, and what i've come to appreciate is tim's shares. A PASSION FOR THIS BUSINESS AND A VISION FOR WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE TO BE SUCCESSFUL OVER THE NEXT DECADE AND BEYOND THAT IS REALLY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MY VIEW OR OUR VIEW OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO REALLY SUCCEED AND BEAT THE COMPETITION SO AND THEN I'D SAY FINALLY PROBABLY YOU KNOW WE'RE BOTH VERY COMMITTED TO A SUCCESSFUL DEAL AND WE'RE BOTH COMMITTED TO GETTING THE SECRET SAUCE THAT IS KONICO FILMS COMBINED WITH THE SECRET SAUCE THAT FORWARD THANK YOU. OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM NEIL METAFF FROM GOLDMAN SACHS. PLEASE GO AHEAD. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GREAT THANKS GUYS. APPRECIATE YOU GUYS TAKING THE TIME TO QUESTION. SO THE FIRST IS A FOLLOW-UP ON DISTRIBUTIONS. INCLUDING FROM APOLG, BUT JUST EQUITY FELLOWS BROADLY. JUST HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? YOU HAD MADE A COMMENT ON THE DECK THAT WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT THAT TO BE DISTRIBUTED. RADICAL TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT OIL PRICE LEVELS AND HOW WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT MODELING THOSE DISTRIBUTIONS COMING INTO THE BUSINESS YES SURE NEIL THIS IS BILL I THINK AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT EQUITY PHILOSOPHY THAT WE'VE TALKED IN THE PAST HOW THEY AREN'T RATEABLE YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM A P L O N G I I N T ERMS OF BEING MORE SIGNIFICANT IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTER AND LIGHTER IN THE FIRST AND TH THIRD BUT AS YOU THINK ABOUT A GOING INTO NEXT YEAR AND YOU LOOK MORE AT LIKE STRIP PRICES FOR NEXT YEAR IF YOU'RE THINKING TENS OF RANGE OF SIX HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION FROM EQUITY STOCKHOLDERS AT THOSE KINDS OF PRICING THAT'S GONNA THAT'S GONNA GET YOU INTO THE BALL PARK THAT OBVIOUSLY DEPENDS ON HOW THEY'RE PERFORMING ON TERMS OF THE MARKETS AND HOW WE'RE OPTIMIZING OUR CAPITAL OVER AN E O L P N G BUT THAT'LL GET YOU Just as a reminder, Deal, we do have a sensitivity for that in our price deck for the pricing. That's right, that's right. And the supplemental materials we included today. That's great, guys. Yeah, go ahead, Deal, you have a second follow-up. Yeah, it was really just about Alaska, and I know we're a couple of days away from the election, but it's probably very sensitive topic, but just sort of your temperature on on on the fair share act and just in general, your message around Alaska. And you think about the the cadence of spend and in investment there yeah you bet i'll let matt's matt's been following that closely i have too but matt's got a can't can't answer yeah mike that they mean as you know that there are really three moves that are topical just now there's the ballot initiative to increase the production tax there's the status of the willow project and there's the impact of the pandemic EIGHTY ON OF A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION IF THAT HAPPENS ON FEDERAL LAND PERMITTING so I PROBABLY SHOULD TALK ABOUT ALL THREE OF THEM SO THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY CLEAR UP ALASKA WITH THIS WITHOUT THIS ONE BUT QUESTION THAT SO AS YOU KNOW THE BALLOT MEASURE WOULD IMPOSE A TAX INCREASE ON PRODUCTION THE THAT'S GONNA HAVE TWO PROBLEMS TWO ADVERSE EFFECTS IT'S GONNA REDUCE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF INVESTMENT IN ALASKA AND IT'S That's not going to be good. We've been years of development opportunities left in Alaska, but a shift of capital from Alaska to elsewhere is going to be rational if taxes are increased. I mean, this is a production tax, and what you tax more, you get less of. So that should be expected that if those advocating for this and voting for the proposal should understand that. And we've been pretty clear about that so that we would avoid any doubt in Alaska that if the measure passes, drilling in the big three fields would be. Targets for the tax increase are not going to resume in twenty twenty one and may be beyond that. So the Alabama jobs, contract labor, all the associated services are going to be adversely impacted by this change. And the contractors, the unions, all the other businesses up there understand this and they've opposed for the most part opposing the change in the tax regime. But it's now up to the electorate to decide in the elections of consequences so. WE'RE GETTING DOWN WITH THE WIRE HERE AND WE REALLY FEEL AS IF WE HAVE TO BE, WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR WITH THE ALASKA VOTERS. NOW ON THE WILLOW PROJECT ITSELF, THEY'VE PASSED A BIG MILESTONE EARLIER THIS WEEK. WE GOT A FAVORABLE RECORD OF DECISION FROM THE BLM AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF PROCESS. SO THAT KEEPS US ON TRACK WITH THE PROJECT TIMELINE. AND IT'S WORTH UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT PERMIT WAS RECEIVED UNDER THE TWENTY TH FOR THE NATIONAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THOSE ARE RULES THAT WERE SET UNDER THE ABRAHAM MANDATE AND ADMINISTRATION, SO THEY SHOULD STAND UP WELL TO SCRUTINY UNDER A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION IF THAT HAPPENS. SO WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS A CONCEPT SELECTION AND MOVING TO FEED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. OF COURSE THIS ASSUMES THE BALLOT MEASURE FAILS AND TAXES ARE NOT INCREASED. IF IT PASSES WE'LL NEED TO RECONSIDER THE TIMING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WE TARGETED BY THE TAX INCREASES THERE WILL BE NO KNOCK ON EFFECTS ON THE OTHER FIELDS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AVAILABLE AVAILABLE CAPITAL NOW THE LAST ONE IS THE FEDERAL LAND PERMITING IN ALASKA THEY THE MORE GENERALLY IF THERE'S A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION WE WOULD EXPECT THAT TO HAVE A RELATIVELY LIMITED IMPACT ON US ALTHOUGH SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR ACRES ARE ON FEDERAL LAND IT ONLY REPRESENTS ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF OUR PRODUCTION NOW SOME COM WELLER IS ON FEDERAL LAND. BUT IT'S WELL UNDER WAY. FIRST PRODUCTION WILL BE AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR. SO WE DON'T EXPECT THAT WILL BE AFFECTED AT ALL. WILLOWS ON FEDERAL LAND OF COURSE. BUT NONE OF WILLOWS NOR G M T ONE OR G M T TWO THE FEDERAL LAND DRILL SITES USED ANYTHING OTHER THAN CONVENTIONAL SIMULATION TECHNIQUES. SO IF THE ISSUE IS ABOUT FRACKING THEY SHOULDN'T BE ENCOURAGED BY THAT. I GUESS WE'VE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THE ALASKA ELECTORAL ACT ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF BALLOT MEASURE ONE WE EXPECT ANY IMPLICATIONS OF THE CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION TO D C TO HAVE A RELATIVELY LIMITED IMPACT ON US THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM JEANINE W FROM BARCLAY'S PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN HI GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE THANKS FOR TAKING OUR CALL Someone said good morning, good morning. Maybe, sorry, just one more on Alaska, if I could real quick, following up on Neal's question. It's a little bit different, but I mean, last year, on the anniversary day, you talked about how willow would be contingent upon selling down twenty five percent of your position in Alaska. And we know that you need resolution on ballot measure one first. But is that twenty five percent sell down still the case now that you have Conoco assets in the portfolio? AND THEN MAYBE JUST ON THAT FOR THE BALLOT MEASURE ONE WE KNOW IT'S A CITIZEN BALLOT MEASURE AND DO YOU THINK THAT IT COULD BE LIKELY THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD POTENTIALLY OVERTURN ANY DECISION CERTAINTY IS RESOLVED. SO IT'S STILL ON THE CARDS THAT WE'LL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO EQUITY IN THE ALASKA BUT WE MAY STILL CONTINUE TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT IN THE MEANTIME. SO SO SO THE TIMING OF THE PROJECT ISN'T CONTINGENT ON THE SELL DOWN I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING. ON THE BALLOT MEASURE ONE AND WHEN COULD THE LEGISLATURE OVERRULE THAT AND NOT REALLY TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME FOR THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE NEGATIVE PHRASE: THAT WAS THAT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR OR THAT IT WOULDN'T IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY WOULD OVERTURN IT THAT THEY YOU KNOW BUT LOCK STOCK AND BARREL OH GREAT THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY FOLLOW-UP QUESTION IS JUST ON THE CASH ALLOCATION PRIORITIES AND YOU INDICATED IN YOUR PREPARED REMARKS THAT TWENTY NINETEEN KAPEX SHOULD BE ABOUT SIMILAR TO TWENTY TWENTY WITH LITT The strip moves around a lot, kind of moving against us all today. But is the right way generally to think about it is that in the mid forty threshold that, that threshold that you have for production growth, it's a hard and fast criteria that needs to be met or are there just a bunch of other considerations that we would need to factor into the decision making process? CURVE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT OUR PLANS FOR TWENTY TWO AND AGAIN I MENTION THOSE ON A STANDALONE BASIS FOR CONOCO PHILLIPS IT'S KINDA HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT GOING INTO THE NEXT YEAR YOU KNOW IT'S JUST NOT NOT COST OF SUPPLY BUT IT'S ALSO WHAT WHAT KIND OF CASH FLOW ARE WE PROJECTING TO MAKE AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A VERY STRONG BALANCE SHEET SO WE CAN USE SOME OF THAT SHOULD WE NEED TO BUT CERTAIN What satisfies 30% of our return criteria and more given the kinds of prices we're seeing? Certainly, some headwinds into the commodity price outlook right now, some you know, with covid resurgence, some demand certainly hasn't started to recover. And depending on what nopec or opec does on the supply side and what the US response is, you know, we're watching all of that really closely to make sure that whatever program we put in place for twenty one we can balance with the cash flow. THOSE THAT WE EXPECT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN THE LOWEST COSTS TO SUPPLY THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN THE PORTFOLIO ONLY. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM JOSH SILBERSTEIN FROM WOLF RESEARCH. PLEASE GO AHEAD. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. On a year-by-year basis, what would the congo standard volumes look like relative to the fourth quarter twenty volumes under that scenario?\n\nAye, Josh, that we would be we would expect it under that scenario to be similar to fourth quarter or second half of the year sort of rates at that sort of level. So that would be roughly four point three is what we're spending. THIS YEAR AND WHICH IS A BIT ABOVE OUR SUSTAINING CAPITAL AND THEY SAID THAT SO WE MIGHT TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THAT UP BECAUSE FLAT PRODUCTION AND YET ABOVE OUR SUSTAINING CAPITAL SO LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY THAT'S DIFFERENT SO IF WE WERE IF WE WERE GOING TO EXECUTE A LONG TERM SUSTAINING STRATEGY FOR THE COMPANY AND THEY THAT WE NEED ABOUT THREE POINT EIGHT FOR FOR KONAL PHILUPS AT STANDOFF AND THAT WOULD BE SUSTAINING PRODUCTION Roughly a bit below one point two million pounds would be the ah but with the low cost of supply that we have in the portfolio we don't expect that our long term strategy will be to simply sustain production the the investment opportunities are too competitive for that but what ryan is really indicating is that we could execute a tactical sustaining program much like we have this year and indeed start twenty twenty with that sort of tactical sustaining program THEN WE'LL SEE HOW DEMAND RECOVERY AND SUPPLY RESPONSES SHAPE OUT AND WHAT WE'LL FIND IS THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OUR TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC SUSTAINING PROGRAM IS THAT ON A TACTICAL SUSTAINING PROGRAM WE WOULD STILL KEEP PRODUCTION FLAT BUT WE WOULDN'T COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN PROJECTS LIKE WILLOW OR EXPLORATION ACTIVITY THOSE THINGS WOULD STILL CONTINUE WITH THE ANTICIPATION THAT THEY ULTIMATELY WOULD MOVE AWAY FROM SIMPLY SUSTAIN THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH JUST NOW ON THE PLAN AND AS RYAN SAID, WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT US TO COMMUNICATE TWENTY TWO IN ONE CAPITAL GUIDANCE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE COMBINED COMPANY TILL SOME TIME AFTER THE TRANSACTION CLOSES FLAT PRODUCTION AT THE CAPITAL LEVEL GOING IN NEXT YEAR. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL CONTINUE TO WATCH IS THAT THE MICRO EVOLVES AROUND US. Do you think about M&A and the network artist as well, as maybe those are the most important candidates to kind of accelerate the goal towards getting into your twenty thirty path? Yeah, so the the highest emissions assets on the portfolio, just now in the operated portfolio, is really it's oil sands the that's why we're so focused on on looking at ways to bring oil sands emissions down and and we've got a lot of ions in the fire there and we're gonna get a lot of ions in the fire there and we're gonna get a lot of ions in the fire there and we're gonna get a lot of ions in the fire there and we're gonna get a lot of ions in the fire there and we're gonna get a lot of ions in the fire there and We're going to extend our non-condensable gas injection, which brings down steam oil ratio by keeping heat in the reservoir. And of course, it's the steam oil ratio that drives the emissions intensity. We're also going to be deploying more of these flow control devices that bring the steam oil ratio down. We're moving to add some sustaining pads. As some of the pads get older, their steam oil ratio increases. When you put new pads on, that brings the steam oil ratio down. We have a very low steam oil ratio and there are other technologies that we're looking at there as well. So what we're doing basically across the board is we're looking at all of our greenhouse gas intensities across every asset that we have and we're asking ourselves what can we do to cost-effectively bring that down that the and that's what we call our marginal abatement cost curve and we have about a hundred projects in there just now. Some of them are desktop exercises, such as feasibility studies. We spend about ninety million dollars this year between capital and operating costs on those projects. They are but we look across the whole asset base to try and find ways to bring that down. Our targets, Josh, you know that we established the thirty-five to forty-five percent reduction that doesn't require major portfolio changes to go do that. SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HAVING TO SELL CERTAIN ASSETS THAT MAT DESCRIBED THAT THAT'S THAT'S THINGS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED INSIDE THE PORTFOLIO TO WORK ON WITH THE PORTFOLIO BEING RELATIVELY CONSTANT OVER THIS TIME YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY THERE'S A GOOD POINT LINE IT'S MOSTLY DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT WE'RE IT'S A SORT OF STRATEGIC SHIFT IN WHERE WE'RE INVESTING WE'RE INVESTING IN LOWER CAPITAL GAS INTENS We're low up in Alaska, which is very low in intensity as well. So the percentage of our production that's very low in intensity increases with time. And when you combine that with reducing the emissions intensity of our existing assets, like the oil sands, that's how we've delivered the the reduction in emissions intensity over the next ten years. It's not, it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a it's The cost and capital is is is small amounts to get this plan. We're not talking about spending hundreds of millions of dollars to go deliver this. This is a small project that that are currently baked into our plans.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Roger Reed from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nHey, thank you. And good morning. Good morning Roger. Just I'd like to kick on really kind of a follow-up where you're talking about with Josh. There's you think about twenty one capex roughly flat. You said you know you ought to be nimble next year for for what comes what what would be the things you would be looking at. I mean, presumably not simply oil price up or down. I'm it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it Getting More Optimistic in Twenty One\n\nYeah, I mean, it would be macro. We have to see how they respond to what looks like a slower response than people were hoping for and especially with Europe and possibly the US coming so we have to just be careful about that. We have to look at how the Russia and OPEC respond.\n\nI'm sorry, it seems like there's an error in the transcript. Could you please provide me with the correct transcript? They have a move coming up at the end of November to see when we can get back to sort of drawing down the inventory. The beauty of our position is that we've got incredible flexibility. We've got the low, a low break-even price to cover, you know, for flat production and to cover the dividend. That's sustained from the two companies together. So we're actually having that flexibility and the ability to respond to what the market is. GOING TO GIVE US IS IS VERY HELPFUL. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO RUSH HEADLONG INTO YOU KNOW TRYING TO GROW PRODUCTION INTO THAT THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO US WE'LL SEE HOW THINGS PLAY OUT HERE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS AND THEN WE'LL MAKE WE'LL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS THAT THAT BETWEEN OUR LOW BREAK EVEN AND OUR BALANCE SHEET WE'LL BE IN WE'LL BE IN VERY GOOD SHAPE TO TO TO ASSESS THAT AS WE GO THROUGH OUR Umm, well, it's it's not so much even just what what's the strip look like or what it looks like for next year it it's sort of a longer term trajectory back to what we believe is a reasonable midcycle price and will be reassessing what that midcycle looks like depending on where the demand and supply fundamentals start to kind of shake out with the u s tide going down you know what happens to the election and in and in alaska and then you know it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it' Making it's going to make imminent amount of sense as we combine with Concho to to optimize and and figure out what the what the right level of activity is between the two companies. So there's you're right there's a number of factors that will be putting into the mix as we look at not only twenty twenty one plans but what the next couple of years look like as we this business recovers back to a mid cycle and whether it overshoots or undershoots it's oil industry so it'll definitely do one or the other. ONE QUICK KIND OF FOLLOW-UP UNRELATED TO THE FIRST QUESTION BUT RELATED TO THE MERGER. SOME OF THE SAVINGS YOU PULL THAT YOU CITED WERE GOING TO BE YOU KNOW EXPORATION APPRAISAL SPENDING THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN I WAS CURIOUS FOR THE ASSETS THAT YOU WON'T BE SPENDING E N A MONEY ON IN THE NEAR FUTURE DID THEY JUST GO BACK INTO THE RESOURCE BASE OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT MAYBE BECOMES MORE LIKELY TO BE AH, DISPOSED OF YOU KNOW, MONETIZED IN A DIFFERENT WAY ROGER, IT'S DOMINICK HERE. THANK YOU. SO WHAT WE SAID WAS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE FOCUSING OUR EXPLORATION EFFORTS ON OUR EXISTING BUSINESS UNITS SUCH AS ALASKA, NORWAY, MALAYSIA. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ABOUT HALF OUR EXPLORATION CAPITAL FROM THREE HUNDRED TO ONE FIFTY. SO THOSE THOSE AREAS SUCH AS YOU KNOW, DOWN IN SOUTH AMERICA, COLOMBIA. ARGENTINA AND SO ON) WE WILL BE WORKING SORT OF MANAGED EXITS FROM THOSE AREAS. COURSE WE HAVE A LOT OF VALUE THERE. WE SEE A LOT OF VALUE THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD GOOD ACREAGE THERE. BUT WE WILL BE WORKING TO A PRESERVE VALUE AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO EXIT THOSE AREAS IN THE FUTURE. SO MORE A QUESTION OF DISPOSITIONS IN A MANAGED WAY RATHER THAN THOSE RESOURCES STAYING IN THE PORTFOLIO. WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG P We focus the exploration effort and we've managed those Roger to whether there's not there's not excessive capital employed associated with those assets but will as Dominic said will we're going to do everything we can to monetize them as best we can and then we don't have any resource associated with any of those assets in the moment that in our supply curve there is no resource associated with them A message from Scott Handled from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open. Thanks, could you give us some color on, you know, US natural gas prices has been pretty strong, and is there ability for Kinder Morgan to flex, you know, for that a little bit? Or is there, you know, where is your opportunity outside of associated gas or is that really the opportunity? I think the main opportunity for Kinder Morgan is associated gas. GAS, WE PROBABLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT IN THE ANADARKO BASIN, BUT THAT'S NOT CAPTURING A LOT OF OUR CAPITAL RIGHT NOW. SO IT'S MOSTLY FOR US, WE'RE STILL A PRETTY BIG BIG MARKETER. SO WE WERE MOVING YOU KNOW OVER EIGHT BCF OF GAS A DAY. SO WE SEE A LOT OF THAT. SO WE'RE GETTING, WE'RE GETTING SOME UPLIFT ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE OF OUR BUSINESS WITH SOME OF THE TRANSPORT CAPACITY WE HAVE THAT TAKES G EVEN EVEN IN MEXICO SO THAT'S HOW WE'RE KIND OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OF THE KINDA MARKET AS WE SEE IT TODAY AND BUT JUST AN ABSOLUTE PRODUCTION SIDE WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO RAP UP YOU KNOW DRY GAS AND IT'S MOSTLY COMING FROM THE ASSOCIATED GAS WITH THE UNCONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YE Are you there? Yeah, sure. So, Scott, we have a very active commercial organization. Ryan mentioned that we're moving a little over 8 bcf a day, which is the fifth largest gas marketer in the US. And we provide a variety of services to various customers ranging from asset management agreements to off-take agreements. And that provides an ability to one have insight into the market and also to gain margin across moving across pipelines. So, we continue to look at that and continue to move. And we're were. SHIPPING GAS FOR A PROFIT\n\nSO YOU KNOW THAT UP OF THAT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT BILLION CUBIC FEET A DAY THAT IS OURS IS THE REST OF ITS THIRD PARTY VOLUME AND SO WE'RE IN AND OUT OF THE MARKET ON BOTH SIDES ON A DAILY BASIS\n\nTHANK YOU. OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM DAVID LIGGETT FROM BANK OF AMERICA. PLEASE GO AHEAD, YOUR LINE IS OPEN THANKS, GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY. I WONDER BILL MAYBE I COULD START OFF WITH YOU AND ASK YOU TO ILLUSTRATE A LITTLE BIT ON RYAN'S COMMENTS AROUND THE POTENTIAL ELECTION OUTCOMES. AND I'M THINKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TAX. I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE LOOKED AT THIS BUT THE THING THAT STRIKES ME IS A LITTLE BIT DISTURBING IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A MINIMUM FIFTEEN PERCENT P L TAX THAT PUTS I'm under a bit of a spotlight, so I'm just wondering if you guys have thought anything about that, any scenarios that you might run outcomes that you might expect? Yeah, sure. We've certainly taken a look at the various tax proposals out there, including the Biden tax proposal. There's there's two primary elements of that that that would impact us. Doug, the first one is obviously the change in the corporate tax rate from twenty one to twenty eight percent. AND THE SECOND ONE THAT WOULD BE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT WOULD BE REMOVAL IDCs PARTICULARLY IN OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM AND AND NEEDING TO DEPRECIATE THOSE OVER TIME THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN ASPECTS AS WE LOOK THROUGH IT THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON US It's too obvious, but we don't maybe ask it enough. Ryan, when, when yourself and when Matt put together the tidal wave scenarios and all the other scenarios that you laid out at the strategy day, we've now seen what we think is a lot of the signs of a bottom, you know, a cycle coming to a bottom, if you like, with consolidation. Yourselves being part of that. How does this, what you're seeing right now, beyond covid influence your thoughts on longer-term supply? DEMAND AS YOU THINK ABOUT SCENARIO PLANNING. I'LL LEAVE IT THERE THANKS. YEAH, THANKS DAN. I'LL MAYBE ADD A FEW COMMENTS. MATT CAN JUMP IN AS WELL. BUT YEAH, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE TRAJECTORY OF THE RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE AND PROBABLY A COUPLE OF COMPETING FACTORS. WE CERTAINLY SEE DEMAND RECOVERY WE UNCERTAIN WHETHER IT GETS FULLY BACK TO A HUNDRED MILLION BARRELS A DAY TO GET THERE AND THEN I THINK EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND MAYBE OVERLOOKED A LITTLE BIT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE SUPPLY SIDE MAYBE MASSED A LITTLE BIT TODAY BY DUCK INVENTORY BUT YOU KNOW WHEN THE DECLINES AND THE DECLINES ARE HITTING IN AND IT WAS MASSED BY CORTEL'S COMING BACK ON YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A DROP IN U S SUPPLY AS WELL SO I CAN MAT KAN PROBABLY CHIME IN AND DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NET EFFECT TO THE S DEBATE OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM AND HOW MUCH TO PUT BACK TO WORK YEAH DUHG YEAH I THINK WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS IN PAST THAT I THINK YOU AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS IN PAST THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE EXIT RATE FOR THIS YEAR FOR US TYRE OIL IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX AND A HALF AND SEVEN MILLION BARRELS A DAY AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET BETTER CALIBRATION ON THAT YEAR THAT APPROACHES THE END OF THE YEAR THAT COMPARES DECEMBER LAST YEAR EIGHT POINT TWO AND AND TO SOME EXTENT THAT THAT DROP FLATTERS TO DECEIVE BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE STILL BRINGING WELLS ON IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND INTO THE SECOND QUARTER THAT THEY THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT UNDERLYING DECLINE GOING ON HERE WHEN WE MODEL THIS AND I KNOW YOU DO TOO THAT IT'S STRIP PRICES IN THE LOW FORTIES AND WE THINK THE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN FLAT PRODUCTION AT DECEMBER'S RATES TWENTY ONE MERGED INTO TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE I'LL GET A BIT OF A LIFT FROM THE DUCKS AND BUT BUT IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIVE WITHIN CASHFLOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A REAL CHALLENGE TO SEE TIGHT OIL AT SEVEN MILLION BARRELS A DAY AND AS IT'S LIKELY TO BE LESS THAN THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE TRAJECTORY WE WERE ON THAT'S AT LEAST FOUR MILLION BARRELS A DAY LESS THAN THE PRE COVID TREND AND THAT BECAUSE OF THE DECLINE RATES AND THE CAPITAL FLEXIBILITY BUT THAT BUT THE SIMILAR ISSUES ARE HAPPENING ELSEWHERE SO ALTHOUGH THERE IS DEFINITELY UNCERTAINTY IN HOW MUCH THE DEMAND EFFECT WILL BE IT'S LIKELY TO BE LESS OF A DEMAND EFFECT THAN THE SUPPLY EFFECT STILL OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO TO THE PREMISE OF YOUR QUESTION INITIALLY YOU KNOW ARE WE SETTING UP FOR THE BOTTOM OF A CYCLE HERE WELL BUT IT FEELS THAT WAY TO US AND TH The demand for the COVID vaccine and what we've done in the short term, but we're certainly setting up for a tighter supply demand balance in a year or so, if not before. Yeah, so it's a short medium term, all about demand, medium longer term, you know, supply starts to enter the picture, as Matt described, and we have a couple of couple three scenarios around how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we how we I think what that slope and trajectory look like. Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Chen from Scotiabank. Please go ahead, Paul. Your line is open. Hey, guys, good morning. Good morning, Paul. Why is it that maybe it's a little bit of the curve ball here? If we look at the trading and optimization or commercial operation? Historically, the U.S. has looked at that as a core center mainly for facilitation. The European on the other hand takes a more aggressive approach and looks at it as a profit center. They seem to be doing quite well and have a good logic to trade around your physical assets. So from that standpoint, we will conical should look at that operation and see whether that it could allow you to have a higher performance and higher returns. RETURN OR THAT YOU THINK FACILITATION IS BETTER AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE ON THAT SWING IN EARNINGS AND THE HIGHER RISK. SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION. THE SECOND QUESTION WITH THE LET'S FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE IF YOU DECIDE YOUR LONGER TERM TEN YEAR PLAN HAS CHANGED DUE TO DIFFERENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THAT SUCH THAT YOUR FUTURE GROWTH RATE IS GOING TO BE LOWER WITH THE ADDITION OF THE CONTROLLED ASSET WHAT Other asset in your portfolio will take more of the back seat and seeing lesser capital investment if you can say, say the number one, number two on that if that's possible. Thank you.\n\nYeah, so let me take the first one and maybe Matt can chime in on the second one on the capital investment. So the first one, yeah, you know, we're looking at the commercial space and with the addition of concho, you know, it is a as you describe it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you PAUL: KIND OF A COST CENTER INSIDE THE COMPANY BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT EXPANDING THAT YOU KNOW AS WE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE AND WHAT THE CONTRA OIL SPRING I THINK AS DOMINIC DESCRIBED EARLIER THEY THEY SOLD MOSTLY AT THE WELL HEADS SO WE GOT SOME OPPORTUNITY TO ADD VALUE THERE TO BOTH THE GAS AND THE OIL SIDE WE'RE BUILDING MORE EXPORT CAPACITY AS A COMPANY AND IN FACT HAVE DONE SOME SALES TO POINT SALES TO CUSTOMERS WHERE WE TAKE EQUATION, AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT QUITE MARGIN ENHANCING AS WE GO FORWARD AS WELL. SO WITH THE GROWING U S PRODUCTION THAT WE WOULD HAVE WITH THE COMBINATION WITH CONCHO IT ABSOLUTELY REPRESENTS A A BIG PART OF HOW WE CAN EXPAND THE COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION AND THINK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY TO I THINK BILL DESCRIBED THE MARKET SHARE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY THAT'S JUST GONNA GET BIGGER AS WE GO FORWARD SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR MORE CONTRIBUTION FROM THE COMMERCIAL SIDE ACROSS THE WHOLE WHOLE PORTFOLIO MAYBE MAD IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION AS A RESULT OF INTEGRATING THE CONTRA ASSETS YOU KNOW AGAIN I GO BACK TO OURS IT'S IT'S A COST OF SUPPLY PRIMARY CRITERIA BUT MAD CAN PROVIDE A BIT MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT WHAT MIGHT FALL OUT YEAH PAUL IS THAT AS YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO IS WE TRY TO OPTIMIZE EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL INTELLECTUAL PROPER Individual parts of the portfolio to get the optimal pace, using a set of decision criteria. The most important of which is that we're not going to invest at a cost of supply of forty dollars per barrel. And we described that the sum length back in November of last year. And so we look at the optimization of each and then we put it together and we may make a few adjustments, but we're trying to honor the optimal in each of the assets. Now, there is FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO AND THE PACE YOU CAN WE CAN ADJUST THE PACE OF ANY GIVEN PROJECT BY A YEAR OR SO WE CAN ADJUST THE RATE OF WHICH WE INCREASE THE RAMP AND THE NUMBER OF RIGS SO I WOULDN'T CALL OUT ANY SPECIFIC ASSET IF WE DECIDE THAT WE WANT TO GROW AT TWO PERCENT INSTEAD OF FOUR PERCENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT THERE'S FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO TO DO THAT AND STILL ON OUR CRITERIA THAT THAT WOULDN'T BUST That's where the flexibility mostly exists and maybe even in Canada as well. But I wouldn't really call it a specific asset. We're trying to do and we're trying to optimize across the portfolio. But the issue is if you're not optimizing across a diverse portfolio then you're not maximizing the value that the diversification brings you. So we we what we're trying to do is to make sure that we're running each of these assets at their optimal level. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM JEFFREY LAMBUNGAN FROM TUDERA CHICKERING. PLEASE GO AHEAD. YOUR LINE IS OPEN.\n\nGOOD MORNING. THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS. MY FIRST ONE IS ON E S G AND THE PARIS ALIGNED CLIMATE RISK STRATEGY. AND I THINK YOUR COMMENTARY EARLIER ANSWERED A LOT OF WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR KNOW WITH THE OIL SANDS SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AND JUST YOUR COMMENTS ON INVESTMENT DECISIONS BUT IS THERE ANYTHING IN The speaker is discussing their work in the field of emissions control. They mention that they are trying to get a sense for the scope of some of the projects they are working on, and that they are focusing on the broader portfolio. They also mention that they are working on retrofitting equipment for emissions control, and that they are interested in new technology in this area. The speaker also mentions that they have been working in this field for 48 years, and that they have seen a lot of changes over that time. They also mention that they are currently working on a new project related to emissions control, and that they are excited to see how it turns out. The progress we're making there, I think, you know, I think we, we announced a couple of things here along with our new Paris-aligned strategy. And one was a commitment to zero routine flaring. And that's the World Bank initiative there. So we've committed to that. The other one was the introduction of continuous methane monitoring. So this is a real breakthrough for us. We're able to do this now at a very reasonable cost. AND WE'RE ABLE TO NOW BASICALLY ON OUR KEY SITES WE'LL HAVE THIS IMPLEMENTED. I THINK WE'LL HAVE ABOUT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR LOW FORTY EIGHT PRODUCTION COVERED BY EARLY NEXT YEAR AND THIS TECHNOLOGY AT VERY LOW COST ALLOWS US TO SAMPLE THE EMISSIONS AROUND SITES LOOKING FOR METHANE EVERY FIFTEEN SECONDS AND FROM THAT WE CAN RESPOND VERY QUICKLY TO ANY ABERRATIONS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS VERY QUICKLY. SO THEY ARE FOR US THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT OVERALL COMMITMENT WE HAVE TO REDUCE OUR GHG INTENSITY BY THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE PERCENT BY TWENTY THIRTY AND WE'RE REALLY FIRST MOVER ON THIS AS YOU'LL KNOW JEFF YOU KNOW WE WERE THE FIRST US BASED OIL AND GAS COMPANY TO SET A GHG INTENSITY TARGET AND WERE THE FIRST US BASED OIL AND GAS COMPANY TO COMMIT TO BEING PARIS ALIGNED Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavol Malchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thanks for the question. Two quick ones. Both regarding Europe. I guess it's about ten percent of your gas volumes. You know, no one is accustomed to seeing north sea gas prices below three dollars an mcf. But we've had that the last two quarters. Is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that Is it a COVID-related demand situation or is there something more structural in that market? I think that this is Bill. I think that as you think about that, that's more of what we've seen with COVID-related and demand-related issues right now. As we think about long-term, the macro supply around the world, we would see markets tend to more arbitration off. The US Gulf Coast with LNG markets starting to move volumes both into Europe and into Asia as the incremental barrel so I think that what you're seeing is a short-term response to supply demand and not a long-term structural change ok and a follow-up on that in about six weeks the European climate law will be approved by the EU leaders which will make the North Sea the one part of your portfolio that that is covered BY A NET ZERO MANDATE: DOES THAT CHANGE ANYTHING IN TERMS OF HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT ASSET? YOU KNOW, GIVEN THE DECARBONIZATION TARGETS FOR THE EU AS A WHOLE? NO, NOT REALLY. I THINK WE'RE CONTINUING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. WHAT WE'RE LEFT WITHIN THE EUROPEAN PORTFOLIO ARE OUR NORWEGIAN ASSETS, AND YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE LOWEST CARBON INTENSITY ASSETS WE HAVE THAT ARE OFFSHORE AND IN LOOKING AT IT. Other options to continue to reduce our emissions through electrification and additions there. But as we look at it, it's, it's minimal addition to the cost of supply and it's quite manageable. And Norway still is very competitive in the portfolio. FROM PHILIPS JOHNSON FROM CAPITAL ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN HEY GUYS THANKS JUST ONE QUESTION FOR ME THAT RELATES TO YOUR FUTURE RETURN OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS YOU GUYS HAVE REPURCHASED A LITTLE OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF AROUND SIXTY TWO A SHARE THAT AT TODAY'S SHARE PRICE THE PAPER LOSS ON THAT PROGRAM IS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL I REALIZE YOU GUYS PL BUT I WANTED TO ASK IF THERE'S ANY APPETITE AT THE BOARD LEVEL TO DISCARD THE IDEA OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND INSTEAD PURSUE A FIXED PLUS VARIABLE DIVIDEND STRATEGY THAT WOULD THAT WOULD TARGET PAYING OUT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF YOUR FREE CASH FLOW DIRECTLY TO SHAREHOLDERS EACH QUARTER YEAH I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOUR LAST PIECE OF THAT WHERE WE ARE TARGETING OVER THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR CASH BACK TO THE DELIVERED ON IN EXCESS OVER THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS SINCE WE KINDA CAME OUT TO REESTABLISH A NEW VALUE PROPOSITION FOR THIS BUSINESS AND I THINK THE DIVIDEND TODAY IS CERTAINLY COVERING A LARGE SHARE OF THAT. ALSO THINK THAT BUYING OUR SHARES BACK AT THIS KIND OF LEVEL IS IS IT IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO TOO BECAUSE SHARES ARE CERTAINLY WELL UNDERVALUED IT'S CERTAINLY RELATIVE TO WHERE WE THINK MID CYCLE PRICE SHOULD BE SO I DON BUY OUR SHARES THROUGH THE CYCLE AND THIS WAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DOWN TURN WITH CURTAILED PRODUCTION AND THE LIKE GOING ON IN THE SECOND QUARTER SO WE DID SUSPEND FOR FOR A WHILE WE WANTED TO RESTART UP BECAUSE THE BENEFIT TO REALLY BUY YOUR SHARES IS NOT JUST BUY THEM WHEN YOU'RE AT AT AT MID CYCLE PRICE BUT CONTINUE TO BUY THEM THROUGH THE LOW LOW END OF THE CYCLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BRINGS DOWN THE AVERAGE COST OF YOUR SHARES O SHARING OWNERSHIP OF PYE AND THE QUESTION BEGINS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ON FUTURE EXCESS RETURNS WHEN IF THERE'S ANOTHER BIG CYCLE AND WE WE START TO EXCEED OUR MID CYCLE PRICE CALL AND WE WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS AROUND THAT WITH THE MARKET AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT AND CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT BUT AT THIS TEN SECONDS THE DIVIDEND MORE THAN SATISFIES OUR RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS THANK ARE WE AT THIS TIME?

Regulation on october twenty ninth the appellate division applied the court of appeals ruling in virginia case only as a base rent for the determination of rent overcharges is four years prior to the two thousand and sixteen filing of the kuminz complaint and overcharges, if any, are to be determined by comparing the rents actually charged during the four year period to the rent increases permitted by new york city rent guidelines board although Eliminating overcharged liability altogether, this ruling is expected to limit our financial exposure in this regard. the appellate division, however, affirmed the lower court's award of attorney's fees to the plaintiff. the case will ultimately be remanded back to the lower court, which will determine the amount of overcharged liability for rent overcharged and attorney's fees. no future court cases have been scheduled as of yet. we do not believe that this litigation will have a material impact on our business as it pertains to the limited amount of liability for rent overcharged and attorney's fees. Up sets of previous and existing tenants at the property. the vast majority of current tenants and all future move ins are not impacted by the litigation as those units are free market. lastly i would like to comment on a third quarter result results. we are reporting quarterly revenues of twenty nine point six million dollars an oi of fourteen point five million dollars and an opo of two point nine million dollars results that reflect the current headwinds discussed earlier michael will provide further details on our financial performance.

Again, given the high collections rate, collection rate, as Jay Jay said, we're still in the high nineties. So what we've seen is actually, to date, pretty good and strong performance, even as the pandemic lingers all in all, at the third quarter. We took a approximate six hundred and sixty thousand dollar charge for bad debt. so about a ten percent increase over the second quarter but again, given everything that's been going on with the pandemic, i think we're pleasantly surprised and continue to see collections hold up overall. okay, do you have any remaining questions or comments? please indicate so now by pressing star one. 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:00 00:0"

MORNING TO EVERYONE ON THE CALL I WOULD LIKE TO UH KICK OFF TODAY'S PRESENTATION BY SENDING OUR THOUGHTS TO ALL WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY COVID-19 AND ALL THE DEDICATED HEALTHCARE WORKERS FIRST RESPONDERS AND VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES ALL OVER THE WORLD BATTLING THIS PANDEMIC I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY A SINCERE THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE INGERSOLL RAND EMPLOYEES AROUND THE WORLD THE PICTURES ON SLIDE FOUR ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF OUR DEDICATED GLOBAL WORKFORCE WHO HAVE ADAPTED TO THE <UNK> OF THE WORK ENVIRONMENT TO CONTINUE TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS EVERY DAY I HEAR OF NEW EXAMPLE OF OUR BUSINESSES PROVIDING MISSION CRITICAL PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND I AM PROUD OF WHAT OUR COMPANY REPRESENTS AND HOW OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE RESPONDED TO THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES WHILE THERE CONTINUES TO BE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE ONE THING I AM SURE ABOUT IS THAT INGERSOLL RAND WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SERVING OUR CUSTOMERS AT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING WE DO AND THAT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE DEDICATION AND HARD WORK OF ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES MOVING TO SLIDE FIVE I WOULD LIKE TO GRIND EVERYONE ON THE CRITICAL PRIORITIES WE'RE FOLLOWING DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES WHEN WE CLOSED THE TRANSACTION A LITTLE OVER TWO MONTHS AGO WE COULD HAVE NEVER ANTICIPATED THAT WITHIN A MATTER OF WEEKS WE WOULD BE DEALING WITH A GLOBAL PANDEMIC CAUSING DISRUPTION TO OUR CUSTOMERS SUPPLY CHAIN AND THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY OUR RESPONSE SPEAKS TO HOW THE IRX TOOLKIT HAS EFFECTIVELY HELPED US PLAN ACCELERATE AND ADAPT OUR ACTIONS TO ACT QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY AROUND THREE CORE PRIORITIES FIRST ENSURING THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITY SECOND AROUND KEEPING A STRONG FOCUS ON THE INTEGRATION AND EXECUTION TO ENSURE THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE COMPANY THROUGH THESE UNCERTAIN TIME AND FINALLY CONTINUING TO EXECUTE ON THE STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY AS WE HAVE MULTIPLE CAPITALISTS TO DRIVE ONGOING BODY CREATION THE STRENGTH OF INGERSOLL RAND TEAM ALIGN AROUND THESE THREE PRIORITIES WE'LL POSITION THE COMPANY TO EMERGE FROM THIS CRISIS AS A STRONGER AND MORE UNIFIED COMPANY THE NEXT SLIDE IS A REMINDER THAT OUR PURPOSE AND VALUES AS WELL AS OUR EXECUTION ENGINE THAT WE CALL IRX ARE REALLY AT THE HEART OF HOW WE OPERATE AS A COMPANY ESPECIALLY IN THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES DURING THE INTEGRATION PROCESS WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THOUGHTFULLY CREATING THE COMPANY'S PURPOSE ONE THAT IS CENTERED AROUND OUR STAKEHOLDERS WHERE WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN LEAN ON US TO HELP MAKE LIFE BETTER THIS PURPOSE WHEN COMBINED WITH THE FOUR KEY VALUES THAT OUR TEAMS LIVE ON A DAILY BASIS CREATES A FRAMEWORK OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE AS A COMPANY AND THE BASIS OF HOW WE DO IT IS THE INGERSOLL RAND EXECUTION EXCELLENCE PROCESS THE SIMPLICITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS IS ALLOWING US TO ACCELERATE THE CREATION OF A SINGLE CULTURE ACROSS INGERSOLL RAND <INAUDIBLE> TO SLIDE SEVEN I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY UPDATE YOU ON THE COMPANY'S RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS SINCE IT HAS BEEN SWIFT AND FOCUSED AROUND TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS FIRST IS A HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WELLBEING OF OUR EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS OUR COMMUNITIES AND SECOND BUSINESS CONTINUITY NOT ONLY WITHIN OPERATIONS BUT ACROSS A LARGER SUPPLY CHAIN STARTING FIRST WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY WE ACTIVATED OUR COVID-19 PASSPORTS IN FEBRUARY AND HAD A FULL COORDINATED COMPANY APPROACH IN EARLY MARCH JUST WEEKS AFTER THE CREATION OF THE NEW COMPANY OUR EXECUTION APPROACH HAS SERVED US VERY WELL AS WE'RE ABLE TO QUICKLY IMPLEMENT ENHANCED SITE SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND A MANDATORY WORK FROM HOME POLICY FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO CAN WORK REMOTELY AND IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING THAT OUR QUICK ACTIONS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AS WE CURRENTLY HAVE HAD FEWER THAN 30 CONFIRMED CASES OF COVID-19 AMONGST OUR MORE THAN 17,000 GLOBAL EMPLOYEE BASE FOR IS MORE THAN JUST IMPLEMENTING SAFETY PROTOCOLS IT'S ALSO ABOUT SUPPORTING AND ENGAGING THE EMPLOYEE BASE AS A RESULT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES INCLUDING A GLOBAL OUTREACH PROGRAM TO <UNK> EMPLOYEE FEEDBACK EMPLOYEES REACTED QUICKLY AND WITH A TRUE OWNERSHIP MINDSET PROVIDED MORE THAN 200 SUGGESTIONS WHEN WE ASKED FOR COST SAVINGS IDEAS NOT ONLY DID OUR TEAM VOLUNTEER TO TAKE INDIVIDUAL PAY CUTS FURLOUGHS AND FORGO VACATION TIME THIS YEAR THEY HAVE THOUGHTFUL IN-DEPTH SUGGESTIONS MANY OF WHICH WE'RE ACTIVELY IMPLEMENTING TODAY FROM A BUSINESS CONTINUITY PERSPECTIVE STARTING FIRST WITH OUR OPERATIONS AS WE PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED WE HAVE SEEN PLANS LARGELY IN CHINA ITALY AND INDIA IMPACTED DUE TO COVID-19 CHINA WAS LARGELY IMPACTED IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY AND FEBRUARY AND HAS SEEN STEADILY IMPROVED CAPACITY AND OUTPUT THROUGH MARCH AND INTO APRIL AS THINGS ARE NOW LARGELY BACK TO NORMAL ITALY AND INDIA SAW ABOUT TWO MONTH LAG TO CHINA WITH OPERATIONS BEING IMPACTED IN LATE MARCH AND INTO APRIL AND IN THESE TIME OUR SITES AROUND THE GLOBE ARE 98% OPERATIONAL WITH INDIA STILL BEING THE MOST IMPACTED DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ON RETURNING TO WORK THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAS SEEN A SIMILAR TREND AS THE IMPACT IN CHINA IS LARGELY BEHIND US AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO MEANINGFUL DELIVERIES ISSUES THE AMERICAS AND <UNK> REGIONS ARE STABILIZING AS IMPACTED SUPPLIERS IN THE U.S. AND ITALY HAVE STARTED TO COME BACK ONLINE IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE HAVE SEEN THE NUMBER OF IMPACT OF SUPPLIERS DROP BY MORE THAN HALF WHICH IS A VERY GOOD SIGN AND WE'RE SUPPLEMENTING SUPPLY FROM DUAL SOURCES FROM OTHER REGIONS WHERE POSSIBLE MUCH LIKE OUR OPERATIONS INDIA CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST IMPACTED ASPECT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND WE EXPECT THE SITUATION TO IMPROVE IN THE LATER HALF OF MAY WHEN GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS BEGIN TO EASE WE ARE ADDRESSING THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT HEAD ON BY ACTIVELY MANAGING THOSE AREAS WITHIN OUR CONTROL SO LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE STARTING WITH SLIDE EIGHT THROUGH THE USE OF IRX WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD THE COST SYNERGY FUNNEL TO OVER $350 MILLION WITH INCREASES ACROSS ALL MAJOR SAVINGS CATEGORIES AND WE CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF INCREMENTAL OPPORTUNITY AS A REMINDER WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION COST SYNERGIES OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION BY THE END OF YEAR THREE AFTER CLOSING WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION OF EXPENSE IN CONNECTION WITH BOTH ACHIEVING THESE COST SYNERGIES AND THE ASSOCIATED STAND UP OF THE NEW COMPANY AS WE HAVE STATED MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE PAST FEW QUARTERS THE FACING OF SYNERGY DELIVERY WAS ALWAYS AN AREA WE BELIEVE WE COULD ACCELERATE BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE WE HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THE PACE HAVING ALREADY EXECUTED ON $90 MILLION OF ANNUALIZED STRUCTURAL COST REDUCTIONS WITH APPROXIMATELY $17 MILLION SAVINGS EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED IN 2020 THE MAJORITY OF THIS SAVINGS ARE COMING FROM HEADCOUNT ACTIONS ALREADY TAKEN IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS AS WE STREAMLINE THE COMPANY AND REDUCE THE YEARS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION IN ADDITION WE HAVE DEPLOYED THE FIRST WAVE OF PROCUREMENT INITIATIVE WITH RFQS FOR NEARLY ONE-THIRD OF OUR HISTORICAL DIRECT MATERIALS SPAN BASE ALREADY LAUNCHED AS WELL AS SOME QUICK WIN INITIATIVES BEING DEPLOYED IN TOTAL WE'RE NOW EXPECTING TO DELIVER APPROXIMATELY 35% OF OUR OVERALL SYNERGY TARGET IN 2020 WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE ORIGINAL YEAR ONE EXPECTATION OF 10 TO 15% REALIZATION WE'RE KEEPING THE OVERALL COST SYNERGY TARGET AT $250 MILLION OVER A THREE YEAR TIMEFRAME AT THIS TIME TO REMAIN PRUDENT ON VOLUME DEPENDENT SYNERGIES LIKE PROCUREMENT AND I TO BE GIVEN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IT IS NOT ONLY THE STRUCTURAL COSTS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN OUT BUT ALSO HOW WE ARE SUPPLEMENTING OUR SYNERGY DELIVERY ACTIVITIES WITH THOUGHTFUL SHORT-TERM COST REDUCTIONS TO PROTECT MARGINS SO LET'S MOVE TO SLIDE NINE TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN Q1 DESPITE THE 15% REVENUE DECLINE THAT WE SAW COLLECTIVELY ACROSS THE BUSINESS ON A PRO FORMA BASIS WE WERE ABLE TO LIMIT ADJUSTED EBITDA INCREMENTALS TO LESS THAN 30% WITH THE STRONGEST PERFORMANCE COMING FROM OUR TWO LARGEST SEGMENTS WE EXPECT THAT THESE ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WOULD YIELD 40 TO $50 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL COST SAVINGS IN THE P&L THIS YEAR WITH THE MAJORITY COMING IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THIRD QUARTER WE WILL CONTINUE TO REEVALUATE ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND IF THE MAIN ENVIRONMENT DOES NOT ACCELERATE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WE WILL POTENTIALLY EXTEND SOME OF THESE ACTIONS AND INCREASE OUR SAVINGS TARGET ACCORDINGLY WHILE WE'RE MAKING SOME TOP DECISIONS TO CONTROL COSTS ONE AREA THAT WE'RE NOT CUTTING BACK IS STRATEGIC GROWTH INITIATIVES ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE MUCH LIKE WE DID BACK IN 2015 AT GARDNER DENVER WHEN WE INVESTED THROUGH THE DOWNTURN TO CAPITALIZE ON MARKET SHARE GAINS AND NEW BROAD OPPORTUNITIES WE'RE FOLLOWING THE SAME PLAYBOOK TODAY INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE BEING MAINTAINED AT SIMILAR LEVELS AS PRIOR YEARS AND WE CONTINUE TO FUND TARGET THE COMMERCIAL INITIATIVES SUCH AS DEMAND GENERATION AND NOW IOT PLATFORMS THIS IS ALL PART OF A STRATEGY TO PLAY OFFENSE NOW ESPECIALLY AS WE BRING THE TWO COMPANIES TOGETHER THROUGH THE INTEGRATION MOVING TO SLIDE 10 LET ME TALK ABOUT LIQUIDITY THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO HAVE A STRONG BALANCE SHEET WITH AMPLE LIQUIDITY AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRICE OUR LEGACY DEBT FOR PLACING THE NEW $1.9 BILLION FIRM LOAN TO CLOSE THE TRANSACTION ALL OF OUR DEBT IS A TERM LOAN BASED STRUCTURE WITH VERY ATTRACTIVE PRICING AS THE <INAUDIBLE> COMPONENTS ARE <INAUDIBLE> 175 AND THE EURO COMPONENT IS <INAUDIBLE> PLUS 200 SO SOME LOANS HAVE NO FINANCIAL COVENANTS FROM A MAINTENANCE PERSPECTIVE AND THERE ARE NO MATURITIES UNTIL 2027 LIQUIDITY ALSO REMAINS STRONG AT $1.6 BILLION AS WE FINISHED THE QUARTER WITH $556 MILLION OF CASH ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF CAPACITY ON OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES AS WE LOOK AHEAD WE CONTINUE TO SEE SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO <UNK> THE CASH AS WE REMAINED VERY PRUDENT ON PRESERVING LIQUIDITY OPPORTUNITIES EXISTS ACROSS WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH TAXES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE TAILWINDS FROM ENTRANCE EXPENSE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AS ALL $825 MILLION OF LEGACY FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WILL EXPIRE BY SEPTEMBER OF 2020 EVEN THOUGH WE FEEL OUR LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY IS PROPER WE'RE EVALUATING INCREMENTAL DEBT OR OTHER LIQUIDITY VEHICLES GIVEN THE ATTRACTIVE RATE AND COVENANT ENVIRONMENT TURNING TO SLIDE 11 OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGY REMAINS UNWAVERING YOU HAVE HEARD ME ALREADY REFERENCE SEVERAL ELEMENTS OF OUR STRATEGY AS WE'RE BUILDING THE CULTURE OF INGERSOLL RAND WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AT THE CORE WE WILL CONTINUE TO ACT QUICKLY AND PRUDENTLY TO PROTECT MARGINS AND PRESERVE LIQUIDITY AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL POSITION THE COMPANY FOR FUTURE GROWTH BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH OPPORTUNISTIC TARGETED BOLT-ON M&A OUR BUSINESS OPERATES IN A VERY FRAGMENTED MARKETS AND WE SEE OPPORTUNITIES TO ADD NICHE TECHNOLOGIES TO THE PORTFOLIO AND IMPORTANTLY OUR NEWEST STRATEGIC PRIORITY OF OPERATING SUSTAINABLY IS TAKING SHAPE AS WE LAUNCH SEVERAL OF OUR ESG ORIENTER INITIATIVES ALREADY OVERALL WE HAVE SEVERAL VALUE CREATION LEVERS AS WE LOOK AHEAD AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXECUTE DESPITE THE UNCERTAIN MICRO ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO EMILY TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE FINANCIALS EMILY THANKS VICENTE ON SLIDE 12 YOU WILL SEE THE AS REPORTED FINANCIALS FOR THE COMPANY AS A REMINDER THE REPORTED FINANCIALS INCLUDE THREE MONTHS OF LEGACY GARDNER DENVER AND ONE MONTH OF THE LEGACY INGERSOLL RAND INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT IN Q1 2020 AND ONLY THE LEGACY GARDNER DENVER BUSINESSES IN Q1 OF 2019 AS A RESULT THE COMPARISONS ARE IMPACTED MATERIALLY BY THE TRANSACTION I WON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THIS PAGE AS A RESULT OTHER THAN TO MENTION THAT THE AS REPORTED NET INCOME IN THE QUARTER INCLUDES $197 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION ACQUISITION RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS WHICH YOU CAN SEE LISTED IN THE RECONCILIATION TABLES IN THE APPENDIX OF THE PRESENTATION TURNING TO SLIDE 13 TO ASSIST IN CLEAN COMPARATIVES FOR THE QUARTER WE PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION WHICH TREATS THE TRANSACTION AS IF IT HAD HAPPENED AS OF JANUARY ONE 2018 FROM A TOTAL COMPANY PERSPECTIVE FX ADJUSTED REVENUE IN ORDERS DECLINED 14% AND 7% RESPECTIVELY AND WERE IMPACTED BY COVID-19 REGIONALLY WE SAW NOTABLE DECLINES IN ASIA PACIFIC AS WELL AS SHARP DECLINES IN THE US AND EUROPE TOWARDS THE END OF THE QUARTER MOST NOTABLY IN THE ITNS SEGMENT THIS LED BOTH TO BILL TO FINISH AT 1.11 FOR THE QUARTER THE COMPANY DELIVERED 208 MILLION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA A DECLINE OF 24% DRIVEN MOSTLY BY THE VOLUME DECLINES IN ITNS AND THE EXPECTED DOWNTURN IN THE HPS SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGINS WERE 16.4% DOWN 200 BASIS POINTS FROM LAST YEAR HOWEVER OUR PROACTIVE COST CONTROLS WITHIN THE BUSINESS LIMITED DETRIMENTAL TO 29% IN TERMS OF ADJUSTED EBITDA COMPOSITION FOR THE COMPANY THE LEGACY GARDNER DENVER BUSINESS DELIVERED 97 MILLION AS COMPARED TO OUR ORIGINAL GUIDANCE EXPECTATION OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED MILLION WHICH WE VIEW AS RELATIVELY STRONG PERFORMANCE GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENT THE LEGACY IR BUSINESSES DELIVERED 51 MILLION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA IN MARCH AS OPPOSED TO A COMBINED 60 MILLION FOR JANUARY AND FEBRUARY MOVING TO SLIDE 14 THE CASH FLOW FOR THE QUARTER WAS $60 MILLION ON AN AS REPORTED BASIS INCLUDING $8 MILLION OF CAPEX THE Q1 FREE CASH FLOW INCLUDES $63 MILLION OF OUTFLOWS RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION COMPRISED OF 38 MILLION OF SYNERGY DELIVERY AND STAND UP RELATED COSTS AND ANOTHER 25 MILLION OF TRANSACTION FEES WE ALSO PAID $38 MILLION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS IN THE QUARTER WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN THE FINANCING SECTION OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT BRINGING OUR TOTAL TRANSACTION RELATED OUTFLOWS IN THE QUARTER TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM A LEVERAGE PERSPECTIVE WE FINISHED AT 2.6 TIMES AND WHILE WE DO EXPECT TO SEE SOME SHORT-TERM INCREASE TO LEVERAGE WE HAVE SHOWN THE ABILITY TO DELIVER HISTORICALLY AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PAGE WE'LL REMAIN EXTREMELY DISCIPLINED ON CASH AND WE EXPECT OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES TO BE VERY ALIGNED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN HISTORICALLY SPECIFICALLY INTERNAL REINVESTMENTS FOR GROWTH PRUDENT DEBT PAY DOWN AND OPPORTUNISTIC BOLT-ON M&A WE HAVE NO PLANS FOR ANY SHARE REPURCHASES OR A DIVIDEND AT THIS TIME I'LL NOW TURN IT BACK TO VICENTE TO WALK THROUGH THE SEGMENTS VICENTE THANKS EMILY STARTING FIRST WITH INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES IN SLIDE 15 THE ITNS SEGMENT FIRST QUARTER ADJUSTED ORDER INTAKE WAS $889 MILLION DOWN 9% VERSUS PRIOR YEAR EXCLUDING EFFECTS ADJUSTED REVENUES IN THE QUARTER WERE $796 MILLION DOWN 17% EXCLUDING EFFECTS AND LEADING TO A BOOK TO BILL RATIO OF 1.12 TIMES FROM A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE ASIA-PACIFIC REVENUES WERE DOWN IN THE MID THIRTIES WITH EUROPE DOWN 15% AND AMERICANS DOWN 7% ALL EXCLUDING EFFECTS WE USE THESE TREND IN AS AN INDICATION OF HOW Q2 COULD POTENTIALLY PLAY OUT MEANING THAT THE APEC DECLINE IN Q1 IS WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE IN AMERICAS <INAUDIBLE> IN THE NEAR TERM THIS IS THE BASELINE WE'RE USING TO PLAN THE COST CONTROLS FOR OUR BUSINESS BUT WE'RE STAYING HIGHLY ACTIVE WITH DEMAND GENERATION ACTIVITIES AND PRICING CONTROLS WHILE WE CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE DISCIPLINE IN PRICE GENERATING OVER 1% IN THE QUARTER FOR THESE MARKETS ARE MORE OPAQUE THAN HISTORICALLY WE'RE USING OUR UNIQUE DATA ACQUISITION STRATEGY TO MAP ORDER TRENDS AND REMAIN AGILE IN SERVING OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WE BREAK THESE OUT INTO TWO AREAS AFTERMARKET AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT FOR AFTERMARKET A LEADING INDICATOR WE HAVE IS ACTUAL COMPRESSOR UTILIZATION DATA AS WE CAN SEE THE HOURLY USAGE OF THOUSANDS OF COMPRESSORS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE CONNECTED TO OUR REMOTE MONITORING SYSTEM IN AMERICA THAN EUROPE WE SAW A SHARP DECLINE IN COMPRESSOR UTILIZATION IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF MARCH OF NEARLY 30% WITH SOME RECOVERY IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS OF APRIL WE'RE NOW USING THESE AS A WAY TO KNOW WHERE OUR SERVICE TEAMS NEED TO FOCUS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME USING IT AS A LEADING INDICATOR FOR AFTERMARKET ACTIVITY WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE COMPRESSOR BUSINESS TODAY FOR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT WE'RE USING DEMAND GENERATION LEADS WE SAID IN THE PAST THAT DEMAND GEN WAS THE LEADING INDICATOR OF ORDERS THAT WE'RE WILL BE GETTING IN THE NEXT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND LEADS PER WEEK WE HAVE A LOAD OF COMMERCIAL INSIGHT IN OUR SYSTEM WHAT WE SAW IN THE LATER WEEKS OF MARCH WAS A DROP OF 30% VERSUS WHAT WE SAW EARLIER IN THE QUARTER WITH SIMILAR TRENDS IN AMERICA AND EUROPE WE HAVE SEEN ALSO EARLY SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS OF APRIL BUT STILL APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 25% OFF FROM THE HIGHS IN THE EARLY PART OF A YEAR LET ME GIVE YOU NOW SOME COLOR FROM A PRODUCT LINE PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE SEEN VERY SIMILAR TRENDS ACROSS COMPRESSORS BLOWERS AND VACUUMS WHERE WE SAW ORDERS DOWN IN THE MID TO HIGH SINGLE DIGITS WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIRD-PARTY INDUSTRY REPORTS IN THE PAST AND THE Q1 DATA SPEAKS WELL FOR THE OUTCOME OF THE COMBINING OF THE TWO COMPANIES ACCORDING TO A LEADING THIRD PARTY REPORT THE MARKET IN THE US WAS DOWN MID SINGLE DIGITS IN DOLLARS IN THE FIRST QUARTER GARDNER DENVER <INAUDIBLE> WERE FLAT AND INGERSOLL RAND <INAUDIBLE> WAS DOWN HIGH SINGLE DIGITS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THE DETAILS YOU SEE THE POWER OF THE TWO COMPANIES AS GARDNER DENVER SAW GOOD SHARE GAINS ON LOW TO MEDIUM HORSEPOWER MACHINES WHILE INGERSOLL RAND TOOK SHARE ON HIGH HORSEPOWER COMPRESSORS THIS WAS EXACTLY OUR HYPOTHESIS COMING INTO THE DEAL AND WE SEE THESE AS A WAY TO LEVERAGE THE TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO AS WELL AS THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT CHANNELS THAT BOTH COMPANIES HAVE POWER TOOLS AND LIFT WHICH IS PART OF THE SEGMENT HAD A VERY TOUGH QUARTER WITH ORDERS AND REVENUE DOWN BOTH OVER 20% THE BUSINESS WAS HIGHLY IMPACTED BY LARGE INVENTORY PURCHASES THAT ONLINE RETAILERS TYPICALLY MAKE IN THE FIRST QUARTER TO SUPPORT FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR REVENUE HOWEVER THIS QUARTER IN ADDITION TO THE SLOWDOWN OF THE MARKET MANY ONLINE RETAILERS SWITCH THEIR FOCUS TO HOUSEHOLD ESSENTIALS MOVING TO NON- GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA ITNS DELIVER $135 MILLION IN THE QUARTER WHICH WAS DOWN 25% NON- GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN WAS 17% WHICH WAS DOWN 150 VERSUS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR OTHER COST MITIGATION EFFORTS HELP LIMIT DECREMENTAL TO 25% IN A SEGMENT THAT TYPICALLY HAS BASIC INCREMENTALS OF 35 TO 40% BEFORE COST ACTIONS MOVING TO SLIDE 16 TO THE PRECISION AND SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY SEGMENT OVERALL THE SEGMENT HAVE SOLELY PERFORMANCE IN THESE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AS ADJUSTED ORDERS WERE 219 MILLION OFF 2% X OF X ADJUSTED REVENUE WAS 192 MILLION DOWN 9% X OF X ON STRONG PRIOR YEAR COMES UP 12% X OF X GROWTH AND SHIPMENT DELAYS DUE TO COVID-19 THIS PLATFORM IS A COLLECTION OF TECHNOLOGIES AND PREMIUM BRANDS THAT HAVE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN VERY ATTRACTIVE NICHE MARKETS IN THE FIRST QUARTER WE SAW ORDERS GROWTH HIGH SINGLE DIGITS IN THE LEGACY MEDICAL PUMP BUSINESS AS WE ARE LEADING KEY PLAYER IN SEVERAL APPLICATIONS LIKE OXYGEN CONCENTRATORS RESPIRATORS AND LIQUID HANDLING YOU CAN SEE MANY OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT OUR MEDICAL PUMP GO INTO AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE OUR TEAM HAVE BEEN WORKING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN PROVIDING MODIFIED SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE USED FOR NEW APPLICATIONS TO FIGHT COVID-19 NOW AND IN THE FUTURE THE REMAINDER OF THE PORTFOLIO SAW SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE ORDERS PERFORMANCE DOWN 2% X OF X WITH THE MAJORITY DUE TO COVID LOCKDOWNS IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY IN CHINA AND TOWARDS THE END OF THE QUARTER IN INDIA WHAT IS ENCOURAGING IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE GOOD FUNNEL AND ALL THIS ACTIVITY ACROSS MANY OF THE PROG LINES AND REGIONS DUE TO THE NICHE APPLICATIONS IN WATER AND CHEMICALS WHICH WILL HELP BALANCE SOME OF THE EXPECTED WEAKNESSES IN A MORE INDUSTRIAL END MARKET MOVING TO NON- GAAP ADJUSTED EBITA PNAC DELIVERED $53 MILLION IN THE QUARTER WHICH IS DOWN 6% NON- GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN WAS 27.7% UP 120 BASIS POINTS DRIVEN BY STRONG COST CONTROLS AND PRODUCTIVITY LEADING TO THE INCREMENTAL MARGINS OF ONLY 15% MOVING TO SLIDE 17 AND THE SPECIALTY VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY SEGMENT PRIORITIES FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE TO CONTINUE TO CAPTURE GROWTH IN A PROFITABLE MANNER WE SEE THAT THESE SEGMENT CAN EXPAND MARGINS WITH THE USE OF THE SAME IRX TOOLS WE HAVE USED ACROSS ALL THE SEGMENTS AND EXPECT TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS OF THESE BUSINESS MOVING FORWARD HAVING SAID THAT THIS BUSINESS PERFORMED VERY WELL IN THE FIRST QUARTER ADJUSTED ORDERS WERE $230 MILLION YOU KNOW AND ADJUSTED REVENUE WAS $185 MILLION UP 8% AND 7% RESPECTIVELY WITH THE <UNK> TO BAIL OF 1.15 GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTH IN GOLD CONNECTIVITY AND CONSUMER PRODUCT LINE THE BUSINESS SAW STRONG DOUBLE DIGIT ORDER MOMENTUM IN EARLY JANUARY AND FEBRUARY BUT AS THE PANDEMIC HIT THE US WE SAW SHARP DECLINE IN THE SECOND HALF OF MARCH WHILE THERE IS A LOT TO BE EXCITED ABOUT WE'RE EXPECTING Q2 TO BE DOWN COMPARED TO LAST YEAR FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS FIRST LAST YEAR WAS A TOUGH COMP AS A BUSINESS HAD SOME SUPPLIER ISSUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHERE SOME PROBLEM WAS SHIFTED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND TWO THE BUSINESS IS NOT IMMUNE TO THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WHILE APRIL ORDERS WERE DOWN HERE A YEAR WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN ORDERS WE FEEL THIS IS DRIVEN BY A COUPLE OF FACTORS FIRST IN THE CONSUMER <UNK> WE DEEM PEOPLE TO QUICKLY TO LEVERAGING DEMAND GENERATION TECHNIQUES WILDLY USED IN THE LEGACY INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND WE HAVE SEEN BETTER MOMENTUM RECENTLY IN THE RUN RATE AND SECOND WITH THE WORK WE HAVE DONE ON PROACTIVE COVID PREVENTION ACROSS ALL OF OUR LOCATIONS WE WERE ABLE TO REMAIN OPEN WHILE SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS WERE CLOSED MOVING TO NON- GAAP ADJUSTED EBITA SPECIALTY VEHICLES DELIVER $18 MILLION IN THE QUARTER DOWN 1% NON- GAAP ADJUSTED EBITA WAS 9.9% WHICH WAS DOWN 80 BASIS POINTS DUE TO STRATEGIC GROWTH INVESTMENTS AMPWORD MIX MOVING TO SLIDE 18 AND THE HIGH PRESSURE SOLUTION SEGMENT IN THE BUSINESS PERFORM ABOVE OUR EXPECTATIONS IN A TOUGH OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WITH ADJUSTED ORDERS OF $84 MILLION AND ADJUSTED REVENUES OF $96 MILLION DOWN 26% AND 29% RESPECTIVELY I SUSPECTED THE REVENUE BASE AND THE BUSINESS WAS NEARLY 90% AFTERMARKET AND THE TEAM EXECUTED VERY WELL COMMERCIALLY WITH SEQUENTIAL ADJUSTED ORDERS UP 6% AND SEQUENTIAL ADJUSTED REVENUES UP 26% VERSUS THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 WE CONTINUE TO SEE SHARED GAIN OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AFTERMARKET AND SPECIFICALLY CONSUMABLES WHERE WE SAW ORDERS AND REVENUE UP DOUBLE DIGIT SEQUENTIALLY THESE ALLOWED US TO DELIVER NON- GAAP ADJUSTED EBITA OF $24 MILLION AND MARGINS OF 24.6% WHICH WAS DOWN FROM LAST YEAR LEVEL OF 30.8% BUT SEQUENTIALLY BETTER BY OVER 400 BASIS POINTS AS WE PEEP TO THE SECOND QUARTER AND REST OF THE YEAR THE KEY LEADING INDICATOR FOR THIS BUSINESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN ACTIVITY AND INTENSITY WE CAN MEASURE THAT IN MULTIPLE WAYS BUT THE SIMPLEST FORM IS THE NUMBER OF FLEETS OPERATIONAL IN THE MARKET AS A REMINDER EACH FRAC FLEET HAS ABOUT 16 TO 18 TRUCKS WITH EACH TRUCK CARRYING ONE PUMP EACH PUMP HAS A FLUID AND EVERY FLUID END UTILIZES CONSUMABLES WHILE Q1 AT 2020 ON AVERAGE WE SAW 318 ACTIVE FLEETS THE EXIT RATE IN MARCH WAS 240 WE EXPECT TO SEE A SUBSTANTIAL DROP IN THE SECOND QUARTER WHERE WE BELIEVE IS THE ACTIVE LEADS DUE TO THE RECENT DYNAMICS IN THE MARKET WITH THE OVER SUPPLY AND LOWER PRICING FOR OUR INFO IMPACT ON REVENUES WITHIN THE SEGMENT AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE TAKING VERY PROACTIVE STANDS TO DRIVE THE PROPER COST TAKEOUT TO STILL SHOW REASONABLE PROFITABILITY IN THE QUARTERS TO COME MOVING TO SLIDE 19 WE WANTED TO PROVIDE A QUICK <INAUDIBLE> OVERALL THE TOTAL COMPANY IS DOWN APPROXIMATELY 20% IN ORDERS IF THE MONTH BEGAN VERY SLOW PARTICULARLY IN US AND EUROPEAN MAR- BY THE ORDER MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT APRIL WE EXPECT TOTAL REVENUE TO BE LOW IN TERMS OF ORDERS BOTH INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES AND SPECIALTY VEHICLE SEGMENTS WERE RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE TOTAL COMPANY AVERAGE WHILE PRECISION AND SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY IS PERFORMING CONSIDERABLY BETTER WITH POSITIVE YEAR OVER YEAR ORDERS PERFORMANCE THUS FAR AS A RESULT OF CONTINUOUS STRENGTH IN MEDICAL PUMPS AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THE HIGH PRESSURE SOLUTION SEGMENT IS NOT A AS THE MARKET RESETS FOR WHAT WILL LIKELY BE A PROLONGED DOWNTURN THAT WE EXPECT WILL LAST FOR A NUMBER OF QUARTERS AS WE LOOK FORWARD DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN WE WILL NOT BE PROVIDING Q2 OR TOTAL YEAR FOR THE BEST MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING THE RIGHT STEPS TO MANAGE MULTIPLE SCENARIOS TO STRESS TEST THE BALANCE SHEET AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON CASH FLOWS A CURRENT MODEL SHOWS THAT THE BUSINESS WILL IN ANNUAL BASIS TO BE CASHFLOW BREAKEVEN USING CERTAINLY CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS AROUND WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPEX COUPLE WITH THE COST SACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN THUS FAR WE FEEL THAT THESE PUTS US IN A VERY SOLID POSITION MOVING FORWARD WHEN COMPARED TO CURRENT ORDER TRENDS AND COUPLED WITH OUR CURRENT LIQUIDITY POSITION FOR INSTANCE LIKE 20 FOR SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS I WANNA SAY THAT WE'LL WIN MANAGE THROUGH WHAT WE WILL NO DOUBT BE OF TOP SECOND QUARTER WE FEEL THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT THESIS IN THE COMPANY HAS NOT CHANGED INGERSOLL RAND IS A PREMIER INDUSTRIAL COMPANY OVER OUR TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE MULTIPLE LEVERS FOR ACCELERATING <INAUDIBLE> CREATION WHILE BEING VERY FOCUSED ON THE CURRENT OUR LIQUIDITY WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE THESE BY ONLOOKING CASH AS WELL AS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT RATE ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE A CULTURE OF EXECUTION AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PARTICULARLY ON THE CURRENT CONDITION IS TO BE STRATEGIC ON BOLT-ON ACQUISITION WITH THIS WE WILL TURN TO Q&A AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE IN ORDER TO ASK A QUESTION NUMBER ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEY PAD IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE QUEUE YOU MAY PRESS THE

UH UH I MEAN UH AS YOU HAVE SEEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE PERFORMED WELL IN THE DOWN CYCLES IN THE PAST UH I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD SOLID PLAYBOOK THAT WE THAT WE EXECUTED IN THE IN THE 15 16 THAT INCLUDED BOTH NOT ONLY THE IN INDUSTRIAL DOWNTURN BUT ALSO UH AN UPSTREAM DOWNTURN UH YOU KNOW BASE DECREMENTALS THEY TEND TO BE AROUND 40% ACROSS THE BUSINESS WITH A SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN UH IN BUSINESSES LIKE UH UH THE HIGH PRESSURE AS YOU MENTIONED AS WELL AS THE UH PRECISION AND SIGNS BECAUSE OF THE NICE UH HIGH GROSS MARGINS THAT BOTH BUSINESSES HAVE AND YOU KNOW LOWER ON THE SPECIALTY VEHICLES AND UH THE INDULGENT TECHNOLOGIES THEY TEND TO PLAY IN THAT KIND OF 40 PERS- 40% RANGE UH YOU KNOW YOUR SEEING THAT WE HAVE TAKEN VERY DECISIVE ACTIONS BETWEEN SYNERGIES AND THE SHORT-TERM ACTIONS UH TO PROTECT THE MARGIN UH WE SAW AS WE'VE MENTIONED YOU KNOW SOME VERY GOOD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS FOR THE TOTAL BUSINESS UNDER 30% AND AND Q2 WE CLEARLY SEE A BIT MORE PRESSURE FROM A TOPLINE PERSPECTIVE BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE DECREMENTALS WITH THE TARGET BEING CLOSER CLOSER TO THAT 30% UH OF UH OF UH OF OF OF OF THE <INAUDIBLE> AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ACTIONS WE'RE WE'RE CLEARLY TAKING MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS IN THE HIGH PRESSURE UH AROUND COURSE ACTIONS BASED ON WHAT WE SEE HERE WITH A LOT OF OUR DATA POINTS AND UH AND THE LONG DURATION OF THE DOWNTURN THAT WE EXPECT THAT BUSINESS TO HAVE VERY HELPFUL VICENTE STAY WELL THANK YOU YOU TOO ANDY YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM JULIAN MITCHELL FROM BARCLAYS YOUR LINE IS OPEN HI GOOD MORNING UM- GOOD MORNING JULIAN M- MORNING

MILLION OF OF OTHER COSTS OUT ACTIONS AND SHOULD THOSE MEAN THAT DECREMENTAL MARGINS NARROW OR NOT NECESSARILY DEPENDING ON MIX AND SOME OTHER THINGS HE MAYBE BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE TWO BUCKETS UH AS AS YOU SUGGEST TO ME ON THE 40 TO 50 THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT UH THAT ARE KIND OF MORE RELATED TO UH DISCRETIONARY OR KIND OF VOLUME RELATED THOSE ARE LARGELY SECOND QUARTER AND THE THIRD QUARTER UH WITH A GOOD MAJORITY I WOULD SAY MORE MORE SO ON THE UH ON THE SECOND QUARTER UH FROM MY FROM THE COST SYNERGY PERSPECTIVE MILLION DOLLARS UH YOU KNOW <INAUDIBLE> PROBABLY 80 TO $90 MILLION OF END YEAR UM YOU KNOW GROWTH AND DOWNTURN I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S KIND OF CONSISTENT THIRD QUARTER AND FOURTH QUARTER WHILE THE OTHER ROUGHLY YOU KNOW 10 TO $20 MILLION THAT COMES FROM PROCUREMENT IT IS REALLY MORE WEIGHTED TOWARDS THAT KIND OF Q3 AND Q4 THEN MAYBE JUST MY UH SECOND QUESTION UM FOR YOU OR FOR EMILY AROUND THE FREE CASH FLOW IS THAT A GOOD PERFORMANCE IN Q1 UH JUST WONDERED YOU KNOW YOU- THE

THE CURRENT CRISIS WE WE WE EXPECT CASH TO STILL BE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT CERTAINLY A LONGER CASH CYCLE AS WE MOVE THROUGH UM WI- AND WE'RE REALLY MANAGING YOU KNOW PAYMENTS AS TO THE COLLECTIONS WERE RECEIVING TO MAINTAIN OUR STRONG CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONS UM YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS UM A LOT OF THAT'S YOU KNOW GONNA DEPEND O- UM FOR SURE BUT WE KNOW WE'LL MAINTAIN OUR CASH POSITION IN OUR LIQUI- AND HOW ABOUT THE COST IS THERE ANY VERY ROUGH G- I'D POST FOR THE YEAR UH IN LIGHT OF ABOUT 63 MILLION IN Q1 THERE'LL BE SOME SOME INCREMENTAL UM I DON'T HAVE THE I DON'T HAVE

INTO THE TRANSACTION WE HAVE ALL THESE SERVICEABILITY AS TO WHAT THAT FUNNEL COULD UH COULD COULD POTENTIALLY BE ROUGHLY THE A $100 MILLION COMES FROM A COMBINATION OF STRUCTURAL SAVINGS UH A RATIONALIZATION KIND OF NON-MANUFACTURING ALLUDED TO ON THE INVESTOR SIDE WE HAVE NOW A PRETTY GOOD DATABASE O- ALL THE UH UH THE LOCATIONS ACROSS THE WORLD AND THAT IS GIVEN US A VERY GOOD WAY FOR US TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AND RATIONALIZE UH NOT SO MUCH THE M- ARE COMING YEAR TWO YEAR THREE BUT MORE MORE THE UH THE OLDER KIND OF PERSPECTIVE SO SO UM THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION UM LIQUIDITY IS IN A STRONG POSITION UM YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THE ONE-OFF THINGS IS OPERATION UM YOU KNOW AND AND SOME OF THE EXTRA THINGS EMILY JUST REFERENCED UH WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU GUYS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE WITH THE CASH OUTFLOW AND THEN UM SECONDARILY ARE YOU <INAUDIBLE> TO DO THAT THAT WE'RE GOING INTO UH SOME SORT OF RECESSION HERE WHO KNOWS HOW LONG <INAUDIBLE> OPPORTUNITY IS

S- OUR SERVICE YEAH YEAH I THINK UH UH UH TELL ME CHINA WAS DEFINITELY IMPACTED LARGELY IN IN IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY UH THE LEGACY IR BUSINESS THEY HAVE A PRINTER WITH SIZEABLE UH CHINA UH EXPOSURE UH UH YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF THE SERVICE UH YOU KNOW WE WE WE STILL SERVE AS BETTER TYPICALLY WE TYPICALLY WE SOLD ROUGHLY ABOUT TWO TIMES FROM A PERCENTAGE PERSPECTIVE BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN THAT THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT AND JUST TO KIND OF GIVE YOU UH MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE COLOR HERE UH PARTICULARLY AS AS YOU KNOW WAYS OF COMPARING SOME OF THE YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY IS COMPOSED OF MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES COMPRESSORS VACUUMS AND BLOWERS AND UH A C- COMPRESSOR BUSINESS IS CLEARLY WITHIN THE WHEN WE ARE SPECIFICALLY COMPARE TO SOME OTHER COMPETITORS COUPLE OF DATA POINTS THAT WE LOOK AT SO THE THIRD PARTY REPORT UH UH AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW TO JUST TO GIVE YOU A FURTHER PERSPECTIVE THE LEGACY GARDNER DENVER BUSINESS IN Q1 ORDERS WERE DOWN IN THE LOW SINGLE- IN THE MARKET AND UH YOU KNOW SINCE SINCE WE SINCE WE DIDN'T OWN THE LEGACY IR FOR THE FULL QUARTER UH WE JUST TEND TO NOT COMMENT ON WHAT WE SAW SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW- I MEAN IN FEBRUARY THAT THEY SOLD FROM AN ORDER PERSPECTIVE BUT THAT HOPEFULLY GIVES YOU A GOOD PERSPECTIVE AS TO HOW ON EVEN ON THE LEGACY <INAUDIBLE> GREAT THANKS THANKS V- VICENTE BUSINESS THIS THIS BUSINESS IS SO SMALL NA- THAT'S SO MUCH INVOLVEMENT BUT IF IF IF IF IT IS DOWN 8% IN THE QUARTER IMPLIES YOU KNOW <INAUDIBLE> I MEAN IS IT POSSIBLE TO TO <INAUDIBLE> GIVEN THAT YOU'RE KIND OF EXPECTING THIS BUSINESS TO TO BE

I ALSO SO FOR SURE YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TARGETING TO BE YOU KNOW THE BRE- BREAKEVEN AND EVEN EVEN POSITIVE UH I MEAN WE'RE TAKING SOME PRETTY PRETTY AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS A HUNDRED PERCENT AFTER MARKET AND CONSUMABLE SO THAT THAT KIND OF CARRIES A MUCH BETTER UH MARGIN PROFILE TOO AS WELL AND YOU KNOW THOSE FACTORIES THAT ARE KIND OF NOT UH NOT NOT UH NEEDED BASED ON VOLUME I MEAN WE'RE BASICALLY KEEPING THEM UH CLOSE OR OR VERY VERY LOW UH EXPOSURE SO HE HAD A GOOD PLAYBOOK ON HOW HOW TO NAVI- HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE WORK A- AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE SEE THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY OVERCOME THESE KIND OF LONG-TERM TERM AND OUR PLAN IS THAT IT'S GONNA BE DOWN FOR A WHILE UH AND AND TO THE SAME QUESTION YOU KNOW I MEAN CLEARLY IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A MARKET THAT AS YOU SAW WE JUST INVESTED IN A NEW FLUID AND TECHNOLOGY SO AND YOU KNOW WE CAN BE READY FOR CAPTURING S- GREAT THANKS VERY MUCH OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM JEFF SPRAGUE FROM VERTICAL RESEARCH PARTNERS THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UM- MORNING TO YOU W- WHY DON'T WE JUST COME BACK TO SERVICE FOR A MOMENT VINCENTE UH INTERESTING COMMENT ABOUT THE UTILIZATION DOWN FROM UH 30% BUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY INTERPRET AND A- A- APPLY THAT TO A FORWARD SALES ARE GONNA BE DOWN 30% AND THE SERV- DOES NOT BELIEVE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH DATA HISTORICALLY UH TO KIND OF PIECE THAT TOGETHER BUT WHAT DOES THAT DOWN 30% TELL YOU YEAH JEFF UH GREAT QUESTION I HINTED UH SO IN TERMS OF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF HISTORICAL BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A LOT OF THESE REMOTE UH MONITORING SYSTEMS AND CONNECTIVITY WITH THE IOT PLATFORMS THAT WE BOTH COMPANIES HAVE NOW UH IS FAIRLY NEW UH BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO TO THEN BREAK IT DOWN BY THE SPECIFIC UH UH SUB AND MARKET THE INDICATION HERE IS THAT IT FINALLY KNOW WHERE ARE THOSE MARKET THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PLAY OR DOUBLE DOWN FROM A SERVICE PERSPECTIVE SO IT'S HELPING US TO REDIRECT THE TEAMS UH IT IS ALSO HELPING US TO REALLY BETTER UH SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE STILL MORE RESILIENT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF BEING DOWN 30% UH I MEAN I THINK WE JUST SEE THAT AS AS A BIT OF INDICATION AS TO WHAT COULD HAPPEN HERE HERE UH BUT UH AS YOU HE WAS A GREAT CORRECT CORRELATION OF WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF HISTORICAL DATA TO SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS JUST TAKING THAT DATA POINT TO KEEP FOCUSING THEM ON THOSE AREAS REGIONS AND MARKETS THAT UH THAT WE'RE STILL SEEING SOME VERY GOOD UTILIZATION OF THEIR COMPRESSORS AND AND ANY ANSWERS YOU NOTED ITS OBVIOUSLY INCLUDES MORE THAN COMPRESSORS THAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT UH THOSE OTHER SORT OF PRODUCTS AR- AREAS OUTSIDE OF VACUUMS AND BLOWERS WERE SUBSTANTIAL YES SO FOR SURE YES I MEAN FOR SURE THE UH THE POWER TOOL AND THE LIFTING BUSINESS UH UH WAS ONE THAT IT WAS WORSE UH THAN THAT UH I MEAN THE POWER TOOLS AS CATS UH THEY HAVE UH TWO MAIN PRODUCT LINES I MEAN IT'S THAT TOOL BUSINESS BUT ALSO THEY HAVE UH A A LIFTING BUSINESS UH THAT IS KIND OF MORE RELATED TO TO FACTORY CONSUMPTION OR FACTORY UH RATIONALIZATION SO I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THAT WAS IMPACTED UH MORE SO UH AND THEN CHINA AS A REGION WAS DEFINITELY UH UH HEAVILY IMPACTED UH AND UH YOU KNOW FROM UH FROM THE OTHER PRODUCT LINES IN TERMS OF THE LONGER CYCLE UH WHICH THESE ARE KIND OF BRANDS LIKE A UH NASH GIL <INAUDIBLE> AND LIKO GREEN VACUUMS THOSE ARE MORE LONGER CYCLE AND THOSE WERE I WOULD SAY MORE STABLE AND RESILIENT RIGHT THANK YOU YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM DAVID ROSSEAU FROM EVERCORE ISI YOUR LINE IS OPEN GOOD MORNING UH MY QUESTION'S ABOUT IN THE ITS THE INVENTORY AND THE CHANNEL AND YOU THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE RECENT IMPROVEMENT YOU'VE SEEN CAN YOU GIVE US SOME SENSE ON ANY SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT SORT OF A LEADER LAG OKAY AND ALSO THE MIX SO YOUR BUSINESS IS BEING SHORT CYCLE VERSUS LONG CYCLE CAN YOU JUST GIVE US SOME SENSE OF THE INVENTORY IN THOSE CHANNELS THE THE LAG YOU WOULD NEED TO SEE OR THAT YOU WOULD EXPERIENCE IF IF SAY THE PMI HAS GOT BETTER FOR EXAMPLE UH YEAH THERE I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN LOOK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INVENTORY IN THOSE CHANNELS UH I MEAN THERE'S JUST NO- THESE FROM A FROM A COMPRESSOR PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY THE ONE THAT HAS UH THE BIGGEST SIZE OF THE DISTRIBUTION THAT WORK AND AND IT IS ALSO A MORE PARTICULARLY TOWARDS THE GARDNER DENVER BRANDED PRODUCTS UH YOU KNOW WE DON'T TEND TO HAVE A LOT OF INVENTORY BECAUSE THESE THESE ARE PARTICULARLY SMALLER DISTRIBUTORS MORE SO <UNK> UH MORE THAN LOCALIZED THEY DON'T TEND TO TO PUT A LOT OF CASH UPFRONT TO HAVE COMPRESSORS ON THE SHELF SO TO SPEAK I MEAN MAYBE ON THE SMALLER COMPRESSORS THEY THEY MAY UH BUT NOT ON THE MEDIUM TO HIGH LEVEL COMPRESSORS AND AND THE INVENTORY WILL COME IN MORE ON CONSUMABLES AFTERMARKET I'M REALLY MOVE FAIRLY UH FA- FAIRLY WELL I MEAN THEY TURN PRETTY QUICKLY VICENTE JUST SO I'M CLEAR IS IT A STABILIZATION AT A LOW LEVEL AFTER THE INITIAL SHOCK IN ITS OR HAVE YOU SEEN SOME YOU KNOW LITTLE IMPROVEMENT IN ORDER SEQUENTIALLY AND I'LL BE CURIOUS IS THAT MORE SHORT CYCLE OR LONG CYCLE YEAH I KNOW YEAH GREAT QUESTION YEAH IT IS I WOULD I WOULD CATEGORIZE IT AS A SET OF CIVILIZATION AND UH UH INITIALLY AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU LOOK WITHIN THE MONTH I MEAN A- AT THE MONTH OF APRIL YOU KNOW THERE SOME UH SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT ON THE SECOND HALF OF APRIL C- BUT AGAIN WAS THAT MORE SHORT CYCLE IMPROVEMENT SHORT CYCLE YEAH MORE SHORT CYCLE YEAH SHORT CYCLE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU V- THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT SURE YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM JOSH POKLINSKY F- IS OPEN HI GOOD MORNING ALL MORNING JOSH UM SO VICENTE I GUESS YOU KNOW E- EVERYONE HERE ON THE CALL KIND OF HAVE SAME MOST QUESTIONS THA- SO WE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND ALREADY UM BUT I GUESS YOU KNOW JUST WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTARY AROUND UTILIZATION UM AND WITH THE COMMENTS YOU MADE AROUND SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTION HOW MUCH OF THE DECLINE THAT YOU'RE SEEING AND YEAH I GUESS THIS COMMENT IS MOSTLY AN ITNS COMMENT IS RELATED TO YOU KNOW CUSTOMER SHUT DOWNS OR SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTION IN IN SOME FORM LIKE YOU KNOW THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEMAND COMES BACK 'CAUSE I I I THINK SOME OF THESE POINTS ON YOU KNOW SERVICE OR UTILIZATION THAT MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE THE THE STEADY STATE YOU KNOW STATE OF THE WORLD THERE YEAH JUST I'LL SAY MORE SO UH I I I IN IN CHINA UH IF I IF YOU WANNA THINK ABOUT IT KIND OF THAT UH DISRUPTION UH COMPLETELY UH ALSO IN THE IN THE FIRST QUARTER MAYBE SOME DISRUPTION UH FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF UH IN IN EUROPE PARTICULARLY IN ITALY UH I MEAN WE DO HAVE SOME VERY GOOD MANUFACTURING BASE IN ITALY UH AND AND AND WE ALTHOUGH WE STAYED OPERATIONALLY I MEAN MOST OF OUR SUPPLIERS HAD TO SHUT DOWN UH UH I I WOULD SAY THAT UH NOW UH AS KIND OF THE COMMENT THAT I MADE BEFORE WE SEE KIND OF THESE LOWER DEMAND LEVEL KIND OF GETTING MORE STABILIZED UH BUT UH BUT YOU KNOW STILL YOU KNOW NOT SEEING THAT UH THAT KIND OF RECOVERY AND WE'RE JUST KIND OF WAITING TO SEE HOW THE RECOVERY WILL WILL PLAY OUT OKAY THEN SWITCHING OVER TO THE UH TO THE SYNERGY FUNNEL I MEAN IT SOUNDS LIKE THE THE YEAR THREE UM A PIPELINE OF ACTIVITY YOU KNOW KIND OF HAS TO STAY THERE AS YOU KNOW BACK ON OTHER THINGS FIRST SINCE WE'RE MANUFACTURING CENTRIC FAIR TO SAY THAT THE INCREMENTAL STEP UP IN SYNERGIES THAN IN THE YEAR TWO IS IT'S SMALLER I GUESS IS YOU KNOW IT'S JUST MORE OF A PULL FORWARD FROM YEAR TWO OR OR YOU KIND OF IMPLICITLY SAYING HEY WE THINK THERE'S MORE THAN 250 HERE WE'RE JUST YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON THIS AS FAST AS WE CAN AND WE'LL UPDATE YOU AS WE KNOW MORE YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY THE CASE WE THINK WE THINK UH WE WANNA KEEP IT AT 250 JUST BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S PRUDENT UH AND AND WE THINK IT'S PRUDENT BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE I MEAN CLEARLY FOCUSED ON A LOT OF THE UH INTERNAL FUNNEL AND EXECUTION YOU SEE HOW WE ACCELERATED AND WE EXECUTED I MEAN THIS IS NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE EXECUTED BUT THERE'S A COMPONENT AROUND PROCUREMENT AND UH AND UH AND I TO BE SAVINGS UH INNOVATIVE VALUE THAT IS GOING INDEPENDENT AND WHEN WE DID A 250 MI- MILLION DOLLAR CUSTOMERS IN YOUR FUNNEL IT WAS ON BASED ON 2019 KIND OF UH UH RUNWAY LEVEL SO TO SPEAK OR SPEND LEVELS SO WE JUST WANNA BE PRUDENT FROM UH FROM KIND OF GOING OUT THERE AND SAYING THAT THE 250 WILL INCREASE UH YOU KNOW ONCE WE'RE WE'RE READY WE'LL DEFINITELY AND WHEN WE SEE AS KIND OF MORE STABILITY OR NOMA- NORMALIZATION IN THE MARKETS MAYBE WE COME BACK WITH THAT BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE'RE WE'RE ACCELERATING WHAT WE CAN CONTROL AND WE KNOW THAT WE CAN CONTROL THAT STRUCTURAL HEAD COUNTDOWN AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE EXECUTED WE KNOW WE CAN CONTROL A LOT OF THE QUICK GAINS IN PROCUREMENT BECAUSE COMMODITIES ARE LOWER AND WE ARE EXECUTING THAT AND WE KNOW WE CAN CONTROL A LOT OF DISCRETIONARY SPEND AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ALSO EXECUTED SO WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON KIND OF GOING THROUGH THE LIST OF THINGS THAT WE CAN REALLY EXECUTE RIGHT APPRECIATE THE COLOR <INAUDIBLE> YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM NATHAN JONES FROM STIEFEL YOUR LINE IS OPEN MORNING EVERYONE MORNING NATHAN HEY UH YOU KNOW REVENUE DOWN 8.6 X FX MARGINS UP 120 BASIS POINTS SO CLEARLY SOME VERY GOOD CONTROL LAG ON WHAT DROVE THE VERY GOOD DECREMENTAL THERE UH HOW DO YOU SAY THE DECREMENTAL IS GOING FORWARD AND AND MAYBE ANY COLOR YOU CAN GIVE US ON WHAT YOU THINK THE LONG TERM MARGIN OPPORTUNITIES IN THAT BUSINESS HEY NATHAN THIS IS UH UH UH YOU KNOW I'LL I'LL SAY SOME VERY GOOD COST CONTROLS BUT ALSO SOME VERY GOOD MOMENTUM THAT WE HAD ALSO FROM THE MEDICAL UH BUSINESS IF YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE MEDICAL BUSINESS WE WERE SEEING UPWARDS OF 200 BASIS POINTS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT AND THE MEDICAL BUSINESS FINISHING LAST YEAR AT ROUGHLY YOU KNOW 30 31% UH EBITDA MARGIN SO AGAIN VERY GOOD MOMENTUM FROM THAT BUSINESS AND AND AND CLEARLY AS WE SAW SOME SUPPLIERS IN THE MARKET THE TEAM CONTINUED TO EXECUTE THOSE UH TARGETS THAT THEY NEEDED THEY NEEDED NEEDED TO GET DONE YOU KNOW I THINK E- WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BUSINESS THAT UH I MEAN HAS SOME VERY NICE GROSS MARGINS AND UH YOU KNOW THE DECREMENTAL THE BASE DECREMENTALS ARE TYPICALLY YOU KNOW 45 OR SO I MEAN PRETTY GOOD JOB THAT THE TEAM DATA HERE IN ORDER TO GET THAT DECREMENTAL DOWN TO THE 15% UH AND I'LL SAY YOU KNOW FROM A LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE WE'LL WE'LL DEFINITELY COME COME BACK UH WITH WITH WITH GIVING SOME KIND OF MEDIUM TO LONGTERM PERSPECTIVE I'LL JUST DO A QUICK COMPARISON THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT MEDICAL WE WERE ABLE TO UH YOU KNOW NOT NOT ONLY YOU KNOW JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THAT MEDICAL BUSINESS WASN'T THE 25 26% EBITDA MARGIN AND WE FINISHED YOU KNOW LAST YEAR IN THE 31% EBITDA MARGIN AND THERE'S A JUST A LOT OF GOOD COMMONALITIES BETWEEN THE MEDICAL AND THE LEGACY UH YOU KNOW PFS ON AERO BUSINESS THAT ARE WITHIN THIS SEGMENT OKAY MAYBE JUST A ONE ON RECEIVABLES UM WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGH THAT DO YOU SEE ANY CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK ANY COL- RISK THERE I GUESS IT'S PARTICULARLY AN UPSTREAM COMMENT UH GIVEN THE WAY GIVEN THE WAY THAT MARKET'S GOING BUT ANYWHERE ELSE YOU SEE YOU KNOW ANY POTENTIAL ISSUES IN RECEIVABLES HOW ARE YOU GOING ABOUT MANAGING CUSTOMER CREDIT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I MEAN I WOULD SAY NOT NECESSARILY THEY I MEAN I THINK IT'S R- IT'S ONE THAT WE WE WE WE WE LIVE BY DAY BY DAY I MEAN CLEARLY THE UH ON THE

THAT UH YOU KNOW FROM AN UPSTREAM PERSPECTIVE THAT OUR BUSINESS IS CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL FOR WHEN THE MARKET COMES BACK UP AGAIN SO UH WE HAVE BEEN PRETTY STRICT IN UH IN MANY CASES THAT UH THAT WE NEED TO SEE THE PAYMENTS OR WE WILL STOP SHIPMENTS AND THEN WE SEIZE UH TO TO PROVIDE ANY TYPE OF UH ANY TYPE OF UH UH OUTPUT OF PRODUCTS E- EITHER NOW OR LATER IN THE IN THE FUTURE SO I THINK WE'RE

CHARACTERIZE THE WAY YOU SEE INCREMENTALS COMING OUT YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DOWNTURN YEAH I KNOW SO YEAH THAT THAT'S SO GREAT I MEAN I THINK I THINK YOU KNOW WE TYPICALLY SEE KIND OF THE BASE UH WHAT I CALL THE BASE LEVEL OF INCREMENTAL TO BE YOU KNOW FOR THE TOTAL BUSINESS BETWEEN 35 TO 40% UH AGAIN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT UH PRECISION AND SCIENCE MAYBE HIGHER THAN THAT UH SPECIALTY VEHICLES UH LOWER THAN THAT WHERE MAYBE INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY IS ABOUT THAT LEVEL UH YOU KNOW DEFINITELY WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A HEADWIND UH AS WE SEE A LOT OF THESE UH STRUCTURAL ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE DOING TO TO COME THROUGH FRUITION UH WE ALSO SEE A LOT OF UH YOU KNOW TAILWINDS UH I'M SORRY WE SEE TAILWINDS THAT A LOT OF THESE KIND OF STRUCTURAL COSTS COME OUT WE

AVERAGE BUT BUT BUT HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS SORT OF UH IT JUST STRUCK ME THAT IT WAS IT WAS SLIDES SPECIFICALLY IN THE SLIDES YEAH I MEAN I THINK I THINK THIS IS A SEGMENT WE LIKE A LOT BY THE BY THE WAY THAT UH THAT TH THESE BUSINESSES ARE KIND OF SO KIND OF NICHE AND AND VERY VERY SOLID UH MARKET POSITIONS UM AND AND IT HAS JUST A LOAD OF GREAT UH UH DESCRIPTORS SUCH AS YOU KNOW KIND OF HIGH GROSS MARGINS AND AND AND VERY SPECIALIZED BOMBS THAT UH THAT ARE KIND OF REALLY SOLIDLY MISSION CRITICAL UH IN THE IN THE IN THE PROCESSES WHERE THEY WHERE THEY APPLY UH YOU KNOW WE WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL NOT ONLY IN ORGANIC BUT ALSO ORGANICALLY UH AND WE'RE DOING A LOT OF WORK ON THAT WHETHER YOU TAKE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE UH THE ARL AND COMBINE THAT WITH THE UH WITH THE UH LIKE A UH EITHER A HASKELL BRANDED PRODUCT OR A MILTON ROY PRODUCT AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY CREATE SOME UNIQUENESS UH IN TERMS OF APPLICATIONS AND THEN ENTER SOME NEW MARKETS AND THAT'S WHAT WHAT A LOT OF THE TEAM ARE DOING IS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE UH ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL AND MINDFUL ON ON SOME OF THOSE VERTICAL MARKETS AND KIND OF NEW NICHE ADJACENT TECH- UH AREAS THAT WE WANT TO PLAY IN

COMPANY AND SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS WE WILL CONCLUDE THIS DAY'S CALL WITH A Q A SESSION AS A REMINDER WE WOULD ASK THAT EACH PARTICIPANT KEEP TO ONE QUESTION AND ONE FOLLOW UP TO ALLOW FOR ENOUGH TIME FOR OTHER PARTICIPANTS AT THIS TIME I WILL NOW TURN OVER TO VICENTE RENAL CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THANKS SHAEK AND GOOD MORNING TO EVERYONE ON THE CALL I WILL LIKE TO KICK OFF TODAY'S PRESENTATION BY SENDING OUR THOUGHTS TO ALL WHO H I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the ingersoll rand employees around the world. the pictures on slide four are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce who have adapted to the new realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers. every day i hear of new examples of our businesses providing mission critical products to our customers and i am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to this unprecedented time. Times while there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future, one thing i am sure about is that ingersoll rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities and serving our customers at the center of everything we do and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees. moving to slide five, i would like to grant everyone an overview of the critical priorities we were following during these challenging times when we closed the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated that within a matter of weeks, we would be facing a global pandemic. We will be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruptions to our customers, supply chain, and the day-to-day operations of the company. Our response speaks to how the AI-RX toolkit has effectively helped us plan, accelerate, and adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities: first, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers, and community; second, keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain times. AND FINALLY CONTINUING TO EXECUTE ON THE STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY AS WE HAVE MULTIPLE CATALYSTS TO DRIVE ONGOING VALUE CREATION THE STRENGTH OF INGRESOL RUN TEAM ALIGNED AROUND THESE THREE PRIORITIES WILL POSITION THE COMPANY TO EMERGE FROM THIS CRISIS AS A STRONGER AND MORE UNIFIED COMPANY THE NEXT SLIDE IS A REMINDER THAT OUR PURPOSE AND VALUES AS WELL AS OUR EXECUTION ENGINE THAT WE CALL I R X ARE REALLY AT THE HEART OF HOW WE OPERATE AS A COMPANY S IN THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES DURING THE INTEGRATION PROCESS WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THOUGHTFULLY CREATING THE COMPANY'S PURPOSE ONE THAT IS CENTERED AROUND OUR STAKEHOLDERS WHERE WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN LEAN ON US TO HELP MAKE LIFE BETTER THIS PURPOSE WHEN COMBINED WITH THE FOUR KEY VALUES THAT OUR TEAMS LIVE ON A DAILY BASIS CREATES A FRAMEWORK OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE AS A COMPANY AND THE BASIS OF HOW WE DO IT IS THE INGREDIENTS R The effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across ingersoll rand. Turning to slide seven, i would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the covid nineteen crisis since it had been swift and focused around two major components first is the health and safety and wellbeing of our employees, customers and communities and second, business continuity not only within operations but across the larger supply chain starting first with health and safety and continuing with business continuity not only within operations but across the larger supply chain starting first with health and safety and continuing with business continuity not only within operations but across the larger supply chain starting first with health and safety and continuing with business continuity not only within operations but across the larger supply chain starting first with health and safety and continuing with business continuity not only within operations but across the larger supply chain SAFETY, WE ACTIVATED OUR COVID NINETEEN TASK FORCE IN FEBRUARY AND HAD A FULL COORDINATED COMPANY PROJECT IN EARLY MARCH JUST WEEKS AFTER THE CREATION OF THE NEW COMPANY. OUR EXECUTION APPROACH HAS SERVED US VERY WELL AS WE WERE ABLE TO QUICKLY IMPLEMENT ENHANCED SITE SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND A MANDATORY WORK FROM HOME POLICY FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO CAN WORK REMOTELY. AND IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING THAT OUR QUICK ACTION H ARE MORE THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND GLOBAL EMPLOYEE BASES BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST IMPLEMENTING SAFETY PROTOCOLS IT'S ALSO ABOUT SUPPORTING AND ENGAGING THE EMPLOYEE BASE AS A RESULT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES INCLUDING A GLOBAL OUTREACH PROGRAM TO SOLICIT EMPLOYEE FEEDBACK OUR EMPLOYEES REACTED QUICKLY AND WITH A TRUE OWNERSHIP MINDSET PROVIDED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SUGGESTIONS WHEN WE ASKED FOR C They have thoughtful, in-depth suggestions many of which are actively implementing today. From a business continuity perspective, starting with our operations, as we previously communicated, we have seen plans largely in China, Italy, and India impacted due to COVID-19. China was largely impacted in the month of January and February and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April as things are now largely back to normal. Italy and India saw about a two-month lag to China with operations being affected in late March and into April. In these times, our sites around the globe are ninety-eight percent operational with India still being the most affected due to governmental restrictions on returning to work. The supply chain has seen a similar trend as the impact in China is largely behind us and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues. The Americas and EMEA regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in China. WEST AND ITALY HAVE STARTED TO COME BACK ON LINE IN A PAST FEW WEEKS WE HAVE SEEN THE NUMBER OF IMPACTED SUPPLIES DROP BY MORE THAN HALF WHICH IS A VERY GOOD SIGN AND WERE SUPPLEMENTING SUPPLIES FROM DUAL SOURCES FROM OTHER REGIONS WHERE POSSIBLE MUCH LIKE OUR OPERATIONS INDIA CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST IMPACTED ASPECT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND WE EXPECT THE SITUATION TO IMPROVE IN THE LATER HALF OF MAY WHEN GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS BEGIN TO EASE WE WELL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE STARTING WITH SLIDE EIGHT THROUGH THE USE OF I R E X WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD THE COST SINERGY FUNNEL TO OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH INCREASES ACROSS ALL MAJOR SAVING CATEGORIES AND WE CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF INCREMENTAL OPPORTUNITY AS A REMINDER WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION COST SINERGY OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLL Approximately four hundred and fifty million dollars of expense in connection with both achieving these cost synergies and the associated stand-up of the new company. As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters, the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believed we could accelerate based on market conditions, and that is exactly what we have done. We have dramatically increased the pace, having already executed on ninety million dollars of annualized structural cost reductions. With approximately four hundred and fifty million dollars of expense in connection with both achieving these cost synergies and the associated stand-up of the new company. As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters, the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believed we could accelerate based on market conditions, and that is exactly what we have done. We have dramatically increased the Approximately seventy million dollars in savings are expected to be delivered in twenty twenty the majority of these savings are coming from headcount actions already taken in the past two months as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization in addition we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiatives with rfqs for nearly one third of our historical direct materials spend base already launched as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed in twenty twenty Total, we're now expecting to deliver approximately thirty five percent of our overall synergy target in twenty twenty which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of ten to fifteen percent realization we're keeping the overall cost synergy target at two hundred and fifty million dollars over a three year time frame at this time to remain prudent on volatile dependent synergies like procurement and itb to be given the current environment it is not only the structural cost that that we're looking at it is not only the structural cost that that we're looking at it is not only the structural cost that that we're looking at it is not only the structural cost that that we're looking at it is not only the structural cost that that we're looking at it is not only the structural cost that that we're looking at it is not We have taken out, but also how we are supplementing our synergy deliver activities with thoughtful, short-term, cost reductions to protect margins. So let's move to slide nine to talk about that. In Q1, despite the 15 percent revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis, we were able to limit adjusted ebitda to less than 30 percent with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments. We expect this, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these, these Additional actions will yield forty to fifty million dollars of incremental cost savings in the pnl this year with a majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter. We will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if the demand environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly. What we're making some top decisions to control cost one area that we're not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise. MUCH LIKE WE DID BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AT GORDON DENVER WHERE WE INVESTED THROUGH THE BONDURANT TO CAPITALIZE ON MARKET SHARE GAINS AND NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES WERE FOLLOWING THE SAME PLAYBOOK TODAY INVESTMENTS IN R D AND D ARE BEING MAINTAINED AT SIMILAR LEVELS AS PRIOR YEARS AND WE CONTINUE TO FUND TARGETED COMMERCIAL INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE MANUFACTURING AND OUR I O T PLATFORMS THIS IS ALL PART OF THE STRATEGY TO PLAY O THROUGH THE INTEGRATION MOVING TO SLIDE TEN LET ME TALK ABOUT LIQUIDITY THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO HAVE A STRONG BALANCE SHEET WITH AMPLE LIQUIDITY AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRICE OUR LEGACY DEBT WHILE PLACING THE NEW ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR TERM LOAN TO CLOSE THESE TRANSACTIONS ALL OF OUR DEBT IS A TERM LOAN BASED STRUCTURE WITH VERY ATTRACTIVE PRICING AS THE US COMPONENTS ARE LIBOR PLUS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THE EU The term loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective and there are no maturities until twenty twenty seven. Liquidity also remains strong at one point six billion dollars as we finish the quarter with five hundred and fifty six million dollars of cash on the balance sheet and over a billion dollars of capacity on our existing credit facilities. As we look ahead, we continue to see several opportunities to unlock cash as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity. OPPORTUNITIES EXIST ACROSS WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH TAXES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE TELL WINDS FROM INTEREST EXPENSES IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AS ALL EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF LEGACY FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WILL EXPIRE BY SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE EVEN THOUGH WE FEEL OUR LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY IS PROPER WE ARE EVALUATING INCREMENTAL DEBT OR OTHER LIQUIDITY VEHICLES GIVEN THE ATTRACTIVE CONTENT STRATEGY REMAINS UNWAVERING YOU HAVE HEARD ME ALREADY REFERENCE SEVERAL ELEMENTS OF OUR STRATEGY AS WE'RE BUILDING THE CULTURE OF INGOLSTADT RAND WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AT THE CORE WE WILL CONTINUE TO ACT QUICKLY AND PRUDENTLY TO PROTECT MARGINS AND PRESERVE LIQUIDITY AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL POSITION THE COMPANY FOR FUTURE GROWTH BOTH ORGANICALLY THROUGH THROUGH OPPORTUNISTIC TARGETED BOLTON M&A OUR BUSINESS OPERATES IN And importantly, our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launch several of our ESG-oriented initiatives already. Overall, we have several value creation levers as we look ahead and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain macroeconomic landscape. I will now turn it over to Emily to walk you through the financials, Emily. INDICATOR: THE REPORTED FINANCIALS INCLUDE THREE MONTHS OF LEGACY GARDNER DENVER AND ONE MONTH OF THE LEGACY INGRESOL RAN RAND INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT IN Q1 TWENTY TWENTY AND ONLY THE LEGACY GARDNER DENVER BUSINESSES IN Q1 OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AS A RESULT, THE COMPARISONS ARE IMPACTED MATERIALLY BY THE TRANSACTION. WE'LL SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THIS PAGE AS A RESULT OTHER THAN TO MENTION THAT THE AS REPORTED NET INCOME IN Here includes a hundred and ninety seven million dollars of amortization, acquisition, restructuring and other adjustments which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation. Turning to slide thirteen to assist in cleaning comparatives for the quarter we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened as of january one, twenty eighteen from a total company perspective. EFFECT ADJUSTED REVENUE AND ORDERS DECLINED FOURTEEN PERCENT AND SEVEN PERCENT RESPECTIVELY AND WERE IMPACTED BY COVID NINETEEN REGIONALLY WE SAW NOTABLE DECLINES IN ASIA PACIFIC AS WELL AS SHARP DECLINES IN THE U S AND EUROPE TOWARDS THE END OF THE QUARTER MOST NOTABLY IN THE I T N S SEGMENT THIS LED TO BOOK TO FINISH AT ONE POINT ONE WON FOR THE QUARTER THE COMPANY DELIVERED TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT Adjusted ebitda had a decline of twenty four percent driven mostly by the volume declines in itns and the expected downturn in the hfps adjusted ebitda margins were sixteen point four percent down two hundred basis points from last year however are proactive cost controls within the business limited deleterious to twenty nine percent in terms of adjusted ebitda composition for the company The Legacy Gardner Denver business delivered ninety seven million as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately a hundred million which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment. The Legacy I R businesses delivered fifty one million of adjusted ebitda on march as opposed to a combined sixty million for january and february moving to slide fourteen free cash flow for the quarter was sixty million dollars. On a reported basis, including eight million dollars of capex, the Q1 free cash flow includes sixty three million dollars of outflows related to the transaction, comprised of thirty eight million dollars of synergy delivery and stand-up related costs and another twenty five million dollars of transaction fees. We also paid thirty eight million dollars of debt issuance costs in the quarter, which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement bringing our total. RELATED TO TRANSACTION OUTLOWS IN THE QUARTER TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM A LEVERAGE PERSPECTIVE WE FINISHED AT TWO POINT SIX TIMES AND WHILE WE DO EXPECT TO SEE SOME SHORT TERM INCREASE TO LEVERAGE WE HAVE SHOWN THE ABILITY TO DELEVER HISTORICALLY AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PAGE WILL REMAIN EXTREMELY DISCIPLINED ON CASH AND WE EXPECT OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES TO BE VERY ALIGNED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN HISTORICALLY Internal re-investments for growth prudent debt paydown and opportunistic bolt-on m&a we have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time i'll now turn it back to vincenzo to walk through the segments vincenzo thanks emily starting first with industrial technologies and services on slide 13 the itn segment first quarter adjusted order intake was eight hundred and eighty nine million dollars down from the previous quarter the itn segment first quarter adjusted order intake was eight hundred and eighty nine million dollars down from the previous quarter the itn segment first quarter adjusted order intake was eight hundred and eighty nine million dollars down from the previous quarter the itn segment first quarter adjusted order intake was eight hundred and eighty nine million dollars down from the previous quarter the itn segment first quarter adjust 99 PERCENT VERSUS PER YEAR EXCLUDING EFFECTS A JUST REVENUE IN THE QUARTER WAS SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS DOWN SEVENTEEN PERCENT EXCLUDING EFFECTS AND LEADING TO A BOOK TO BILL RATIO OF ONE POINT ONE TWO TIMES FROM A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE ASIA PACIFIC REVENUES WERE DOWN IN THE MID THIRTIES WITH EUROPE DOWN FIFTEEN PERCENT AND AMERICA'S DOWN SEVENTEEN PERCENT ALL EXCLUDING EFFECTS WE USE TH The Apex decline in Q1 is what we expect to see in America's and the media in the near term. This is the basis we're using to plan the cost controls for our business. But we're staying highly active with demand generation activities and pricing controls. We continue to demonstrate disciplined pricing, generating over one percent in the quarter. While these markets are more opaque than historically, we're using our unique data acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment. This is broken down into two areas: aftermarket and original equipment. For aftermarket, a leading indicator we have is actual compressor or utilization data as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide that are connected to our remote monitor and system. In America and Europe, we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last three weeks of march of nearly thirty percent with some recovery in the past three weeks of april. We're now using these as a way to know where our service teams need to focus while at the same time. At the same time, using it as a leading indicator for active market activity which is approximately fifty percent of the compressor business today. For original equipment, we're using the man generation leads. We said in the past that the man generation was a leading indicator of orders that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks with more than a thousand leads per week. We have a lot of commercial insight in our system. What we saw in the latter weeks of march was a drop of thirty percent versus what we saw earlier in the quarter. WITH SIMILAR TRENDS IN AMERICA AND EUROPE WE HAVE SEEN ALSO EARLY SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT OVER THE PAST THREE WEEKS OF APRIL BUT STILL APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OFF FROM THE HIGHS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE YEAR LET ME GIVE YOU NOW SOME COLOR FROM A PRODUCT LINE PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE SEEN VERY SIMILAR TRENDS ACROSS COMPRESSORS BLOWERS AND VACUUMS WHERE WE SAW ORDERS DOWN IN THE MID TO HIGH SINGLE DIGITS WE HAVE SPOKEN A According to a leading third-party report, the market in the U.S. was down 10% in dollars in the first quarter. GM's branded products were flat, and Ford's branded products were down 10%. But when you look into the details, you see the power of the two companies. GM saw good gains on low-to-medium horsepower machines, while Ford took care on high-horsepower compressors. This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal. This is a way to leverage the technology portfolio as well as the direct and indirect channels that both companies have. Power tools and lift, which is part of the segment, had a very tough quarter with orders and revenue down both over twenty percent. The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases that online retailers typically make in the first quarter to support first half of the year revenue. However, this quarter, in addition to the slowdown of the market, many online retailers also saw a decrease in sales due to supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their focus is to household essentials. Moving to non-gap at jeritol i t n s deliver a hundred and thirty-five million dollars in the quarter which was down twenty-five percent. Non-gap at jeritol i t n s margin was seventeen percent which was down one hundred and fifty basis points from the prior year. Our cause mitigation efforts help limit decremental to twenty-five percent in a segment that typically has basis decrementals of thirty-five to forty percent before cost actions. Moving to slide sixteen. The precision and science technology segment overall had solid performance in this economic environment as adjusted orders were two hundred eighteen million up two percent x f x adjusted revenue was one hundred ninety two million down nine percent x f x on strong prior year comps of twelve percent x f x growth and shipping delays due to covid nineteen this platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets In the first quarter, we saw orders grow high single digits in the legacy medical pump business as we are a leading key player in several applications like oxygen concentrators, respirators and liquid liquid. You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into at the bottom of the page. Our teams have been working twenty four seven providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight covid nineteen now and in the future. The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down two percent. X effects with a majority due to covid lockdowns in january and february in china and towards the end of the quarter in india what is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and order activity across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in the more industrial m markets moving on to non-gaap adjusted ebitda p and s deliver fifty three million dollars a quarter which is down six percent non-gaap adjusted ebitda p and s deliver fifty three million dollars a quarter which is down six percent WAS TWENTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT UP A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BASIS POINTS DRIVEN BY STRONG COST CONTROLS AND PRODUCTIVITY LEADING TO DECREMENTAL MARGINS OF ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT MOVING TO SLIDE SEVENTEEN AND THE SPECIALTY VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY SEGMENT PRIORITIES FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE TO CONTINUE TO CAPTURE GROWTH IN A PROFITABLE MANNER WE SEE THAT THIS SEGMENT CAN EXPAND MARGINS WITH THE USE OF THE SAME I R X TOOLS WE HAVE USED AC BUSINESS MOVING FORWARD HAVING SAID THAT THIS BUSINESS PERFORMED VERY WELL IN THE FIRST QUARTER ADJUSTED ORDERS WERE TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN AN ADJUSTED REVENUE WAS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS UP EIGHT PERCENT AND SEVEN PERCENT RESPECTIVELY WITH A BOOST IN BILL OF ONE POINT ONE FIVE RATE WAS DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTH IN GOLD CONNECTIVITY AND CONSUMER PRODUCT LINES THE BUSINESS SAW STRONG DOUBLE DIGIT ORDER MOMENT MARCH 2023\n\nWHILE THERE IS A LOT TO BE EXCITED ABOUT, WE ARE EXPECTING Q2 TO BE DOWN COMPARED TO LAST YEAR FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, LAST YEAR WAS A TOUGH COMP, AS THE BUSINESS HAD SOME SUPPLIER ISSUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHERE SOME PRODUCT WAS SHIFTED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND TWO, THE BUSINESS IS NOT IMMUNE TO THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. WHILE APRIL ORDERS WERE DOWN YEAR OVER YEAR The team worked quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques widely used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate. Secondly, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations, we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed. Moving to no gap adjusted yibida, specialty vehicles deliver eighteen million dollars in the quarter, down one percent. No gap adjusted yibida was nine point nine percent, which was down. EIGHTY BASIS POINTS DUE TO STRATEGIC GROWTH, INVESTMENTS AND PUBLIC MIX. MOVING TO SLIDE EIGHTEEN AND THE HIGH PRESSURE SOLUTION SEGMENT. IN THE BUSINESS PERFORMED ABOVE OUR EXPECTATIONS IN A TOUGH OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WITH ADJUSTED ORDERS OF EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND ADJUSTED REVENUES OF NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS DOWN TWENTY SIX PERCENT AND TWENTY NINE PERCENT RESPECTIVELY. I SUSPECT THE REVENUE BASE IN THE BUSINESS With sequential adjusted orders up six percent and sequential adjusted revenues up twenty six percent versus the fourth quarter of two thousand nineteen we continue to see sequential gain opportunities in aftermarket and specifically consumables where we saw orders and revenue up double digits sequentially this allowed us to deliver non-GAAP adjusted ebitda of twenty four million dollars on margins of twenty four point six percent which was down from last year's level of thirty eight point eight percent but sequentially better by over four hundred basis points. Activities and intensity have always been key indicators for this business. As we pivot to the second quarter and the rest of the year, a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity. We can measure that in multiple ways, but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market. As a reminder, each frac fleet has about sixteen to eighteen trucks with each truck carrying one pump. Each pump has a fluid end, and every fluid end utilizes consumables. While Q1 at twenty twenty, on average, we saw three hundred and eighteen active fleets. The price in march was two hundred and forty. we expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter where we believe fifty active fleets due to the recent dynamics in the market with the oversupply and lower pricing for oil will have an impact on revenues within this segment. and because of that, we're taking a very proactive stance to drive the proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come. moving to slide nineteen, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of how we're doing. Overall, the total company's down approximately twenty percent in orders as the month began very slow, particularly in U.S. and European markets. However, the order momentum throughout April we expect total revenue to be low. In terms of orders, both industrial technology and services and specialty vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average while precision and science technology is performing considerably better with positive year-over-year orders performance thus far as a result of continuous strength in medical devices. AND NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE HIGH PRESSURE SOLUTION SEGMENT IS NOW DOWN TO A MARKET RESET FOR WHAT WILL LIKELY BE A PROLONGED DOWN TURN THAT WE EXPECT WILL LAST FOR A NUMBER OF QUARTERS AS WE LOOK FORWARD DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN, WE WILL NOT BE PROVIDING Q2 OR TOTAL YEAR GUIDANCE TO BEST MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND IN SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING THE RIGHT STEPS TO MANAGE AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON CASH FLOWS A CURRENT MODEL SHOWS THAT THE BUSINESS WILL NEED AN ANNUAL BASIS TO BE CASH FLOW BREAK EVEN USING QUITE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS AROUND WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPEX COUPLED WITH THE COST OF ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN THUS FAR WE FEEL THAT THIS PUTS US IN A VERY SOLID POSITION MOVING FORWARD WHEN COMPARED TO CURRENT ORDER TRENDS AND COUPLED WITH OUR CURRENT LIQUIDITY POSITION MARKS I WANT TO SAY THAT WHAT WE MANAGE THROUGH WHAT WE WILL NO DOUBT BE A TOP SECOND QUARTER WE FEEL THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT THESES IN THE COMPANY HAS NOT CHANGED INGRAINED RANCH IS A PREMIER INDUSTRIAL COMPANY OF OUR TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE MULTIPLE LEVERS FOR ACCELERATING VALUE CREATION BUT WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON THE CURRENT PARAMETERS OF OUR LIQUIDITY WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE THIS BY UNLOCKING CASH AS WELL AS TAKING ADV ADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT RATE ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE A CULTURE OF EXECUTION AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE CURRENT CONDITIONS TO BE STRATEGIC ON BOLT ON ACQUISITIONS WITH THIS WE WILL TURN TO GENERAL AUDIENCE AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE IN ORDER TO ASK A QUESTION NUMBER ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEY PAD IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE CUE I MAY PRESS THE POWER BUTTONS YOURSELF TO ONE QUESTION AND WELL YOUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM ANDY CAPELLITZ FROM CITY GROUP YOUR LINE IS OPEN GOOD MORNING GUYS HOW ARE YOU WELL MORNING ANDY HOW ARE YOU VICENTE CAN YOU GIVE US MORE COLOR INTO THE APRIL ORDER DECLINE YOU'RE SEEING AND YOUR LARGEST SEGMENT IN IT N S FIRST OF ALL HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR FROM THAT POWER TOOL BUSINESS IS I now have, you know, smaller ups and downs.

I'M SURE YOU YOU EXPECT US TO ASK ABOUT DECIMAL MARGINS IN SOME WAY. SO LET ME JUST ASK IT LIKE THIS. I'M OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW, GOOD RESULT IN Q1 OF OVER THIRTY YOU KNOW HOW DO I THINK ABOUT DECIMAL MARGINS WITH HIGH PRESSURE SOLUTIONS YOU KNOW THE ORDERS DOWN EIGHTY PERCENT CAN YOU HOLD DECIMAL MARGINS THERE IN THE MID FORTIES AT WHAT POINT THAT'S FIXED C PERCENTAGE DECREMENTALS WITH A TWENTY PERCENT DECLINE THAT YOU'RE SEEING OVERALL IN THE REST OF THE BUSINESS BUSINESS WITH A SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN BUSINESSES LIKE A HIGH PRESSURE AS YOU MENTIONED AS WELL AS THE PRECISION AND SCIENCE BECAUSE OF A NICE HIGH GROSS MARGINS THAT THOSE BUSINESSES HAVE AND YOU KNOW LOWER ON THE SPECIALTY VEHICLES AND THE INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY THEY TEND TO PLAY IN THAT KIND OF FORTY PERCENT FORTY PERCENT RANGE YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE TAKEN VERY DECISIVE ACTIONS BETWEEN SYNERGIES AND THE SHORT TERM ACTIONS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS FOR THE TOTAL BUSINESS UNDER THIRTY PERCENT AND ANQ2 WILL CLEARLY SEE A BIT MORE PRESSURE FROM A TOP LINE PERSPECTIVE BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE DECREMENTALS WITH THE TARGET BEING CLOSER TO THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF AHVITA AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ACTIONS WE'RE WE'RE CLEARLY TAKING MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS AND HIGH PRESSURE AROUND COAST ACTIONS BASED ON WHAT WE SEE HERE WITH A LOT OF O BUSINESS TALK Of other cost-out actions and to those means that decremental margins narrow or not necessarily depending on mix and some other things. He may break it down into the two buckets as you suggested. On the forty to fifty that we spoke about that are kind of more related to discretionary or kind of volume related, those are largely second quarter and the third quarter with a good mix. I WOULD SAY MORE MORE SO ON THE ON THE SECOND QUARTER FROM A FROM THE COST SYNERGY PERSPECTIVE MILLION DOLLARS I MEAN OUT OF THE EIGHTY TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OF IN YEAR YOU KNOW ROUGHLY ACCOUNT AND I WILL SAY THAT IS KINDA CONSISTENT THIRD QUARTER AND FOURTH QUARTER WHILE THE OTHER ROUGHLY YOU KNOW TEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT COMES FROM PROCUREMENT IT IS REALLY MORE WEIGHTED TOWARDS THAT KIND OF THING Thank you for it.

Yeah, any very rough guesstimates for the year in light of about sixty three million in cue one? Will be some, some incremental costs. I don't have the, I don't have the figure at my fingertips, at my fingertips, Julie. I can get back to you on that. Your next question comes from Michael Holleran and from Baird. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone's doing well. So, so, could we just talk about the synergy funnel you referred to? You know, what are some of the incremental sources that originally identified two hundred and fifty? Maybe talk about the difference you're seeing. Have any new synergy opportunities to report? aye, as you recall, we all we did say that we were going for it. you know, as we with sixty days into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into into Manufacturing has alluded to on the investor side. we have now a pretty good database of all the locations across the world and that is giving us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize not so much the day-to-day but the other kind of perspective. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Some sort of recession here. Who knows how long this opportunity is going to last. To deploy capital more towards the D E M A side of things over the next couple of years. Are you positioning for that today? And any kind of thoughts on how you're thinking humbly about that capital side over the next six nine plus months? Yeah, no, absolutely, Mike. I mean, I think clearly over the next couple of years continue to be a really part of our strategy. You know, we see it's a very unique environment right now. we still see at this point in time, some very good funnel on also very good funnel around, you know, industrial technologies but they're really more relatable towards buttons. thank you. your next question comes from nigel co from wolf research. your line is up.

Try again later. Speech:\n\nPREFERRED LANGUAGE: SPANISH\n\nWould you expect revenues to kind of like just bounce along the trough here for the next several quarters? I mean, any colors that would be helpful?\n\nYeah, I mean, any colors that would be helpful. So, for sure, you know, that's what we're targeting to be, you know, the break even and even more positive. I mean, we're taking some pretty, pretty aggressive actions. A hundred percent after marketing consumables, so that kind of carries a much better margin.\n\nSo, so for sure, you know, that's what we're targeting to be, you know, the break even and even more positive. I mean, we're taking some pretty, pretty aggressive PROFILE TOO AS WELL AND YOU KNOW THOSE FACTORIES THAT ARE KIND OF NOT NOT NOT NEEDED BASED ON VOLUME I MEAN WE'RE BASICALLY KEEPING THEM CLOSED OR OR VERY VERY LOW EXPORTERS SO IT'S A GOOD PLAYBOOK ON HOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS AND HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE WORK AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE SEE THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY OVERCOME THIS KIND OF LONG TERM AND OUR PLAN IS THAT IT'S GONNA BE DOWN FOR A WHILE And to the final question, you know, clearly is a market that, as you saw, we just invested in a new fluid and technology. And you know, we can be ready for capturing so great, thank you very much. her next question comes from jeff sprague from vertical research partners. thank you, good morning, everyone. what would you like to know? An interesting comment about utilization down thirty percent. But how do we actually interpret and apply that to a forward-looking sales forecast that's going to be down thirty percent in the service industry? I don't know if you have enough data historically to kind of piece that together. But what does that down thirty percent tell you? REMOTE MONITORING SYSTEMS AND CONNECTIVITY WITH THE AYO PLATFORMS THAT WE BOTH COMPANIES HAVE NOW IS FULLY NEW BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO TO THEN BREAK IT DOWN BY THE SPECIFIC SUB END MARKETS THE INDICATION HERE IS THAT IT'S TELLING US WHERE ARE THOSE MARKETS THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PLAY OR DOUBLE DOWN FROM A SERVICE PERSPECTIVE SO IT'S HELPING US TO REDIRECT THE TEAMS IT IS ALSO HELPING US TO REALLY BETTER SERVE CUSTOMERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE STILL MORE RESILIENT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF BEING DOWN THIRTY PERCENT AH I MEAN I THINK WE JUST SEE THAT AS A BIT OF INDICATION AS TO WHAT COULD HAPPEN HERE HERE BUT AS YOU GAVE US A GREAT CORRELATION THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF HISTORICAL DATA TO SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS JUST TAKING THAT DATA POINT TO VERY GOOD UTILIZATION OF THEIR COMPRESSORS AND AND IN THE ANSWERS THAT YOU NOTED I T S OBVIOUSLY INCLUDES MORE THAN COMPRESSORS VACUUM PUMPS ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE I mean the power tools is cats they have a two main product lines, it's that tool business, but also they have a lifting business that is kind of more related to factory consumption or factory rationalization. so i think you know that that was impacted more so and then china as a region was definitely heavily impacted and you know from the other product lines in terms of the longer cycle which these are a kind of Lines are open. Thank you. Your next question comes from David Rosso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Good morning. My question is about in the iTunes podcasting in the channel and you think about some of the recent improvements you've seen. Can you give us a some sense of what those improvements are? On any sequential improvement sort of a lead lag and also the mix of your businesses being short cycle versus long cycle can you just give it some sense of the inventory in those channels the lag you would need to see or that you would experience if say the Pm's have got better for example I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're trying to say. Could you please rephrase or provide more context? Smaller compressors they may, but not on the medium to high level compressors and and the inventory will come in more on consumables aftermarket and really move fairly fairly well. I mean they turn fairly fairly well. You've seen just home clear is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in it's s or have you seen some little improvement in orders sequentially and i'd be curious is that more short cycle? For a long cycle? Yes, that's a great question. It is out categorized as the step stabilization and initially, and then obviously, when you look at it within the month, I mean, at the month of April, you know, there's some slight improvement on the second half of April. But but again, was that more of a short cycle improvement, or was it more of a long cycle improvement? Short cycle improvement. Short cycle improvement. Alright. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

SOME SUFFICIENT IN THE MARKET, THE TEAM CONTINUED TO EXECUTE THOSE TARGETS THAT THEY NEEDED TO GET DONE YOU KNOW I THINK IT WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BUSINESS THAT I MEAN HAS SOME VERY NICE GROSS MARGINS AND YOU KNOW THE DECREMENTAL THE PHASE DECREMENTALS ARE TYPICALLY YOU KNOW FORTY FIVE OR SO I MEAN PRETTY GOOD JOB THAT THE TEAM DID HERE IN ORDER TO GET THAT DECREMENTAL DOWN TO THE FIFTEENTH PERCENT AND I'LL SAY YOU KNOW FROM A L I'll just do a quick comparison and you can see that medical we were able to you know not only you know just a few years ago that medical business wasn't the twenty five twenty six percent ebitda margin and we finished you know last year in the thirty one percent ebitda margin and there's just a lot of good commonalities between the medical and the legacy you know pfs and a r o business that are within this segment okay maybe just one on receivables when you look through that do you see any cost savings? CREDIT RISK, ANY COLLECTIBLE ASSET RISK THERE? I GUESS IT'S PARTICULARLY AN UPSTREAM COMMENT GIVEN THE WAY GIVEN THE WAY THAT MARKET'S GOING BUT ANYWHERE ELSE YOU SEE ANY POTENTIAL ISSUES IN RECEIVABLES, HOW YOU'RE GOING ABOUT MANAGING CUSTOMER CREDIT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS? IT TAKES LONGER TO PAY BUT THEY STILL PAY YOU KNOW THEY DO THEY ALSO REALIZE THAT FROM AN OFFSHOOT PERSPECTIVE THAT OUR BUSINESS IS CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL FOR WHEN THE MARKET COMES BACK UP AGAIN SO WE HAVE BEEN PRETTY STRICT IN MANY CASES THAT THAT WE NEED TO SEE THE PAYMENTS OR WE WILL STOP SHIPMENTS AND THEN WE SEIZE TO PROVIDE ANY TYPE OF ANY TYPE OF OUTPUT OF PRODUCTS EITHER NOW OR LATER IN THE FUTURE SO I THINK WE'RE REALLY EXECUT The next question comes from Nicole De Blaise from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. Your next question comes from Nicole De Blaise from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. Your next question comes from Nicole De Blaise from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. So a lot of this has been answered, we've covered a lot of ground so far, but I just wanted to ask one into next year, as we think about approaching a recovery, there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here. We've got more to do. SAVINGS COMING THROUGH PRESUMABLY YOU HAVE TEMPORARY COSTS PROBABLY COMING BACK TO THE BUSINESS AND THEN JUST KIND OF DOVETAILING ALL OF THAT WITH TYPICAL INCREMENTAL MARGINS I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW HOW BETTER YOU CAN DO THIS VICENTE BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY YOU KNOW HELPFUL TO KIND OF CHARACTERIZE THE WAY YOU SEE INCREMENTALS COMING OUT YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DOWNTURN YEA YEA YEA YEA YEA YEA YEA YE YOU KNOW FOR A TOTAL BUSINESS BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY PERCENT AGAIN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRECISION AND SCIENCE MAYBE HIGHER THAN THAT SPECIALTY VEHICLES LOWER THAN THAT WITH MAYBE INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY ABOUT THAT LEVEL YOU KNOW DEFINITELY WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A HEAD WINDS AS WE SEE A LOT OF THESE STRUCTURAL ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE DOING TO COME TO FULFILLMENT WE ALSO SEE A lot of these kind of structural costs come out we see some of some of the headwinds but you know as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we kind of work with the teams we'll definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin obviously to be at a minimum at that days or more QUESTION COMES FROM JOHN WALSH FROM CREDIT SWISS YOUR LINE IS OPEN SORRY YOUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM MARCUS NITTMAYER FROM UBS YOUR LINE IS OPEN YEAH GUD MORNING EVERYBODY I JUST PUT ONE MORE ON THE ON THIS HI HI GUD MORNING EVERYBODY I DO APPRECIATE THAT OBVIOUSLY PROCUREMENT IS VOLUME DEPENDENT BUT YOU FLAG HERE TEN TO TWENTY MILLION YEAH Savings realized in twenty twenty and what do you currently assume as a sort of full run rate savings out of that wave one of the spend which i think is a third of your overall spend and how should we think about more medium term cuts for the other two thirds if you assume that at some point in a normalized world you get back to twenty nineteen levels let's start here yeah i think if you think about it twenty to twenty one you know coming in assuming that wave one of the spend which i think is a third of your overall spend and how should we think about more medium term cuts for the other two thirds if you assume that at some point in a normalized world you get back to twenty nineteen levels let's start here yeah i think if you think about it twenty to twenty one you know coming in assuming that wave one of the spend which i think is a MAYBE KIND OF CURRENT VOLUME LEVELS IT WILL BE TWENTY TO FORTY MILLION SO THAT'S MAYBE AT LEAST THAT WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE COMING FROM WAVE ONE ON AN ANALYZED LEVEL AT CURRENT VOLUMES AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IT'S ONLY COVERING YOU KNOW A PORTION OF THE TOTAL SPAN WITH WAVE TWO AND WAVE THREE COMING UP HERE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR right and if there's sort of an estimate you can give us what that would have been at nineteen volume levels that sort of twenty to forty million BUT IT WILL DEFINITELY BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT. I MEAN I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT WAS ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT. YOU COULD SAY ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY COULD BE UPWARDS OF SIXTEEN. OK. OK. AND THEN NEXT QUESTION ON CAPITAL ALLOCATION. YOU FLAGGED THE SLIDES WITH THE MOST INTERESTING THOSE BULLET POINTS IN P T. IT'S OBVIOUSLY PRETTY FRAGMENTED MARKET. YOU PROBABLY HAVE A SHARE OF CALL IT I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? NICHE AND VERY VERY SOLID MARKET POSITIONS AND IT HAS JUST A LOT OF GREAT DESCRIPTORS SUCH AS YOU KNOW KINDA HIGH GROSS MARGINS AND AND VERY SPECIALIZED PUMPS THAT ARE KINDA REALLY SOLIDLY MISSION CRITICAL IN THE IN THE PROCESSES WHERE THEY APPLY YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO SEE THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL NOT ONLY IN ORGANIC BUT ALSO ORGANICALLY AND WE'RE DOING A LOT OF WORK ON THAT WEATHER YOU TAKE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AH0 sil AA1 R OW1 sil AE1 N D K AH0 M B AY1 N DH AE1 T W IH1 TH DH AH0 sil W IH1 TH sil AH0 L AY1 K sil AH0 sil HH AE1 F K AO1 L B R AE1 N D IH0 D P R AA1 D AH0 K T sil AO1 R AH0 M IH1 L T AH0 N R OY2 P R AA1 D AH0 K T sil AE1 N D DH EH1 N Y UW1 K AE1 N AE1 K SH AH0 L IY0 K R IY0 EY1 T S AH1 M Y UW0 N IH1 K S sil IH Perspective we can we can acquire so so a lot of a lot of really great work strategically going on on this segment to really picture this and how do we kind of double it thanks a lot good luck thank you your next question comes from john walsh from credit suisse your line is open hi good morning sorry about that i had some technical difficulties earlier i'm glad to hear everyone's doing well You know, maybe just one question here. You alluded on the call to share gains on kind of both the legacy gdi and and iar businesses. I wanted to know if you could put a little more color around what's driving those. Is it something on the the product side? Is it, you know, some of the end market strategies you were doing previously around, you know, more niche markets like paper and pulp maybe some competitive pressures? FROM SMALLER GUYS, JUST ANY KIND OF COLOR YOU COULD PROVIDE THERE WOULD BE HELPFUL SURE JOHNYA, SO ANAT KAGATARIYA, I MEAN WHAT I SAID ON THE CALL IS THAT IT IS ON SPECIFIC HORSEPOWERS AND WHAT WE SAW THAT WE LIKED IS THAT THIS IS IN THE U S BASED ON THE THIRD PARTY REPORT, ZEE AND AND WE LIKED BECAUSE IT WAS VERY COMPLEMENTARY. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEGACY GUARDIAN DENVER WE SAW SOME SHARE TAKES IN THE LOW TO MEDIUM KIND OF LARGER HORSEPOWER COMPRESSORS I WILL CATEGORIZE THAT AS YOU KNOW ingersoll-rand has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the larger horsepower while as you know you know from a gardner denver perspective we have been more focused on the medium to small compressor and and i think you know this is what i mentioned on the call that this is a great hypothesis that we had on these great mergers and combining the two companies because now we have great new complementary products and spectrum of technologies that That, you know, a lot of these that i mention is on the oil lubricated which is very good solid core product line but as we spoke about during the april call now also the oil free product line spectrum. So so again it's it's it's new technology new products and and be able to to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the products that the teams are lunching great appreciate taking the question thank you john There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the company. Thank you. I just want to close out by saying thanks to everyone for your interest in Ingersoll Rand. I want to do another shout out and thank you to our employees that are obviously doing a lot of work here to stay healthy, stay safe, and at the same time, you know, provide to our customers our mission critical products that are needed in these current kind of market conditions. So hopefully everyone stays safe and And healthy. And we'll look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks. Thank you. ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. thank you for participating. you may now disconnect."

AUGUST WE INCREASED OUR REVENUE GUIDANCE FOR THE QUARTER BY MORE THAN 10% AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT ACTUAL RESULTS EXCEEDED THE HIGH END OF THAT REVISED GUIDANCE REVENUE FOR THE QUARTER WAS $32.7 MILLION UP 52% SEQUENTIALLY AND UP 29% OVER THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO TO PROVIDE SOME COLOR ON END MARKETS OUR REPORT SALES BY MARKET GROUP AS I HAVE IN THE PAST THE FIRST IS MOBILE IOT AND CONSUMER WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALES INTO MOBILE PHONES WEARABLE DEVICES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THIS WAS THE SEGMENT MOST IMPACTED BY THE GLOBAL SLOWDOWN IN Q2 BUT IT CAME BACK STRONG IN Q3 SALES WERE $20.9 MILLION OR 67 64% OF TOTAL SALES UP 105% SEQUENTIALLY AND UP 19% OVER THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO THE SECOND IS INDUSTRIAL AUTOMOTIVE AND AEROSPACE WHICH GOES INTO INDUSTRIAL AUTOMOTIVE

MILLION UP 5% SEQUENTIALLY COMPRISED OF 7.0 MILLION IN R&D AND 5.5 MILLION IN SG&A EXPENSE THE INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $0.1 MILLION AND THIS GENERATED NON- GAAP NET INCOME OF $4.4 MILLION OR 23 CENTS PER SHARE AND THAT'S COMPARED TO A LOSS IN THE PRIOR QUARTER OF 2.2 MILLION OR 14 CENTS A SHARE STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED PAYROLL TAXES WERE $5.1 MILLION THIS WAS HIGHER THAN THE 3.4 MILLION IN Q2 DUE TO THE HIGHER STOCK PRICE SOME NEW HIGHER STOCK GRANTS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE STOCK BONUS PLAN TRADE RECEIVABLES WERE $17.2 MILLION THAT WAS UP FROM 13.0 MILLION IN Q2 DUE TO THE HIGHER REVENUE BUT DSOS DECREASED FROM 58 DAYS IN Q2 TO JUST 49 DAYS IN Q3 INVENTORY WAS $15.2 MILLION UP SLIGHTLY FROM 14.8 MILLION IN Q2 WE GENERATED $4.2 MILLION IN CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND USED 2.5 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF ASSETS WE HAD $35 MILLION IN BANK DEBT GOING INTO THE QUARTER BUT WE PAID THIS OFF ENTIRELY AND FINISHED THE QUARTER WITH NO BANK DEBT WE THEN ENDED THE QUARTER WITH $69.2 MILLION IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS I'D NOW LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2020 WE EXPECT Q4 TO BE ANOTHER GREAT QUARTER WITH CONTINUED SEQUENTIAL REVENUE GROWTH GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION AND INCREASING NET INCOME WE EXPECT FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE WILL BE UP 10 TO 15% SEQUENTIALLY AT THE MIDPOINT THIS WOULD PUT REVENUE AT ABOUT $36.8 MILLION OR 30% HIGHER THAN THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION WITH NON- GAAP GROSS MARGINS INCREASING TO APPROXIMATELY 53% PLUS OR MINUS A POINT OPERATING EXPENSES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE BETWEEN EIGHT AND 10% SEQUENTIALLY WHICH AT THE MIDPOINT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $13.7 MILLION WE WILL NOT INCUR ANY INTEREST EXPENSE SINCE WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY BANK DEBT INCOME TAXES WILL BE NOMINAL AND LESS THAN 50K FOR THE QUARTER THE BASIC SHARE COUNT IN Q4 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 17.0 MILLION SHARES IN ADDITION THE DILUTED IMPACT OF EMPLOYEE RSUS WILL ADD APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION SHARES TAKING THE TOTAL DILUTED SHARE COUNT USE FOR OUR EPS CALCULATION TO APPROXIMATELY 19.2 MILLION SHARES STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $5.5 MILLION UP FROM Q3 DUE TO THE HIGHER STOCK PRICE AND A FEW NEW HIGHER GRANTS SO BASED ON THE GUIDANCE JUST GIVEN WE EXPECT FOURTH QUARTER NON- GAAP EPS WILL BE BETWEEN 28 CENTS AND 32 CENTS PER SHARE SO IN SUMMARY WE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL WORKFORCE THAT IS PERFORMING EXTREMELY WELL WORKING FROM HOME WE HAVE TRULY DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS LARGE AND GROWING MARKETS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF NEW PRODUCTS IN THE PIPELINE AN ENVIABLE LIST OF TIER 1 CUSTOMERS A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO A VERY STRONG Q4 SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN THE CALL BACK TO THE OPERATOR FOR Q&A OPERATOR AT THIS TIME I

GONNA REPORT THAT THE UH THE PHONE REVENUE SPECIFICALLY ONE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUT I WILL PROVIDE SOME COLOR TO THAT WHEN WE INCREASED OUR GUIDANCE IN AUGUST ABOUT HALF OF THAT INCREASE WAS RELATED TO THAT NEW PHONE DESIGN WIN AND THE UH THE BALANCE WAS OBVIOUSLY THEN UH STRENGTH IN NON PHONE SO THAT THAT WAS KINDA WHAT HAPPENED IN IN THE THIRD QUARTER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WE'RE SEEING VERY STRONG REVENUE GROWTH UH AS I MENTIONED OUR GUIDANCE IS THAT REVENUE WILL BE UP 10 TO 15% UH I'LL MENTION THE PHONE AGAIN NOT SPECIFICALLY BUT PHONE REVENUE WILL PROBABLY ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT UM AND THEREFORE NON PHONE UH BASICALLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE BALANCE OF THAT BUT WE'RE WE'RE EXPECTING UH GROWTH IN ALL OF OUR MARKET SEGMENTS GOING FROM Q3 TO Q4 GREAT THAT'S SUPER HELPFUL AND THEN MY FOLLOW-UP IS JUST REALLY AROUND UH THE LAR THE LARGEST CUSTOMER FOR YOU GUYS THAT OBVIOUSLY STEPPED UP MATERIALLY INTO SEPTEMBER UH ALONG WITH THAT MARGINS CLEARLY STEPPED UP AS WELL CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT'S DRIVING THAT BETTER MARGIN PERFORMANCE CLEARLY YOU'RE YOU'RE SEEING SOME ACCRETIVE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS UH AS THAT CUSTOMER STEPS UP BUT UH CAN YOU TALK TO YOUR OTHER SEGMENTS AS WELL IS- IS THERE A MATERIAL PART OF THAT UPTICK THAT'S ALSO COMING FROM THE COMMS ENTERPRISE AND THE AUTO INDUSTRIAL SPACE AS WELL AS AS THOSE PRODUCTS MOVE A LITTLE MOVE A LITTLE- OH OH AB- ABSOLUTELY AB- ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE GROSS MARGIN DRIVERS UH IN OUR BUSINESS UM YOU KNOW OUR NEWER PRODUCTS GENERALLY ARE HIGHER ASP AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE UH AS AS THOSE NEWER PRODUCTS BECOME A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF OUR SALES THAT DRIVES HIGHER UH BLENDED GROSS MARGINS THAT'S ONE TWO WE'RE TAKING MORE OF OUR SALES DIRECT THAT CUTS OUT THE DISTRIBUTOR UH THAT IMPROVES OUR GROSS MARGINS UH WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN REDUCING OUR PRODUCT MATERIAL COSTS THAT WOULD BE WAFER COSTS UH THAT IMPROVES GROSS MARGINS OUR OPS GROUP HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AT OF IMPROVING SORT AND TEST YIELDS AND PACKAGE COSTS THAT IMPROVES GROSS MARGINS VOLUME HELPS US OUR OUR MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD EVEN THOUGH WE'RE FABULOUS WE HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD THAT'S RELATIVELY FIXED SO AS THE VOLUME GOES UP UH THAT MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD IS PERCENT OF SALES DECREASES THAT HELPS GROSS MARGINS AND SO YOU KNOW WE- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS NOW FOR FOR A WHILE AND YOU KNOW WE SAW VERY SIGNIFICANT GROSS MARGIN UH EXPANSION FROM Q2 TO Q3 AS I MENTIONED GROSS MARGINS INCREASED 530 BASIS POINTS FROM Q2 TO Q3 AND UH I'VE GUIDED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER POINT OF IMPROVEMENT PLUS OR MINUS GOING FROM Q3 TO Q4 GREAT CONGRATS AGAIN ON THE NEXT RESULTS GUYS THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE YOUR NEXT QUESTION FROM <INAUDIBLE> FROM <INAUDIBLE> YOUR LINE'S OPEN YES THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THE RECORD RESULTS UM RAJESH YOU- YOU- YOU UM CALLED OUT SOME SOME CHALLENGES IN THE UH IN THE QUARTZ INDUSTRY YOU KNOW YOUR COMPETITORS COULD YOU MAYBE ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT AND UM WHAT- WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN FOR SORT OF NEW ENGAGEMENTS AND NEW DESIGN WINS FOR- FOR SITIME YEAH I THINK WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT LAST TIME UM BASICALLY THE QUARTZ INDUSTRY AS WE KNOW HAS DONE A STELLAR JOB IN THE LAST 70 YEARS OF PROVIDING UH PRODUCT TO EVERYBODY IN THE ELECTRONICS WORLD UH BUT I THINK UH THAT IT IS STILL A BATCH PROCESS IT IS A FAB PROCESS IT'S A FACTORY PROCESS OR EVERYBODY HAS TO INVEST IN FACTORIES AND THESE FACTORIES ARE PURPOSE MADE SO THEY CAN'T BE USED <INAUDIBLE> THEY DON'T HAVE THE SCALE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT A FABULOUS COMPANY LIKE SITIME WHICH USES SEMICONDUCTORS UH CAN GET I MEAN AS A REMINDER UM UH WHEN WE BUILD OUR MEMS RESONATORS WE CAN UM A- A- A MILLION UH SORRY UH 10,000 WAFERS SHOULD GIVE US ABOUT A BILLION UNITS AND THESE ARE 180 NANOMETER TECHNOLOGY WAFERS SO NOT REALLY THAT UH DIFFICULT TO GET SO WE IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN IS BATCH MADE AND I THINK IT HAS THESE ISSUES WITH IT THERE WERE SOME REPORTS OF SOME STUMBLES IN FABS IN UH IN IN THE ASIAN MARKETS AND I THINK UH WE SAW A SPIKE IN DEMAND COMING THAT DIDN'T IMPACT Q3 BY THE WAY I'M JUST TALKING UH THAT WE WE SAW SPIKES IN PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE GET NERVOUS WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME 10 YEARS AGO THERE WAS UH A BIG UM UH A BIG PROBLEM WITH UH CERAMIC PACKAGING AS YOU KNOW ALL QUARTZ MADE PRODUCTS WITH THE OSCILLATORS THE RESONATORS ARE QUARTZ PACKAGED BECAUSE TO BECAUSE THEY'RE FRAGILE AND THEY WANT TO TO KEEP A VERY STRONG PACKAGING THOSE QUARTZ UH PACKAGING CERAMIC PACKAGES COME FROM ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND SOMETIMES THERE'S A SHORTAGE SO I THINK THEY HAVE THESE MULTIPLE POINTS OF FAILURE POTENTIALLY UH AND UH THAT'S WHAT I WAS POINTING OUT TOO AND YEAH THERE HAVE BEEN SOME UH THERE HAVE BEEN SOME YOU KNOW ANECDOTAL UH EVENTS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND IN THE CONTINUING WE EXPECT TO SEE THAT UM IT- IT'S JUST A IT'S JUST A REMINDER TO OUR CUSTOMERS IT DOESN'T SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REVENUE BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IN THE MEDIUM TO LONGER TERM IT GETS OUR CUSTOMERS A REMINDER THAT THEY THEY'RE PROBABLY BETTER OFF IN MOVING TO MORE STABLE SUPPLY CHAINS YEAH THAT'S THAT'S GREAT UH PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AS MY FOLLOW-UP UH CONGRATULATIONS ON ON ENTERING THE- THE RESONATOR MARKET UH AND NOW OBVIOUSLY YOU- YOU'RE UH COVERING THE ENTIRE GAMUT OF- OF THE TIMING MARKET I KNOW IN THE PAST YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT UH TARGETING UH UH ABOUT A $10 BILLION <INAUDIBLE> IF YOU KIND OF COMBINED ALL THREE SUB SEGMENTS UM COULD YOU UPDATE US WHERE YOUR SUM IS NOW UH WITH YOUR UH PENETRATION WITH NEW PRODUCTS INTO THE RESONATOR MARKET YEAH OUR SUM IS IT'S STILL AROUND 1 BILLION TO 1.2 BILLION IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER DEPENDING ON WHEN WHEN WE INTRODUCE PRODUCTS AND SO ON BUT IT'S CERTAINLY LESS THAN 2 BILLION UH IT'S ALSO MOSTLY CONCENTRATED RIGHT NOW IN UM IN OSCILLATORS SO WHILE WE DO HAVE RESONATORS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED WHILE WE DO HAVE UM UH ANALOG UM CLOCKING SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED OUR RAMP INTO THAT FROM A REVENUE POINT OF VIEW WE HAVE ALREADY SET EXPECTATIONS WILL BE RELATIVELY SLOW I THINK OUR ENTRY INTO THESE MARKETS IS SIGNIFICANT FOR CUSTOMERS UM IN THE FOLLOWING WAY IN THE WAY THAT THEY CAN THEN COME AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH US ON ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS AND NOT EVERY CUSTOMER WANTS TO TALK TO US ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THEM SOMETIMES THEY WANT TO TALK TO US ONLY ABOUT RESONATORS OR OSCILLATORS OR CLOCKING AND THEN THAT BECOMES AN ENTRY POINT TO TALKING ABOUT OTHER PRODUCTS SO IT'S A IT'S FROM A TAM POINT OF VIEW WE'RE STILL PRETTY TINY UH YOU KNOW ONE AND A HALF BILLION IN TAM OUT OF A $8 BILLION TOTAL MARKET <INAUDIBLE> AT ONE AND A HALF BILLION <INAUDIBLE> OUT OF AN 8 BILLION TOTAL TAM AND OF COURSE SITIMES REVENUE IS YOU KNOW STILL PRETTY PRETTY SMALL IN COMPARISON YOU KNOW AT AROUND 100 MILLION UM SO WE STILL EVEN IF WE MAINTAINED AND DID NOT GROW OUR <INAUDIBLE> VERY MUCH WE WOULD STILL PROBABLY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE FILL OUT THOSE BOOTS THANK YOU FOR THAT RAJESH AND CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN <CROSSTALK> WE HAVE YOUR NEXT QUESTION FROM QUINN BOLTON FROM NEEDHAM YOUR LINE'S OPEN HEY GUYS CONGRATULATIONS ON THE ON THE NICE RESULTS WANTED TO START OFF UH WITH THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES YOU'VE YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH QUARTZ I BELIEVE THAT WAS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT LED TO THE TO THE PHONE UH WIN THAT- THAT YOU ANNOUNCED LAST QUARTER YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK FORWARD DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE QUARTZ SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES ARE POSITIONING YOU TO POTENTIALLY WIN ADDITIONAL SKEWS EITHER AT AT THAT CUSTOMER OR OTHER LARGE SMARTPHONE VENDORS I THINK THAT'LL HAVE SOME IMPACT QUINN UH BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S FORECASTABLE UH I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GENERAL SLOW TREND UH AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS SEVERAL TIMES IT'S A GENERAL SLOW TREND IT'S- IT'S- IT'S NOT AT THE POINT WHERE IT'S GOTTEN THAT SNOWBALL HAS BECOME VERY BIG BUT IT'S A TREND THAT WE SEE AND WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT PEOPLE DESIGN US IN FOR UH PERFORMANCE REASONS AS WELL AS FOR SUPPLY CHAIN BUT OVERWHELMINGLY THEY DESIGN US FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS UH JUST TO JUST TO PICK UH YOU KNOW UH UH I WOULD SAY LESS THAN 15% OF THE TIME WE GET DESIGNED IN UH FOR SUPPLY CHAIN REASONS BUT THOSE SUPPLY CHAIN REASONS ARE IMPORTANT UH BECAUSE WHEN UH PEOPLE LOOK AT THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS AND SEE THESE <UNK> THAT HAPPEN FROM TIME TO TIME AND THESE BY THE WAY THESE PERTURBATIONS ARE NOT NEW THEY'VE BEEN GOING ON FOR FOR A LONG TIME BUT BUT CUSTOMERS DID NOT HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE NOW THAT THEY DO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE IT JUST BECOMES ONE MORE FASTER IN THEIR THINKING UM UH PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FURTHER OUT IN TIME PARTICULARLY <INAUDIBLE> FOR EXAMPLE IN AUTOMOTIVE OR <INAUDIBLE> UH OR- OR UH OR YOU KNOW LONGER TERM INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE A SLOW RAMP IN MULTIPLE YEARS UH MANY OF THEM START TO THINK IT MIGHT BE PRUDENT TO DO THAT UM BUT I WOULD STILL PUSH ON OUR PERFORMANCE BENEFITS AS BEING THE PRIMARY REASON FOR ADOPTION GREAT AND THE SECOND QUESTION I KNOW UM WITH UH WITH THE RECENT INTRODUCTION OF THE APEXMEMS FAMILY YOU'RE YOU'RE MOVING INTO THE RESONATOR MARKET ARE YOU TARGETING SELECT FREQUENCIES UM YOU KNOW WHERE YOU KNOW HIGH VOLUME FREQUENCIES WITH THE INITIAL RESONATORS UM AND I GUESS A RELATED QUESTION YOU KNOW SINCE YOU DESIGN THIS IN SILICON DO YOU NEED NEW MASK SETS EVERY TIME THE FREQUENCY CHANGES UM IN THOSE RESONATOR STRUCTURES THANK YOU YEAH YEAH ABSOLUTELY UH WE TO ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION FIRST WE DO NEED UH A NEW MASK SET UM BUT UM SOMETIMES UH THOSE ARE VERY SIMILAR UH THEY'RE NOT UH THE- THE- THE DESIGN OF THE RESONATOR IS NOT VERY DIFFERENT FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN A 24 MEGAHERTZ AND A 26 MEGAHERTZ IT'S NOT GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT HOWEVER BETWEEN A 24 MEGAHERTZ AND UH 76.8 MEGAHERTZ I THINK IT COULD BE DIFFERENT UH BUT UH GENERALLY THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE SE THE RESONATOR INDUSTRY HAS WORKED AROUND THE QUARTZ LIMITATIONS IN THE PAST AND THERE ARE BASICALLY A HANDFUL MAYBE TWO HANDFULS SO I'LL CALL IT A DOZEN QU- QUOTE UNQUOTE POPULAR FREQUENCIES UH THAT EXIST AND UM AND SO I THINK UH THAT MAKES OUR TASK EASIER AS WE GO FROM ONE FREQUENCY TO THE OTHER AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE WILL <INAUDIBLE> TARGET THE MOST POPULAR ONES BUT WE'LL TARGET THE ONES WHERE THE FREQUENCY IS ONE THING BUT WHERE WE BRING THE COMBINATION OF SIZE OF UH OF RESILIENCE OF UH ENVIRONMENTAL STABILITY AND CLEARLY OF HIGH VOLUME BECAUSE THESE ARE LOW PRICED PRODUCTS THEY ARE SUB 20 CENT PRODUCTS IN PRICE AND SO OBVIOUSLY THE VOLUME HAS TO BE OPPORTUNITY HAS TO BE IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS FOR IT TO BE INTERESTING FOR US UM THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY KEY REASONS TO DO IT NOW THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN UH OVER TIME AS FREQUENCIES OF SOCS INCREASE UM THE THE REQUIREMENT FOR FREQUENCIES BEYOND SAY 75 MEGAHERTZ UH INCREASES AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE THINK UH THAT QUARTZ TECHNOLOGY HAS UH HAS DIFFICULTY GETTING TO UH A HIGH VOLUME HIGH FREQUENCY HIGH RELIABILITY SMALL SIZE PRODUCT AND THAT'S WHERE ALSO WE WOULD SHINE AND I'M THINKING TWO THREE FOUR YEARS OUT UH PARTICULARLY IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS PERHAPS SOME PHONE APPLICATIONS GOT IT GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND THEN JUST QUICKLY FOR ART YOU MENTIONED EACH EACH OF THE UH SEGMENTS WOULD GROW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER JUST WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO RANK ORDER UM IF ONE'S GROWING MUCH MUCH FASTER THAN THE OTHERS OR DO YOU EXPECT ALL OF THEM TO TO GROW ABOUT THE SAME RATE THANK YOU SURE FAIR FAIR QUESTION I DON'T THINK WE WANTED TO GET THAT DETAILED IN OUR IN OUR GUIDANCE WE DO EXPECT A GROWTH IN EACH ONE OF THOSE SEGMENTS UM AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND AND UH WE'LL UH WE'LL ANNOUNCE THAT SEGMENT GROWTH IN IN MORE DETAIL WHEN WE ACTUALLY ANNOUNCE THE FOURTH QUARTER UNDERSTOOD THANKS ART THANKS QUINN WE HAVE YOUR NEXT QUESTION FROM <INAUDIBLE> FROM <INAUDIBLE> YOUR LINE'S OPEN <INAUDIBLE> CONGRATULATIONS ON THE STRONG RESULTS SO UH PERHAPS FOR ART WOULD BE UH INCREASING MOBILE UH CONTENT YOU HAVE NOW CAN YOU IN THIS FRAMEWORK WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SEASONALITY GOING FORWARD FIRST HALF FIRST SECOND HALF FIRST Q UH VERSUS MAYBE BEFORE UM YOU KNOW COMING INTO THIS YEAR SURE WELL IF YOU LOOK AT UH THE SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS AND WE DO HAVE SEASONALITY GO BACK TO LAST YEAR 2019 RIGHT SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR MUCH STRONGER THAN FIRST HALF PEOPLE CAN GO BACK AND- AND QUANTIFY THAT WE SAW PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING THIS YEAR UH YOU KNOW THE BACK HALF OF THIS YEAR MUCH STRONGER THAN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR Q2 OF COURSE WAS WAS SOMEWHAT DEPRESSED IN OUR MOBILE AND IOT SEGMENT BECAUSE OF THE GLOBAL SLOWDOWN AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY RETAIL STORES WERE CLOSED AND I THINK NEXT YEAR IT'S GONNA BE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR UH IN TERMS OF FIRST HALF VERSUS SECOND HALF OBVIOUSLY WE EXPECT UH UH YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH YOU KNOW Q1 NEXT YEAR SHOULD BE NICELY HIGHER THAN Q1 OF THIS YEAR AND Q2 OVER Q2 AND THREE AND THREE AND FOUR AND FOUR SO WE WE EXPECT YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR WE'LL HAVE GOOD GROWTH WE'RE NOT QUANTIFYING THAT AT THIS POINT UH BUT IN TERMS OF THE SEASONALITY IT'S GONNA LOOK I THINK SIMILAR TO HOW IT LOOKED LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR OKAY ART THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND THEN PERHAPS ON THE UM THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE 5G UH WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE IN PARTICULAR UM ARE YOU HAVING DESIGN WINS KINDA SHOWING UP EVERY QUARTER THAT <INAUDIBLE> THAT BE A STEADY GROWTH DRIVER OR MIGHT YOU EBB AND FLOW WITH THE 5G BUILD OUT UH PUTS AND TAKES YEAH I THINK IT'S A SLOW STEADY <INAUDIBLE> OF PRODUCTS UH YOU KNOW OUR UH OUR PRODUCTS ARE ALSO SHOWING UP YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE 9501 UH WE IN THE OPTICAL MODULE BUSINESS THAT'S CLEARLY SHOWING UP UH THE ORAN UH THAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER I THINK WE HAVE UH TENS OF UH DESIGN WINS THAT SHOWED UP IN THE LAST UH IN THE LAST UH FEW MONTHS UM YEAH SO SO IT'S JUST A STEADY GROWTH AND WHAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT IS THE BREADTH OF WHERE 5G TOUCHES SO AGAIN AS I SAID IT'S NOT JUST THE DISTRIBUTE THE DIGITAL UNIT OR THE <UNK> IT'S IT'S THE MID HAUL THE BACK HAUL THE MICROWAVE THE YOU KNOW IT'S IN THE SERVERS IT'S IN IT'S ALL IT'S IN SO MUCH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE THIS IS PROBABLY A FIVE SEVEN YEAR UM ROLLOUT AND UH SHOULD BE A VERY VERY SOLID PLACE FOR SITIME HELPFUL COLOR THANK YOU RAJESH <INAUDIBLE> WE HAVE YOUR NEXT QUESTION FROM <INAUDIBLE> FROM WILLIAM BLAIR YOUR LINE'S OPEN UH SURE MAYBE A QUICK QUESTION FOR ART UM JUST ON OPERATING EXPENSES CAN YOU UPDATE US ON THE LONG-TERM OPERATING MAR UM MODEL AND HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IT YOU GUYS HAVE REALLY HAD OUR DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB UM GROWING REVENUE THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS WITH VERY LITTLE UM OPEX FLOW THROUGH YEAH UH SO I'M WONDERING UH HOW TO THINK ABOUT IT YEAH GREAT GREAT GREAT QUESTION WELL REVENUE KINDA GOT AHEAD OF OUR EXPENSES SO THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD THING YOU KNOW OUR KIND OF STATED LONGTERM GOAL IS THAT WE WOULD GROW OPEX AT ABOUT HALF THE RATE OF TOP LINE GROWTH SO JUST FOR SAKE OF MATHEMATICAL EXAMPLE IF WE WERE TO GROW REVENUE YEAR OVER YEAR BY 20% THEN I WOULD EXPECT OPEX TO GROW BY ABOUT 10% SO THAT'S KIND OF A- A- A GENERALIZED LONG-TERM GOAL IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS UM YOU KNOW Q2 OUR REVENUE WENT UP 52% SEQUENTIALLY BUT ONLY FIVE BUT OPEX ONLY WENT UP 5% SEQUENTIALLY SO YOU KNOW WE WE COULDN'T RAMP EXPENSES QUITE FAST ENOUGH MY GUIDE FOR Q4 UH WE'RE GUIDING REVENUE UP 10 TO 15% AND I'M GUIDING OPEX UP EIGHT TO 10% SO THAT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN UH HALF THE TOP LINE RATE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE OF A LITTLE BIT OF A CATCH-UP BECAUSE WE WERE S SO LOW IN TERMS OF UH OPEX GROWTH IN Q2 SO DOES THAT DOES THAT KIND OF FRAME IT FOR YOU UH YEAH THAT HELPS UM AND THEN- AND I- I- I HAVE A I HAVE A COMMENT I HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT AND THAT COMMENT IS THAT UM A REMINDER THAT SITIME'S AN ANALOG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY AND WHEN YOU THINK OF OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES THAT ARE USING SEVEN NANOMETER TAPE-OUTS UH WE'RE DOING 180 130 65 NANOMETER TAPE-OUTS UH WHEN YOU THINK OF OTHER COMPANIES DOING A BUNCH OF SOFTWARE IN OPEX IN SCALING THAT UM WE'RE NOT IN THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS OR NOT MEANINGFULLY IN THAT ON THE OTHER HAND UH THE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COMING AT US ARE COMING PRETTY THICK AND FAST SO WE ALWAYS WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN THE ABILITY TO INVEST UH AT A AT A GREATER RATE YOU KNOW WITHIN REASON UM TO THE MODEL THAT WAS PUT OUT BY ART UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT'S HELPFUL AND A HELPFUL REMINDER ON THE UM ON THE GEOMETRIES UM AND THEN JUST ONE MORE QUESTION I BELIEVE LAST QUARTER WHEN YOU ANNOUNCED THE CASCADE PRODUCT THE CLOCK IC PRODUCT UM THAT YOU EXPECTED REVENUE TO REALLY BE YOU KNOW A 2021 <INAUDIBLE> UM AND THEN PROBABLY RAMPING UM BEYOND THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE STANDALONE RESONATOR PRODUCT SHOULD WE THINKING ABOUT THE TIMEFRAME TO REVENUE IN A IN A SIMILAR FASHION OR WHAT ARE THE PUTS AND TAKES <INAUDIBLE> FROM A CUSTOMER STANDPOINT YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT'S EVEN SLOWER <INAUDIBLE> OKAY UH I WOULD SAY THAT UH YOU KNOW BE- BECAUSE UH THERE'S TWO KINDS OF DESIGN WINS WE WOULD HAVE WE WOULD HAVE STANDALONE DESIGN WINS SO WE WOULD GO TO UH OEMS AND SELL THEM RESONATORS THAT'S ONE UH AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE TO GO TO SOC VENDORS THE ONES WE SORT OF FOR EXAMPLE GAVE AND THEY WOULD DESIGN IT INTO THEIR PRODUCTS BOTH OF THEM PARTICULARLY THE SECOND ONE TAKE A LONG TIME SO THE GESTATION PERIOD FOR THAT FOR MEANINGFUL REVENUE IS EASILY TWICE AS LONG AS THE UH CLOCKING BUSINESS UM SO UM YEAH SO OF COURSE THERE CAN BE OTHER TIMES WHEN IT CAN HAPPEN VERY FAST BUT UH BUT GENERALLY THAT'S A GOOD RULE OF THUMB UM THAT'S HELPFUL UH THAT'S IT FOR ME THANK YOU THANKS ALEX WE HAVE YOUR NEXT QUESTION FROM CH- CHRIS CASTLE FROM RAYMOND JAMES YOUR LINE'S OPEN YES THANK YOU GOOD EVENING UM I GUESS THE QUESTION ON ON MARGINS AND UM UH I- I- I GUESS AS WE GO FORWARD INTO NEXT YEAR THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS WITH UM UH SEASONALITY UH SOME OF THE DIFFERENT MARGIN PROFILES OR THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS THAT ARE GONNA MOVE IN SEASONALITY COULD YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT AS WE GO THROUGH THE YEAR PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT YEAR AS SOME OF THE UH CONSUMER RELATED PRODUCTS UH YOU KNOW TYPICALLY WOULD BE SEEMINGLY WEAKER YEAH GREAT GREAT QUESTION SO YOU KNOW OUR LONGTERM GOAL FOR GROSS MARGINS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS GETTING GROSS MARGINS SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO 60% AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE US TWO TO THREE YEARS GIVE OR TAKE SO YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST KINDA DO THAT MATH YOU KNOW WE'RE- WE'RE TARGETING GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION OF MAYBE THREE POINTS A YEAR NOW WE OBVIOUSLY DID MUCH BETTER THAN THAT GOING FROM Q2 TO Q3 BUT YOU KNOW JUST FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IF WE CAN ADD THREE POINTS WE GET TO 60% MARGIN UM YOU KNOW IN IN TWO TO THREE YEARS WITHIN A YEAR THERE ARE SOME DYNAMICS THAT AFFECT GROSS MARGINS BY QUARTER AND YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR GENERALLY OUR MOBILE IOT AND CONSUMER BUSINESS WHICH IS UH SOMEWHAT LOWER GROSS MARGIN NOT THAT MUCH LOWER BUT A LITTLE BIT LOWER WOULD ARGUE THAT GROSS MARGINS WOULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR JUST BECAUSE OF MIX BUT THE COUNTER TO THAT IS WE HAVE THIS LEVERAGE ON OUR MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD SO THE LOWER VOLUMES ACTUALLY HURT US ON THAT SIDE SO TAKING ALL OF THAT INTO ACCOUNT JUST LIKE WE HAVE DYNAMICS THIS YEAR OF GROSS MARGINS BEING NICELY HIGHER IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR VERSUS THE FIRST HALF I WOULD EXPECT THE SAME THING NEXT YEAR SO IF YOU'RE MODELING THIS I WOULD MODEL GROSS MARGINS TO WHAT YOU THINK IT WOULD BE FOR THE YEAR IN TOTAL MARGINS WILL BE HIGHER IN THE BACK HALF THAN THEY WILL BE IN THE FIRST HALF RIGHT AND- AND THAT'S AS THE THE THE THE THE POOR MIX IS OFFSET BY THE HIGHER AT UH UH MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR RIGHT AND AND THE VOLUME UH IS IS A LITTLE HEAVIER WEIGHTING SO UH I WOULD ACTUALLY EXPECT GROSS MARGINS TO- TO PULL BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT IN THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT YEAR BUT I EXPECT THEM TO BE MUCH STRONGER IN THE BACK HALF OF NEXT YEAR UH EVEN STRONGER OF COURSE THAN THEY ARE IN THE BACK HALF OF THIS YEAR ALL RIGHT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU UM A- AS A FOLLOW-UP UM UH PERHAPS YOU COULD TALK TO US ABOUT YOU KNOW KINDA WHAT YOU'RE TARGETING FOR NEXT YEAR AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES IN- IN FRONT OF YOU UH YOU KNOW WHA IN- IN- IN TERMS OF WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WHA- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO DRIVE THE GROWTH NEXT YEAR AND UH UH THE- THE- THE- THERE'S A LOT ON YOUR PLATE THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THERE WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO MOST CLOSELY AS WE GO INTO NEXT YEAR UM I THINK THE MARKET UM THAT WE THE MARKET TRENDS THAT WE HAVE OUTLINED CONTINUE SO PURELY COMMS ENTERPRISE DATA CENTERS ARE A BIG PLAY UM UH WE ARE CONTINUING TO FIND UH MORE TRACTION IN AUTOMOTIVE UH AS MORE AND MORE UH ELECTRIC VEHICLES SHOW UP 'CAUSE A LOT OF AUTOMATED DRIVING IS HAPPENING IN THAT UH WE HAVE A NICE LITTLE STORY AND CONNECTION GROWING IN THE MIDDLE AEROSPACE MARKET AND THEN FINALLY UH THE MOBILE IOT PIECE <INAUDIBLE> THE CONSUMER THE MOBILE IOT PIECE OF IT IS ALWAYS A NATURAL PLACE FOR SITIMES GROWTH UH BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE SIZE THE RESILIENCY THE PERFORMANCE SO I- I THINK UH WE'RE ALSO UM CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR CUSTOMER BASE YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS AGO WE WERE UH ADDRESSING ABOUT 2,000 CUSTOMERS TODAY WE'RE ABOUT FIVE X THAT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND UH SO I THINK THE EXPANSION OF CUSTOMER BASE THIS IS NOT THE BIG CUSTOMERS THIS IS CUSTOMERS THAT ARE OF MUCH MUCH SMALLER SIZE WHERE WE ARE WORKING IN THE CHANNEL TO TO CONNECT WITH THEM I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD INITIATIVE FOR SITIME AS WELL SO I THINK THOSE ARE SOME WAYS THAT WE THINK ABOUT IT GREAT VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU GREAT THANKS CHRIS I'M SHOWING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TURN THE CONFERENCE BACK TO MR ARTHUR CHADWICK SIR PLEASE CONTINUE GREAT WELL WE WANNA THANK EVERYBODY FOR JOINING US TODAY ON THE CALL AND UH WE HOPE THAT YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY AND UH THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS CONCLUDES TODAY'S CONFERENCE CALL

I NOW LIKE TO CALL THE CALL OVER TO RESHMA. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU LYNN. GOOD AFTERNOON. WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US TODAY AND HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES ARE STAYING SAFE AND HEALTHY DURING THESE UNIQUE TIMES. EVEN WITH THE CHALLENGING MACRO BACKDROP SITAM CONTINUED TO EXECUTE DEMONSTRATED BY A RECORD QUARTERLY REVENUE OF THIRTY TWO POIN Twenty twenty which was above our updated guidance range of thirty one to thirty two million our results demonstrate the diversity of our end market segments our customer base and the exceptional dedication of our site team all of which have benefited site during the current environment during this third quarter revenue grew fifty two percent sequentially compared to our second quarter twenty twenty revenues we anticipate that continued growth. Strength in the fourth quarter will allow Citi to set another quarterly revenue record and Citi's going to discuss our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook later in the call. Now, Citi's fabulous model and multi-source strategy continue to provide a competitive advantage in this market while at the same time providing added assurance of quality and reliability to our customers. In contrast, we believe that the coarse industrial infrastructure has several points of weakness. POINTS OF FAILURE WHICH CAN CAUSE SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS SOME OF WHICH WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THROUGH RECENT INDUSTRY COMMENTARY ADDITIONALLY WITHIN THE TIMING MARKET RESPONSIVENESS IS BECOMING A KEY THEME AND WE BELIEVE THAT MANY COMPETITORS IN QUARTERS MAY NOT BE SET UP TO SUPPORT INDUSTRIAL NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FUTURE IN INFRASTRUCTURE APPLICATIONS OUR SPEED OF RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL DISRUPTORS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE CHANGE MINIMIZ In mobile IOT our kilohertz products help reduce radio power by turning it on and off more quickly and precisely something that's unique to cytime on the supply side our programmability continues to enable the flexibility speed and delivery required by our customers with the recent introduction of our apex mims family of resonator products cytime now offers all three categories of timing products which are the oscillators THE CLOCKS AND THE RESONATORS AS OF THE THIRD QUARTER WE HAVE CUMULATIVELY SHIPPED ALMOST TWO BILLION OSCILLATORS ALL OF THEM WITH AN EMBEDDED MEM RESONATOR OUR COMBINED KNOWLEDGE OF THE M E M S THE ANALOG CHIPS THE PACKAGE AND THE MATERIALS IS UNIQUE TO THE INDUSTRY AND OFFERS A SYSTEM LEVEL UNDERSTANDING FOR OUR RESONATOR CUSTOMERS AS WELL NOW WE KNOW THAT THE MANUFACTURING M E M S PRODUCTS IN HIGH VOLUME IS NOT EASY Leaders in other markets, non-timing markets, maintain their leadership position because they invest early, focus on developed innovative solutions at a rapid pace as well. And we believe today that siteimprove is in a similar position for the timing market as we continue to build upon this market leadership. Our apexmen's resonators are ideally suited for high-volume, space-constrained, mobile and iot applications such as bluetooth earbuds, high-speed connectivity. IN ADDITION TO THESE APPLICATIONS OTHER SYSTEMS ON A CHIP RENDERERS CAN USE OUR APEX BENDS RESONATORS THAT WOULD BE CO-PACKAGED WITH THE CHIPS JUST LIKE WE DO IN OUR OSCILLATORS GIVEN A BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF TIMING MARKET SOLUTIONS ACROSS ALL THREE CATEGORIES WE BELIEVE OUR SYSTEM TIMING OUR SYSTEM LEVEL TIMING SOLUTIONS SAVE CUSTOMER DESIGN TIME INCREASE THEIR END PRODUCTS PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY WHILE Also reducing their overall board footprint, creating value. Moving to 5G, in 5G, the opportunities available to Samsung continue to drive the company's expansion into the communications market. Our products continue to see solid design traction in 5G applications at tier one manufacturers of telecommunications equipment. In addition, we have previously mentioned O-RAN, which is open radio access network. Networks and we continue to see significant interest in Oran hardware solutions that are being developed for greenfield operators as well as traditional carriers. Oran is getting traction because it gives operators best-in-class equipment and performance while driving better deployment economics. And the need for successful interoperability of equipment from different suppliers is a driving factor for Oran's success. WE'RE GETTING SIGNIFICANT TRACTION WITH ORAN CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE ACROSS THE ENTIRE RADIO NETWORKS INCLUDING R U R S SMALL CELLS AND DISTRIBUTED UNITS IN THE AREA OF FIVE GHZ OPTICAL TRANSPORT WHERE WE ARE ENGAGED WITH HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED GHZ OPTICAL AND S O C SUPPLIERS WITH OUR S I T NINE FIFTY ZERO FIVE NINE FIFTY ZERO ONE PRODUCTS WE FIND THAT WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER UNIQUE Value with high performance in the smallest form factor. In conclusion, Cisco is uniquely positioned to disrupt the market as the first company that continues to provide system level timing solution. That said, this is the only the first step of a multi-year strategy to extend our market leadership in timing solution. We remain a results-driven company with a culture that encourages creativity, leadership, and strong commitments to our customers. WHICH CONTINUES TO BE REFLECTED IN OUR RECENT QUARTERLY TRENDS I'D NOW LIKE TO TURN THE CALL OVER TO ART AS WE'LL DISCUSS AS HE WILL DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL OUR THIRD QUARTER RESULTS AND OUR OUTLOOK FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ART THANKS RESHJI AND THAT GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO BE HOLDING OUR FOURTH FINANCIAL RESULTS CONFERENCE CALL AS A PUBLIC COMPANY AND DURING MY REVIEW TODAY I'LL DISCUSS THIRD Q FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER I'LL FOCUS MY DISCUSSION ON NON GAP FINANCIAL RESULTS AND REFER YOU TO TODAY'S PRESS RELEASES FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF OUR GAP RESULTS AS WELL AS RECONCILIATION OF GAP TO NON GAP RESULTS WHICH EXCLUDE STOCK BASED COMPENSATION AND RELATED PAYROLL TAX EXPENSES SO FIRST OF ALL Q3 WAS REALLY AN EXCELLENT QUARTER FOR US WE HAD STRONG REVENUE GROWTH SIGNIFICANT GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION AND VERY POSITIVE RES AUD GAP NET INCOME AS YOU KNOW AT THE END OF AUGUST WE INCREASED OUR REVENUE GUIDANCE FOR THE QUARTER BY MORE THAN TEN PERCENT AND IM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT ACTUAL RESULTS EXCEEDED THE HIGH END OF THAT REVISED GUIDANCE REVENUE FOR THE QUARTER WAS THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS UP FIFTY TWO PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY AND UP TWENTY NINE PERCENT OVER THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO TO PROVIDE SOME COLOR ON N D MARKETS A REPORT SALES The first is mobile iot and consumer, which consists primarily of sales into mobile phones, wearable devices and consumer products. This was the segment most impacted by the global slowdown in Q2, but it came back strong in Q3. Sales were twenty point nine million dollars or sixty seven percent of total sales, up one hundred and five percent sequentially and up nineteen percent over the previous quarter. The second is industrial automotive and aero space which goes into industrial automotive aero space military applications and includes broad base sales sales were six point four million dollars or twenty percent of sales up five percent sequentially and up twenty three percent over the same quarter a year ago the third is communications and enterprise which consists of wireless infrastructure Including five g data center and networking. This was the fastest growing segment over the same quarter last year. Sales were five point four million dollars for sixteen percent of sales up three percent sequentially and up one hundred and three percent year over year. We had just one end customer where sales exceeded ten percent and sales to that customer were forty five percent of total sales. WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES WITHIN THE COMPANY TO EXPAND GROSS MARGINS AND THOSE INITIATIVES ARE PAYING OFF NON GAP GROSS MARGINS DURING THE QUARTER WERE FIFTY TWO POINT ONE PERCENT UP FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BASIS POINTS OVER C TWO NON GAP OPERATING EXPENSES WERE TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS UP FIVE PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY FROM PROFITS OF SEVEN POINT ZERO MILLION IN R D AND FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION D E N A I Y A E N A E X P E N S sil I N T E R IH0 S T IH1 K S P EH1 N S W AH1 Z Z IH1 R OW0 P OY1 N T W AH1 N M IH1 L Y AH0 N D AA1 L ER0 Z sil AE1 N D DH IH0 S JH EH1 N ER0 EY2 T IH0 D N AA1 N G AE1 P sil N EH1 T IH1 N K AH2 M sil AH1 V F AO1 R P OY1 N T F AO1 R M IH1 L Y AH0 N D AA1 L ER0 Z sil AO1 R T W EH1 N IY0 TH R I In Q2 due to the higher stock price some new higher stock grants and the establishment of an executive performance stock bonus plan trade receivables were seventeen point two million dollars that was up from thirteen point zero million in Q2 due to the higher revenue but dso's decreased from fifty eight days in Q2 to just forty nine days in Q3 inventory was fifteen point zero million We generated four point two million dollars in cash from operations and used two point five million for the purchase of assets. We had thirty five million dollars in bank debt going into the quarter but we paid this off entirely and finished the quarter with no bank debt. We then ended the quarter with sixty nine point two million dollars in cash and bank debt. EQUIVALENTS I'D NOW LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF TWENTY TWO WE EXPECT TWO PERCENT TO BE ANOTHER GREAT QUARTER WITH CONTINUED SEQUENTIAL REVENUE GROWTH GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION AND INCREASING NET INCOME WE EXPECT FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE TO BE UP TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY AT THE MIDPOINT THIS WOULD PUT REVENUE AT ABOUT THIRTY SIX PERCENT EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OR THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION WITH NON GAP GROSS MARGINS INCREASING TO APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT PLUS OR MINUS A POINT OPERATING EXPENSES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY WHICH AT THE MIDPOINT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WE WILL NOT INCUR ANY INTER SINCE WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY BANK DEBT INCOME TAXES WILL BE NOMINAL AND LESS THAN FIFTY KA FOR THE QUARTER THE BASIC SHARE COUNT IN Q4 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN POINT ZERO MILLION SHARES IN ADDITION THE DILUTED IMPACT OF EMPLOYEE RSUs WILL ADD APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT TWO MILLION SHARES TAKING THE TOTAL DILUTED SHARE COUNT USED FOR OUR EPS CALCULATION TO APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN POINT TWO MILLION SHARES STATED BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY FIVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS UP FROM Q3 DUE TO THE HIGHER STOCK PRICE AND A FEW NEW HIGHER GRANTS. SO BASED ON THE GUIDANCE JUST GIVEN WE EXPECT FOURTH QUARTER NON GAAP EPS WILL BE BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHT CENTS AND THIRTY TWO CENTS PER SHARE. SO IN SUMMARY WE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL WORKFORCE. THAT IS PERFORMING EXTREMELY WELL WORKING FROM HOME WE HAVE TRULY DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS LARGE AND GROWING MARKETS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF NEW PRODUCTS IN THE PIPELINE AN ENVIABLE LIST OF TIER ONE CUSTOMERS A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO A VERY STRONG Q4 SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN THE CALL BACK TO THE OPERATOR FOR Q AND A Operator: At this time, I would like to inform everyone in order to ask a question. Please press star one on your telephone keypad. Again, that is star one to ask a question. We have your first question from Blaine Curtis from Berkeley. Your line is open. Good afternoon, guys. This is Tom O'Malley for Blaine Curtis. Congrats on the really nice results. My first question was around the improvement throughout the quarter. Obviously, you updated guidance in late August. Possibly and then you're you're coming ahead of that range now what most materially improved between now and then and then if you could look out into december you're obviously guiding for some more expansion there could you give us a little color on segments between the three where you're seeing that growth sequentially so from q two to q three as as i mentioned the most significant growth was in our mobile i o group right part of that is seasonality but we just had real string INCREASES KIND OF ACROSS THE BOARD WITH OUR CUSTOMERS IN THAT IN THAT SEGMENT WE ALSO MENTIONED IN OUR REVISED IN OUR PRESS RELEASE WITH OUR REVISED GUIDANCE IN AUGUST THAT WE HAD WON A DESIGN WIN, A PHONE DESIGN WIN THAT ALSO CONTRIBUTED YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA REPORT THAT THAT THE PHONE REVENUE SPECIFICALLY ONE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUT I WILL PROVIDE SOME COLOR TO THAT WHEN WE INCREASED OUR GUIDANCE IN AUGUST ABOUT HALF OF THAT IN Was related to that new phone design win and the balance was obviously then strength in non phone so that that was kind of what happened in the third quarter in the fourth quarter we're seeing very strong revenue growth as i mentioned our guidance is that revenue will be up to fifteen percent as i mentioned the phone again not specifically but phone revenue will probably account for about a third of that revenue growth CONSECUTIVE WORDS\n\nPERFECT IMPROVEMENT AND THEREFORE NON-PHONE BASICALLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE BALANCE OF THAT BUT WE'RE WE'RE EXPECTING GROWTH IN ALL OF OUR MARKET SEGMENTS GOING FROM Q3 TO Q4 GREAT THAT'S SUPER HELPFUL AND THEN MY FOLLOW-UP IS JUST REALLY AROUND THE LARGEST CUSTOMER FOR YOU GUYS THAT ABSOLUTELY STEPPED UP MATERIALLY INTO SEPTEMBER ALONG WITH THAT MARGINS CLEARLY STEPPED UP AS WELL TALK ABOUT WHAT'S D MARGIN MONEY DOLLARS AS THAT CUSTOMER STEPS UP. BUT CAN YOU TALK TO YOUR OTHER SEGMENTS AS WELL? IS THERE A MATERIAL PART OF THAT UPTICK THAT'S ALSO COMING FROM THE COMS INTERNATIONAL IN THE AUTO INDUSTRIAL SPACE AS WELL AS AS THOSE PRODUCTS MOVE A LITTLE MOVE A LITTLE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE GROSS MARGIN DRIVERS IN OUR BUSINESS YOUR NEWER PRODUCTS GENERALLY ARE H BECOME A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF OUR SALES THAT DRIVES HIGHER BLENDED GROSS MARGINS THAT'S ONE TWO WE'RE TAKING MORE OF OUR SALES DIRECT THAT CUTS OUT THE DISTRIBUTOR THAT IMPROVES OUR GROSS MARGINS WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN REDUCING OUR PRODUCT MATERIAL COSTS THAT WOULD BE WAY FER COSTS THAT IMPROVES GROSS MARGINS OUR OPS GROUP HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF IMPROVING SORT AND TEST YIELDS AND PACKAGE COST Our manufacturing overhead, even though we're fabulous, we have a certain amount of manufacturing overhead that's relatively fixed. so as the volume goes up that manufacturing overhead is percent of sales decreases. that helps gross margins and so you know we've been working on this now for a while and you know we saw very significant gross margin expansion from q two to q three. as i mentioned, gross margins increased five hundred and thirty basis points from q two to q three. AND I'VE GUIDED IT FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER POINT OF IMPROVEMENT PLUS OR MINUS GOING FROM Q3 TO Q4 GREAT CONGRATS AGAIN ON THE NEXT RESULTS GUYS THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE YOUR NEXT QUESTION FROM TORA IT'S VANDENBURGH FROM STEYLE YOUR LINE IS OPEN YES THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THE RECORD RESULTS ROGER ROGER INDUSTRY YOU KNOW YOUR COMPETITORS COULD YOU MAYBE ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT AND WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN FOR SOMETHING NEW ENGAGEMENTS AND NEW DESIGN WINDS FOR PHYSICIANS YEAH I THINK WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT LAST TIME BASICALLY THE QUARTERS INDUSTRY AS WE KNOW HAS DONE A STERLING JOB IN THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS OF PROVIDING PRODUCTS TO EVERYBODY IN THE ELECTRONICS WORLD BUT I THINK IT IS STILL PROCESS IT IS A FAB PROCESS IT IS A FACTORY PROCESS OR EVERYBODY HAS TO INVEST IN FACTORIES AND THESE FACTORIES ARE PURPOSE MADE SO THEY CAN'T BE USED FOR ANYTHING ELSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SCALE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT A FABLESS COMPANY LIKE SITHEIM WHICH USES SEMICONDUCTORS CAN GET I MEAN AS A REMINDER WHEN WE BUILD OUR MEN'S RESONATORS WE CAN AH A MILLION SORRY AH TEN THOUSAND WAY FARERS SHOULD GIVE US ABOUT A BILLION UNITS AND THESE ARE HUNDRED EIGHTY TEN NANOMETER TECHNOLOGY WAVERS, SO NOT REALLY THAT DIFFICULT TO GET. SO WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN IS BATCH MADE AND I THINK IT HAS THESE ISSUES WITH IT THERE WERE SOME REPORTS OF SOME STUMBLES IN FABS IN NH IN NH IN THE ASIAN MARKETS AND I THINK WE SAW A SPIKE IN DEMAND COMING IT DIDN'T IMPACT Q2 THOUGH BY THE WAY. I'M JUST TALKING THAT WE SPIKES IN PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE GET NERVOUS WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME TEN YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BIG AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM AHUM A SOURCE: I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE POINTS OF FAILURE POTENTIALLY AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS POINTING OUT TO YOU AND YET THERE HAVE BEEN SOME THERE HAVE BEEN SOME YOU KNOW ANECDOTAL EVENTS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND IN THE CONTINUING WE EXPECT TO SEE THAT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST A REMINDER TO OUR CUSTOMERS THAT IT DOESN'T SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REVENUE BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IN THIS MEDIUM TO LONGER TERM IT GETS OUR CUST MERCHANTS A REMINDER THAT THEY ARE PROBABLY BETTER OFF IN MOVING TO MORE STABLE SUPPLY CHAINS YEAH THAT'S GREAT PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THAT'S MY FOLLOW UP CONGRATULATIONS ON ENTERING THE RESONATOR MARKET AND NOW OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE COVERING ENTIRE GAMUT OF THE TIMING MARKET I DON'T KNOW IN THE PAST YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT TARGETING ABOUT A TEN BILLION DOLLAR TAM IF YOU COULD HAVE COMBINED ALL THREE SUB SEGMENTS Samsung is now with your penetration with new products into the resonator market? Yeah, our Samsung is still around a billion to a billion point two. It might be a little bit higher, depending on when when we introduce products and so on. But it's certainly less than two billion. It's also mostly concentrated right now in in oscillators. So while we do have resonators that have been introduced, while we do have a analog, Clocking solutions that have been introduced are ramped into that from a revenue point of view. We have already said expectations will be relatively slow. I think our entry into these markets is significant for customers in the following way, in the way that they can then come and have conversations with us on all of these products. And not every customer wants to talk to us about every one of them. Sometimes they want to talk to us only about resonators or oscillators. FOR CLOCKING AND THEN THAT BECOMES AN ENTRY POINT TO TALKING ABOUT OTHER PRODUCTS SO IT'S IT'S FROM A TAM POINT OF VIEW WE'RE STILL PRETTY TINY YOU KNOW ONE AND A HALF BILLION IN TAM OUT OF AN EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR TOTAL MARKET SAM AT ONE AND A HALF BILLION SAM OUT OF AN EIGHT BILLION TOTAL TAM AND OF COURSE SYSTIMES REVENUE IS STILL PRETTY PRETTY SMALL IN COMPARISON YOU KNOW AT AROUND A HUNDRED MILLION SO WE STILL EVEN IF We maintain and did not grow our SAM very much. We would still probably have a long way to go before we fill out those boots. Thank you for your attention. Congratulations again. Great. Thank you, Tor. We have your next question from Queen Bolton from Midem. Your line is open. Hey, guys, congratulations on the nice results. Wanted to start off with the supply chain issues you talked about with quarts. I believe that was one of the factors that led to the phone call. WIN THAT YOU ANNOUNCED LAST QUARTER YOU KNOW AS YOU LOOK FORWARD DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE COURT SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES POSITION YOU TO POTENTIALLY WIN ADDITIONAL SKEWS EITHER AT THAT CUSTOMER OR OTHER LARGE SMARTPHONE VENDERS I THINK THAT'LL HAVE SOME IMPACT WIN BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S FORECASTABLE I THINK IT'S A GENERAL SLOW TREND AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS SEVERAL TIMES IT'S A GENERAL SLOW TR AND IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT AT THE POINT WHERE IT'S GOT THAT SNOWBALL HAS BECOME VERY BIG BUT IT'S A TREND THAT WE SEE AND WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT PEOPLE DESIGN US IN FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS AS WELL AS FOR SUPPLY CHAIN BUT OVERWHELMINGLY THEY DESIGN US FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS JUST TO JUST TO PICK A YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY LESS THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE TIME WE GET DESIGNED IN FOR SUPPLY CHAIN REASONS BUT THOSE SUPPLY CHA AND BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS AND SEE THESE PERTURBATIONS THAT HAPPEN FROM TIME TO TIME IN THESE BY THE WAY THESE PERTURBATIONS ARE NOT NEW, THEY'VE BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME BUT BUT CUSTOMERS DID NOT HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE NOW THAT THEY DO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE IT JUST BECOMES ONE MORE FACTOR IN THEIR THINKING PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FURTHER OUT IN TIME PARTICULARLY SAY FOR EXAMPLE AN AUTOMOTIVE OR Mill Aero or or or you know longer term industrial products that have a slow ramp in multiple years many of them start to think it might be prudent to do that but I would still push on our performance benefits as being the primary reason for adoption a great second question I know with the recent introduction of the Apex Mems family you're moving into the resonator MARKET ARE YOU TARGETING SELECT FREQUENCIES YOU KNOW WHERE YOU KNOW HIGH VOLUME FREQUENCIES WITH THE INITIAL RESONATORS AND I GUESS A RELATED QUESTION YOU KNOW SINCE YOU DESIGN THIS IN SILICON DO YOU NEED NEW MASK SETS EVERY TIME THE FREQUENCY CHANGES IN THOSE RESONATOR STRUCTURES THANK YEAH YEAH ABSOLUTELY WE TO ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION FIRST WE DO NEED A NEW MASK SET BUT BUT SOMETIMES THOSE ARE VERY SIMILAR THEY ARE NOT DISTINCT THE DESIGN OF THE RESONATOR IS NOT VERY DIFFERENT FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN A TWENTY FOUR MEGA OHMS AND A TWENTY SIX MEGA OHMS IT IS NOT GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT HOWEVER BETWEEN A TWENTY FOUR MEGA OHMS AND A SEVENTY SIX POINT EIGHT MEGA OHMS I THINK IT COULD BE DIFFERENT BUT GENERALLY THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE SET OF THE RESONATOR IS NOT VERY DIFFERENT The resonant industry has worked around the quartz's limitations in the past and there are basically a handful, maybe two handfuls, so let's call it a dozen quote unquote popular frequencies that exist and and so i think that makes our task easier as we go from one frequency to the other and you're absolutely right, we will not target the most popular ones but we'll target the ones where WHERE THE FREQUENCY IS ONE THING BUT WHERE WE BRING THE COMBINATION OF SIZE OF RESILIENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STABILITY AND CLEARLY OF HIGH VOLUME BECAUSE THESE ARE LOW PRICED PRODUCTS THEY ARE SUB TWENTY CENT S PRODUCTS IN PRICE AND SO OBVIOUSLY THE VOLUME HAS TO BE OPPORTUNITY HAS TO BE IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS FOR IT TO BE INTERESTING FOR US THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEYS KEY REASONS TO DO IT NOW THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER TIME AS FREQUENCIES OF S O C S INCREASE THE REQUIREMENT FOR FREQUENCIES BEYOND SAY SEVENTY FIVE MHZ INCREASES AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE THINK THAT QUARTZ TECHNOLOGY HAS HAS DIFFICULTY GETTING TO A HIGH VOLUME HIGH FREQUENCY HIGH RELIABILITY SMALL SIZE PRODUCT AND That's where also we would shine and I'm thinking two, three, four years out, particularly in consumer products, perhaps in phone applications. Got it. Great. Thank you for that additional detail. And just quickly for Art, you mentioned each, each of the segments would grow in the fourth quarter. Just wondering if you might be able to rank order if one's growing much, much faster than the others or do you expect all of them to grow about the same rate. Thank you. Sure, fair question. I DON'T THINK WE WANTED TO GET THAT DETAILED IN OUR OUR GUIDANCE. WE DO EXPECT GROWTH IN EACH ONE OF THOSE SEGMENTS AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND AND WE'LL WE'LL ANNOUNCE THAT SEGMENT GROWTH IN MORE DETAIL WHEN WE ACTUALLY ANNOUNCE FOURTH QUARTER UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU GUYDEN WE HAVE YOUR NEXT QUESTION FROM SOOJI DE SILVA FROM ROTH CAPITAL YOUR LINES OPEN SO, PERHAPS FOR ART, WITH THE INCREASING MOBILE CONTENT YOU HAVE NOW, CAN YOU MISS THIS FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING ABOUT SEASONALITY GOING FORWARD? FIRST HALF, SECOND HALF, THIRD QUARTER, VERSUS MAYBE BEFORE YOU KNOW, COMING INTO THIS YEAR? SURE. WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS, AND WE DO HAVE SEASONALITY, GO BACK TO LAST YEAR, TWENTY NINETEEN, RIGHT, SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, MUCH STR THIS YEAR YOU KNOW THE BACK HALF OF THIS YEAR MUCH STRONGER THAN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR Q TWO OF COURSE WAS WAS SOMEWHAT DEPRESSED IN OUR MOBIL AND I O T SEGMENT BECAUSE OF THE GLOBAL SLOWDOWN AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY RETAIL STORES WERE CLOSED AND I THINK NEXT YEAR IT'S GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN TERMS OF FIRST HALF VERSUS SECOND HALF YOU KNOW Q ONE NEXT YEAR SHOULD BE NICELY HIGHER THAN Q TWO OF THIS Y THIS YEAR AND Q2 OVER Q2 AND THREE AND THREE AND FOUR AND FOUR SO WE WE EXPECT YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR WE'LL HAVE GOOD GROWS WE'RE NOT QUANTIFYING THAT AT THIS POINT BUT IN TERMS OF THE SEASONALITY IT'S GONNA LOOK I THINK SIMILAR TO HOW IT LOOKED LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR OK THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND THEN PERHAPS ON THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE FIVE G WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE IN PARTICULAR ARE YOU HAVING DESIGN WINDS KINDA SHOWING EBEN FLOW WITH THE FIVE G BUILD OUT PUTS AND TAKES YEAH I THINK IT'S A SLOW STEADY DRUM BITER PRODUCTS YOU KNOW OUR PRODUCTS ARE ALSO SHOWING UP YEAH WE TALKED ABOUT THE NINETY FIVE O W AH N IN THE OPTICAL MODULAR BUSINESS THAT'S CLEARLY SHOWING UP THE O RAN THAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER I THINK WE HAD TENS OF DESIGN WINS THAT SHOWED UP IN THE LAST LAST FEW MONTHS Um, yeah, so, so it's just a steady growth and what I'm excited about is the breadth of where five g touches. So, again, as I've said, it's not just the distribute the digital unit or the riu, it's the mid-hall, the back-hall, the micro-wave, you know, it's in the servers, it's in, it's all, it's in so much of the infrastructure and as i've mentioned before, this is probably a five, seven year rollout. AND SHOULD BE A VERY, VERY SOLID PLACE FOR SIGHTIMES. AH, HELPFUL COLOURS. THANK YOU JESSICA. HAY THANK YOU JESSICA. WE HAVE YOUR NEXT QUESTION FROM ALESSANDRA VETCHI FROM WILLIAM BLAIR. YOUR LINES OPEN. SURE, MAYBE A QUICK QUESTION FOR ART JUST ON OPERATING EXPENSES. CAN YOU UPDATE US ON THE LONG TERM OPERATING MARGIN MODEL AND HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IT? YOU GUYS HAVE REALLY DONE A JOB GROWING REVENUE THE LAST FEW QUARTERS WITH VERY LITTLE OPEX FLOW THROUGH SO WONDERING HOW TO THINK ABOUT IT YEAH GREAT GREAT GREAT QUESTION WELL REVENUE KIND OF GOT AHEAD OF OUR EXPENSES SO THAT'S A GOOD THING YOU KNOW OUR KINDA STATED LONG TERM GOAL IS THAT WE WOULD GROW OPEX AT ABOUT HALF THE RATE OF TOP LINE GROWTH SO JUST FOR SAKE OF MATHEMATICAL EXAMPLE IF WE WERE TO GROW REVENUE YEAR OVER YEAR BY TO GROW BY ABOUT TEN PERCENT. SO THAT'S KIND OF A GENERALIZED LONG TERM GOAL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST COUPLE QUARTERS YOU KNOW Q2 OUR REVENUE WENT UP FIFTY TWO PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY BUT ONLY FIVE BUT OPX ONLY WENT UP FIVE PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY SO YOU KNOW WE WE COULDN'T RANP EXPENSES QUITE FAST ENOUGH MY GUIDE FOR Q2 FOUR WERE GUIDING REVENUE UP TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT AND IM GUIDING OPX UP EIGHT The line rate, but that's because of a little bit of a catchup because we were so low in terms of apex grows in Q2. So does that, does that kind of frame it for you? Yeah, that helps. I have a comment, I have a comment on that and that comment is that sytimes an analog semiconductor company. And when you think of other semiconductor companies that are using seven nanometer tapeouts we're doing one eighty, one thirty, sixty five nanometers. METER TAPE OUTS\n\nWHEN YOU THINK OF OTHER COMPANIES DOING A BUNCH OF SOFTWARE IN AI AND SCALING THAT WE'RE NOT IN THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS OR ARE NOT MEANINGFULLY IN THAT\n\nON THE OTHER HAND THE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COMING AT US ARE COMING PRETTY THICK AND FAST\n\nSO WE ALWAYS WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN THE ABILITY TO INVEST AT A GREATER RATE YOU KNOW WITHIN REASON TO THE MODEL THAT WAS FOOTED OUT BY ART UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT'S HELPFUL AND A HELPFUL REMINDER ON THE UM ON THE GEOMETRIES AND THEN JUST ONE MORE QUESTION I BELIEVE LAST QUARTER WHEN YOU ANNOUNCED THE CASCADE PRODUCT THE CLOCK I C PRODUCT THAT YOU EXPECTED REVENUE TO REALLY BE YOU KNOW A TWENTY TWENTY ONE EVENT BEGINNING AND THEN PROBABLY RAPING BEYOND THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE STANDOFF RESONATOR PRODUCT SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT Do you in a similar fashion or what are the puts and takes to there from the customer's standpoint? Yeah, I would say that's even slower, Alex. I would say that you know because there's two kinds of design wins we would have. We would have standalone design wins, so we would go to OEMs and sell them resonators. That's one and then the other one would be to go to SoC vendors, the ones we sort of for example gave. AND THEY WOULD DESIGN IT INTO THEIR PRODUCTS BOTH OF THEM PARTICULARLY THE SECOND ONE TAKE A LONG TIME SO THE GESTATION PERIOD FOR THAT FROM MEANINGFUL REVENUE IS EASILY TWICE AS LONG AS THE CLOCKING BUSINESS SO UM YEAH SO OF COURSE THERE CAN BE OTHER TIMES WHEN IT CAN HAPPEN VERY FAST BUT BUT GENERALLY THATS A GOOD RULE OF THUMB THATS IT FOR ME THANK YOU THATS HELPFUL THATS IT FOR ME THANK YOU THATS HELPFUL THATS IT FOR ME THANK [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDI GO THROUGH THE YEAR, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT YEAR AS SOME OF THE CONSUMER RELATED PRODUCTS YOU TYPICALLY WOULD BE SEEMINGLY WEAKER YEAH GREAT GREAT QUESTION. SO YOU KNOW OUR LONG TERM GOAL FOR GROSS MARGINS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS GETTING GROSS MARGINS SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO SIXTY PERCENT AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE US TWO TO THREE YEARS GIVE OR TAKE WERE WE'RE TARGETING GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION OF MAYBE THREE POINTS A YEAR NOW WE ABSOLUTELY DID MUCH BETTER THAN THAT COMING FROM Q2 TO Q3 BUT YOU KNOW JUST FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IF WE CAN ADD THREE POINTS WE GET TO SIXTY PERCENT MARGIN YOU KNOW IN IN TWO TO THREE YEARS WITHIN A YEAR THERE ARE SOME DYNAMICS THAT AFFECT GROSS MARGINS BY QUARTER AND YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR GENERALLY OUR MOBIL That's much lower, but a little bit lower would argue that gross margins would be a little higher in the first half of the year just because of mix but the counter to that is we have this leverage on our manufacturing overhead so the lower volumes actually hurt us on that side so taking all that into account just like we have dynamics this year of gross margins being nicely higher in the back half of the year versus the first half i would expect the same thing next year so... IF YOU'RE MODELLING THIS I WOULD MODEL GROSS MARGINS TO WHAT YOU THINK IT WOULD BE FOR THE YEAR IN TOTAL MARGINS WILL BE HIGHER IN THE BACK HALF THAN THEY WILL BE IN THE FIRST HALF RIGHT AND THAT'S AS THE THE POOR MIX IS OFFSET BY THE HIGHER AT MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR RIGHT AND THE VOLUME IS A LITTLE HEAVIER WEIGHING SO I WOULD ACTUALLY EXPECT GROSS MARGINS TO PULL BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT IN IMPERSONAL VOICE: TO BE MUCH STRONGER IN THE BACK HALF OF NEXT YEAR EVEN STRONGER OF COURSE THAN THEY ARE IN THE BACK HALF OF THIS YEAR ALL RIGHT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU AS A FOLLOW UP PERHAPS YOU COULD TALK TO US ABOUT KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE TARGETING FOR NEXT YEAR THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES IN FRONT OF YOU YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR EXPECTS WHAT YOU EXPECT TO DRIVE THE GROWTH NEXT YEAR AND WHAT THERE'S A LOT ON YOUR PLATE THERE Too most closely as we go into next year. I think the market that we the market trends that we have outlined continue so clearly coms enterprise data centers are a big play we are continuing to find more traction in automotive as more and more electric vehicles show up because a lot of automated driving we are continuing to find more traction in automotive as more and more electric vehicles show up because a lot of automated driving we are continuing to find more traction in automotive as more and more electric vehicles show up because a lot of automated driving we are continuing to find more traction in automotive as more and more electric vehicles show up because a lot of automated driving we are continuing to find more traction in automotive as more and more electric vehicles show up because a lot of automated driving we are continuing to find IS HAPPENING IN THAT WE HAVE A NICE LITTLE STORY AND CONNECTION GROWING IN THE MIDDLE AEROSPACE MARKET AND THEN FINALLY THE MOBILE I O T PIECE OF IT LETS THE CONSUMER THE MOBILE I O T PIECE OF IT IS ALWAYS A NATURAL PLACE FOR SIDETIMES GROWTH BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE SIZE, THE RESILIENCY, THE PERFORMANCE SO I THINK WE'RE ALSO CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR CUSTOMER BASE YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS AGO WE WERE ADDRESSING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND CUSTOMERS TODAY WE ARE ABOUT FIVE X THAT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND SO I THINK THE EXPANSION OF CUSTOMER BASE IS NOT THE BIG CUSTOMERS THIS IS CUSTOMERS THAT ARE OF MUCH MUCH SMALLER SIZE WHERE WE ARE WORKING IN THE CHANNEL TO TO CONNECT WITH THEM I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD INITIATIVE FOR SITEM AS WELL SO I THINK THO Spoken Words into Written Form\n\nPERSON 1: About it.\nPERSON 2: Great, very helpful. Thank you.\nPERSON 3: Great, thanks Chris.\nPERSON 4: I shall be showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Arthur Chadwick, sir.

AND MUCH HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS FURTHER DURING A CHALLENGING HOLIDAY PERIOD WE STRENGTHENED OUR COMMERCIAL PLANS TO DRIVE SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL DEMAND WHILE REMAINING FOCUSED ON DELIVERING GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION POSITIVE COMP SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY OUR CORE BED BATH AND BEYOND BANNER WHICH WAS UP 5% IT WAS FUELED BY EXPONENTIAL DIGITAL GROWTH OF 94% WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET STORES DECLINED OF 14%

EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRY-WIDE OUTBOUND FREIGHT RATE INCREASES PARTICULARLY IN THE LATTER PART OF THE QUARTER THE SIGNIFICANT YEAR OVER YEAR IMPROVEMENT AND OUR ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN REFLECT THE MANAGEMENT THEMES FOCUS ON DRIVING THE COMPONENTS OF MARGIN WHILE DELIVERING EXPLANATION GROWTH IN DIGITAL SGNA EXPENSE DECLINED $41 MILLION VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER PAYROLL RELATED EXPENSES INCLUDING SAVINGS FROM OUR COMPREHENSIVE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS EARLIER IN THE YEAR ADJUSTED EBITDA INCREASED 168% TO $121 MILLION WHICH IS ALMOST THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR

BUSINESS MODEL ARE WORKING TURNING NOW TO SOME CASHFLOW AND BALANCE SHEET <INAUDIBLE> STATEMENTS WE UNLOCKED $244 MILLION IN POSITIVE CASHFLOW GENERATION CASHFLOW FROM INVESTMENTS WAS $200 MILLION POSITIVE THAT IT INCLUDED PROCEEDS FROM NON-CORE ASSET MONETIZATION NET OF <INAUDIBLE> OPERATING CASH FLOW OF $44 MILLION WAS ALSO POSITIVE IN SPITE OF SEASONAL DYNAMICS WE CONTINUE TO CAREFULLY MANAGE WORKING CAPITAL THIS QUARTER WITH ENDING INVENTORIES OF 1.8 BILLION ON A SEQUENTIAL BASIS INVENTORIES WERE 13% LOWER VERSUS THE SECOND QUARTER AND 30% LOWER THAN LAST YEAR THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT FROM BANNER DIVESTITURES INCLUDING SEASONAL INVENTORY PURCHASES FOR THE HOLIDAY SELLING PERIOD WE ARE TRACKING AT A FASTER PACE TO DELIVER OUR PREVIOUSLY STATED 2021 GOAL OF $1 BILLION IN INVENTORY REDUCTION AT RETAIL COMPARED TO 2019 OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE QUARTER WERE ONLY 38 MILLION THAT SAID WE HAVE PLANS TO SIGNIFICANTLY RAMP UP OUR CAP EXPANDING STARTING IN FISCAL ' 21 IN SUPPORT OF OUR DIGITAL FIRST <INAUDIBLE> TRANSFORMATION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER WE ALSO IMPROVE OUR GROSS DEBT BALANCE WITH A REDUCTION IN OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY OF ABOUT HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FROM NON-CORE BANNER DIVESTITURES AND STORE CLOSURES TAKEN TOGETHER WITH A HALF A BILLION IN DEBT REDUCTION WE ACHIEVED IN THE SECOND QUARTER WE HAVE REDUCED TOTAL GROSS DEBT BY ABOUT $1 BILLION SO FAR THIS YEAR A REDUCTION OF ABOUT 25% WE REMAIN IN A STRONG NET CASH POSITION WITH AN ENDING CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCE OF 1.5 BILLION THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE BALANCE AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER EVEN AFTER RETURNING CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASES WE HAVE ALSO MAINTAINED A STRONG LIQUIDITY OF $2.2 BILLION INCLUDING OUR ABL SO CAPITALIZING ON THIS STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION WE LAUNCHED THE 225 MILLION ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE IN LATE OCTOBER AND IN DECEMBER IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO DIVEST COST PLUS WORLD MARKET WE REPORTED PLANS FOR A SECOND ASR IN THE AMOUNT OF 150 MILLION THESE TWO PROGRAMS TOTALING 375 MILLION ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED ON OR BEFORE THE END OF OUR FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER NEXT MONTH IN FEBRUARY AND WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF OUR SHARES OUTSTANDING OF APPROXIMATELY 15% AT CURRENT STOCK PRICE LEVELS OUR AUTHORIZED LEVEL FOR SHARE REPURCHASE AT THIS EARLY STAGE OF THE PLANNING PERIOD IS NOW UP TO $825 MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THESE ACTIONS REFLECT OUR BALANCED CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRINCIPLES STRONG LIQUIDITY AND COMPETENCY IN OUR STRATEGIC GROWTH PLAN IN SUMMARY OUR THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE SHOWS CONSISTENT EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGY WHICH DRIVES SALES AND EBITDA GROWTH COUPLED WITH STRONG CASH FLOW GENERATION AND THE REINITIATION OF CAPITAL RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS NOW MOVING ON TO OUR OUTLOOK I WILL START WITH SOME DIRECTION OF <INAUDIBLE> ON OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR Q4 AND THEN PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE FROM FISCAL 2021 IT HAS BEEN WIDELY REPORTED THAT COVID-19 RELATED HEADWINDS CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE RETAIL INDUSTRY IN THIS CONTEXT WE WILL NOT BE PROVIDING SPECIFIC SALES AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR THE CURRENT FOURTH QUARTER THAT'S IT WE FEEL POSITIVE ABOUT THE PARTS OF THE BUSINESS WE CAN CONTROL AND EXPECT TO DELIVER YEAR YEAR ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN IMPROVEMENT IN Q4 THIS DESPITE LOW STORES SHOPPING AND SHIPPING CONSTRAINTS ACCOMPANIED BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS IN TERMS OF THE TOP LINE COMP SALES ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY IN LINE WITH LAST YEAR WE EXPECT CONSISTENT STRENGTH IN DIGITAL TO BE TAMPERED BY COVID RELATED HEADWINDS IMPACTING STORES DECEMBER SALES SHOW POSITIVE TOTAL ENTERPRISE COMPARABLE GROWTH INCLUDING CONTINUED STRENGTH ACROSS KEY DESTINATION CATEGORIES IMPORTANTLY WE'RE PLANNING FOR A DOUBLE DIGIT ON FAVORABLE IMPACT ON Q4 TOTAL NET SALES VERSUS LAST YEAR EVEN THE DIVESTED BANNERS AND THE ONGOING STORE OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVE IN TERMS OF GROWTH MARGIN IN SPITE OF THE ANTICIPATED DRAG FROM SIGNIFICANT FREIGHT COST INCREASES IN Q4 WE'RE DRIVING COST OPTIMIZATION ACTIONS TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF THESE PRESSURES SO WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN TO BE ABOVE IN LINE WITH THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AGAIN WE EXPECT TO DELIVER A YEAR ON YEAR ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN INCREASE IN Q4 WITH ABSOLUTE EBITDA FIGURES IN LINE WITH THE PRIOR YEAR NOW I'LL TURN TO FISCAL 2021 OUR INITIAL OUTLOOK INCLUDED FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS THE BASE YEAR AT THE TIME OUR PORTFOLIO BANNER REVIEW WAS STILL UNDERWAY WE HAD ALREADY DIVESTED FOUR BANNERS BUT WE DID NOT HAVE A SIGNED DEAL FOR COST PLUS WORLD MARKET YET NOW WE DO AND WE EXPECT THIS TRANSACTION TO CLOSE IMMINENTLY TODAY WE'RE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL VISIBILITY ON THE SIGNIFICANT WE SHAPE OF OUR P&L AS A RESULT OF THESE DIVESTITURES AND THE CLOSURE OF UNDER PERFORMING STORES OUR SIGNIFICANT PORTFOLIO TRANSFORMATION WILL LEAD TO FEWER BETTER PERFORMING STORES AND WILL INCLUDE A HEALTHIER CORE REVENUE BASE WITH A LARGER PROPORTION OF A FASTER GROWING DIGITAL BUSINESS WE'RE NOW TIGHTENING OUR PROJECTED FISCAL 21 REVENUE RANGE TO APPROXIMATELY EIGHT TO 8.2 BILLION LOOKING AT QUARTERS STARTING WITH THE FIRST QUARTER WHICH WILL NOT BE ON A COMP BASIS WE EXPECT TO RECAPTURE THE LOST SALES OPPORTUNITIES FROM THE STORE CLOSURES IN 2020 DUE TO COVID-19 DURING QUARTERS TWO THROUGH FOUR WHICH WILL BE ON A COMP BASIS WE EXPECT TO SUSTAIN COMPARABLE SALES LEVELS IN RELATION TO THE SOLID CONSOLE SPACE OF FISCAL 2020 OUR SALES FORECAST FOR FINANCIAL PLANNING PURPOSES ASSUMES TOTAL ENTERPRISE COMPARABLE SALES TO BE IN LINE WITH FISCAL 2020 WE ARE REITERATING OUR EXPECTATION FOR ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN OF APPROXIMATELY 35% WHICH REPRESENTS A MORE THAN 200 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT VERSUS PROFORMA 2019 WE ARE ENHANCING ADJUSTED FISCAL YEAR 2021 EBITDA TO A RANGE OF BETWEEN 500 TO $525 MILLION THIS REPRESENTS A 20% INCREASE FROM THE PROFORMA 2019 EBITDA BASE OF 425 MILLION THE DRIVERS OF THE ADJUSTED EBITDA RANGE ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ONES WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SHARED INCLUDING COST SAVINGS FROM PLANNED STORE CLOSURES PRODUCT SOURCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND THE IMPACT FROM RE INVESTMENTS AND CHANNEL SHIFT AND SHIPPING COSTS AND AS I SAID EARLIER WE HAVE ASSUMED COMP SALES TO BE IN LINE VERSUS FISCAL 2020 FOR MODELING PURPOSES AS WE'RE NOT REQUIRING SALES GROWTH TO DELIVER THE HIGHER EBITDA RANGE BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY WE WILL STRIVE FOR CONTINUED TOP LINE GROWTH IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT OUR PERFORMANCE TO DATE GIVES US CONFIDENCE IN OUR LONGER TERM GOAL OF ACHIEVING BETWEEN 850 AND $1 BILLION IN ADJUSTED EBITDA BY FISCAL 2023 IMPORTANTLY OUR PORTFOLIO TRANSFORMATION COUPLED WITH STORE CLOSURES IS DRIVING SIGNIFICANT BALANCE SHEET IMPROVEMENT TO <INAUDIBLE> REDUCTION OF $1 BILLION THIS WOULD RESOLVE IN A GROSS DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO BELOW 3.5 TIMES WHICH PUTS US WELL ON OUR WAY TO OUR MIDTERM GOAL OR BELOW THREE TIMES WE HAVE A STRATEGIC AND DISCIPLINED PATHWAY FOR DRIVING SALES AND MARGIN GROWTH GENERATING

QUESTIONS THANK YOU WE WILL NOW BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN ONE ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE IF YOU WISH TO BE REMOVED FROM THE QUEUE PLEASE PRESS THE POUND SIGN OR THE HASH KEY THERE'LL BE A DELAY BEFORE THE FIRST QUESTION IS ANNOUNCED IF YOU'RE USING A SPEAKER PHONE YOU MAY NEED TO PICK UP THE HANDSET FIRST BEFORE PRESSING THE NUMBERS ONCE AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PRESS STAR THEN ONE ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE AND OUR FIRST QUESTION IS FROM KURT O'NEAL FROM BANK OF AMERICA UH GOOD MORNING THANKS VERY MUCH FOR FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS UM YEAH SO THE FIRST ONE IS UM YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND HOW YOU KNOW VERY CONSTRAINED SHIPPING AND FREIGHT WAS UH AN ISSUE FOR ON OUR HOLIDAY MARGINS BUT YEAH HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THIS PRESSURE CARRIES INTO ' 21 IT SOUNDS LIKE AT LEAST FOR THE FULL YEAR UH YOU DON'T THINK IT'S AN ISSUE SINCE YOU'RE STILL TARGETING UH 20 I'M SORRY UM 35% GROSS MARGINS IN IN ' 21 AND THEN JUST HAVE A FALL AFTER THAT YEAH GOOD MORNING TOO THANKS LOOK UH WE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THE BLOOD PRESSURE YOU KNOW ACROSS RETAIL IS HERE TO STAY AND WE'VE BUILT THAT INTO OUR FUTURE PLANS UH SO WE SEE THAT OUR MARGIN STABILITY AND THE OFFSET SO WE'VE CREATED UH CURRENTLY IN THE PROOF OF CONCEPT OF THOSE OVER BOTH Q2 AND Q3 OF THIS YEAR UM REALLY STANDARDS IN GOOD STEAD TO DELIVER THAT 35% MARGIN SO WE FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE AROUND THAT OKAY UM SO MAYBE JUST YOU KNOW AGAIN FOR YOUR MARCH UM MAYBE GIVE THIS A QUICK UPDATE ON SOME OF THE UH BIG MERCHANDISING INITIATIVES YOU GUYS HAVE OUTLINED IN OCTOBER UM AND <INAUDIBLE> SUCH AS YOU KNOW LOWER SOURCING VENDOR COSTS AND THEN YOU KNOW STARTING TO ROLL OUT IMPROVED AND OR MERCHANDI- OR MORE EXCLUSIVE PRODUCT AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT THAT'LL MAKE IN ' 21 OR WE'LL JUST HAD TO THINK ABOUT THE CADENCE OF THOSE THINGS UH YOU KNOW IN 2021 YEAH I MEAN THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'VE ALREADY BUILT A FIRM FOUNDATION WITH THESE RESULTS NOW THE ACTIONS AND TRENDS WE ADD HERE IN TERMS OF MARGIN BOUGHT ACROSS THE BOARD ARE REALLY SUBSTANTIAL AND SUSTAINABLE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO ADD INTO THOSE THE ROLLING BENEFITS AS YOU OUTLINED GOOD SO THE SOURCING BENEFITS THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN THROUGHOUT 2020 UH ARE REALLY GOING TO BE EVIDENCED IN FIRST QUARTER ONWARDS IN 2021 UH AND THEN WE BEGIN IN MARCH WITH THE ROLLOUT OF OUR OWN BRANDS AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SHARING MORE CLOTHES IN THE PAGINATION OF THAT FLOW THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SEVERAL BRANDS WILL BE LAUNCHED BUT THE KEY NEWS IS THAT IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2021 WE'LL BE ADDRESSING THE MAJORITY OF OUR BIG KEY CATEGORIES WE'RE ALREADY SEEING STRENGTH AND GROWTH IN REINVENTING THOSE WITH OWN BRANDS AND ALSO THE INTRODUCTION OF OPENING PRICE POINT ITEMS AND ARE ARRANGED THERE WHICH HAS BEEN A HUGE MISSING PART OF OUR EQUATION IN TERMS OF BEING TRULY COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE TO BUILD OUR AUTHORITY SO THE STEP CHANGES UM THE THE THE CONSISTENT MANAGEMENT OF PROMOTIONS UM THE MIX MANAGEMENT NOW WE'RE GOING TO LAY IN THE INCREMENTAL BENEFITS OF SOURCING AN OWN BRAND UH SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT PROGRESSION IN 2021 OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM <INAUDIBLE> MORGAN STANLEY GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION CAN YOU TALK ABOUT UM WHERE YOUR EXPECTATIONS WERE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER IN SALES AND NOW AND AND I KNOW THE OUTLOOK FOR NEXT YEAR IN BED UH FLATTISH UM DOES THAT CHANGE NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LAPPING AT SOMETHING THAT MAY BE POTENTIALLY WEAKER IN THIS YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER YEAH I THINK <INAUDIBLE> AGAIN WE HAD ROBUST PLANS FOR Q4 OF THIS YEAR UM WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOW WE'RE EXECUTING ON THOSE BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE COVID HEADWINDS AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAS HAD ON FOOT TRAFFIC AND UH OVERALL CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HAD TO FACTOR INTO OUR PLAN TENTS WHILE WE TALKED ABOUT THE AGILITY ABOUT SAYING THROUGH Q3 AND NOW Q4 TO RESPOND TO THOSE CHALLENGES AND SO WE THINK WE'VE MET THOSE IN IN UH YOU KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN THE TABLE ON TIME AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE LAPPING THOSE NEXT YEAR IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OKAY THANKS FOR THAT AND THEN MY FOLLOW-UP CAN YOU TALK ABOUT UM Q4 UH YOU MENTIONED THE FRAYED HEADWINDS AND BUT OFFSET BY SOME OPTIMIZATION UM ON I THINK THE GROSS MARGIN AND IN TERMS OF PROMOTION AND PRICING CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PROMOTIONAL ENVIRONMENT UM AND THEN YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT UM HOW MUCH MARGIN OPPORTUNITY THERE STILL IS I THINK FOR NEXT YEAR'S UM GUIDANCE REVISION THAT IS IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S MORE OF A FUNCTION OF THE MARGIN CHANGING AS OPPOSED TO THE TOP LINE JUST TO CONFIRM YEAH I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD STRESS THAT WE DID NOT BECOME MORE PROMOTIONAL UH DURING THE QUARTER IN Q3 OR IN Q4 WE'VE ACTUALLY RESHAPED AND RE-ENGINEERED OUR PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY WE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO UH BUT THAT'S REALLY PAYING DIVIDENDS IN TERMS OF GENERATING GROSS MARGIN AND HELPING TO CREATE THAT BALANCE AND EXCEEDING EQUATION ON THE ON THE MARGIN UH DIFFERENTIALS FROM UH SHIPPING AND FREIGHT UM SO WE'RE LESS PROMOTIONAL WE'RE MORE FOCUSED ON REG PRICE UM WE'RE WINNING CUSTOMERS AND WE SEE THAT PROGRESSING FORWARD AS GUSTAVO HAD OUTLINED UH WE'RE NOT PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE UH THE WORKING SALES PLAN TO GENERATE UH EVEN UH WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH A NUMBER OF THE DIFFERENT INITIATIVES WE HAVE UH THROUGH COST CONTROL AND DEFINITELY MARGIN GROWTH IN 2021 AS WE OUTLINED IN THAT THREE DAY PLAN OUR THREE-YEAR PLAN SORRY OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM BOBBY GRIFFIN FROM RAYMOND JAMES MORNING BUDDY UM THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS I GUESS WE'LL START WITH MARK THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE RANGE FOR NEXT YEAR IT'S A FAIRLY TIGHT RANGE OF 500 TO 525 MILLION EBITDA YOU KNOW WAS STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY OUT THERE SO CAN YOU MAYBE TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE IN THE BUSINESS NOW THAT REALLY GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE AND TIGHTENING THAT RANGE UP AND AS A SECOND PART OF THAT UM WHERE WHAT WHAT COULD BE THE DRIVER THAT WOULD CAUSE THAT RANGE TO UNDERPERFORM IS IT SALES IS IT MARGIN WHAT WHAT GIVES YOU THE MOST UH CONCERN THERE HI BOBBY GUSTAVO HERE SO DEFINITELY THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES AS WE LOOK FORWARD BUT WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT IN OUR PLANS WE HAVE CLARITY ON THE DRIVERS OF GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION WHICH IS WHY WE ARE REITERATING A GROSS MARGIN OF 35% NEXT YEAR IN SPITE OF THE REASON HEADWINDS THAT WE'RE SEEING ON FREIGHT COSTS AS MARK MENTIONED WE'RE BEING MORE DATA-DRIVEN IN MANAGING OUR PROMOTION AND OUR MIX AND WITH THAT WE WILL OFFSET IT IT IS A TIGHTER RANGE THAN THE WHY THE ONE WE PROVIDED ON INVESTOR'S DAY BUT WE SET THAT AS WE COMPLETED THE PORTFOLIO WORK THE MONETIZATION OF NON-CORE ASSETS WE WOULD TIGHTEN THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE COMING UH FOR TO YOU RIGHT NOW UH ON YOUR QUESTION OF WHAT CAN THROW US OFF IT'S NOT SALES WE ARE PRUDENTLY ASSUMING FOR FINANCIAL PLANNING PURPOSES THAT WE WOULD HAVE SALES COMP SALES IN LINE WITH PRIOR YEAR AND <INAUDIBLE> BUY WITH THAT WE WOULD DELIVER SIGNIFICANT EBITDA GROWTH YEAH BOBBY JUST I WOULD JUST ADD THAT I THINK THAT THE PLAN WE'RE PLACING IS A RESPONSIBLE PLAN BASED ON CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE MARKET ANY THREAT OR A CONSENT WOULD REALLY BE UH A MACRO MARKET UH ISSUE NOT AN INTERNALLY CAUSED ISSUE AND AGAIN I THINK 2020 IS EXEMPLIFIED UH HOW YOU KNOW EVERYONE GETS AFFECTED BY THOSE THINGS SO WE ARE MONITORING THINGS VERY CAREFULLY BY WORKING BY QUARTER WE FEEL OUR PLA- PLAN IS RESPONSIBLE AND ACHIEVABLE UH AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO DELIVERING THAT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I GUESS MY SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE FOR THE DECEMBER COMMENTARY YOU MENTIONED THAT THE ENTERPRISE DID SHOW SOME GROWTH FOR COMPARABLE SALES BUT THEN I GUESS FOR THE ENTIRE QUARTER YOU'RE YOU'RE KIND OF CALLING FOR FLATTISH VERSUS LAST YEAR OR IN LINE OF BELIEVES THAT WE'RE WORDING CAN YOU MAYBE JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IS GOING IN THERE IS SOMETHING POPPED UP IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS HAS GIVEN YOU CONCERN OR IS THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW A FUNCTION OF BEING CONSERVATIVE GIVEN THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY THAT'S STILL OUT THERE IN THE WORLD YEAH BANG ON THERE UM IT'S DEFINITELY AROUND WE'VE SEEN UM POSITIVE SIGNS IN DECEMBER REMEMBERING THAT OUR FOURTH QUARTER IS DECEMBER JANUARY FEBRUARY WE STILL HAD TWO FOUR MONTHS TO COMPLETE THIS PROCESS THERE'S A LOT GOING ON ON THE WORLD AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING RESPONSIBLE IN OUR PLANNING AND UH YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO KIND OF SHARING MORE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEST OF LUCK ONCE AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PRESS STAR THEN ONE ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE AND OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM CHRIS HORVERS FROM JP MORGAN THANKS GOOD MORNING GUYS UM SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS A FOLLOW-UP AS YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THINGS EVOLVING AND CHANGING AS YOU THOUGHT ABOUT UM YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR ' 21 PLAN IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT UH COVID CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE RECENT SURGE ARE YOU ASSUMING THAT THIS WILL SORT OF LASTS LONGER UNTIL WE ACTUALLY GET TO A VACCINE SO WHAT WAS THE CHANGE THERE AND ALSO WAS THE OTHER CHANGE UH THE FREIGHT COSTS I MEAN PRESUMABLY AS A HOLIDAY THE VOLUME SURCHARGES SHOULD COME DOWN AS YOU GET INTO A MORE NORMALIZED SORT OF UH SHIPPING ENVIRONMENT HERE SO UH IS THERE SOMETHING STRUCTURAL WITHIN THAT FREIGHT THAT YOU'RE- THAT YOU'RE ASSUMING STICKS AROUND YEAH I THINK THAT I THINK IT'S PRUDENT TO TO THINK ABOUT AN ENVIRONMENT I MEAN WE SAW AN ACCELERATION OF CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR BETWEEN UM YOU KNOW OUR OUR Q2 IN SEPTEMBER OCTOBER RESULTS AND THEN NOVEMBER RESULTS BASED ON COVID AND BASED ON FOOT TRAFFIC TO STORES UH CUSTOMERS BEING CONCERNED AROUND WHAT THE FUTURE HELD AND REAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET REALLY BEGAN AROUND THE ELECTION PERIOD SO WE A BIG PRUDENT IN THINKING THROUGH YOU KNOW WITH THE VACCINE ROLLOUT IT'S STILL UNDERWAY IT'S STILL VERY EARLY WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR THAT AND ITS IMPACTS UH WE HAVEN'T AFFECTED ANYTHING IN TERMS OF UH SEAMLESS CHECKS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS BECAUSE AGAIN THAT'S BEING SO UNCERTAIN AS ONLY JUST BEING USED SO JUST ENSURING THAT THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY AND VOLATILITY THAT THAT HAS OR COULD BRING IS BUILT CONSERVATIVELY INTO OUR PLANS AND THAT WE CAN BALANCE OUT ANY OF THOSE HEADWINDS UH YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S BEEN INTERESTING THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THE HOME CATEGORY EXPERIENCING THESE GREAT TILE WINS FROM UH YOU KNOW THE COVID MOMENT ALL OF A SUDDEN RETAIL AND BAITING FACING INCREDIBLE HEADWINDS AND CONFUSION AND AND CONSENT FROM THE CUSTOMER THAT WE'VE HAD TO BUY SO I FEEL REALLY POSITIVE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING POSITIVE COMPS PROFIT EBITDA IN THE FACE OF THAT UNCERTAINTY AND WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'VE GOT A BALANCED PLAN GOING INTO 2021 GOT IT SO UH UNDERSTOOD UM AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE FOURTH QUARTER I MEAN JUST RELATIVE TO HISTORY FOR GROSS MARGIN RATE TO BE YOU KNOW WORSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IT WAS IN THE THIRD QUARTER JUST TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MENTIONED NOT BEING YOU KNOW MORE PROMOTIONAL IN DECEMBER UM IS IT UH YOU KNOW YOU GET ABOUT OUR MATH ABOUT 140 BIBS FROM THE ACCOUNTING SHIFT BETWEEN COST OF GOODS AND SGNA SO IS THE SHIPPING SURCHARGES ARE GONNA BE CHARGED CAN BE MUCH LARGER THAN THE 80 BASIS POINTS UH THAT YOU SAW ON 3Q YOU LAP AT 180 BASIS POINTS OF MARKDOWN PRESSURE AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY INVENTORY SO JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT DYNAMIC ON A YOU KNOW SORT OF A YEAR A YEAR AND SEQUENTIAL BASIS IN GROSS MARGIN SUCH THAT IT WOULD BE FLATTENED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER YEAR OVER YEAR SURE CHRIS UM IT'S RIGHT ON WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE SHIPPING COSTS UH PART OF THE REASON IN THE PREPARED REMARKS WE TALKED ABOUT 80 BASIS POINTS IMPACT IN Q3 THAT WAS JUST THE LATTER PART OF THE QUARTER WHAT WE'RE ASKING MAYBE IN Q4 IS OVER 150 BASIS POINTS IMPACT AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO OFFSETTING THAT AGAIN THROUGH DISCIPLINE PROMOTION MANAGEMENT AND MIX AND THAT'S WHAT WE WILL DO BUT THE INCIDENTS ON THE SHIPPING COSTS IT'S MUCH LARGER IN Q4 AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE BEING PRUDENT ON THAT <CROSSTALK> GO AHEAD SORRY 'CAUSE I'LL JUST ALSO ADD IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT Q4 VERSUS Q4 LAST YEAR UH THE THING YOU'VE JUST GOT RECOGNIZED IN THAT AS A CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL PURCHASING VERSUS STORE PURCHASING YOU KNOW IT IS NOT LIKE THE LIKE AND IT'S DEFINITELY ACCELERATED UH AND THAT'S BROUGHT WITH IT UM NATURAL PRESSURES TO MARGIN A MIX AS WE'VE SHARED THAT WE'RE OFFSETTING THAT AND MITIGATING THAT TO BE STABLE I THINK IS A REAL ACHIEVEMENT SO THESE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS A Q4 LIKE NOW ARE THERE AND THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR THAT DIGITAL PIVOTS AND THEREFORE WHAT THAT'S MEANT FOR MARGIN INCLUSIVE SHIPPING IS PART OF WHAT WE'RE BALANCING ON AND AGAIN ONE MONTH INTO OUR OUR THREE MONTH QUARTER BUT UH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING PRUDENT UNDERSTOOD THANKS SO MUCH GUYS AND OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM PETER BENEDICT FROM BAIRD HEY GUYS THANKS UH THANKS FOR TAKING THE QUESTION UM FIRST I'M JUST CURIOUS ON UM ON THE ADOPTION OF BOPUS AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN AROUND SIX MONTHS AND AND YOU KNOW THE CURBSIDE BUT I MEAN HOW IS THAT TRENDING RELATIVE TO EXPECTATIONS AND AND WHAT UM KIND OF WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS OR GOALS TO DRIVE CONTINUED ADOPTION OF THAT UM IN THE IN THE MONTHS AHEAD THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION YEAH PETER GREAT QUESTION I I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW WE SHOWED AN OVERALL STATISTICS FOR UH Q3 BUT I'M PACKING THAT YOU SEE AN ESCALATION AND A MOVEMENT INTO THE NEW MUSCLE REMEMBERING WE ONLY INTRODUCED THIS IN MAY UH SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS WE HAVE AN NPS SCORE OF 80 YOU KNOW WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE ABOUT A TWO HOUR ASSURANCE ON OUR ORDER FULFILLMENT STORE LEVEL ON THAT IT'S ACTUALLY IN REAL TERMS AROUND 30 MINUTES CUSTOMERS ARE LOVING IT I THINK IN A TOTAL INDUSTRY LEVEL BOTH US AS A MUSCLE ON IT AND A NEW METHODOLOGY IS VERY ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER AND WE'RE BENEFITING FROM THAT AS WELL WE SAW OUT RIGHT UH IN THE DECEMBER PERIOD ESCALATE WEEK IN WEEK OUT UH AS CUSTOMERS BECAME MORE CONCERNED AROUND DELIVERY SHIPPING TIMES AND REALLY ENSURING THAT I HAD A JOYOUS HOLIDAY PERIOD THAT I COULD SECURE THE PRESIDENT UNDER THE TREE AND SO WE REALLY WENT INTO UM CREATING UH EASE AND CONVENIENCE FOR OUR CUSTOMER THAT THEY REALLY RESPONDED TO AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR WE BELIEVE THESE ARE CONSTANTS NOW AND THEY MUSCLES IN THE BUSINESS THAT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN AND FOR US WE KNOW THAT A BOPUS ORDER FULFILLED BY STORE IS ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO A STORE BY <INAUDIBLE> PROFITABILITY SO THE DIFFERENTIAL HELPS US AND HAS HELPED US THROUGH Q3 AND WILL HELP US IN Q4 IN TERMS OF UH SHIPPING AND PROFITABILITY COSTS UH SO WE THINK IT'S HERE TO STAY IT IS ONE OF THE STICKY OUTCOMES ALL NOT JUST THE THE PROGRESSION IN BOPUS BUT HOW COVID HAS FORTIFIED THIS IS A NEW MUSCLE FOR MOST RETAILERS OKAY THANKS THANKS FOR THAT MARK AND THEN I GUESS SHIFTING YOU GUYS BROUGHT REGISTRY A COUPLE OF TIMES UH DURING YOUR PREPARED REMARKS AND I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH YOU'RE WILLING TO SHARE QUANTITATIVELY ON ON THE SIZE OF THOSE BUSINESSES BUT MAYBE IT DOESN'T QUOTE MORE QUALITATIVE COMMENTS UM BABY VERSUS WEDDING UM AND UH I MEAN YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BASKET SIZE BUT JUST CURIOUS KIND OF HOW YOU HOW YOU SEE THOSE TWO BUSINESSES OR THAT BUSINESS ACROSS THE TWO SEGMENTS UM UH AS PART OF YOUR OUTLOOK OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ON THE OPPORTUNITIES THANKS YEAH I IT'S A IT'S A GREAT POINT I WOULD ACTUALLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A MOMENT IN TIME EXPERIENCE VERSUS THE CARDBOARD EXPERIENCE AND THE MOMENT IN TIME EXPERIENCE AS JOHN OUTLINE A BABY REGISTRY IS VERY STRONG PRODUCT BUT IT HAS BEEN MORE RELIANT ON AN IN-STORE EXPERIENCE AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE BUILD A BIGGER BASKET IT'S MORE STICKY AND HIGHER CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT AND SO WE'VE BEEN PIVOTING TO STRENGTHEN OUR DIGITAL REGISTRY UH AND WE'LL INVEST THERE FURTHER BUT FOR US WE SEE COMPLETE UPSIDE IN 2021 UH WITH YOU KNOW THE RETURN TO A MORE NORMALIZED SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT IN STORES AND DIGITAL INTO THE TRUE OMNI WHEN WE TURNED TO BED BATH AND BEYOND THE STORY'S EVEN BETTER WE ARE CONSISTENTLY IN THE TOP OF THE RANKING IN AND HAVE HELD MARKET SHARE IN MOST RECENT DATA IN TERMS OF REGISTRIES UH NOW WE HAVEN'T HAD THE BENEFIT OF THAT IN OUR 2020 OR CURRENT NUMBERS BECAUSE OF THE COVID MOMENT AND PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT HAVING WEDDING CEREMONIES IN 2021 THERE'S GOING TO BE PICK UP DEMAND AND TRANSFER INTO INTO THAT YEAR UH FOR WEDDINGS TO OCCUR AND BECAUSE WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN THOSE SPACES AND WELL-PLACED WITH HELD MARKET SHARE AND THAT THE STATS ARE GOOD WE FEEL LIKE THAT AS A RUNWAY FOR GROWTH UH OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IS ONE OF OUR SOLID STRENGTHS THAT HASN'T EXISTED IN OUR 2020 OR CURRENT NUMBERS AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DOUBLING DOWN AND INVESTING THERE EVEN FURTHER THE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM STEVEN FORBES FROM GUGGENHEIM GOOD MORNING SO I WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE TRENDS WITHIN THE CATEGORIES MAYBE OUTSIDE OF THE TOP FIVE THAT YOU NOTED IN THE RELEASE UM SO SO MARK JUST CURIOUS HOW HOW THESE CATEGORIES ARE PERFORMING UM I KNOW IT'S EARLY BUT PERFORMING AND WITHIN SOME OF THE NEW CONCEPT STORES OR REMODELS AND AND OR IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO SOME OF THE INITIATIVES RIGHT THAT SET AROUND THE DRESSING THE PERFORMANCE HERE RIGHT 'CAUSE ALTHOUGH IT'S THE LOWER PERCENTAGE OF SALES IS STILL ONE THIRD HERE SO I'D LOVE TO SEE HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IMPROVING UM IN THOSE SPECIFIC UH CATEGORIES AND- YEAH UH IN THE STRUCTURE THAT'S WITHIN THEM YEAH THANKS STEVEN IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME NATURAL UH HEADWINDS THERE JUST BASED ON SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES BEING MORE RELEVANT TO SOUL-BASED TRAFFIC THE DIGITAL TRAFFIC FOR US AND ONE OF THEM IS PERSONAL CARE AGAIN UM WE IN OUR REMODEL STORES UH THAT WE'VE BEEN TESTING OUR PERSONAL CARE BUSINESS IS BOOMING AND ACTUALLY SHOWING A HUGE DIFFERENTIAL TO OUR CONTROL AND WHEN WE GET THE TRAFFIC WE GET THE TRADE UM AND I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN IN THE END OF Q3 UH AND AND SOMEWHAT IN Q4 IS THIS SORT OF SUPPRESSION OF FOOT TRAFFIC IN STORES THAT HAS A DIRECT CORRELATION AND THAT'S A BUSINESS THAT EITHER UM IS A GREAT BASKET BUILD BUSINESS OR IS JUST PART OF A TRIP TO STORE THAT'S JUST NOT OCCURRING AT THIS MOMENT AS FREQUENTLY IT HAS IN THE PAST I THINK OF A COUPLE OF KEY AREAS TO WHERE UH WE HAVE HAD SOME UH SOME SOFTNESS UM I I THINK CLEANING IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE FOR US AN AREA THAT'S NORMALLY BEEN STRONG I THINK UH GETTING SUPPLY PRODUCT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE UM IT'S IT'S CONSTRAINED ACROSS THE GLOBE UH AND AND WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN UH FIRING IN THAT SPACE UM BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO CLEARED OUT OF SMALLER CATEGORIES LIKE FOOD UM TO KIND OF CLEAN UP OUR ASSORTMENT THAT WE BUILD INTO THAT IMPACT SO WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON DOUBLING DOWN AS STRENGTHS CATEGORIES YOU SEE THAT COMING THROUGH AND CONSIS- CONSISTENT THROUGH Q3 UH Q4 AND OUR EFFORTS AND STRATEGICALLY IN 2021 BUT WE ARE DEFINITELY FOCUSING ON A COUPLE OF KEY CATEGORIES WHERE WE CAN REALLY RAMP UP OUR INVENTORY AND OUR FOCUS AND WE'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SEE POSITIVE SIDES OF THAT IN JANUARY THANKS WE'RE GONNA ITS JUST A QUICK FOLLOW-UP UH FOR YOU GUSTAVO YEAH OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THE MINIMUM WAGE RATE INCREASES THAT ARE TRANSPIRING THIS YEAR AND UM YEAH POTENTIAL SOME PRESSURE RIGHT FROM OTHER RETAILERS ANNOUNCING YOU KNOW THE PATH TO 15 SO CURIOUS HOW YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT UM YOU KNOW THAT AS A PRESSURE POINT RIGHT ON THE BUSINESS UH AND AND WHAT'S INCORPORATED RIGHT IN THE FINANCIAL GUIDANCE UH AS IT RELATES TO WAGE INVESTMENTS FOR 2021 WE DEFINITELY SEE THE EMERGING TRENDS AND THE AND THE EVOLUTION UH WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP AND HOW THAT CAN IMPACT ON THAT NO NEWS ON THAT TODAY OTHER THAN THE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT VERY VERY CAREFULLY UH WANT TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND WE'LL BE ABSORBING THAT INTO OUR ROLL UP COST AND UH FINANCIAL PLANS GOING FORWARD THANK YOU BEST OF LUCK OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM CARLA CASELLA FROM JP MORGAN HI UM COU D YOU JUST GIVE US AN UPDATE ON WHAT HOW MUCH OF YOUR COST SAVINGS DID YOU ACHIEVE IN THE QUARTER FROM YOUR OVERALL GOAL YEAH WE'RE ON TRACK WITH THE PATH THAT UH THE OBJECTIVE WE HAVE OF 200 TO $215 MILLION GOING NEXT YEAR WE EXPECT ABOUT 125 UH AT LEAST IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WE SAW UM SAVINGS AS YOU SAW IN THE BUILDING BLOCKS RIGHT 180 BASIS POINTS FROM PRODUCT MARGIN UM AND SAVINGS INCLUDING LEVERAGE A DISTRIBUTION COSTS OF 210 BASIS POINTS OKAY SO WE COULD KIND OF GO TOWARDS THE COST SAVINGS PROGRAM OKAY THAT'S GREAT AND ALSO UM UM DID YOU PROVIDE OVERALL UM SAME-STORE SALES AT BUYBUY BABY OR HARMON I KNOW YOU GAVE SOME DETAILS BUT I DON'T THINK I HEARD THE SAME SOURCE SALES NUMBER OVERALL WELL WE DID NOT PROVIDE THAT <INAUDIBLE> I MEAN HISTORICALLY FOR THE THIRD QUARTER NO WE HAVEN'T <CROSSTALK> NO WE SAID IN THE PREPARED REMARKS IS UM IN THE THIRD QUARTER SAME STORE SALES WERE DOWN IN BUYBUY BABY AND THEN RECOVERED IN DECEMBER THE REASON WHERE THEY WERE DOWN TEMPORARILY IN THE QUARTER IS SOME OF THE DYNAMICS THAT JOHN SPOKE ABOUT JUST KEEPING MIND STORE SALES STORE TRAFFIC PARTICULARLY IN BUYBUY BABY SLOWED DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN NOVEMBER AND IT WAS PARTLY COMPENSATED BY THE STRENGTHENED DIGITAL UM BUT STILL THAT RECOVERY STARTED HAPPENING IN DECEMBER OKAY GREAT AND IF YOU'RE HOW MUCH OF YOUR IF YOU LOOK AT THE BED BATH AND BEYOND BUSINESS ALONE HOW MUCH OF THAT BUSINESS WAS DONE BY DIGITAL I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT DIGITAL GROWTH THERE BUT I'M WONDERING YOU GAVE IT FOR THE OVERALL COMPANY BUT HOW HAS THAT <INAUDIBLE> IN BED BATH AND BEYOND VERSUS LAST YEAR WHAT DID SHARE THAT THAT DIGITAL GROWTH THERE IS 94% FOR THE QUARTER CARLA SO EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG I GUESS I WAS WONDERING WITH WHAT PERCENTAGE IS THE DIGITAL SALES NOT THE GROWTH <CROSSTALK> OF THE OVERALL COMPANY OKAY THIRD <INAUDIBLE> THINK ABOUT <INAUDIBLE> YEAH I THINK THAT THE REFERENCE POINT TO THAT CARLA IS IS THAT WE'RE <INAUDIBLE> AND SO AND THAT WAS A GROWTH AND GROWTH AT THE PRIOR YEAR AT SIX TO 8% SO YOU CAN SEE THAT EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF REMEMBERING THAT ONLY INCLUDES THE NOVEMBER PORTION UH OF UH HOLIDAY PERIODS SO AND OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM MIKE LASSER FROM UP- UBS GOOD MORNING THANKS A LOT FOR TAKING MY QUESTION MARK YOU MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DRIVING IN-STORE TRAFFIC TO THE BED BATH MODEL WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE WEDDING REGISTRY OR SOME OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS IN ONE OF THE LONG LASTING OUTCOMES THAT THIS SITUATION IS THAT THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE A HIGHER PENETRATION OF E-COMMERCE IN RETAIL AND SOME OF THE INITIATIVES THAT YOU'RE ROLLING OUT LIKE I PICK UP AND SHIP TO UH SHIP TO HOME ARE GOING TO DRIVE LESS TRAFFIC TO YOUR STORES SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BALANCE THAT OVER THE LONG RUN AND GENERATE SOME OF YOUR SALES PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVE WELL WE <CROSSTALK> THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION NOW WE SAW UH WHEN THINGS STARTED TO NORMALIZE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR BEFORE THE SECOND WAVE CAME THROUGH WE SAW REALLY GREAT COMPETENT STORES AND THE OMNI-CHANNEL BENEFIT OF STORES AND DIGITAL REALLY CAME TOGETHER IN A POSITIVE WAY UM YOU KNOW FOR US IN OUR FOOD PLANNING THAT WE PROVIDED FOR THE THREE-YEAR PLAN WE'VE ACTUALLY SHOWN UM WE'VE ACTUALLY FACTOR IN A VERY HIGH DIGITAL RIGHT INTO THAT SO THAT OUR FINANCIALS REMAIN STABLE BUT WE SEE THAT THE DRIVING TO STORE PHASE REALLY DOES COME FROM AN OMNI-CHANNEL ENVIRONMENT I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF GREAT RETAILERS EXEMPLIFYING THIS WITH ALIGNMENT AND A TRIP TO THE STORE WHETHER IT BE FOR BOPUS OR FOR A TRUE TRIP BOTH GENERATE A SENSE OF THE STORE IN YOUR COMMUNITY AS PART OF YOUR NETWORK AND PART OF YOUR NEEDS LIFESTYLE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO A MORE NORMALIZED BASE WE THINK OUR STORES WILL BE READY WHEN THAT COME THROUGH WITH NEW VISUAL MERCHANDISING YOUR ASSORTMENT YOUR PLANNING AND IN 150 DOORS PLUS ARE A COMPLETELY NEW ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THOSE NEW ENVIRONMENTS IS THAT WHEN WE PROVIDE THAT UM THE DIFFERENTIAL TO OUR CONTROL IS VERY VERY STRONG AND THAT WE SEE SALES GROWTH BUT WE ARE A FIRM BELIEVER IN STORES WE'RE INVESTING IN STORES UH AND THEN WE THINK THAT OUR ASSORTMENT OUR PRESENTATION AND OUR REMODELS WILL REALLY HELP US EVEN FURTHER THERE OKAY MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS IN THE BRIDGE THAT YOU PROVIDED FOR YOUR GROSS MARGIN FOR 20 2019 TO 2021 YOU TALK ABOUT THE POSITIVE DRIVERS IS SOURCING OWN BRANDS BETTER PROMOTIONS AND MARKDOWNS AND COUPONS UPSET BY SOME CHANNEL SHIFT AND FREIGHT COSTS IN THAT THERE'S THERE'S NO REAL DISCUSSION AROUND REINVESTMENT IN IN PRIDE OR OTHER TRAFFIC DRIVING INITIATIVES AND THIS IS GOING TO BE AT A TIME WHERE ARGUABLY I MEAN UH DEBATABLE THAT SOME OF THE TAILWINDS AT THE HOME-RELATED CATEGORY ARE GOING TO FADE IN A REOPENING ENVIRONMENT YEAH I THINK THE REASON WHY THAT'S NOT IN THERE IS THAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE I MEAN WE'RE ALREADY SHOWING THAT THE INDICES ON THE <INAUDIBLE> FOR OUR KEY CATEGORIES THAT WE'RE SHOWING GREAT EVERYDAY PARODY TO OUR KEY COMP SET UH WE'VE HAVE PROMOTIONS THAT WE USING NOW ARE TAKING HOLD AND ACTUALLY WE'VE USING THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY SO WE'RE SEEING COST SAVINGS IN THE PROMOTION THEY'RE GETTING MUCH MORE EFFECTIVENESS WE'VE BELIEVED THAT THESE MUSCLES WHICH WE'VE DISPLAYED IN THE LAST TWO QUARTERS THAT HAVE REALLY DRIVEN GREAT GROSS MARGIN GROWTH ARE SUSTAINABLE OR INSIDE THE MIX UH MIKE I THINK THAT THE THE PROMOTIONAL EXPECTATION OF 2021 I FEEL AS I'VE STATED I THINK WE SEE GREAT DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THE HOME TREND WILL BE STICKY THIS IS A PART OF PEOPLE'S LIVES NOW AND THEIR EXPECTATION OF CREATING JOY AND COMFORT AT HOME UM AND AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE UH AN EXCEPTIONAL CHASE INTO A PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY BUT OUR FINANCIALS AND OUR PROMOTIONAL CADENCE THAT WE HAVE AND THE BALANCE WE'VE CREATED THIS YEAR IS READY FOR THAT IN 2021 AND OUR LAST QUESTION IS FROM SETH BASHAM FROM WEDBUSH SECURITIES <INAUDIBLE> AND GOOD MORNING UM MY FIRST QUESTION IS JUST ON YOUR EBITDA GUIDANCE FOR 2021 COULD YOU GIVE US SOME COLOR AS TO WHAT THE IMPACT FROM THE BANNER SALES IS UH SPECIFICALLY COST PLUS AND AND UH UH CHRISTMAS TREE SHOPS IN THAT FORECAST SO THE GUIDANCE WE'RE PROVIDING A 2021 IS ALREADY ON OUR CORE BANNER BASIS IT IS IT ONLY INCLUDES BED BATH BUYBUY BABY BED REST AND HARMON WE SHOWED IN THE BRIDGE WHAT WOULD BE THE PROFORMA UH 2019 POSED THOSE BANNERS OF <INAUDIBLE> AND THAT'S THE STARTING POINT OF $425 MILLION OKAY THAT'S <CROSSTALK> EVEN ONGOING BASIS YES THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO AT THE INVESTOR DAY AND WE SHARE WITH MANY OF YOU AFTER WAS THAT UH WE HAD TO INCLUDE IN FULL OUR COST PLUS WORLD MIND THAT BUSINESS UM IN TERMS OF THE EBITDA PROJECTION BUT WE DIDN'T INCLUDE IN THE <INAUDIBLE> PROJECTION SO WHAT YOU SEE NOW WITH THAT SALE IS THAT FROM A RANGE OF BEING PRESENTED UM BASED ON THE TRUE PRO- PROFORMA OF 2019 AGAIN STILL WITH THAT RESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE TO EBITDA FOR THE FULL YEAR BASED ON SOME OF THE EARLY CHANGES IN HALF ON THE COMMUNICA BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS A SECONDARY PIVOT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO BE EVEN MORE DEFINITIVE ON THE WIDER FURTHER GROWTH <CROSSTALK> AND I KNOW THIS BUT IT'S A TIGHTER RANGE ON REVENUE NOW WHEN YOU COMPARE NET SALES 2021 THERE'S A REPORT OF SALES IN 2020 TO 2019 IT'S NOT COMPARABLE THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE ON A COMPARABLE BASIS AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME OF THAT DYNAMIC IN Q4 ALREADY WHILE WE'VE MENTIONED THAT Q4 NET SALES ARE GOING TO BE DOWN DOUBLE DIGITS MY REPORTING BASIS BETWEEN 15 UP TO 20% JUST SIMPLY THE IMPACT OF THE BAN ON DIVESTITURES IT'S A SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION GOING ON THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SHAPE OF THE P&L UH NEXT YEAR ON CONCEPTS ON SALES ON STORES UNDERSTOOD MY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE MIX OF ONLINE VERSUS IN STORE SALES THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING IN 2021 WHEN YOU EXPECT THAT MIX OF IN-STORE SALE TO INCREASE FROM 2020 AND IF SO WHY DO YOU EXPECT SO MUCH CHANNEL SHIFT HEADWIND IS IT JUST BECAUSE OF FREIGHT RATE INCREASES YEAH I MEAN WE DO I MEAN THERE'S A NATURAL PIVOT BACK TO STORES THAT THERE JUST WILL BE UH YOU KNOW AND AGAIN IT'S BEEN SUCH AN EXCEPTIONAL YEAR UH WE THINK THAT THE DIGITAL PENETRATION WILL UM CONTINUE TO BE STRONG UH AND WE'VE GOT GREAT OFFSETS TO THAT YOU KNOW INCLUDING WHERE WE WERE SHARING THAT 36% OF ALL THE DIGITAL LOANERS WERE ACTUALLY FULFILLED BY UH STORES IN THE QUARTER WAS JUST INCREDIBLE AGILITY THERE SO WE'RE GOING TO BE OFFSETTING SOME OF THE COSTS WE SEE SOME FREIGHT PERMEATING IN 2021 UH BUT WE ARE FACTORING IN THE HIGH DIGITAL PENETRATION RING THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR QUESTIONS I WILL NOW TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO JANET BARTH FOR CLOSING REMARKS THANK YOU AND THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING IN OUR CALL TODAY PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME OR FELIX WITH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS HAVE A GREAT DAY AND STAY SAFE THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT CONCLUDES TODAY'S CALL THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING AND YOU MAY NOW DISCONNECT",

sales and profitability and reconstruct a modern, durable model for long-term profitable growth today we stand in a very different position as a company than we did just a mere twelve months ago firstly we continue to execute On our digital first omnichannel strategy and have delivered a second consecutive quarter of comparable sales and ebda growth through strong margin management secondly, we responded to our customers wherever they needed us, growing our omni capabilities to accelerate profitable digital growth and grow our customer base thirdly, we continue to strengthen an already strong balance sheet and remain focused on ensuring liquidity optimizing costs and Significantly reducing debt while driving positive cash flow generation and while we drove overall business results we also completed our non-core banner monetization plan with the final transactions set to close in our fiscal twenty twenty fourth quarter these efforts will help fund our transformation and put us in the position to start fiscal twenty twenty one with a more cohesive set of core businesses our favorable sales results are also starting to be starting to be starting to be starting to be starting

october and november we achieved market share gains in the bed category with improving trends in both bath and kitchen categories we expect to see continued improvement in market share trends as our strategy continues to take hold additionally we continue to show strong market share strength in our Wedding registry where we believe we are very well positioned as a market leader when we get back to celebrating important life moments such as getting married. all of this has been achieved this quarter despite the significant headwinds of covid nineteen during our call today, gustavo arnal, chief financial officer and treasurer will review our third quarter financial results and then provide some perspective on our fourth quarter and our outlook for fiscal twenty twenty one. then rafi mesud, chief digital officer, will speak about the quarter from a digital first and customer perspective and then john hartman, chief operating officer and president, bye bye baby, will do the same for our operations including the progress on our plans to close underperforming stores and invest in our remaining portfolio we will then take questions gustavo thank you mike and good morning everyone today i will cover two key topics first I will provide perspective on the performance of our third quarter as well as on december sales trends and then i will provide visibility on the current fourth quarter as well as on our outlook for fiscal year twenty twenty one to begin, it is important to note that our first quarter runs through september, october and november and consistent with last year, the saturday of thanksgiving weekend was the last date of the period we delivered. strong results despite extensive and widely reported covid-related headwinds these included lower foot traffic trends shipping capacity constraints and much higher freight costs further during a challenging holiday period we strengthened our commercial plans to drive significant digital demand while remaining focused on delivering gross margin expansion positive comps sales growth was led by our core bed bath and beyond the banner which was up five percent it was fueled by exponential digital growth of ninety four percent which more than offset store declines of fourteen percent growth was healthy and broad based across five key destination categories which grew eleven percent and represented two thirds of revenue total enterprise comparable sales grew two percent also driven by strong digital com growth up seventy seven percent as you'll hear from john in a few minutes covid-related headwinds disproportionately impacted store sales in our baby business during the quarter yet, encouragingly, we saw a return to growth in december following some key interventions the strength of our digital growth has been powered by the investments we have made in omnichannel capability including buy-online-pickup-in-store, curbside pickup and same-day delivery which are all completely new this year Bopis orders represented sixteen percent of total digital sales in the quarter. these service offerings provide ease and convenience and allow us to further gain trust from our customers, including the approximately seven million new online customers gained this year. our digital capabilities are becoming a key driver of results. net sales were two point six billion, an expected reduction of five percent primarily due to the impact from banner. Vendors and the continuation of our bed, bath, and beyond store network optimization initiative this has been a holiday season like no other as outlined by third-party data sources, including censormatic and adobe analytics, market-wide black friday in-store traffic was down by over fifty percent and online spending was up twenty-two percent similarly, for the six-week holiday period during the period, market-wide in-store traffic fell between thirty-four and thirty-six percent. we performed strongly against this reported trend. during the competitive season, the intense five-day holiday sales period from thanksgiving through cyber monday, overall com sales demand for our core u.s. fedex and beyond banner was up double digits versus last year and delivered digital com sales growth of approximately sixty-nine percent more than ours. Setting store com sales declines of twenty four percent and during the six week holiday sales period from november sixteenth to december twenty seventh our total enterprise com sales grew low single digits led by significant digital growth of more than ninety percent which more than offset store com sales declines of more than twenty percent i will now continue with our third quarter financial results on a gap basis. including the non-cash loss from banners divested or held for sale we reported a net loss for diluted share of sixty one cents our gap results include approximately eighty six million dollars from unfavorable impacts which are excluded from adjusted results to provide better perspective on the underlying performance of our business these include losses on the sales of businesses including cost plus world market which is held for sale these results provide a special item such as losses on the sales of businesses including cost plus world market which is held for sale these results provide a special item such as losses on the sales of businesses including cost plus world market which is held for sale these results provide a special item such as losses on the sales of businesses including cost plus world market which is held for sale these results provide a special item such as losses on the sales of businesses including cost plus world market which is held for sale Self as well as non-cash charges for the impairment of certain long-lived assets plus restructuring and transformation expenses adjusted gross margin increased three hundred and ten basis points to thirty-five point four percent this expansion was driven by a hundred and eighty basis points of favorable strategic engineering of promotion and markdown expense including data-driven coupon optimization a hundred and twenty basis points of favorable strategic engineering of promotion and markdown expense including data-driven coupon optimization basis points of favorable product mix from higher margin categories such as bidding and batch and two hundred and ten basis points of leverage from distribution and fulfillment costs. these benefits were partially offset by a two hundred basis points impact from channel mix due to the anticipated larger proportion of total sales from digital channels versus a prior year. this impact also includes around eighty basis points of higher shipping expense associated with the channel mix. Industry-wide outbound freight rate increases particularly in the latter part of the quarter the significant year over year improvement in our adjusted gross margin reflect the management team's focus on driving the components of margin while delivering exponential growth in digital sgna expense declined forty one million dollars versus the prior year driven primarily by lower payroll related expenses including savings from our comprehensive restructuring efforts Actions earlier in the year adjusted ebay increased a hundred and sixty eight percent to a hundred and twenty one million dollars which is almost three times higher than the prior year period this was driven by digital sales growth coupled with growth margin expansion once again these results demonstrate that our efforts to transform the business and build a modern, durable business model are working turning now to some cash flow... balance sheet item statements we unlocked two hundred and forty four million dollars in positive cash flow generation cash flow from investments was two hundred million dollars positive as it included proceeds from non-core asset monetization net of capex operating cash flow of forty four million dollars was also positive in spite of seasonal dynamics we continued to carefully manage working capital this quarter with ending inventories of one point eight billion On a sequential basis, inventories were thirteen percent lower versus the second quarter and thirty percent lower than last year. this was primarily due to the impact from banner divestitures, including seasonal inventory purchases for the holiday selling period. we are tracking at a faster pace to deliver our previously stated twenty twenty one goal of one billion dollars in inventory reduction at retail compared to twenty nineteen. our capital expenditures are... in the quarter were only thirty eight million that said we have plans to significantly ramp up our capital expenditure starting in fiscal twenty one in support of our digital first omni-always transformation during the third quarter we also improved our gross debt balance with a reduction in operating lease liability of about half a billion dollars from non-core banner divestitures and store closures taken together with the half a billion dollars In debt reductions we achieved in the second quarter we have reduced total gross debt by about one billion dollars so far this year a reduction of about twenty five percent we remain in a strong net cash position with an ending cash and investment balance of one point five billion this is in line with the balance at the end of the second quarter even after returning cash to shareholders in the form of accelerated share repurchases we We have also maintained a strong liquidity of two point two billion dollars, including our ideal. so capitalizing on this strong financial position, we launched a two hundred and twenty five million accelerated share repurchase in late october and in december, in conjunction with the announcement of a definitive agreement to divest cost plus world market, we reported plans for a second asr in the amount of a hundred and fifty million these two programs totaling three hundred and seventy five million are expected to be completed on or before the end of our fiscal fourth quarter next month in february and will result in a reduction of our shares outstanding of approximately fifteen percent at current stock price levels our authorized level for share repurchases at this early stage of the planning period is now up to eight hundred and twenty five million dollars over the next three years these actions reflect our balanced approach capital allocation principles, strong liquidity and confidence in our strategic growth plans. in summary, our third quarter performance shows consistent execution of our strategy which drives sales and ebitda growth, coupled with strong cash generation and the re-initiation of capital return to shareholders. now, moving on to our outlook. we'll start with some directional callers on our expectations for q4 and then provide perspective. FROM FISCAL TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT HAS BEEN WIDELY REPORTED THAT COVID NINETEEN RELATED HEADWINDS CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE RETAIL INDUSTRY IN THIS CONTEXT WE WILL NOT BE PROVIDING SPECIFIC SALES AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR THE CURRENT FOURTH QUARTER THAT SET THAT WE FEEL POSITIVE ABOUT THE PARTS OF THE BUSINESS WE CAN CONTROL AND EXPECT TO DELIVER YEAR-ON-YEAR ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN IMPROVEMENT IN Q4 THIS DESPITE YOUR LOWS Store traffic and shipping constraints accompanied by higher freight costs. in terms of the top line, comps are expected to be approximately in line with last year. we expect consistent strength in digital to be tempered by covid-related headwinds impacting stores. december sales show positive total enterprise comparable growth including continued strength across key destination categories. importantly, we're planning Planning for a double digit impact on Q4 total net sales versus last year even the divested banners and the ongoing store optimization initiative in terms of growth margin in spite of the anticipated drag from significant freight cost increases in Q4 were driving cost optimization actions to manage the impact of these pressures so we expect gross margin to be about in line with the same period last year again hence we expect to deliver a year on year adjusted ibedat margin increase in q4 with absolute ibedat figures in line with the prior year. now i'll turn to fiscal twenty twenty one our initial outlook included fiscal year twenty nineteen as the base year at the time our portfolio banner review was still underway we had already divested four banners but we did not have a face year. Signed deals for cost plus world market yet now we do and we expect this transaction to close imminently today we're providing additional visibility on the significant we shape of our p and l as a result of these divestitures and the closure of underperforming stores our significant portfolio transformation will lead to fewer better performing stores and will include a healthier core revenue base with a world market yet a larger proportion of a faster growing digital business. we're now tightening our projected fiscal twenty one revenue range to approximately eight to eight point two billion. looking at quarters, starting with the first quarter, which will not be on a com basis, we expect to recapture the lost sales opportunities from the store closures in twenty twenty due to covid nineteen during quarters two through four, which will be... will be on a cash basis we expect to sustain comparable sales levels in relation to the solid cash sales base of fiscal twenty twenty our sales forecast for financial planning purposes assumes total enterprise comparable sales to be in line with fiscal twenty twenty we are reiterating our expectations for an adjusted gross margin of approximately thirty five percent which represents a more than two hundred basis point improvement for VERSUS PROFORMA TWENTY NINETEEN WE ARE ENHANCING ADJUSTED FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE IBIDA TO A RANGE OF BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS REPRESENTS A TWENTY PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE PROFORMA TWENTY NINETEEN IBIDA BASE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE DRIVERS OF THE ADJUSTED IBIDA RANGE ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ONES WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SHARED INCLUDING FROM PLANNED STORE CLOSURES PRODUCT SOURCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND IMPACTS FROM REINVESTMENTS AND CHANNEL SHIFT AND SHIPPING COSTS AND AS I SAID EARLIER WE HAVE ASSUMED COMP STORES TO BE IN LINE VERSUS FISCAL TWENTY TWENTY FOR MODELING PURPOSES AS WE ARE NOT REQUIRING SALES GROWTH TO DELIVER THE HIGHER EBITDA RANGE BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY WE WILL STRIVE FOR CONTINUED TOP LINE GROWTH IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT our performance to date gives us confidence in our longer-term goal of achieving between eight hundred and fifty and one billion dollars in adjusted ebitda by fiscal twenty twenty three. importantly, our portfolio transformation coupled with store closures is driving significant balance sheet improvement through gross debt reduction of one billion dollars. this will result in a gross debt to ebitda ratio of 2. That ratio below three point five times which puts us well on our way to our mid-term goal of below three times we have a strategic and disciplined pathway for driving sales and margin growth generating cash and investing in our business plan to drive shareholder value creation and it is working i will now turn the call over to rafi moussai chief digital officer rafi Thank you, gustavo. with covid as a headwind to our store traffic, we have stuffed up our strategy as an omnichannel retailer and it is paying off. during the third quarter, we delivered digital growth of seventy seven percent. our third consecutive quarter of growth in excess of seventy five percent this year our bed bath and beyond alone posted a digital com sales up ninety four percent, almost doubling last year's sales. With this momentum and based on current trends, we are on track to exceed our digital sales goal of three billion dollars by the end of fiscal twenty twenty. we have laid out a transformation plan to unlock the potential of our omni always growth strategy by elevating customer experience, building out our omni capabilities and evolving to a digital first culture. the goal of this initiative is to meet customers. wherever they are i am pleased to report that the company is now incredibly equipped to do that the benefits are coming through not only in digital sales growth but also in customer metrics during the quarter we gained two point two million new online customers of which the bed bath and beyond alone added one point eight million year to date we have gained approximately seven million new online customers and not only are our we're seeing them return at a higher rate than ever before in the third quarter twenty one percent of our bed bath and beyond customers placed more than one online order compared to about fifteen percent versus last year so what's driving the sticky customer experience for online customers we believe the true hero for us is buy online pick up in store since introducing bopis and contactless payments last year we've seen Web site pickup services earlier this year we have seen a rapid rate of adoption by our customers in the third quarter approximately one point two million customers placed a bullpup order representing sixteen percent of our total digital revenue in the bedcup and beyond bullpup orders represented fifteen percent of total digital sales and sixty percent of total digital orders and were ready within thirty days This fast and convenient experience has earned bedbathandbeyond a net promoter score of eighty percent for our bouquet services up from forty nine percent in may when we first introduced this service our stores are now a competitive advantage of our omnichannel strategy fulfilling a total of thirty six percent of all digital sales in the third quarter this muscle was not in place last year Now we're connecting our stores with our online platforms and the power of omnichannel is enabling us to better serve our customers however they choose to shop. We know omnichannel is the future of retail and we're making the right investments that are resonating with our customers. The fast-paced transformation of our digital offering and elevated customer experience has resulted in a 25% increase in our online conversion rate for the third quarter as compared to the prior year. Key drivers of the increase include first, the relaunch of our mobile sites and mobile apps. We implemented a new framework with an optimized experience that drove a thirty-three percent increase in conversion and mobile sales growth of one hundred seven percent versus the prior year period during the five-day holiday shopping period from thanksgiving to cyber monday our mobile homepage loaded seventy-four percent faster than the same period. Last year we also relaunched bed bath and beyond and bye bye baby mobile apps resulting in over eight hundred thousand downloads this quarter our bed bath and beyond mobile app was launched over fifteen million times during this quarter and revenue more than doubled versus last year we have also seen the rate of app uninstalls continue to improve further underscoring the stickiness of our customer experience. That we were firing on all cylinders going into the holiday season we launched same day delivery on bedbathandbeyond.com and byebyebaby.com to provide our customers another convenient and cost-effective way to shop this service was introduced in q3 results are preliminary but we have seen hundreds of thousands of our customers take advantage of this new convenient way to shop we also began to offer same day delivery service through the launch of bedbathandbeyond.com and byebyebaby.com baby stores on ship and instacart with both marketplaces each reaching more than eighty percent of u s. households harmon face values was recently added to the instacart marketplace and we are pleased with its initial launch and continued positive response from customers on this platform third we implemented over a hundred improvements to make our shopping experience more convenient and easier to use including a faster checkout process and end payment type options this includes buy now pay later options like afterpay and paypal's pay in 4 as well as extending apple pay from store only to our mobile apps during the quarter we also focused on optimizing our experiences and speed to place orders on our site making it even easier convenient and faster for our customers to shop with us again each of these initiatives were geared to customers with the goal of meeting them. WHERE THEY ARE AND CREATING MULTIPLE OPTIONS FOR PAYMENT AND DELIVERY AS WE LOOK AT OUR DIGITAL PROGRAM HOLISTICALLY IT IS A TRUE REVOLUTION FROM WHERE WE WERE A YEAR AGO AND HAS BECOME PART OF THE FABRIC OF HOW WE OPERATE AT BED BATH AND BEYOND THE CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENT IS RAPIDLY CHANGING AND WE ARE THERE TO GREET THEM AT EVERY TURN THROUGH OUR ENHANCED SERVICES SPEED AND FOCUS ON ENGAGEMENT OUR CUSTOMER PERCEPTION CONTINUES TO IMPROVE Our omni always strategy is working and was a key driver of our third quarter sales performance. our strength in digital has more than compensated for the headwinds of the pandemic and has fast-tracked our transformation as we moved into the important holiday season this year and set us up for success moving forward. we have delivered an elevated customer experience, launched meaningful capabilities and pivoted digital from a laggard tactic to a strategic asset. Strategic acid and a profitable growth engine that has delivered another strong quarter of growth. with that, i will turn the call over to john hartman, our chief operating officer and president of bye bye baby. john thank you, rafi. we made exceptional progress across our operations in the third quarter, specifically as it relates to our supply chain reformation, optimizing our real estate portfolio and advancing our technology roadmap. modernizing our business remains a key focus. and we are evolving our store formats our distribution and fulfillment capabilities alongside leveraging our unique data and insights to meet the changing needs of our customers and deliver an exceptional shopping experience i'll start with supply chain while we remain focused on mid to long-term capability building we made very substantial pivots in the third quarter as ravi mentioned our stores fulfilled thirty six percent of total digital sales in the third quarter while last year we didn't have bopis curbside pickup or same day delivery in our offering not only do these new capabilities provide ease and convenience to our customers they also help us to partially alleviate current shipping constraints and additional cost pressures in the supply chain during the quarter we also added a secondary national carrier in several regional parcel delivery carriers which helped to offset an over twenty percent cost increase from our primary carrier fedex And, importantly, we continue to focus intently on the health and safety of our associates working in our fulfillment centers by instituting daily covid-19 cleaning procedures in our facilities. Concurrently, we launched an evaluation of a number of potential third-party logistics providers who will partner with us to establish new regional distribution centers and to manage the efficient flow of domestic distribution. We anticipate that using third-party logistics operators will enable us to optimize our supply chain, reduce costs, and improve service levels for our customers. Will also provide increased financial flexibility and reduced capital expense this is the cornerstone of the transformation of our supply chain network and will increase our capacity for fast-paced replenishment while continuing to leverage our store network for omni fulfillment by making the replenishment process more efficient our store teams will have a more predictable and faster flow of the products we sell most in turn this will allow us to meet the increased demands. For bopis courier and same day delivery services while also reducing the time our store teams spend managing deliveries so they can spend more time with our customers also core to our transformation is technology and we are taking a disciplined approach to our investments in building a technology infrastructure that will enable us to personalize the service for our customers improve our ability to predict and meet demand make it easier to collaborate across teams and and Drive down inefficiencies in our business over the next three years we plan to invest approximately two hundred and fifty million dollars to modernize the application and technology landscape to a cloud-empowered foundation last quarter we talked about our expanded multi-year partnership with google and deloitte to enhance our omni-channel shopping experience this quarter we defined our plans for a new rp system we will also be pursuing a product life cycle Management solution in support of our own brand initiative and an inventory management capability to improve inventory productivity these plans will all start in two thousand and twenty one and are the foundational parts of building out our technology infrastructure in other activity we are making significant progress toward the targets we have previously highlighted regarding our real estate portfolio including our store network optimization and store remodel plans Let me start with our network optimization program which is designed to not only insure our stores remain a strategic asset for us but also to insure that we have them in the right locations to deliver more sustainable sales growth improved margins and greater cash generation as part of this work we are well underway in the process of closing approximately two hundred underperforming bed bath and beyond stores by the end of fiscal twenty twenty one initially we identified about one billion dollars in underperforming stores and beyond stores. one third of these stores to be closed by the end of the fiscal year we have since accelerated the pace of targeted store closings this year from seventy to about one twenty stores with certain stores closing earlier than planned due to having efficiently sold down store inventory during the closing process in the third quarter we closed four bed bath & beyond stores and in december we closed another seventy five and we are currently liquidating an additional forty two stores We are very pleased with our progress to date and completing the store closure program during fiscal twenty twenty one remains a priority turning to our bed bath and beyond store remodel program we have advanced from the initial prototype phase to active iteration within ten stores in our houston market these proof of concept stores highlight our destination categories bed bath kitchen and storage we expect complete this phase of the remodel program by the end of february twenty twenty one additionally, we will take all the visual signage enhancements and immediately apply them to the entire fleet of stores on the same timeline next, we will take our learnings from houston and move into our first expanded wave of renovations in twenty twenty one which includes approximately one hundred and fifty stores in total our store remodel plan involves two hundred and fifty Million dollars of investment over the next three years and touches over four hundred and fifty stores representing roughly sixty percent of our revenue in addition we will utilize strategic sourcing methods to procure necessary remodel components at a lower cost and leverage economies of scale with this overall initiative instead of the legacy store by store one off approach of the past we have established a unified planning process to Identify, prioritize, and sequence all aspects of the remodels. These store remodels and our network optimization plans are crucial steps in building an omnichannel organization that serves our digital-first customers with an intuitive and modern shopping experience. We look forward to reporting our progress along the way. Before closing, let me provide some perspective on the quarterly performance of Buy Buy Baby, which represents 10% of our total revenue.

Quarter Approximately ten percent of total enterprise reported sales in the third quarter this included strong growth in digital of approximately forty percent which represented more than half of the sales in the quarter it remains a challenging environment for our new or soon to be parents who are particularly vulnerable to the perceived challenges associated with in-store shopping due to covid nineteen as a result we saw a disproportionate level of store traffic declines from our baby customers this quarter than across our other banners these covid-related headwinds have also had a short-term impact on the registry component of our business which is highly correlated to in-store activity while we have seen overall growth in registry digital registries created online currently tend to carry a lower average value than those created in-store enhancements to the digital registry experience are addressing this opportunity To assist our customers in building a more well-rounded baby wish list covid headwinds have also constrained inventory levels in certain of our key categories such as furniture and gear as a result of disruptions in the global supply chain we have made key pivots here including sharing improved forecasts with our vendor partners well into two thousand and twenty one so as consumer behavior shifted we pivoted and leaned into Digital to create an enhanced online experience with a more convenient suite of checkout options including afterpay, pay in 4 and apple pay. we also upgraded and relaunched our byebaby app in november, strengthening the choices we offer our customers who connect with us digitally year to date we have gained nearly two million u.s. online customers, an increase of forty six percent over last year, including more than a half million new online customers in the third quarter in all nearly two thirds of our baby customers only shop online this quarter as young parents take safety into consideration this year our new omni capabilities allowed us to meet them where they are with bopis curbside and same day delivery services digital orders fulfilled by our baby stores represented a significant portion of total orders in the quarter with bopis orders representing approximately half of all store orders Orders while the holiday period is traditionally not a big baby season except for gift-giving or needs of families getting ready for or just having had a baby we did see strong digital demand comps of forty-nine percent year over year during the five-day holiday period from thanksgiving to cyber monday this growth was driven by top-performing baby categories including toys playroom furniture and apparel these positive results sales and category trends accelerated in december we believe in this business and we are now ready to double down on and significantly invest in expanding sales and margin in growing our market share we plan to accelerate our growth in baby over the next several years including introducing own brands aging up into toddler and younger children as well as expanding into categories like toys and educational as well as furniture enhancing our registry and leading with new partnerships we will also invest to scale our footprint nationwide with about 50 new stores over the next three years fiscal two thousand and twenty one will mark the true beginning of the transformation of this banner as we execute our three year plan and unlock the value of this brand earlier this week we announced the appointment of patty wu as senior vice president and general manager for bye bye baby our Exceptional experience will help accelerate our plans and drive meaningful change. we look forward to sharing our progress and future conference calls. mark, i'll turn it back over to you now for closing remarks. thank you, john. our strong performance this quarter across several key performance metrics including positive comp sales growth, gross margin expansion, positive cash flow generation and gross debt reduction is evidence of this. Our transformation taking hold even despite the significant headwinds of a global pandemic yet what i saw beyond the numbers was even more impressive our team was planning, modifying and executing in an aligned and disciplined way like never before they were learning and improving in real time as the customer and conditions changed showing true agility in motion these newly acquired muscles extended from product and price through messaging and digital expression To sales floor and distribution center i am truly grateful to all our associates that rallied around this call to action to demonstrate our strengths and opportunities as the new bed bath & beyond team in what has been an exceptional year of change so far we still continue to make bold pivots to reconstruct renovate and restore our company simply put we are delivering on what we said we would do we said we would put a team in place that would have the right talent and expertise To execute our new vision and inject new ideas and that we would create the right organizational structure to facilitate more streamlined decision making and we've done that we said we would lean into the digital space and make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us and we are doing that we said we would reset our cost structure modernize for growth and refine our organization and we've done that and continue to focus on gross margin improvement we said we had a clear Mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omnichannel home destination and that we would use customer-inspired and market insights to develop our new customer value proposition and we are doing that we said we would evaluate our asset base and how best to optimize its value for the business on a go-forward basis and we have done that and finally we said our mission is to ensure that bed bath & beyond is well-positioned for long-term success and we're doing just that. I am proud of what our teams have achieved and i thank them for their continued dedication and commitment to the long-term success of our company our results this quarter set a firm base from which we will continue to drive our bold transformation and seek to deliver on our three-year strategic and financial goals shared at our twenty twenty investor day we have many bold and exciting plans for fiscal twenty twenty one such as launching new own brands that will help differentiate us in our key destinationation Category remodeling approximately one hundred and fifty stores under our store network optimization program introducing new and unique digital services designed to enhance our omni always experience modernizing our technology in operations and reinventing our supply chain for the future investing to further strengthen our buy by baby and harmon banner's and continuing to unlock and deliver shareholder value. In a year like no other, we are embracing and driving transformative change, staying curious and bold, and so much more. I'm proud of the commitment our teams have shown and what we have achieved together. With that, we will now take your questions. First question is announced. if using a speaker phone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. once again, if you have a question, press star then mau on your touchtone phone. and our first question is from kurt nagel from bank of america. good morning, thanks very much for taking my questions. yeah, so the first one is, you know, understand how very strange shipping and a freight was an issue for holiday margins, but How long do you think this pressure carries into twenty one it sounds like at least for the full year you don't think it's an issue since you're still targeting twenty i'm sorry thirty five percent gross margins in twenty one and then just have a follow up after that good morning kurt thanks look we you know we know that the freight pressure you know across retail is here to stay and we've built that into our future plans so we see that our margin stability and the offsets that we Created currently in the proof of concept of those over both q2 and q3 of this year really stands in good stead to deliver that thirty five percent margin so we feel really comfortable around that okay and maybe just again for you mark, maybe give this a quick update on some of the big merchandising initiatives you've outlined in the october analyst day such as lowering sourcing and vendor costs and then you know, starting to think about, you know, how we're going to, how we're going to think about, you know, how we're going to think about, you know, how we're going to think about, you know, how we're going to think about, you know, how we're going to think about, you know, how we're going to think about, you know, how we're going to think To roll out improved and more merchandise or more exclusive product and how much of an impact that'll make in twenty one or at least how to think about the cadence of those things you know in two thousand and twenty one yeah i mean the good news is that we've already built a firm foundation with these results you know the actions and trends we out here in terms of margin but across the board are really substantial and sustainable and then we're going to add into those the rolling benefits as you've outlined so it's the sourcing benefits that we've undertaken throughout Twenty twenty are really going to be evidenced in first quarter onwards in twenty twenty one and then we begin in march with the rollout of our own brands and we're going to be sharing more closely in the pagination of that flow throughout the year several brands will be launched but the key news is that in the first half of twenty twenty one will be addressing the majority of our big key categories where we're already seeing strength and growth in reinventing those with our own brands and also the introduction of opening price point items and a range there which has been a huge missing part of our equation in terms of being truly competitive in the marketplace to build our authority. so these step changes, the consistent management of promotions the mix management now we're going to lay in the incremental benefits of sourcing and own brand so we're excited about that progression in twenty twenty one our next question is From simeon gunn from morgan stanley good morning, thanks for taking my question. can you talk about where your expectations were a couple of months ago for the fourth quarter in sales and now and and i know the outlook for next year imbedded flattish does that change now that you're going to be lapping something that may be potentially weaker in this year's fourth quarter? yeah, i think simeon gunn from morgan stanley Again we had robust plans for q4 of this year we feel good about how we're executing on those but there's no doubt that the covid-19 headwinds and the impact that that has had on foot traffic and due overall consumer confidence has something that would have to factor into our plans hence why we talked about the agility of our team through q3 and now q4 to respond to those challenges and so we think we've met those in in what has been a turbulent year Time and we really look forward to lapping those next year in a very different way ok, thanks for that. and then my follow up can you talk about q four you mentioned the freight headwinds and but offset by some optimization on i think the gross margin in terms of promotion and pricing can you talk about the promotional environment and then and then you know, thinking about how much margin opportunity there still is. i think for next year's Guidance revision that is it looks like it's more of a function of the margin changing as opposed to the top line just to confirm yeah, i think that you know, we would stress that we did not become more promotional during the quarter in q3 or in q4. we actually reshaped and reengineered our promotional activity. we had opportunity to do so but that's really paying dividends in terms of generating gross margin and helping to create that balance and exceed. Achieving equation on on the margin differentials from shipping and freight so we're less promotional we're more focused on reg price we're winning customers and we see that progressing forward and as gustavo had outlined we're not putting pressure on the the working sales plan to generate our ebitda we believe that we can do that through a number of the different initiatives we have through cost control and definitely margin growth in twenty twenty one as we've outlined in our three day Playing at three eyed pigs, sorry. And our next question is from bobby griffin from raymond james. Good morning, buddy. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, just to start off, mark, the first thing i wanted to talk about was, you know, looking at the range for next year, it's a fairly tight range of five hundred to five hundred twenty five million ebitda. You know, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. So, can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you see in the business now that really gives you confidence and tightening that range up? And as a second part of that, as a second part of that, as a second part of that, as a second part of that, as a second part of that, as a second part of that, as a second part of that, Um, where, what, what could be the driver that would cause that range to underperform? Is it sales? Is it margin? What, what gives you the most concern there? Hi, Bob, it's Joe here. So, definitely, there's still a lot of uncertainties as we look forward, but we feel very confident in our plans. We have clarity on the drivers of gross margin expansion, which is why we are reiterating a gross margin of thirty five percent. Here in spite of the recent headwinds that we're seeing in freight costs as mark mentioned were being more data-driven in managing our promotion and our banks and with that we will offset it it is a tighter range than the wide the one we provided at investors day but we said that as we completed the portfolio work the monetization of non-core assets we would tighten that and that's what we're coming over to you Now on your question of what can throw us off, it's not sales. we are prudently assuming for financial planning purposes that we would have sales, comps sales in line with prior year. and in fact, with that, we will deliver significant ebitda growth yeah, bobby, i would just add that i think that the plan we're placing is a responsible plan based on changing circumstances in the market any threat or concern would really be A macro market issue, not an internally caused issue. And again, I think twenty twenty is exemplified how, you know, everyone gets affected by those things. So we are monitoring things very carefully by week and by quarter. We feel our plan is responsible and achievable and we're looking forward to delivering that. Great, thank you. I guess my second question would be for the december commentary. Mentioned that the enterprise did show some growth for comparable sales. But then again, I'm not sure what you're asking. for the entire quarter you're you're kind of calling for flattish versus last year or in line i believe still rewarding can you maybe just talk a little bit about what is going in there is something popped up in the last couple of weeks that's given you concern or is that just a little bit of you know function of being conservative given the level of uncertainty that's still out there in the world yeah bang on there it's definitely around we've seen positive signs in december remembering that our fourth quarter is december january february we're still around We'll have two full months to complete this process. there's a lot going on in the world and we want to make sure that we're being responsible in our planning and you know, we look forward to kind of sharing more in the fourth quarter. thank you very much. best of luck. once again, if you have a question, press star then one on your touch tone phone. and our next question is from chris hoves from jp morgan. Thanks, good morning, guys. so, my first question is a follow-up. as you think about, you know, you talk about, you know, things evolving and changing as you thought about, you know, your, your twenty one plan. is it fair to say that, you know, covid changed, in terms of the recent surge, are you assuming that this sort of lasts longer until we actually get to a vaccine? so, was the change there, and also, the other change, the freight costs. i mean, presumably, as a holiday, the volume surge, the search costs, i mean, presumably, as a holiday, the volume surge, the search costs, i mean, presumably, as a holiday, the volume surge, the search costs, i mean, presumably, as a holiday, the Charges should come down as you get into a more normalized sort of shipping environment here. so is there something structural within that freight that you're that you're assuming sticks around? yeah, i think that i think it's prudent to to think about an environment. i mean, we saw an acceleration, a change in behavior between our q two and and september october results and versus our november results. Based on covid and based on foot traffic to stores customers being concerned around what the future held and real uncertainty in the market that really began around the election period. so we are being prudent in thinking through, you know, with the vaccine rollout it's still underway, still very early. we want to be able to monitor that and its impacts. we haven't factored in anything in terms of stimulus checks and their impact on the business because again, that's been so uncertain. Just new news so just ensuring that the level of uncertainty and volatility that that has or could bring is built conservatively into our plans and that we can balance out any of those headwinds you know i think it's been interesting that there's been a lot of discussion around the home category experiencing this great tailwind from you know the covid moment all of us in retail have been facing incredible headwinds and confusion and concern from the customer that we've had to face so i feel really really good positive that we're delivering positive comps, profit, ebitda in the face of that uncertainty and want to ensure that we've got a balanced plan going into twenty twenty one got it, so to understood. and then in terms of the fourth quarter, i mean, just relative to history, for gross margin rate to be you know, worse in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, just trying to really understand that. you've mentioned not being you know, you know, worse in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, just trying to really understand that. you've mentioned not being you know, you know, worse in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, just trying to really understand that. you've mentioned not being you know, you know, worse in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, just trying to really PROMOTIONAL IN DECEMBER UM IS IT YOU KNOW YOU GET ABOUT OUR MATH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY BIPS FROM THE ACCOUNTING SHIFT BETWEEN COST OF GOODS AND S G N A SO IS THIS SHIPPING SURCHARGER GONNA BE CHARGES GONNA BE MUCH LARGER THAN THE EIGHTY BASIS POINTS THAT YOU SAW ON THREE Q YOU LAP A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BASIS POINTS OF MARK DOWN PRESSURE AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY CLEAN INVENTORY SO JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE D On a you know sort of year-by-year and sequential basis in gross margins such that it would be flat in the fourth quarter year-by-year sure chris it's right on what you said about the shipping costs part of the reason in the prepared remarks we talked about eighty basis points impact in q three that was just the latter part of the quarter what we're estimating in q four is over a hundred and fifty basis points impact and we're committed to offsetting that again And through disciplined promotion management and mix and that's what we will do but the incidents on the shipping costs it's much larger in q four and that's why we're being put on that nigel i just said it sorry i just also add if you're looking at q four versus q four last year the thing you'll recognize is that the consumer behavior and and the impact of digital purchasing versus store purchasing you know it is not like for like and It's definitely accelerated and that's brought with it natural pressures to margin and mix as we've shared. But that we're off-setting that and mitigating that to be stable, I think, is a real achievement. So these are, you know, it is unique like no other, and the consumer behavior that digital pivots and therefore what that's meant for margin inclusive shipping is part of what we're balancing there. And again, one month into our three month quarter, but we want to make sure that we're being pretty. Understood, thanks so much, guys. And our next question is from Peter Benedict from Baird. Hi, guys. Thanks, thanks for taking the question. Um, first, just curious, on the adoption of Opus, and I know it's been around six months, and you know, the curve side, but how is that trending relative to your expectations, and what kind of what are your plans or goals to drive continued adoption of that? In the months ahead, that's my first question yeah, peter, great question. i think what we've seen you know, we showed an overall statistic for q three, but i'm packing that you see an escalation and a movement into the new muscle. remember, we only introduced this in may. so what we're seeing now is we have an nps score of eighty. you know, we're able to provide about a two hour assurance on our order fulfillment and store level. it's actually in real terms around thirty minutes. customers are loving it. I think in a total industry level, both as a muscle and a new methodology is very accepted by the customer and we're benefiting from that as well. we saw our rates in the december period escalate week in, week out as customers became more concerned around delivery shipping times and really ensuring that they had a joyful holiday period that they could secure the present under the tree. and so we really went into Creating ease and convenience for our customers that they really responded to and we were very grateful for. We believe these are constants now and their muscles in the business that we want to maintain. And for us, we know that a boat or a workboat filled by store is almost equivalent to a store by sale in terms of profitability. So the differential helps us and has helped us through q3 and will help us in q4 in terms of our shipping and profitability costs. So we think it's here to stay. It is one of the sticky outcomes. of not just the progress in mobis but how covid has fortified this is a new muscle for most retailers ok, thank, thanks for that, mark. and then i guess, shifting, you guys brought up registry a couple of times during your prepared remarks and i'm not sure how much you're willing to share quantitatively on the size of those businesses, but maybe you'd like to qualitatively on the size of those businesses. but just curious, kind of how you see those two to businesses. and and you talked a little bit about basket size. but just curious, kind of how you see those two to businesses. and and you talked a little bit about basket size. but just curious, kind of how you see those two to businesses. and and you talked a little bit about basket size. but just curious, kind of how you businesses or that business across the two segments as part of your outlook over the next couple of years, any opportunities, thanks yeah, it's a great point. i would actually differentiate between the moment in time experience versus the go forward experience. and the moment in time experience as john outlined baby registry is very strong for us but it has been more reliant on an in-store experience. and when we do that we build a big basket it's more sticky and higher customer engagement. and so we've been pivoting to Strengthen our digital registry and will invest there further. But for us, we see complete upside in twenty twenty one with, you know, the return to a more normalized shopping environment in stores and digital in terms of true omnichannel. When we turn to bed bath and beyond, the story is even better. We are consistently in the top of the ranking in and have held market share in most recent data in terms of registries. Now, we haven't had the benefit of that in our twenty twenty one. Or current numbers because of the covid moment and people are just not having wedding ceremonies in twenty twenty one there's going to be a pent up demand and transfer into into that year for weddings to occur and because we are number one in those spaces and well placed with held market share and that the stats are good we feel like that as a runway for growth over the next couple of years is one of our solid strengths that hasn't existed in our twenty twenty one or current numbers and we're going to be going there We're doubling down in investing there even further our next question is from stephen forbes from guggenheim good morning so i wanted to focus on the trends within the categories maybe outside of the top five that you noted in the release so so mark just curious how how these categories are performing i know it's early but performing within some of the new concept stores or remodels and and or if you could just speak to some of the initiatives, right, that we've Better at addressing the performance here because although it's it's the lower percentage of sales, it's still one third here. so i'd love to see how you're thinking about improving those specific categories and yeah, and the shared trajectory within them yeah, thanks stephen. it's a great question. i think that there's been some natural headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to store-based traffic than digital traffic for us. and one of them is personal care. again, We in our remodel stores that we've been testing our personal care business is booming and actually showing a huge differential to our control. and when we get the traffic, we get the trade and i think what we saw in the end of q3 and and somewhat in q4 is this sort of suppression of foot traffic in stores that has a direct correlation and that's a business that either is a great basket build business or is just part of A trip to store that's just not occurring at this moment as frequently as it has in the past. there are a couple of key areas too where we have had some some softness i think cleaning is a really good example for us an area that's normally been strong i think getting supply product has been an issue it's it's constrained across the globe and and we just haven't been firing in that space but at the same time we also cleared out of smaller categories like food To kind of clean up our assessment that we build into that impact. so we're really focused on doubling down on our strength categories. you see that coming through and consistently through q3, q4 and our efforts and strategically in twenty twenty one but we are definitely focusing on a couple of key categories where we can really ramp up our inventory and our focus and we're already starting to see positive sides of that in january It's just a quick follow-up either for you or estebo. obviously we know the minimum wage rate increases that are transpiring this year and you potentially some pressure right from other retailers announcing the past fifteen so curious how you guys think about that as a pressure point right on the business and in what's incorporated right in the financial guidance as it relates to wage investments for twenty twenty one. yeah, we definitely see the emerging trend and the financial guidance as it relates to wage investments for twenty twenty one. it's just a quick follow-up either for you or estebo. obviously we know the minimum wage rate increases that are transpiring this year and you potentially some pressure right from other retailers announcing the past fifteen so curious how you guys think about that as a pressure point right on the business and in And the evolution, we're looking at, you know, change of leadership and how that can impact on that. no news on that today, other than that we're looking at it very, very carefully. want to be competitive in the marketplace and will be absorbing that into our overall cost and financial plans going forward. thank you. best of luck. our next question is from carla cassella from jp morgan. hi. please give us an update on what how much of your cost savings did you achieve in the quarter from your overall goal yeah we're on track with the path that the objective we have of two hundred to two hundred and fifty million dollars going next year we expect about a hundred and twenty five at least in the current quarter we saw savings as you saw in the building block Right, a hundred and eighty basis points from product margin and savings, including leveraging of distribution costs of two hundred and ten basis points okay, so we could count those towards the cost savings program, okay, that's great. and also, um, did you provide overall same store sales at babies r us? i know you gave some details, but i don't think i heard the same store sales number overall. no, we did not provide that budget i mean, historically, for the third quarter no, we haven't what we said in the prepared remarks is that in the third quarter, sensor cells were down in badabybaby and then recovered in december the reason why they were down temporarily in the quarter is some of the dynamics that john spoke about just keep in mind store sales, store traffic, particularly in buy buy baby, slowed down significantly in november and it was partly compensated by the strength in digital but still that recovery started happening in december ok, great and if you're how much of your if you look at the bed bath and beyond business alone how much of that business was done by digital i know you talked about digital growth there but i'm wondering you gave it for the overall company but how much of that business was done by digital Trading in bedbathandbeyond versus last year we did share that the digital growth there is ninety four percent for the quarter color so exceptionally strong i guess i'm wondering what percentage is the digital sales not the growth a thirty one percent of the overall company ok third thank you yeah, i think that the reference point to that color is that they were at ninety percent last year so and that was a growth and growth of the prior year at sixty percent so i think that the reference point to that color is that they were at ninety percent last year so and that was a growth of the prior year at sixty percent so i think that the reference point to that color is that they were at ninety percent last year so and that was a growth of the prior year at sixty percent so i think that the reference point to that color is that they were at ninety percent last year so In so you can see that exponential growth through remembering that only includes the november portion of holiday periods so and our next question is from mclaughlin or from ubs good morning thanks for taking my question marcia mentioned several times about the importance of driving in-store traffic to the bed bath and beyond model whether it's through the wedding registry or some of the personal care items Products. and one of the long-lasting outcomes of this situation is that they're just gonna be a higher penetration of e-commerce in retail. and some of the initiatives that you're rolling out, like curbside pickup and ship a ship a home are gonna drive less traffic to your stores so how are you gonna balance that over the long run and generate some of your sales productivity initiatives? well, Michael, thanks for your question. We saw when, you know, things started normalizing in the middle of the year before the second wave came through. We saw really great comps in stores and that the omnichannel benefit of stores and digital really came together in a positive way. You know, for us, in our forward planning that we provided for the three year plan, we've actually shown we've actually factored in a very high digital rate into that so that our financials remain stable. But we see that the the driving to store piece really does come from an omnichannel environment. i think there's a number of great retailers that are exemplifying this at the moment and a trip to the store whether it be for bopa or for a true trip both generate a sense of the store in your community as part of your network and part of your needs lifestyle. so we look forward to a more normalized base. we think our stores will be ready when that comes through with new visual merchandising, your assortment, your planning, and in our One hundred and fifty doors plus a completely new environment and what we've seen in those new environments is that when we provide that the differential to our control is very, very strong and that we see sales grow. So we are firm believers in stores. We're investing in stores. And we think that our assortment, our presentation, and our remodels will really help us even further. For your gross margin for twenty nineteen to twenty twenty one you talk about the the positive drivers of sourcing own brands better promotions and markdowns and coupons upsetting some channel shift and freight costs in that there's there's no real discussion around re investment in in price or other traffic driving initiatives and this is going to be at a time where arguably and i know this is debatable that Some of the tailwinds that the home-related category are going to feed in a reopening environment yeah, i think the reason why that's not in there is that that work has been done. i mean, we're already showing that the indices on the kbais for our key categories that we're showing great everyday parity to our key comp set we've our promotion that we're using now are taking hold and actually we're using them more effectively so we're seeing cost savings. In the promotions but getting much more effectiveness we've believed that these muscles which we've displayed in the last two quarters that have really driven great gross margin growth are sustainable areas inside the mix michael i think that the the promotional expectation of twenty twenty one i feel has overstated i think we see great data that shows that the home trend will be sticky this is part of people's lives now and their expectation of creating joy and comfort at home and an And we don't believe that there's going to be an exceptional chase into a promotional activity but our financials and our promotional cadence that we have and the balance that we've created this year is ready for that in twenty twenty one and our last question is from seth bassam from wedbush securities thanks a lot and good morning my first question is just on your ebita guidance for two thousand and twenty one could you give us some color as to what the key drivers are? the impact from the banner sales is specifically cost plus and and christmas tree shops in that forecast so the guidance we're providing in twenty twenty one is already on a core banner basis it is it only includes bed bath and beyond buy buy baby decora and harmon we showed in the bridge what would be the pro forma twenty nineteen post so those banner ads at vestis and that's a starting point of four hundred and twenty five million dollars okay, that's hopeful on an ongoing basis yes, seth, one of the things that we weren't able to do at the investor day and we share with many of you after was that we had to include full a cost plus world market business in terms of the ebda projection, but we didn't include the sales projection. so what you're seeing now with that sale is that that's a starting point of four hundred and twenty five million dollars okay, that's hopeful on an ongoing basis yes, seth, one of the things that we weren't able to do at the investor day and we share with many of you after was that we had to include full a cost plus world market business in terms of the ebda projection profoma range being presented based on the true profoma of nineteen nineteen again, still with that responsible attitude to it but for the full year based on some of the early changes in half of one that will occur. but you know it was a secondary pivot that we could provide to be even more definitive on the way to further growth yeah, and importantly, there's that, that i know you know this, but it's a tighter range on revenue now when you compare net sales twenty nineteen to twenty twenty one, you'll see that it's a tighter range on revenue now when you compare net sales twenty nineteen to twenty twenty one, you'll see that it's a tighter range on revenue now when you compare net sales twenty nineteen to twenty twenty one, you'll see that it's a tighter of reported sales in twenty twenty or nineteen nineteen it's not comparable that's why we want to provide the guidance on a comparable basis and we're going to see some of that dynamic in q four already while we've mentioned that q four net sales are going to be down double digits on a reported basis between fifteen up to twenty percent it's simply the impact of the ban on advertisers it's a significant transformation going on it's a totally different shape of the p n l Next year on concepts, on sales, on stores. Understood. My follow-up questions relate to the mix of online versus in-store sales that you're expecting in two thousand and twenty one. Would you expect that mix of in-store sales to increase from two thousand and twenty? And if so, why do you expect so much channel shift, headwind, to just because of freight rate increases? Yeah, I mean, we do. I mean, there's a natural pivotal point. Back to stores, that just will be, you know, and again, it's been such an exceptional year. we think that the digital penetration will continue to be strong and we've got great offsets to that, you know, including where we were sharing that thirty six percent of all digital orders were actually fulfilled by stores in the quarter. it was just incredible agility there. so we're gonna be off setting some of the costs. we see some freight permeating in twenty twenty one but we are factoring in the high digital penetration. Thank you very much. And as is all too often the case, we have for questions. And I will now turn a call back over to janet barth for closing remarks. thank you and thank you all for participating in our call today. please feel free to contact me or felix with any additional questions. have a great day and stay safe. that concludes today's call. thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect."

WILL REVIEW FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER THANKS IV AS MENTIONED EARLIER ON THE CALL WE HAVE POSTED SLIDE PRESENTATIONS TO OUR INVESTOR RELATIONS WEBSITE THAT COVER KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES WE'VE ALSO POSTED OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY HERE'S THE FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER NET SALES WERE 72 MILLION DOWN 6.8% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD ON A PRE-TAX GAAP BASIS THE COMPANY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF 5.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH A PRE-TAX INCOME OF 4.3 MILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AS PREVIOUSLY DI- DISCLOSED A FEW WEEKS AGO ON FEBRUARY 18TH THE RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR INCLUDE A REVERSAL OF A 6.1 MILLION RECORDED CONTINGENT EARN-OUT LIABILITY AS WELL AS NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF 13.6 MILLION RELATED TO THE HOME ACCESSORY DIVISION RESULTING IN A NON-CASH NET CHARGE OF 7.6 MILLION EXCLUDING THIS NET CHARGE ADJUSTED PRETAX INCOME NON- GAAP WAS 2.4 MILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF THIS FISCAL YEAR THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF LAST FISCAL YEAR INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY 769,000 IN RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES AND CREDITS AND OTHER NON-RECURRING ITEMS DUE MOSTLY TO THE CLOSURE OF THE COMPANY'S ANDERSON SOUTH CAROLINA PRODUCTION FACILITY EXCLUDING THIS NET CHARGE PRETAX INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF LAST YEAR WAS 5 MILLION NET LOSS ATTRIBUTED TO CULP INC SHAREHOLDERS WAS $58,000 OR ZERO CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF 3.2 MILLION OR 25 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD THE RESULTS OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF BOTH FISCAL YEARS INCLUDE THE RESPECTIVE CHARGES AND RESTRUCTURING RELATED CREDITS I JUST NOTED THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 19% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND 142.8% FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR THE COMPANY'S HIGH EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD REFLECTS THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE COMPANY'S PROJECTED ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED TAXABLE INCOME PARTICULARLY IN THE US WHICH INCLUDES THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED AS WELL AS THE MIX OF CONSOLIDATED TAXABLE INCOME THAT IS EARNED BY THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS LOCATED IN CHINA AND CANADA THAT HAVE HIGHER HIGHER INCOME RATES IN RELATION TO THE US THE CURRENT MIX OF TAXABLE INCOME HAS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAX INCOME OR GILTI TAX WHICH REPRESENTS A US INCOME TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS IMPORTANTLY INCOME TAXES INCURRED IN THE US ON A CASH BASIS FOR FISCAL 2020 ARE EXPECTED TO BE THE MINIMAL DUE TO THE PROJECTED UTILIZATION OF THE COMPANY'S US FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS AND IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF US CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LOOKING AHEAD TO THE REST OF THIS FISCAL YEAR WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR CONSOLIDATED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WILL REMAIN HIGH AND BE IN THE 120% 130% RANGE BASED ON THE FACTS THAT WE KNOW TODAY AND AS AFFECTED BY THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE NOTABLY THE US TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAVE ISSUED NEWLY PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT IF AND WHEN ENACTED AND IF ENACTED AS PROPOSED COULD PROVIDE US WITH SOME RELIEF FROM THE GILTI TAX UNDER THE PROPOSED GILTI HIGH TAX EXCEPTION ELECTION BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2021 OR LATER SUBJECT TO THE TIMING OF ENACTMENT AND SUBJECT TO ANY DETERMINATION BY THE US TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND IRS THAT THE EXCEPTION SHOULD APPLY RETROACTIVE RETROACTIVE THE PROPOSED GILTI TAX HIGH TAX EXCEPTION ELECTION IS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ARE FINALIZED AND EFFECTIVE IF THE PROPOSED GILTI TAX EXCEPTION ELECTION IS ENACTED AS PROPOSED AND BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL 2021 YEAR AND ASSUMING WE DO NOT HAVE NON-RECURRING CHARGES OR IMPAIRMENTS THAT WOULD REDUCE OUR PRE-TAX INCOME THEN BASED ON CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS WE WOULD ESTIMATE OUR TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2021 TO TO BE IN THE RANGE OF 35 TO 50% HOWEVER LET ME STRESS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS THAT AFFECT THIS RATE INCLUDING THE MANY FACTORS I'VE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY SO THIS ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE TRAILING 12 MONTH ADJUSTED EBITDA AS OF THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF THIS FISCAL YEAR WAS 19.6 MILLION OR 6.7% OF SALES CONSOLIDATE RETURN ON CAPITAL FOR THE TRAILING 12 MONTH PERIOD WITH 8.7% NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR TWO AT OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR MATTRESS FABRIC SEGMENT SALES WITH

PURCHASES IN ANTICIPATION OF ADDITIONAL TARIFFS OPERATING INCOME FOR THE QUARTER WAS 3 MILLION COMPARED WITH 3.8 MILLION A YEAR AGO WITH OPERATING INCOME MARGIN OF 8.7% COMPARED WITH 10.2% A YEAR AGO WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE 8.7% MARGIN THIS YEAR GIVEN THAT IT WAS ACHIEVED DURING THE QUARTER WITH THE CHINESE NEW YEAR SHUTDOWN OCCURRED RETURN ON CAPITAL FOR THE TRAILING 12 MONTH PERIOD FOR THE UPHOLSTERY FABRIC SEGMENT CONTINUES TO BE IMPRESSIVE COMING IN AT 54% THE HOME ACCESSORY SEGMENT WHICH INCLUDES OUR E-COMMERCE AND FINISHED PRODUCT BUSINESS OFFERING BEDDING ACCESSORIES AND HOME GOODS REPORTED 3.9 MILLION IN SALES TO THE THIRD QUARTER COMPARED WITH 4.4 MILLION A YEAR AGO OPERATING LOSS WITH THE QUARTER WAS 181,000 WHICH REFLECTS CONTINUED SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT FROM THE $350,000 LOSS EXPERIENCED IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE $535,000 LOSS EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST QUARTER WE'LL COMMENT MORE ON OPERATING PERFORMANCE LATER ON HERE ARE THE BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS WE REPORTED 34.8 MILLION TOTAL CASH AND INVESTMENT AND OUTSTANDING BARNS NINE- OF 925,000 FOR A NET CASH POSITION OF 33.9 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF THIS FISCAL YEAR WE INCURRED 4.1 MILLION CAPITAL

REFLECTS A DISCOUNT TO OUR CALCULATED INTRINSIC VALUE PER SHARE HOWEVER AS HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY WHICH IS POSTED IN THE RE- INVESTOR RELATIONS SECTION OF OUR WEBSITE WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON A VERY DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION INCLUDING MAINTAINING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND SOLID CASH POSITION PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY IN THE GLOBAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT WITH THAT I'LL TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO IV THANKS KEN UH LET ME START WITH THE MATTRESS FABRIC SEGMENT OUR MATTRESS FABRIC SALES WERE LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE YEAR AS WE WERE PRESSURED BY MORE THAN EXPECTED OR WE WERE PRESSURED MORE THAN EXPECTED FROM HOLIDAY SHUTDOWNS AND CONTINUED INDUSTRY WEAKNESS FOR OUR LEGACY BUSINESS CUSTOMERS MATTRESS COVERS HAVE BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS AND LOSING MULTIPLE PRODUCTIVE WEEKS FOR OUR CLASS COVER OPERATIONS IN HAITI AND ALSO IN CHINA CAUSED A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT WHEN COMBINED WITH SOFTNESS AND OUR LEGACY BUSINESS ALSO THE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES RELATING TO LOW PRICE MATTRESS IMPORTS FROM CHINA HAVE NOT YET PROVIDED THE RELIEF EXPECTED FOR THE DOMESTIC MATTRESS INDUSTRY IN SPITE OF THESE CHALLENGES WE CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS WITH A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON CREATIVE DESIGNS INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE OUR GLOBAL PLATFORM SUPPORTS THESE EFFORTS WITH EFFICIENT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF MATTRESS FABRICS AND SOME COVERS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO EVOLVING CUSTOMER NEEDS WE ARE STRENGTHENED BY OUR EXISTING MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN THE US CANADA HAITI CHINA AND OUR SOURCING PLATFORM IN TURKEY WE EXPECT TO ADD FABRIC PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES IN VIETNAM THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING OUR SEWN COVER PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES IN HAITI WITH A NEW BUILDING AND ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT WE BELIEVE THESE EXPANSIONS WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITIES TO SERVE CUSTOMERS FURTHER WHILE THE DOMESTIC DISRUPTION FROM LOW PRICE MATTRESS IMPORTS APPEARS TO BE CONTINUING AS A RESULT OF MANY IMPORTS MOVING FROM CHINA NOW TO OTHER COUNTRIES WE BELIEVE OUR STRONG GLOBAL PLATFORM FOR FABRIC AND COVERS IN ASIA HAS US WELL-POSITIONED TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE WITH IMPORTED MATTRESSES GOING FORWARD ADDITIONALLY WHILE THE HOLIDAY SHUTDOWNS DISRUPTED OUR CLIENTS OPERATIONS IN HAITI AND CHINA DURING THE THIRD QUARTER WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR SEWN MATTRESS COVER BUSINESS DEMAND TRENDS FOR MATTRESS COVERS REMAINS FAVORABLE ESPECIALLY FOR THE GROWING BOX BEDDING SPACE AND WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP FRESH PRODUCTS WITH BOTH NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS WITH SOME COVER PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES NOW IN THE US HAITI AND ASIA WE HAVE A VERY STRONG PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS US TO MAXIMIZE OUR FULL SUPPLY CHAIN POTENTIAL FROM FABRIC TO FINISHED COVERS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN DESIGN AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES WITH OUR LATEST TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND SPEED TO MARKET WITH NEW DIGITAL TOOLS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THE INITIAL CUSTOMER RESPONSE TO OUR NEW 3D MAPPING AND RENDERING CAPABILITIES WHICH IS BEING MARKETED AS RE IMAGINE CULP HOME FASHIONS THIS REFLECTS THE SPIRIT OF INNOVATION IN OUR MATTRESS FABRICS BUSINESS WE'RE ALSO ENHANCING OUR SERVICE PLATFORM AS PART OF OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO CUSTOMER DEMAND WITH SHORTER LEAD TIMES AND WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A NEW INVENTORY MANAGEMENT PROCESS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL DRIVE GREATER CONTROL I'M ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH SANDY BROWN OUR LONG TIME CFO IN THE MATTRESS FABRIC SEGMENT IS NOW PRESIDENT OF THE DIVISION HAVING WORKED WITH SANDY FOR OVER 20 YEARS I'M CONFIDENT SHE HAD THE EXPERIENCE EXPERTISE AND THE VISION TO LEAD THIS BUSINESS AS WE STRIVE TO OPERATE OUR STRONG PLATFORM IN THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER LOOKING AHEAD THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE OUR POSITION AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF MATTRESS FABRICS AND SEWN COVERS WE BELIEVE WE WILL BENEFIT FROM OUR RECENT AND ONGOING EFFORTS TO FURTHER OUT DESIGN AND SERVICE CAPABILITIES WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT SUPPORT OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS WITH BOTH LEGACY AND NEW CUSTOMERS NOW I'LL TURN TO THE UPHOLSTERY FABRIC SEGMENT OUR UPHOLSTERY FABRIC BUSINESS WAS AFFECTED BY A SLOW DOWN IN SHIPMENTS HEADING INTO THE CHINESE NEW YEAR HOLIDAY RESULTING IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED SALES FOR THE QUARTER IT'S DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF THE HOLIDAY SHUTDOWN FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND THIS YEAR WE EXPERIENCED A GREATER THAN EXPECTED DECLINE IN JANUARY LEADING UP TO THE HOLIDAY PERIOD AS A RESULT WE SHOWED A MODEST DROP IN SALES COMPARED WITH A VERY STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAIN BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT WE FACED WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF OUR UPHOLSTERY FABRIC BUSINESS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE COMPARISON TO A VERY STRONG QUARTER LAST YEAR IN FISCAL 2019 WE HAVE A STRONG PLATFORM IN CHINA AND STABLE LONG-TERM RE- SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS WITH VENDORS THAT PRIORITIZE OUR PRODUCTION DUE TO THOSE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS THIS HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE FOR CULP ESPECIALLY AS WE RES- RESUMED OPERATIONS AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER FOLLOWING AN EXTENDED GOVERNMENT MANDATED SHUTDOWN IN CHINA ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK WE BELIEVE THIS PLATFORM SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE CURRENT DISRUPTIONS CREATED BY THIS OUTBREAK AND THE PROCEDURES REQUIRED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ALSO OUR ADDITION OF CUT AND SEW CAPABILITIES IN VIETNAM FOR THE END OF FISCAL 2019 HAS FURTHER AUGMENTED OUR ASIAN PLATFORM THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2020 WE HAVE CONTINUED TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS OF INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND DIVERSIFYING OUR CUSTOMER BASE WE ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR HOSPITALITY BUSINESS AS WE'VE EXTENDED OUR REACH IN THIS GROWING MARKET LEAD WINDOW PRODUCTS OUR WINDOW TREATMENT AND INSTALLATION SERVICES BUSINESS HAS BEEN A KEY DRIVER OF OUR GROWING SALES IN THIS BUSINESS AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AS WE EXPAND OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO TO THE HOSPITALITY MARKET PRODUCT INNOVATION IS ALSO A HALLMARK OF OUR SUCCESS IN THE MARKETPLACE AND PROVIDED THE STATE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR CULP OUR LINE OF HIGHLY DURABLE STAIN RESISTANT LIVESMART FABRIC CON- CONTINUES TO BE VERY POPULAR WITH BOTH EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE DEMAND TRENDS FOR LIVESMART EVOLVE OUR RECENTLY INTRODUCED LINE OF SUSTAINABILITY FABRICS FEATURING THE USE OF RECYCLED YARNS ALONG WITH THE SAME STAIN RESISTANT PERFORMANCE LOOKING AHEAD WHILE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REMAIN REMAINS UNCERTAIN WITH THE HEALTH ISSUES SURROUNDING THE CORONAVIRUS IN CHINA WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY WITH FAVORABLE RESULTS WE HAVE A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS CREDIT DESIGN A GROWING CUSTOMER BASE ACROSS BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND HOSPITALITY MARKETS AND A GLOBAL PLATFORM TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS AND MEET CHANGING CUSTOMER DEMANDS AS SUCH WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER ANOTHER SOLID PERFORMANCE IN OUR UPHOLSTERY FABRIC IN FISCAL 2020 LASTLY I'LL COMMENT ON THE RESULTS FOR CULP HOME ACCESSORIES WHICH INCLUDES OUR E-COMMERCE AND FINISHED PRODUCTS BUSINESS OFFERING BEDDING ACCESSORIES AND HOME GOODS WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO REFINE OUR STRATEGY AND DRIVE IMPROVED RESULTS FOR OUR HOME ACCESSORY SEGMENT WHILE IT'S TAKING LONGER THAN WE EXPECTED TO REACH OUR INITIAL PROJECTION FOR THIS BUSINESS WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY RECENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH NEW ONLINE MARKETPLACES AND BUSINESS TO BUSINESS SALES CHANNELS WE ALSO REMAIN DEDICATED TO IMPROVING OUR PERFORMANCE ON AMAZON WHICH IS A PRINCIPAL SALES CHANNEL FOR OUR LEGACY E-COMMERCE BUSINESS IN TANDEM WITH THESE STRATEGIES WE ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS FEATURING CULP MATTRESS FABRICS AND UPHOLSTERY FABRICS AND WE WERE PLEASED WITH A VERY SOLID SHOWING UP AS NEW PRODUCTS AT THE RECENT LAS VEGAS MARKET WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT POTENTIAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR CULP HOME ACCESSORIES AND THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THIS NEW IMPORTANT SALES CHANNEL TO REACH NEW CUSTOMERS FOR CULP KEN WILL NOW REVIEW OF THE OUTLOOK FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND WE'LL THEN TAKE SOME QUESTIONS IMPORTANTLY OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ASSUMED THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK DOES NOT HAVE A GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS WHICH MAY AFFECT EACH OF THE COMPANY'S DIVISIONS TO VARYING LEVELS WE ARE MONITORING THE SITUATION DAILY AND FOLLOWING THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES PROVIDED FOR IN THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PANDEMIC DISEASE CONTINGENCY PLAN TO PROTECT OUR WORKFORCE HOWEVER THE POTENTIAL IMPACT WITH THE CORONAVIRUS IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE REASONABLY AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE SOLIDITY AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE DISEASE AND THE ACTIONS BEING TAKEN TO CONTAIN ITS SPREAD SUBJECT TO THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS WE EXPECT THE OVERALL SALES TO DECREASE SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF LAST YEAR WE EXPECT MATTRESS FABRIC SALES TO BE SLIGHTLY DOWN COMPARED WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF LAST YEAR DUE TO CONTINUING MARKET PRESSURE AND STOCK WITHIN OUR LEGACY BUSINESS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER WHILE OPERATING INCOME AND MARGINS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR PERIOD IN OUR UPHOLSTERY FABRIC SEGMENT WE EXPECT FOURTH QUARTER SALES AND OPERATING INCOME AND MARGINS TO BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD IN OUR HOME ACCESSORY SEGMENT WE EXPECT FOURTH QUARTER SALES TO BE COMPARABLE TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF LAST FISCAL YEAR WE EXPECT AN OPERATING LOSS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND CONTINUED QUARTER REPORT SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR CONSIDERING THESE FACTORS THE COMPANY EXPECTS REPORT PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER IN THE RANGE OF 1.9 MILLION TO 2.4 MILLION EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES OR CREDITS OTHER NON-RECURRING CHARGES AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IF ANY PRE-TAX INCOME FOR LAST YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER WAS 1.5 MILLION WHICH INCLUDED A NON-RECURRING CHARGE OF $500,000 EXCLUDING THIS CHARGE PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF LAST YEAR WAS $2 MILLION BASED ON OUR CURRENT PROJECTION CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR ARE NOW EXPECT TO BE IN THE 6 MILLION TO $6.5 MILLION RANGE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPECT TO BE APPROXIMATELY 8.6 MILLION ADDITIONALLY FREE CASH FLOW FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR IS EXPECTED TO BE MODERATELY DOWN AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR'S RESULTS WITH THAT WE WENT OUT TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE SIGNAL BY PRESSING STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU'RE USING A SPEAKER PHONE PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR MUTE FUNCTION IS TURNED OFF TO ALLOW YOUR SIGNAL TO REACH OUR EQUIPMENT AGAIN PRESS STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION WE'LL PAUSE FOR JUST A MOMENT TO ALLOW EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNAL FOR QUESTIONS WE'LL TAKE OUR FIRST QUESTION FROM BOBBY GRIFFIN WITH RAYMOND JAMES PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS GOOD MORNING BOBBY SO I GUESS THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS UM PRODUCT MAYBE ADDING SOME FABRIC PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES IN VIETNAM AND MAYBE CAN WE EXPAND ON ON WHAT THOSE CAPABILITIES WILL GIVE YOU GUYS AND WHAT'S THE STRATEGY TO PARTICIPATE MORE AND WHAT I I GUESS WE CAN CALL THE ASIA IMPORT MARKET FOR MATTRESSES BACK INTO THE US RIGHT THANK YOU BOBBY THIS IS IV I'LL TAKE THAT QUESTION UM YEAH YOU HAVE TO GO BACK A LITTLE BIT AS WE THINK ABOUT THE ANTI DUMPING AND TARIFFS UM YOU KNOW WHICH IT FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW NOW WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THAT ANYMORE BUT THAT WAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OVER THE LAST YEAR THE SECTION 301 TARIFFS THE RULES FOR UPHOLSTERY AND MATTRESS FABRICS ARE ARE QUITE DIFFERENT SO THE REASON WE'RE LOOKING PRIMARILY TO ESTABLISH M- FABRIC MANUFACTURING IN VIETNAM IS BECAUSE TODAY MATTRESS FABRICS HAVE A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT UM EXTRA 301 TARIFFS COMING FROM CHINA AS DO MATTRESS COVERS UM UNLIKE FURNITURE OR UPHOLSTERY FABRIC WHERE WE CAN SHIP FABRIC FROM CHINA TO VIETNAM TO AVOID A TARIFF UNLESS YOU MAKE THE FULL SOWN COVER FABRIC ALL THE WAY TO COVER IN VIETNAM YOU STILL YOU WOULD STILL PAY THE EXTRA TARIFF SO FOR US ESTABLISHING IN VIETNAM IS UH IS A RISK MANAGEMENT PLAY A COST SAVING PLAY AND CERTAINLY GIVES US THE ABILITY TO MAKE COVERS THAT WE CAN UH FULFILL THROUGH VIETNAM THAT WE CAN THEN SELL INTO OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE MAKING BEDS AND END UP IN THE US OR BRING THAT UP IN COVERS OF OUR OWN BACK TO US IN THE US WHAT ABOUT- <CROSSTALK> YEAH THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I'M JUST CURIOUS FROM A COMPETITIVE STANDPOINT ONCE YOU GET THIS OPERATION SET UP WOULD THOSE CORRESPONDING COVERS THAT YOU CAN NOW MAKE IN VIETNAM BE COMPETITIVELY PRICED TO SOME OF THE COVERS THAT ARE ALREADY GOING ON IMPORTS UH IN FOR THE BEDROOM TO THE US TODAY YES SIR BOBBY WE EXPECT YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN VERY COMPETITIVE WITH COVERS ALREADY MATTRESS COVERS THAT WE'RE MAKING THROUGH OUR CULP CHINA PLATFORM UH HAVE BEEN VERY COMPETITIVE AND THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES MATERIALIZING THERE BUT TO BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO AND TO DEAL WITH US TARIFF RULES AND AND COSTS VIETNAM COULD BE POTENTIALLY COULD POTENTIALLY MORE ADVANTAGEOUS IN CERTAIN CASES OKAY AND THEN SECOND FOR ME ON THE HOME ACCESSORY BUSINESS YOU TALKED ABOUT MAYBE IMPROVING SOME OF THE PERFORMANCE ON THE AMAZON CHANNEL SO CAN YOU CAN YOU MAYBE EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THOSE STRATEGIES AND THEN SECONDLY IS THERE YOU KNOW A BIGGER OPPORTUNITY TO SELL SOME OF THOSE FINISHED PRODUCTS IN IN RETAIL LOCATIONS UH YES SIR BOBBY THOSE ARE REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS TOO UM FIRST OF ALL TOUCH ON THE AMAZON PART WHEN WE FIRST INVESTED IN HOME ACCESSORIES AMAZON WAS THE SOLE UH REALLY THE PRIMARILY PRIMARY PART OF THE BUSINESS UP TO 80% OF THE SALES UH AND WE WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT SINCE THE TIME WE'VE INVESTED IT'S BECOME MORE COSTLY TO DO BUSINESS AND TO RANK HIGHER TO GOOGLE AD WORDS TO JUST FIND YOURSELF HIGHER IN THE RANKINGS SO IT ENDED UP COSTING US MORE MONEY THAN WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED SO WE'VE DIALED BACK OUR OFFERINGS ON AMAZON TO REALLY WHAT WE CONSIDER OUR CORE MOST STABLE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ADVERTISING SO WHAT WE HAVE PLACED ON AMAZON TODAY WE BELIEVE WE CAN SERVE AS WELL IT'S A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT THAT SHOULD RANK WELL AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO OVER ADVERTISE IT AND AND SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY TO MAKE IT WORK SO WE'RE ANTICIPATING AMAZON BEING A SIGNIFICANT BUT MORE LIKE A 50% SHARE OF OUR BUSINESS AND NOT NOT SUCH A HEAVY PIECE UH FOR CERTAIN WE HAVE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES IN ALL OF OUR ACCESSORY PRODUCTS ON THE B2B SIDE UH WE HAVE A LOT OF CUSTOMERS UH ROLL PATH BETTING CUSTOMERS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR PRODUCTS TO TAKE ON AND HAVE ADDITIONAL SALE ACCESSORIES WE ALSO HAD A CHANCE TO SELL SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS INTO SOME RETAIL DIRECT DISTRIBUTION AND THAT IS WORKING UM SOMETIMES IT'S NEVER AS FAST AS WE WANT IT TO BE BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO TO GET INTO RETAIL CYCLE BUT WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THAT OPPORTUNITY ALSO ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING MY QUESTIONS IV THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL BEST OF LUCK IN THE NEXT QUARTER YES SIR THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN THAT IS STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION IF YOU FIND THAT YOUR QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED YOU MAY REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE QUEUE BY PRESSING STAR TWO AND STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION WE'LL TAKE OUR NEXT QUESTION FROM PAUL BETZ WITH STIFEL UH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UM CONTINUING WITH AMAZON YOU MENTIONED SOME NEW SELLERS ARE VIOLATING UH TERMS UM CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND MAYBE IF THAT GETS RECTIFIED YOU KNOW YOU'LL LOSE SOME OR SEE LESS COMPETITION YES SIR WELL UM PAUL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IT'S IV I'LL I'LL TAKE THAT TOO UM BASICALLY WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE WE FIRST STARTED WITH AMAZON AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STORIES IN THE PRESS ABOUT THIS THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE PRIMARILY CHINESE SELLERS HAVE UH FLOODED THE MARKETPLACE ON COMMODITY ITEMS UM MATTRESS PROTECTORS AND MATTRESS PADS AND THINGS THAT WE SPECIALIZED IN AND AMAZON HAS PRETTY SPECIFIC TERMS OF SERVICE THE WAY YOU THE WAY YOU ACQUIRE A FIVE-STAR REVIEWS WE HAVE A LOT OF REVIEWS THAT UH WE'VE EARNED THROUGH STEADY UM NORMAL PROCESSES SELLING ITEMS GETTING REVIEWS IT'S NOT REALLY IN TERMS OF SERVICE TO BE DOING A LOT OF FREE GIVEAWAYS AND FABRICATING REVIEWS AND ALSO TO BE DOWNGRADING COMPETITORS WITH FAKE REVIEWS WHICH WE HAVE FOUND UM INSTANCES OF ALL THOSE THINGS AND WE HAVE REPORTED THEM TO REALLY HIGH LEVELS IN AMAZON AND AND MADE SOME HEADWAY SO AMAZON IS WORKING REALLY HARD TO CHANGE THEIR METHOD THE WAY THEY UH RANK SUPPLIERS AND I THINK IN TIME THAT WILL GET BETTER BUT IT'S A PRETTY IT'S A PRETTY LONG FIGHT FOR SOMEONE LIKE US TO TO MAKE A BIG IMPACT REALLY QUICK BUT THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN BY TERMS OF SERVICE VIOLATION IT'S REALLY FABRICATED AND FALSIFIED REVIEWS PRIMARILY OKAY THANKS AND THE CAPEX WAS REDUCED UM THAT JUST TO CONSERVE CASH OR WHAT AREAS UH DID YOU MIGHT LOWER THAT SUM YEAH WELL THIS CAN UM YEAH WE WE LOOKED AT THE YEAR AND GIVEN OUR CASH POSITION WE STARTED PRIORITIZING PROJECTS AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WHAT WE CALL MAINTENANCE CAPEX WHICH IS IN THAT 6 MILLION OR SO RANGE UH SO UM WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE'RE ENDING UP PROJECTED ENDED UP AND THEN LOOKING FORWARD I MEAN WE ARE GOING TO IN THIS TIME OF UNCERTAINTY WE ARE GOING TO PRIORITIZE PROJECTS AND AND AS WE SAID KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON OUR CASH BUT UH WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE BUSINESS AS AS WE ALWAYS HAVE AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO UH YOU KNOW JUST M- MARK THE THINGS CLOSELY AND PRIORITIZE PROJECTS AS THEY COME ALONG OKAY THANKS AND LASTLY UM THE OF COURSE MARGINS IN THE MATTRESS SEGMENT UM WILL BLOW OUR EXPECTATIONS DOWN YEAR OVER YEAR IS THAT JUST THE DISRUPTION FROM UH THE HOLIDAY SHUTDOWN OR ARE THERE ANYTHING ELSE GOING ON THERE NO THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD UH INSIGHT THERE THE UH OBVIOUSLY THE LOWER SALES UH HAD AN IMPACT BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF UH MOVING PARTS WITH THE SHUT DOWNS AND ALL THAT UH IN THE QUARTER AND UH SO THAT WAS THE THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE MATTRESSES BEING DOWN YOU KNOW THE IN THE LOWER SALES AND THE OTHER DISRUPTION AS WELL OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WE'LL TAKE OUR NEXT QUESTION FROM MARCO RODRIGUEZ OF STONEGATE CAPITAL MARKETS PLEASE GO AHEAD UH GOOD MORNING GUYS THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS WONDERING IF UH <CROSSTALK> MORNING UH I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE THE EXPANSION ACTIVITIES UM THAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IN VIETNAM AND HAITI IF YOU COULD JUST MAYBE PLACE UM A A TIMELINE AS FAR AS WHEN THESE CAPABILITIES UH WILL BE THERE AND THEN AND THEN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE YES SIR THANKS FOR THE QUESTIONS MARCO UM THE EXPANSIONS IN VIETNAM AND AND HAITI UM ARE ARE BOTH REALLY TARGETED FOR THE MATTRESS FABRICS BUSINESS IN TERMS OF THE EXPANSION STANDPOINT WE'RE ALREADY OPERATING PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY IN VIETNAM FOR OUR UPHOLSTERY CURTAIN FULL KITS UH THAT'S PERFORMING WELL UH HAITI YOU KNOW WE STARTED A A TWO-PRONGED STRATEGY A REALLY THREE PRONGED STRATEGY FOR MATTRESS COVERS YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR US BUSINESS THAT IS A PROTOTYPING AND QUICK ROLLOUT AND EMERGENCY RECOVERY PLATFORM THAT WORKS WELL FOR US UH HAITI IS A A VERY LOW COST OPPORTUNITY THAT WE SEE UM OUT ON A NEAR SOURCING UH POTENTIAL SO WE'RE ABLE TO DRIVE UH SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER LEAD TIMES IN HAITI IT'S BEEN A REALLY RESOUNDING SUCCESS FOR US SO FAR AND WE'RE JUST EXPANDING THE BUILDING SO UM IT'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST BUILDING SOME EXTRA SPACE AND ADDING SOME MORE SEWING MACHINES GETTING INTO CUT AND SEW SO IT'S NOT A HEAVY CAPEX UH VENTURE SO WE WOULD ANTICIPATE BEING IN THAT PLAN AND HAVING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY THIS SUMMER IT'S A PRETTY FAST UH PRETTY FAST UH UPRISING THERE AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT HAITI THE GOOD PART ABOUT IT IS WE CAN BRING FABRICS FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TODAY UM AND CO- IF IT'S SHOWN IN HAITI AND COMES BACK TO US THERE'S NO DUTY ON ANY OF THE PRODUCTS IN OR OUT SO VERY ADVANTAGEOUS PLATFORM THAT SHOULD PROVIDE US WITH UH FASTER LEAD TIMES IF WE FORECAST AND STORE INVENTORY AT THE RIGHT PLACES UH VIETNAM IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT ABILITY FOR US TO DABBLE WITH MATTRESS FABRICS IN A SMALL WAY WE SHOULD WE'LL START START SMALL MAINLY FOCUSED ON SERVING ASIAN CUSTOMERS AND THAT'S OUR ATTEMPT TO GET AFTER SOME OF THE BEDS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN ASIA AND WE CAN DO THAT WITH BOTH FABRIC OR WITH A SEWN MATTRESS COVER UH IF WE NEED TO WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING SOME OF THAT BACK TO THE US UM NOT PREFERRED ON LEAD TIME BASIS BUT IT COULD BE GOOD FOR COSTS UM AND WE'LL JUST DO THAT ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS AND WE WOULD AVOID A SECTION 301 TARIFF GOT IT UH UNDERSTOOD AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE UM UH THE SERVICE PLATFORM UM UH ADDITIONS OR ENHANCEMENTS THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT IN THE IN- IN THE NEW INVENTORY MANAGEMENT UH CAN YOU MAYBE EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ON WHAT SORT OF IMPACT IF ANY YOU MIGHT SEE ON THE P AND L AND OR THE BALANCE SHEET WITH THOSE WELL WHAT AND AND NOW I CAN'T NOW I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE IMPACT BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE WAY THE REASON WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT IS THE MATTRESS INDUSTRY ALWAYS FOR A LONG TIME WAS A PRETTY QUICK SPEED TO MARKET BUSINESS WHERE WE PRETTY MUCH INVENTORY SHIPPED EVERYTHING SAME DAY AND WE STILL DO THAT FOR A BIG PART OF THE MARKET BUT AS THINGS HAVE GOTTEN MORE DIVERSE WITH IMPORTED MATTRESSES AND IMPORTED COMPONENTS UH LEAD TIMES HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE LONGER SO WE'VE TRIED TO THEN MATCH OUR PLATFORM WITH ALL THE MULTI COUNTRIES THAT WERE IN US CANADA CHINA HAITI VIETNAM AND THEN OUR SOURCING BUSINESS IN TURKEY WE WANT TO BRING LEAD TIMES BACK DOWN EVEN WITH THAT GLOBAL STRATEGY SO OUR ANTICIPATION WOULD NOT BE TO GET OUT OF THE LONGER LEAD TIMES THAT WE'VE HAD RECENTLY SHORTEN THOSE LEAD TIMES DOWN SO WE'RE NOT CAUGHT WITH SO MUCH EXPOSURE ON THE WATER AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE SO WE'RE JUST OUR INTENTION IS TO BRING A BETTER EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF OUR SCHEDULING UM FASTER LEAD TIME TO CUSTOMERS TO MAKE THEM HAPPY AND THEN REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE FOR EXTRA INVENTORY YEAH MARCO THIS IS KEN AND THAT'S UH WE HAD YOU KNOW THE EXTRA INVENTORY WE WE WERE EXPECTING OBVIOUSLY A BETTER QUARTER THAN WE HAD AND SO WE BUILD UP INVENTORY THAT THOSE SALES DIDN'T MATERIAL- UH DIDN'T MATERIALIZE BUT NOW WITH THIS NEW FOCUS UH WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET INVENTORY DOWN AND AND KEEP IT IN LINE UM WORK CONSISTENTLY WHICH WILL OBVIOUSLY HELP IMPROVE THE CASHFLOW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER BUT UH WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW PROCESS AND UH YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY DON'T GET BACK IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE BUILD UP INVENTORY IN EXPE- IN IN ANTICIPATION SALES THAT THAT DON'T MATERIALIZE SO THIS IS THIS IS AN EXCITING MOVE AND ONE THAT'S UH THAT WE'RE EXCITED UH ANXIOUS TO GET STARTED GOT IT A- AND LAST QUICK QUESTION I KNOW IT'S IT'S KIND OF A DIFFICULT ONE HERE ON GUIDANCE UM YOU KNOW YOU YOU BUILT IN SOME SORT OF AN IMPACT FOR CORONAVIRUS UM BUT JUST KIND OF CURIOUS IF MAYBE YOU CAN PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE COLOR AROUND WHAT WHAT DOES WORSENING CONDITIONS MEAN FOR YOU OR LOOK LIKE ARE ARE WE TALKING UM UH ADDITIONAL SHUTDOWNS IN CHINA UM AS FAR AS THE RISK IS CONCE- CONCERNED AND I KNOW THAT YOU

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to welcome to the call the Kulp quarterly conference call with analysts and investors.

EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY WHO IS SIGNING IN REMOTELY I WILL NOW BRIEFLY CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO SOME BRIEF COMMENTS AND KEN WILL THEN REVIEW THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER I WILL THEN UPDATE YOU ON THE STRATEGIC ACTIONS IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND AFTER THAT KEN WILL VIEW OUR FOURTH QUARTER PHYSICAL TWENTY TWO BUSINESS OUTLOOK WE WILL THEN BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE I GIVE AGAIN MY COMMENTS ON Our current supply chain currently, colp has not seen significant impact from the virus in any of our businesses. in our polyester fabric business, our colp location is operating at normal levels with virtually all employees reporting to work. we have also built a stable long-term supply base in china and we work with vendors who favor colp due to our strong, trusted relationships. we have experienced minimal delays, as most of our suppliers have backed nearly full output and continue to do so. We continue to prioritize our production. We have also relocated a considerable amount of our cut and sew production to two facilities we work with in Vietnam. Likewise, in both our mattress fabrics and home accessories business, we are not currently experiencing any delays in Asia and we also have significant alternative locations for production as needed. This includes production or sourcing capabilities in the US, Canada, Haiti, Vietnam, and Turkey. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THE VIRUS WILL HAVE ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN THE US CONSUMER MARKET WE BELIEVE OUR SOLID AND STABLE SUPPLY CHAIN AND OUR GLOBAL PLATFORM SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE ANY DISRUPTION CREATED BY THE OUTBREAK NOW WE WILL TURN TO THE THIRD QUARTER RESULTS AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED OUR RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER REFLECTED LITTLE IMPACT ON EXPECTED SALES PARTICULARLY IN OUR CO WE BELIEVE COLLAPSE IS WELL POSITIONED FOR THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERM OUR GLOBAL PLATFORM IS REACTIVE AND IS A DISTINCT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR THE COMPANY PROVIDING THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY RESPOND TO CHANGING MARKET DYNAMICS WE ALSO BENEFIT FROM SIGNIFICANT SYNERGIES ACROSS OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS THAT ARE FOSTERING COLLABORATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ALLOW US TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS IN ALL MARKETS ABOVE ALL WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON INNO BUSINESSES AND WE ARE CONFIDENT IN OUR PRODUCT DRIVEN STRATEGY AND THE ABILITY TO MEET THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF A DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE DURING FISCAL TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE MAINTAINED OUR POSITION AS A TRUSTED SUPPLIER OF FABRICS FOR A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO SUPPORT AND EXECUTE OUR STRATEGIES AND CONTINUE RETURNING FUNDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD FOR THE Call over to Ken who will review financial results for the quarter. Thanks, Iv. As mentioned earlier on the call, we have posted slide presentations to our investor relations website that cover key performance measures. We've also posted our capital allocation strategy. Here are the financial highlights for the third quarter. Net sales were $72 million, down six point eight percent compared to the prior year period. On a pre-tax basis, the company reported a net loss of five point one million compared to a pre-tax income of four point three million. FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED A FEW WEEKS AGO ON FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH THE RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR INCLUDE A REVERSAL OF A SIX POINT ONE MILLION REPORTED CONTINGENT EARN OUT LIABILITY AS WELL AS NON CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF THIRTEEN POINT SIX MILLION RELATED TO THE HOME ACCESSORIES DIVISION RESULTING IN A NON CASH CHARGE OF SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION For the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, the financial results for the fourth quarter of last fiscal year included approximately seven hundred sixty nine thousand in restructuring and related charges and credits and other non-recurring items, due mostly to the closure of the company's Anderson, South Carolina production facility. Excluding this net charge, pre-tax income for the third quarter of last year was five million dollars. Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the third quarter of last year was fifty eight thousand dollars or zero cents per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. Compared with net income of three point two million or twenty five cents per diluted share for the prior year period, the results of the third quarter of both fiscal years include the respective charges and restructuring related credits I just noted. The effective income tax rate was nineteen percent for the third quarter and a hundred forty two point eight percent for the year to date for this fiscal year. The company's high effective income tax rate for the year to date reflects a significant decline in the company's profits. Proposed annual consolidated taxable income, particularly in the US, which includes the income tax effects of the asset impairment charges previously discussed as well as the mix of consolidated taxable income that is earned by the company's foreign operations located in China and Canada that have higher income rates in relation to the US. The current mix of taxable income has led to a significant increase in the effective income tax rate that is associated with our global. TANGIBLE LOW TAX INCOME OR GUILTY TAX WHICH REPRESENTS A US INCOME TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS IMPORTANTLY INCOME TAXES INCURRED IN THE US ON A CASH BASIS FOR FISCAL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ARE EXPECTED TO BE MINIMAL DUE TO THE PROJECTED UTILIZATION OF THE COMPANY'S US FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOAN PROGRAMS AND IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF US CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LOOKING AHEAD TO THE REST OF THIS FISCAL YEAR WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR CONSOLIDATED EFF The tax rate will remain high and be in the one hundred twenty percent to one hundred thirty percent range based on the facts we know today and as affected by the factors noted above. Notably, the US Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service have issued newly proposed regulations that, if and when enacted, could provide us with some relief from the guilty tax under the proposed guilty high tax exception election beginning in fiscal year twenty twenty one or later. Due to the timing of enactment and subject to any determination by the U S Treasury Department and IRS that the exception should apply retroactively retroactive the proposed GILTI tax high tax exception election is not available until the proposed regulations are finalized and effective if the proposed GILTI tax high tax exception election is an act as proposed and becomes effective for our fiscal year twenty twenty one year and assuming we do not have a GILTI tax high tax exception election is an act as proposed and becomes effective for our fiscal year twenty twenty one year and assuming we do not have a GILTI tax high tax exception election is an act as proposed and becomes effective for our fiscal year twenty twenty one year and assuming we do not have a GILTI tax high tax exception election is an act as proposed and becomes effective for our fiscal year twenty twenty NON RECURRING CHARGES OR IMPERFECTIONS THAT WOULD REDUCE OUR PRE TAX INCOME THAN BASED ON CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS WE WOULD ESTIMATE OUR TAX RATE FOR FISCAL TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE TO BE IN THE RANGE OF THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY PERCENT HOWEVER LET ME STRESS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS THAT AFFECT THIS RATE INCLUDING THE MANY FACTORS I'VE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY SO THIS ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE TWELVE MONTHS JUST AHEAD 26 POINT SIX MILLION OR SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF SALES CONSOLIDATED RETURN ON CAPITAL FOR THE TROY TWELVE MONTH PERIOD WAS EIGHT POINT SEVEN PERCENT NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR TWO AT OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR THE MATTRESS FABRIC SEGMENT SALES WERE THIRTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOWN SEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT COMPARED TO LAST YEAR THIRD QUARTER OPERATING INCOME FOR THE QUARTER WAS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION The operating performance was primarily affected by lower than expected sales. Return on capital for the trailing twelve month period for mattress fabrics was fourteen point one percent. For the opposing fabric segment, sales for the third quarter were thirty five million, down five point seven percent over the prior year which prior year was a strong, very strong quarter sales performance that was positively affected by advanced customer purchases in anticipation of additional tariffs operating income for the quarter was The quarter was three million, compared to three point eight million a year ago, with operating income margin of eight point seven percent, compared to ten point two percent a year ago. We are pleased with the eight point seven percent margin this year, given that it was achieved during the quarter in which the Chinese New Year shutdown occurred. Return on capital for the traveling twelve month period, for the apparel fabrics segment, continues to be impressive, coming in at fifty four percent. The home accessories segment, which includes our e commerce and finished products business, continues to be impressive, coming in at thirty four percent. OFFERING BETTING ACCESSORIES AND HOME GOODS REPORTED THREE POINT NINE MILLION SALES TO THE THIRD QUARTER COMPARED WITH FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION A YEAR AGO OPERATING LOSS FOR THE QUARTER WAS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND WHICH REFLECTS CONTINUOUS SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT FROM THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER WE'LL COMM Investments and outstanding bonds worth ninety two thousand five hundred thousand for a net cash position of thirty three point nine million. For the first nine months of this fiscal year, we incurred four point one million in capital expenditures. We returned four point five million to shareholders in regular quarterly dividends and share repurchases through the third quarter of this fiscal year. We had negative cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of five hundred nineteen thousand and four point seven million respectively for the first nine months of this fiscal year. THIS FISCAL YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE OF CHINESE NEW YEAR SETDOWNS AND HIGHER THAN EXPECTED INVENTORIES MOSTLY IN OUR MATTRESS FABRICS BUSINESS THIS COMPARED WITH POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND POSITIVE FREE CASH FLOWS OF EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION AND FIVE POINT NINE MILLION RESPECTIVELY FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WITH BETTER WORKING CAPITAL PERFORMANCE INCLUDING BETTER MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORIES WE EXPECT This fiscal year the company repurchased fifty six thousand shares of our common stock during the third quarter of this year and repurchased approximately eighty six thousand additional shares through march fourth leaving three point three million available under the previous share repurchase program as reported in our press release our board has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization back to five million shares shares may be repurchased at the company's discretion from time to time in the open market or through private transactions We will continue to consider opportunities to repurchase shares at a price that reflects a discount to our calculated intrinsic value per share. However, as highlighted in our capital allocation strategy which is posted in the investor relations section of our website, we remain focused on a very disciplined approach to capital allocation including maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid cash position particularly given the current uncertainty in the global business environment. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Iv. Thanks, Ken. Let me start with the mattress fabric segment. Our mattress fabric sales were lower than anticipated for the third quarter of the year as we were pressured by more than expected or we pressured more than expected from holiday shutdowns and continued industry weakness for our legacy business customers. Mattress covers have become an increasingly important part of our business and losing multiple productive weeks for our class cover operations in Haiti and also in South Africa. CHINA CAUSED A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT WHEN COMBINED WITH SOFTNESS IN OUR LEGACY BUSINESS ALSO, THE ANTI DUMPING MEASURES RELATING TO LOW PRICE MATTRESS IMPORTS FROM CHINA HAVE NOT YET PROVIDED THE RELIEF EXPECTED FOR THE DOMESTIC MATTRESS INDUSTRY IN SPITE OF THESE CHALLENGES WE CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS WITH A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON CREATIVE DESIGNS INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE OUR GLOBAL PLATFORM SUPPORTS THESE EFFORTS A COMPLEMENT OF MATTRESS FABRICS AND SLEEPING COVERS WITH A FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO EVOLVING CUSTOMER NEEDS WE ARE STRENGTHENED BY OUR EXISTING MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN THE US CANADA HAITI CHINA AND OUR SOURCING PLATFORM IN TURKEY WE EXPECT TO ADD FABRIC PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES IN VIETNAM THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND ARE ALSO EXPANDING OUR SLEEPING COVER PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES IN HAITI WITH NEW BUILDINGS AND ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT WE BE ANNOUNCE OUR ABILITIES TO SERVE CUSTOMERS FURTHER, WHILE THE DOMESTIC DISRUPTION FROM LOW PRICE MATTRESS IMPORTS APPEARS TO BE CONTINUING AS A RESULT OF MANY IMPORTS MOVING FROM CHINA NOW TO OTHER COUNTRIES WE BELIEVE OUR STRONG GLOBAL PLATFORM FOR FABRIC AND COVERS IN ASIA HAS US WELL POSITIONED TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE WITH IMPORTED MATTRESSES GOING FORWARD ADDITIONALLY, WHILE THE HOLIDAY SHUTDOWNS DISRUPTED OUR CLASS OPERATION Of our sown mattress cover business the demand for mattress covers remains favorable especially for the growing boxed bedding space and we continue to develop fresh products with both new and existing customers with sown cover production capabilities now in the us haiti and asia we have a very strong platform that allows us to maximize our full supply chain potential from fabric to finished covers we continue to invest in design and marketing capabilities with our latest technologies To improve the customer experience and speed to market with new digital tools and project management software, we are very pleased with our initial customer response to our new 3D mapping and rendering capabilities, which is being marketed as re dot imagine copthorne fashions. This reflects the spirit of innovation in our mattress fabrics business. We are also enhancing our service platform as part of our ongoing efforts to be more responsive to customer demand with shorter lead times. AND WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A NEW INVENTORY MANAGEMENT PROCESS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL DRIVE GREATER CONTROL I'M ESPECIALLY PLEASED THAT SANDIE BROWN OUR LONGTIME C E O IN THE MATTRESS FABRIC SEGMENT IS NOW PRESIDENT OF THE DIVISION HAVING WORKED WITH SANDIE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS I'M CONFIDENT SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE EXPOTISE AND VISION TO LEAD THIS BUSINESS AS WE STRIVE TO OPERATE OUR STRONG PLATFORM IN THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER LO AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF MATTRESS FABRICS AND SOUND COVERS WE BELIEVE WE WILL BENEFIT FROM OUR RECENT AND ONGOING EFFORTS TO FURTHER ADVANCE DESIGN AND SERVICE CAPABILITIES WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT SUPPORT OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS WITH BOTH LEGACY AND NEW CUSTOMERS NOW I'LL TURN TO THE ULPSTER FABRIC SEGMENT OUR ULPSTER FABRIC BUSINESS WAS AFFECTED BY A SLOWDOWN IN SHIPMENTS HEADING INTO THE CHINESE NEW YEAR HOLIDAY RESULTING The impact of the holiday shutdown from year to year and this year we experienced a greater than expected decline in January leading up to the holiday period. As a result, we showed a modest drop in sales compared with a very strong performance in the prior year. In light of the uncertain business environment we faced, we are pleased with the overall performance of our poultry fabric business particularly given a comparison to a very strong quarter last year in fiscal twenty nineteen. We have a strong platform in China and a stable LONG TERM OR SUPPLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH VENDORS THAT PRIORITIZE OUR PRODUCTION DUE TO THOSE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS THIS HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE FOR KOHL'S ESPECIALLY AS WE RESUMED OPERATIONS AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER FOLLOWING AN EXTENDED GOVERNMENT MANDATED SHUT DOWN IN CHINA ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK WE BELIEVE THIS PLATFORM SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE CURRENT DISRUPTIONS CREATED BY THIS OUTBREAK ALSO OUR ADDITION OF CUTTING AND SEWING CAPABILITIES IN VIETNAM TOWARDS THE END OF FISCAL TWENTY NINETEEN HAS FURTHER AUGMENTED OUR ASIAN PLATFORM DURING FISCAL TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE CONTINUED TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS OF INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND DIVERSIFY OUR CUSTOMER BASE WE ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR HOSPITALITY BUSINESS AS WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR REACH IN THIS GROWING MAR SALES IN THIS BUSINESS AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AS WE EXPAND OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO TO THE HOSPITALITY MARKET PRODUCT INNOVATION IS ALSO A HALMARK OF OUR SUCCESS IN THE MARKETPLACE AND PROVIDES A DISTINCT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR COLD WE ARE A LINE OF HIGHLY DURABLE STAIN RESISTANT LIFE SMART FABRICS THAT CONTINUES TO BE VERY POPULAR WITH BOTH EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE DEMA FABRICS FEATURING THE USE OF RECYCLED YARNS ALONG WITH THE SAME STAIN RESISTANT PERFORMANCE LOOKING AHEAD WHILE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REMAINS UNCERTAIN WITH THE HEALTH ISSUES SURROUNDING CORONAVIRUS IN CHINA AND BEYOND WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY WITH FAVORABLE RESULTS WE HAVE A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS CREATIVE DESIGNS A GROWING CUSTOMER BASE ACROSS BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND HOSP CUSTOMER DEMANDS AS SUCH WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER ANOTHER SOLID PERFORMANCE IN OUR POLYESTER FABRICS BUSINESS IN FISCAL TWENTY TWO THIRD LASTLY I COMMENT ON THE RESULTS FOR KOLP HOME ACCESSORIES WHICH INCLUDES OUR ECOMMERCE AND FINISHED PRODUCTS BUSINESS OFFERING BETTER ACCESSORIES AND HOME GOODS WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO REFINE OUR STRATEGY AND DRIVE IMPROVED RESULTS FOR OUR HOME ACCESSORIES SE RECENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH NEW ONLINE MARKETPLACES AND BUSINESS TO BUSINESS SALES CHANNELS WE ALSO REMAIN DEDICATED TO IMPROVING OUR PERFORMANCE ON AMAZON WHICH IS A PRINCIPAL SALES CHANNEL FOR OUR LEGACY ECOMMERCE BUSINESS IN TANDEM WITH THESE STRATEGIES WE ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS FEATURING COLT MATTRESS FABRICS AND APPLIQUE FABRICS AND WE ARE PLEASED WITH A VERY SOLID SHOWING OF THESE NEW PRODUCTS AT THE RECENT Accessories and the ability to leverage this new, important sales channel to reach new customers. Ken will now review the outlook for the fourth quarter and we will then take some questions. Importantly, our expectations for the fourth quarter assume the corona virus outbreak does not have a greater than anticipated impact on the company's operations which may affect each of the company's divisions to varying levels. We are monitoring the situation daily and following the processes and procedures provided for. FOR THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL PANDEMIC DISEASE CONTINGENCY PLAN TO PROTECT OUR WORKFORCE HOWEVER THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE REASONABLY AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE FLUIDITY AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE DISEASE AND THE ACTIONS BEING TAKEN TO CONTAIN ITS SPREAD SUBJECT TO THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS WE EXPECT OVERALL SALES TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF LAST YEAR WE EXPECT MATTRESS FAB Last year due to continuing market pressure and softness in our legacy business during the fourth quarter while operating income margins are expected to increase slightly compared to the prior year period in our poultry fabric segment we expect fourth quarter sales and operating income margins to be slightly higher than the prior year period in our home accessories segment we expect fourth quarter sales to be comparable to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year we expect an operating loss for the fourth quarter but with significant improvements. IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND CONTINUED QUARTER OVER QUARTER IMPROVEMENT FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR. CONSIDERING THESE FACTORS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO REPORT PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER IN THE RANGE OF ONE POINT NINE MILLION TO TWO POINT FOUR MILLION EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES OF CREDITS OTHER NON-RECURRING CHARGES AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IF ANY. PRE-TAX INCOME FOR LAST YEAR'S FOURTH In dollars, excluding this charge, pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of last year was two million dollars. Based on our current projection, capital expenditures for this fiscal year are now expected to be in the six million to six point five million dollar range. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately eight point six million. Additionally, free cash flow for this fiscal year is expected to be moderately down as compared to last year's results. With that, we will now take your questions. Thank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, press star one to ask a question. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. Good morning, buddy. Thank you for taking my questions. Good morning, buddy. So, I guess the first thing we want to talk about is the potential of adding some fabric production capabilities in Vietnam. And, maybe we can expand on on what those capabilities would be. And what's the strategy to participate more in what I, I guess, we can call the Asia import market for mattresses back into the US. Right. Thank you, Bobby. It's Zherav. I'll take that question. UMER YOU HAVE TO GO BACK A LITTLE BIT. WE THINK ABOUT BOTH ANTI DUMPING AND TARIFFS YOU KNOW IT FEELS LIKE YOU NOW WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THAT ANY MORE BUT THERE WAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OVER THE LAST YEAR OF SECTION THREE O NINE ONE TARIFFS. THE RULES FOR APOLLSTERY AND MATTRESS FABRICS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. SO THE REASON WE'RE LOOKING PRIMARILY TO ESTABLISH FABRIC MANUFACTUR THREE OVER ONE TARIFF COMING FROM CHINA AS DO MATTRESS COVERS UNLIKE FURNITURE OR IMPULSE FABRIC WHERE WE CAN SHIP FABRIC FROM CHINA TO VIETNAM TO AVOID A TARIFF IF YOU MAKE THE FULL SOWN COVER FABRIC ALL THE WAY TO COVER IN VIETNAM YOU STILL YOU WOULD STILL PAY THE EXTRA TARIFF SO FOR US ESTABLISHING IN VIETNAM IS A RISK MANAGEMENT PLAY A COST SAVING PLAY AND CERTAINLY GIVES US THE ABILITY TO MAKE COVERS THAT WE CAN Fill through vietnam that we can then sell into other countries that are making beds that end up in the us or bring fabric covers of our own back to us in the us will that answer well yeah that's very helpful i'm just curious from our competitive standpoint once you get this operation set up will those corresponding covers that you can now make in vietnam be competitively priced to some of the covers that are already going on the imports imports of beds into the us today Yes, sir, Bob, we expect you. We've been very competitive with covers already. The mattress covers that we're making through our colchina platform have been very competitive. And there are already opportunities materializing there. But to be more advantageous and to deal with U.S. tariff rules and costs, Vietnam could be potentially more advantageous in certain cases. Okay. For me, on the home accessories business, we talked about maybe improving some of the performance on the Amazon channel. So, can we maybe expand a little bit on those strategies? And then, secondly, is there, you know, a bigger opportunity to sell some of those Finnish products in retail locations? Yes, sir, Bobbi, those are really good questions, too. First, let's touch on the Amazon part. When we first invested in home accessories, Amazon was the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, Whole or really these primarily primary parts of the business up to eighty percent of the sales and we were really focused on that since the time we've invested it has become more costly to do business and to rank higher to google ad words to just find yourself higher in the rankings it ends up costing us more money than we might have expected so we've dialled back our offerings on amazon to really what we consider our core most stable most cost-effective products and we're trying to do what we consider our core most stable most cost-effective products and we're trying to do what we consider our core most stable most cost-effective products and we're trying to do what we consider our core most stable most cost-effective products and we're trying to do what we consider our core most stable most cost-effective products and we're BUT TO BE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ADVERTISING SO WHAT WE HAVE PLACED ON AMAZON TODAY WE BELIEVE WE CAN SERVICE WELL IT'S A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT THAT SHOULD RANK WELL AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO OVER ADVERTISE IT AND AND SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY TO MAKE IT WORK SO WE'RE ANTICIPATING AMAZON BEING A SIGNIFICANT BUT MORE LIKE A FIFTY PERCENT SHARE OF OUR BUSINESS AND NOT JUST SUCH A HEAVY PIECE FOR CERTAIN WE HAVE G ROLL PACK BETTING CUSTOMERS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR PRODUCTS TO ATTACK ON AND HAVE ADDITIONAL SALES ACCESSORIES WE ALSO HAVE A CHANCE TO SELL SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS INTO SOME RETAIL DIRECT DISTRIBUTION AND THAT IS WORKING SOMETIMES IT'S NEVER AS FAST AS WE WANT IT TO BE BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO GET IN THE RETAIL CYCLE BUT WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THAT OPPORTUNITY ALSO Once again, that is Star One to ask a question. If you find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing Star Two. Again, Star One to ask a question. We'll take our next question from Paul Bets with Steffel. Good morning, everyone. Continuing with Amazon, you mentioned some new sellers or violating terms. Can you explain what's going on there? MAYBE IF THAT GETS RECTIFIED YOU MAY LOSE SOME OR SEE LESS COMPETITION YES SIR WELL UM PAUL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION STEPHEN I'LL TAKE THAT TOO BASICALLY WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE WE FIRST STARTED WITH AMAZON AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF STORIES IN THE PRESS ABOUT THIS THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE PRIMERILY CHINESE SELLERS HAVE FLOODED THE MARKET PLACE ON COMMODITY ITEMS MATTRESS PROTECTORS AND MATTRESS PADS THINGS THAT WE SPECIALIZE IN AND AMAZON HAS PRETTY SPECIFIC TERMS OF SERVICE THE WAY YOU THE WAY YOU ACQUIRE FIVE STAR REVIEWS WE HAVE A LOT OF REVIEWS THAT WE HAVE EARNED THROUGH STUDY NORMAL PROCESSES SELLING ITEMS GETTING REVIEWS IT'S NOT REALLY IN TERMS OF SERVICE TO BE DOING A LOT OF FREE GIVEAWAYS AND FABRICATING REVIEWS WHICH WE HAVE FOUND ISTANCES OF ALL THOSE THINGS AND WE HAVE REPORTED ON THEM To really high levels in Amazon and made some headway so Amazon is working really hard to change their method the way they rank suppliers and I think in time that will get better but it's a pretty it's a pretty long fight for someone like us to to make a big impact really quick but that's what we mean by terms of server violations it's really fabricated and falsified reviews primarily okay thanks the cap ex was reduced Is that just to conserve cash or what areas did you might lower that sum? Paul, this is Ken. Yeah, we looked at the year and given our cash position, we started prioritizing projects. And so, you know, we have a certain amount of what we call maintenance capex, which is in that six million or so range. So when you look at where we're ending up, projected end up and then looking forward, I mean, we are going to go with that. TO IN THIS TIME OF UNCERTAINTY WE ARE GOING TO PRIORITIZE PROJECTS AND AS WE SAID KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON OUR CASH BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE BUSINESS AS WE ALWAYS HAVE AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO YOU KNOW JUST MONITOR THINGS CLOSELY AND PRIORITIZE PROJECTS AS THEY COME ALONG Below our expectations down year in year out, is that just some disruptions from the holiday shutdown or is there anything else going on there? No, that's a good, that's a good insight there. The obviously the lower sales had an impact but there were a lot of moving parts with the shutdowns and all that in the quarter and so that was the primary reason for the martins being down. You know, the lower sales and the other disruption as well. Okay. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WE'LL TAKE OUR NEXT QUESTION FROM MARCO RODRIGUEZ WITH STONE GATE CAPITAL MARKETS PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING GUYS THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS WE'RE WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE EXPANSION ACTIVITIES THAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IN VIETNAM AND HAITI IF YOU JUST MAYBE PLACE A TIMELINE AS FAR AS WHEN THESE CAPABILITIES These will be there, and then, and then the costs associated with those. Yes, sir. Thanks for the question, Marco. And expansions in Vietnam and and Haiti are both really targeted for the mattress fabrics business in terms of the expansion standpoint. We're already operating pretty significantly in Vietnam for our full-size cutting and sewing kits, and it's performing well. Haiti, you know, it's sort of a two-pronged strategy. It's really a three-pronged strategy. It's really a three-pronged strategy. We're already operating pretty significantly in Vietnam for our full-size cutting and sewing kits, and it's performing well. Haiti, you know, it's sort of a two-pronged strategy. It's really a three The speaker is discussing a business opportunity in Haiti. They mention that Haiti is a low-cost opportunity and that their company has been successful in driving faster lead times in Haiti than in other countries. They also mention that their company specializes in prototyping and emergency recovery platforms. The speaker is enthusiastic about the potential of the business opportunity in Haiti. It's not a significant expense. You know, we're just building some extra space and adding some more sewing machines. Getting into cutting and sewing is not a heavy capital X venture. So, we would anticipate being in that plant and having additional capacity this summer. It's a pretty fast pretty fast uprising there. And we're excited about Haiti. The good part about it is we can bring fabrics from anywhere in the world today and if it's sown in Haiti and comes back to the US, there's no duty on any of the products. We're out so very advantageous platform that should provide us with faster lecoms if we forecast and store inventory at the right places vietnam is really an important ability for us to dabble with mattress fabrics in a small way we'll start start small mainly focused on serving asian customers and that's our attempt to get after some of the beds that are being made in asia and we can do that with both fabric or with a sun mattress COVER: IF WE NEED TO, WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING SOME OF THAT BACK TO THE US NOT PREFERRED ON A LEAD TIME BASIS BUT IT COULD BE GOOD FOR COSTS AND WE'LL JUST DO THAT ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS AND WE WOULD AVOID A SECTION THREE O ONE PERFORMANCE PERFORMANCE GOT IT UNDERSTOOD AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE SERVICE PLATFORM ADDITIONS OR ENHANCEMENTS THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT IN THE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT CAN WE MAYBE EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ON WHAT SORT OF IMPACT IF ANY YOU MIGHT SEE ON THE P N L AND OR THE BALANCE SHEET WITH THOSE WELL WHAT AND ALEX ALLEK CAN COMMENT ON THE IMPACT BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE WAY THE REASON WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT IS THE MATTRESS INDUSTRY ALWAYS FOR A LONG TIME WAS A PRETTY QUICK SPEED TO MARKET BUSINESS WHERE WE PRETTY MUCH INVENTORIED SHIPPED EVERYTHING SAME DAY AND WE STILL DO THAT FOR A BIG PART OF THE MARKET First, with imported mattresses and imported components, lead times have gotten a little longer. So, we've tried to then match our platform with all the multicountries that we're in, US, Canada, China, Haiti, Vietnam, and then our sourcing business in Turkey. We want to bring lead times back down, even with that global strategy. So, our anticipation would not be to get out of the longer lead times that we've had recently, shorten those lead times down so we're not caught with so much exposure. WATER, IF MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE SO WE'LL JUST OUR INTENTION IS TO BRING A BETTER EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF OUR SCHEDULING FASTER LEAD TIME TO CUSTOMERS WHICH WILL MAKE THEM HAPPY AND THEN REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE FOR EXTRA INVENTORY YEAH MARCO THIS CAN'T AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THE EXTRA INVENTORY WE WE WERE EXPECTING OBVIOUSLY A BETTER QUARTER THAN WE HAD SO WE BUILT UP INVENTORY THAT THOSE SALES DIDN'T MATERIALIZE BUT To be able to get inventory down and keep it in line more consistently which will obviously help improve the cash flow in the fourth quarter. But we're excited about the new process and you know hopefully don't get back in a situation where we build up inventory in excess and in anticipation of sales that don't materialize. So this is an exciting move and one that's that we're excited to get started. And lastly, a question that's kind of a difficult one here on guidance, you know, you've built in some sort of an impact for coronavirus, but just kind of curious if maybe you can put a little bit more color around what what does worsening conditions mean for you or look like? Are we talking additional shutdowns in china as far as the risk is concerned? And i know that you also brought up the fact that obviously consumer confidence in the u.s. is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is BIG UNKNOWN AT HIS FINGERTIPS RIGHT NOW YEAH MARCO I'LL I'LL ANSWER AND THEN IF BOYD WANTS TO JUMP IN YEAH IT'S IT'S FORECASTING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND IS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT YOU KNOW WHAT WE WE PUT A LOT OF LANGUAGE AROUND THE UNCERTAINTY YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW EVERYBODY READS WHAT HAPPENS DAILY THE NEWS COMES OUT AND SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE THINGS ARE OPERATING WELL IN CHINA THINGS HAVE RECOVERED SO WE'VE GOT THAT THAT NEWS THERE BUT YOU KNOW THINGS CHANGE DAILY SO GIVEN WHERE WE ARE WE EXPECT A GOOD QUARTER THE FOURTH QUARTER BUT AS I'VE SAID THINGS CAN CHANGE QUICKLY AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE NOW WE'VE GOT PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS THAT WE CAN REACT TO AND MAKE CHANGES AND BE FLEXIBLE IN OUR AND IN OUR FLEXIBLE PLATFORMS BUT IT'S JUST A VERY VERY UNCERTAIN TIME RIGHT NOW AND SO WE'RE JUST BEING VERY CAUTIOUS IN HOW WE FORECAST BACK TO NORMAL SITUATIONS THERE WE HAD A ONE WEEK DELAY IN OUR CHINA OPERATIONS A GOVERNMENT MANDATED ONE WEEK DELAY BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO GET BACK TO OPERATING AND THEN WE'VE SEEN SOME DELAYS FROM OUR SUPPLY BASE BUT CURRENTLY NEARLY ALL OF OUR SUPPLIERS ARE NOW BACK TO ALMOST FULL OUTPUT AGAIN. SO THE CURRENT SITUATION IS HAS BEEN VERY POSITIVE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED MINIMAL DELAYS AND DISRUPTIONS. Actions to supply to our customer base as a result and so while it may remain a dynamic situation for sure and in uncertainty the current picture is China has recovered quite nicely and our supply base is back to near full output and so at the moment there appears to be minimal delay this delay is coming from A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AGAIN, THEN A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY A"

OUTLINED ON OUR SECOND QUARTER CALL INCLUDING 80% GROWTH IN RFID FOR THE FULL YEAR 20% SEQUENTIAL GROWTH IN PHYSICAL SECURITY IN Q2 TO Q3 AND FEDERAL SALES UP 80% SEQUENTIALLY WITH OUR FINALIZED FINANCIAL RESULTS WE'RE CONFIRMING THAT WE BEAT EACH OF THOSE EXPECTATIONS THIS SHOWS BOTH STRONG INDUSTRY TRENDS DRIVING OUR BUSINESS AND OUR LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE INDUSTRY OVERALL REVENUES GREW 30% SEQUENTIALLY TO 24.9 MILLION SHOWING STRENGTHS ACROSS THE BUSINESS WE PROJECTED OUR PREMISES BUSINESS WHICH IS ABOUT TWO THIRDS FEDERAL TO GROW 20% SEQUENTIALLY WE ACTUALLY GREW 26% SEQUENTIALLY IN PREMISES OUR RFID BUSINESS GREW MORE THAN 50% SEQUENTIALLY AND OVER 100% YEAR OVER YEAR AS ON TRACK FOR 80% FULL YEAR GROWTH AND OUR FEDERAL REVENUES GREW NEARLY 90% SEQUENTIALLY SO THIS <INAUDIBLE> IS LINED UP FOR A STRONG FOURTH QUARTER AND THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAT'LL BE MORE THAN 30% HIGHER THAN OUR FIRST HALF WE'RE SEEING BUSINESS MOMEN- MOMENTUM CONTINUING BACKLOG BUILDING AND THE PIPELINE FOR 2021 BECOMING STRONGER BUT BEFORE WE TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE FUTURE LET'S REVIEW THE OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER NOW OUR KEY FOCUS AREAS OF OUR RFID AND OUR FEDERAL BUSINESS WERE PARTICULARLY STRONG WITHIN OUR IDENTITY BUSINESS WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY RFID REVENUE INCREASED SEQUENTIALLY BY 33% TO 15.4 MILLION AND YEAR OVER YEAR IDENTITY AND TOTAL GROUP 53% FROM 10.1 MILLION IN Q3 2019 TO 15.4 MILLION IN Q3 2020 THE GROWTH WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY RFID OF COURSE WHERE WE RAMPED UP PRODUCTION VOLUMES FOR A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IN PARTICULAR A MAJOR CUSTOMER WHOSE PRODUCTION STARTED IN Q2 CAME THROUGH THROUGH IN Q3 EVEN STRONGER THAN WE EXPECTED AS A RESULT OUR RFID BUSINESS MORE THAN DOUBLED THE VOLUME WE PRODUCED THE YEAR AGO EVEN WITH OUR RAMP UP THERE WAS NEARLY $1 MILLION SHIPMENTS WE DIDN'T FULFILL WE BALANCED CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND MADE SURE THAT MOST CRITICAL DELIVERIES WERE COVERED AS A BUSINESS IMPLICATION IS THAT THE INDUSTRY LAUNCHES WE EXPECTED ARE WELL UNDERWAY THE MASS MARKET ADOPTION OF RFID INTEGRATED PRODUCTS IS HAPPENING OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE INCORPORATED RFID DEVICES AND THE HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS MOBILITY CONSUMER PRODUCTS APPLIANCES LIBRARIES PHARMACEUTICALS AND APP ENABLING THE PHYSICAL WORLD THE POINT IS THAT EACH OF THESE ARE A HUNDRED MILLION OR BILLION PLUS UNIT APPLICATIONS IT'S A HUGE MARKET THAT'S JUST BEGINNING TO GROW THE OVERALL TREND CLEARLY SHOWS IN OUR THIRD QUARTER RESULTS AS WELL AS IN THE CONTINUING BACKLOG STRING WE WENT INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER WITH BACKLOG FOR FOURTH QUARTER SHIPMENTS OF 68% OVER LAST YEAR AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS GOING FORWARD OF ALL THESE TRENDS LATER ON THE CALL ALSO WITH AN IDENTITY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OUR IDENTITY READERS GREW STRONGLY UP 38% OVER LAST YEAR'S THIRD QUARTER AND WE ALL EXPECTED THE WORK FROM HOME TREND TO PLATEAU AFTER THE INITIAL LOCKDOWNS IN THE SPRING BUT THIS REALLY SHOWS THE DEMAND IS CONTINUING THE THIRD QUARTER IS ALWAYS STRONG FOR SMART GUARD READERS BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL YEAR END SO THE GROWTH COMES OVER A NORMALLY STRONG YEAR PRIOR PERIOD REASON IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ESPECIALLY THE DOD ARE ADOPTING POLICY SUPPORTING WORK FROM HOME AND WORK MOBILE FOR THE LONGTERM SO WE DO EXPECT THESE TRENDS TO SUSTAIN WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THEM AS WE GET AS WE LOOK AT 2021 SO TURNING TO OUR PREMISES BUSINESS IN Q3 THIS SHOWED THE STRENGTH OF OUR FULL PRODUCT RANGE AS WELL AS OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOCUS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE PREMISES GREW 26% SEQUENTIALLY THE FEDERAL BUSINESS WHERE OUR VELOCITY SECURITY PLATFORM WAS THE STRONGEST VERTICAL FROM 90% SEQUENTIALLY BUT WE ALSO SAW ACTIVITY IN BANKING RETAIL UTILITIES AND OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES WE QUOTED OUR FIRST LARGE 3VR PRIME MANAGED VIDEO SERVICES ORDER WHICH IS NOW CLOSED <INAUDIBLE> ADOPTING OUR PLATFORM ACROSS ALMOST 100 BRANCHES THE SIX-YEAR'S $650,000 AGREEMENT PROVIDES VIDEO SURVEILLANCE ANALYTICS AND CASE MANAGEMENT ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS SENDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN CAPITAL EXPENSE FOR OUR CUSTOMER AND ASSURING A PREDICTABLE REVENUE STREAM OF OVER $100,000 ANNUALLY FOR OUR BUSINESS THAT'D BE CLEAR WE'VE HAD CONTINUING STRONG BUSINESS PROGRESS BUT IN OUR INDUSTRY SOME SMALL DEALERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE UNDER PRESSURE AS ARE OUR COMPETITORS WHO FOCUS THERE <INAUDIBLE> FEDERAL STATE AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS ARE MORE THAN TWO THIRDS IN THE BUSINESS FOR OUR PHYSICAL ACCESS PLATFORMS WE'RE SEEING STRONG PERFORMANCE IN PREMISES AND OUR QUICK PIVOT TO RECURRING REVENUES WITH LOWER COST OF ENTRY HAS PUT US IN A STRONG POSITION OVERALL THESE INCLUDE OUR VELOCITY CIRRUS PRODUCT MOBILIST ID 3VR PRIME OUR FREEDOM CLOUD OR FREEDOM MOBILE WHICH WE JUST LAUNCHED THIS WEEK ALL OF THESE ARE RECURRING REVENUE PRODUCTS ALL LAUNCHED IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS NOW AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE SECOND QUARTER THE BROAD ADOPTION OF RFID IN OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS CORE PRODUCTS IS WHAT REALLY GIVES US REASON TO BELIEVE THIS GROWTH IS A LONG-TERM TREND THAT WE'RE JUST STARTING TO SEE TAKEOFF IT'S BUILDING BACKLOG FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FOR 2021 SO OVERALL THE QUART- THE THIRD QUARTER WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY 30% SEQUENTIAL REVENUE GROWTH OVER 100% YEAR OVER YEAR RFID GROWTH A 90% SEQUENTIAL GROWTH IN FEDERAL SALES 38% YEAR OVER YEAR IDENTITY READER GROWTH AND Q4 BACKLOG OF 68% FOR LAST YEAR SO CERTAINLY YOUR CHALLENGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WE'RE ALL IN BUT THE STRONG SECULAR GROWTH WE'RE EXPERIENCING RFID ARE STRENGTHENED FEDERAL WORK FROM HOME GOING INTO A SECOND WAVE OF DEMAND AND THE PRODUCTS WE'VE LAUNCHED IN THE THIRD QUARTER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RETURN TO WORK NEEDS AND BUILD THE BASE FOR A STRONG FOURTH QUARTER IN 2021 SO LET ME TURN IT OVER TO SANDRA TO GO THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS AFTERWARDS I'LL GO INTO MORE METRICS AND THE INDUSTRY WIDE TRENDS THAT ARE REALLY ACCELERATING OUR BUSINESS INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER AND INTO 2021 SANDRA AS STEVE MENTIONED OUR RESULTS SHOW THE CONTINUED DELIVERY OF WHAT WE COMMITTED WITH A SOLID TRAJECTORY FOR 2021 PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE RESULTS ARE ALL WITHIN THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS ANNOUNCED OCTOBER 29TH PRIOR TO MARKET OPEN THE FIRST METRIC IS REVENUE GROWTH EVEN WITH THE CONTINUED IMPACT OF COVID-19 WE CLOSED OUT THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020 WITH 24.9 MILLION IN TOTAL REVENUE UP 30% COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND THAT'S 8% COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 OUR RECURRING REVENUE ACCOUNTED FOR 6% OF OUR THIRD QUARTER REVENUE AND 8% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2020 THIS PART OF OUR BUSINESS REMAINED STEADY AT 8% OF OUR TOTAL TRAILING 12 MONTH REVENUE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020 OUR GAAP AND NON- GAAP ADJUSTED GROSS PROFIT MARGINS WERE 40 AND 41% RESPECTIVELY FOR THE TRAILING 12-MONTH PERIOD OUR NON- GAAP ADJUSTED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS 42% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER 2020 OUR NON- GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN WAS POSITIVE 11% WITH A POSITIVE 4% FOR THE TRAILING 12-MONTH PERIOD OUR GAAP NET INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER 2020 WAS 0.4 MILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF 2.7 MILLION IN Q2 2020 AND THAT INCOME OF 1.1 MILLION IN Q3 2019 BUT THE DIVIDENDS ON THE SERIES TO BE PREFERRED OUR GAAP NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS THE 0.1 MILLION OR NET INCOME OF 1 CENT PER SHARE COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF 17 CENTS PER SHARE IN Q2 2020 AND POSITIVE 5 CENTS PER SHARE IN Q3 OF 2019 WE HAVE PROVIDED IN THE APPENDIX A FULL RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON- GAAP INFORMATION WHICH IS ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR EARNINGS RELEASE ON OUR NEXT SLIDE FURTH- FURTHER ANALYZING TRENDS BY SEGMENT OUR PREMISES SEGMENT WHICH INCLUDES SALES OF A PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL AND VIDEO PRODUCTS VIDEO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR 9.4 MILLION OR 38% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN Q3 REPRESENTING AN INCREASE IN DOLLARS OF 26% FROM Q2 2020 AND A DECREASE OF 27% FROM Q3 2019 REVENUE FROM OUR IDENTITY PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDES SALES OF ACCESS CREDENTIALS SMART CARD READERS RFID TRANSPONDERS AND MOBILE SECURITY PRODUCTS TOTAL 15.4 MILLION OR 62% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN Q3 2020 AN INCREASE THE DOLLARS OF 33% FROM Q2 2020 AND AN INCREASE AT 53% FROM Q3 2019 OUR NON- GAAP GROSS PROFIT WAS 41% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020 THIS COMPARES WITH 42% IN Q2 2020 AND 47% IN Q3 2019 DRIVEN BY BOTH THE MIX OF PRODUCT ACROSS SEGMENTS AND WITHIN SEGMENTS OUR PREMISES SEGMENT MARGINS WERE 55% RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO Q2 2020 AND Q3 2019 AT 55 AND 56% RESPECTIVELY OUR IDENTITY SEGMENT MARGINS WERE 30% RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO Q2 2020 AT 31% AND LOWER THAN Q3 2019 AT 33% DUE TO A HIGHER PROPORTION OF LOWER MARGIN TRANSPONDER SALES NOW MOVING TO OUR OPERATING EXPENSE MANAGEMENT OUR GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WERE 8.9 MILLION WHICH WAS DOWN FROM 10 MILLION IN Q2 2020 AND DOWN YEAR OVER YEAR FROM 9.3 MILLION IN Q3 2019 THE SEQUENTIAL DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NON-RECURRING 1.2 MILLION RESTRUCTURINGS <INAUDIBLE> IN Q2 2020 OUR NON- GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DECREASED TO 30% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED WITH 40% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND 34% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 OUR NON- GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES TOTALED 7.5 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020 THIS COMPARES TO 7.6 MILLION IN Q2 2020 AND 7.9 MILLION IN Q3 OF 2019 BRINGING ALL THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER OUR NON- GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS 2.8 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020 A SEQUENTIAL INCREASE OF 2.3 MILLION OVER Q2 2020 TURNING TO THE BALANCE SHEET WE'LL BE COMPARING OUR POSITION OF SEPTEMBER 2020 TO THE POSITION ONE QUARTER AGO OF JUNE 2020 AND THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 WE EXITED THE THIRD QUARTER WITH CASH AT 12.3 MILLION AND NET DECREASE OF 0.8 MILLION FROM Q2 2020 AND A 1.2 MILLION INCREASE FROM Q3 2019 NET CASH ACTIVITY FOR THE QUARTER WAS DRIVEN BY 2.2 MILLION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OUR NET INCOME EXCLUDING NON-CASH ITEMS 3.6 MILLION OF CASH USE FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAP EX DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LATE Q3 BILLINGS THAT WERE NOT COLLECTIBLE WITHIN THE QUARTER AND BY AN INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL TO SUPPORT OUR SINGAPORE GROWTH UNDER FINANCING AND FOREIGN CURRENCY WE HAD A 0.6 MILLION NET CASH PROVIDED DRIVEN BY A 0.9 MILLION INCREASE IN NET BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVER AND A 0.5 MILLION REDUCTION THROUGH SCHEDULED PAYMENTS ON THE TERM LOAN FACILITY WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE CAPITAL AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND RETURNED TO POSITIVE NON- GAAP FREE CASH FLOW EXITING Q4 2020 AS WELL AS RETIRING THE TERM AND NOTE THAT ON SCHEDULE IN Q1 2021 IN OUR 10Q FILINGS WE WILL BE PROVIDI- PROVIDING A FULL RECONCILIATION OF THE YEAR TO DATE CASH FLOWS FOR COMPLETENESS WE'VE INCLUDED THE FULL BALANCE SHEET FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASE IN THE APPENDIX EVEN WITH THE GLOBAL DISRUPTION CONTINUING TODAY WE ARE CONFIRMING OUR GUIDANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF THE COMPANY FOR FULL YEAR 2020 AT REVENUE BETWEEN 86 AND 88 MILLION WITHIN OUR ORIGINAL GUIDANCE ENTERING THIS YEAR WE ACHIEVED GAAP EPS PROFITABILITY IN Q3 2020 AHEAD OF EXPECTATIONS AND CONTINUES TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF OUR ACTIONS TO OPTIMIZE COSTS CARRY FORWARD IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE NON- GAAP FREE CASH FLOW POSITIVE AS COMMITTED DURING Q4 2020 AND BEYOND IN ADDITION TODAY WE'RE PROVIDING GUIDANCE FOR THE FULL YEAR 2021 BUILDING ON THE STRONG BASE OF GROWTH THAT WE HAVE DELIVERED OUR FULL YEAR 2021 GUIDANCE IS FOR REVENUE BETWEEN 96 AND 102 MILLION WHICH REFLECTS GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR FROM THE MIDPOINT OF OUR 2020 GUIDANCE EXCEEDING THE MARKET GROWTH BY A FACTOR OF TWO WE EXPECT OUR NORMAL SEASONALITY TO CONTINUE WITH OUR LOWEST QUARTER IN Q1 2021 AND BUILDING UP QUARTER OVER QUARTER THROUGH THE END OF 2021 WE WILL BE ISSUING A FULL SET OF GUIDANCE AT OUR Q4 AND FULL YEAR 2020 EARNINGS RELEASE TARGETED FOR MARCH 2021 WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE THE FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND PASS IT BACK TO STEVE THANKS SANDRA AS I SAID EARLIER OUR RFID GROWTH IS PREDICTABLE FOR TWO REASONS IT'S HEAVILY BACKLOG DRIVEN AND IT'S DRIVEN BY MAJOR COMPANIES WHO HAVE INCORPORATED OUR RFID DEVICES INTO THEIR PRODUCTS SO ANY FOR GLOBAL PRODUCTS IS A YEAR LONG PROCESS SO EVEN NOW WE'RE GETTING VISIBILITY INTO PLANS THROUGHOUT 2021 FIRST BACKLOG GOING INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER OUR TOTAL BACKLOGS STOOD AT 10.5 MILLION UP 68% FOR LAST YEAR AND OUR RFID BACKLOG FOR SHIPMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER IS UP 125% OVER THE LAST YEAR WE'VE NOW GOTTEN IN ORDERS FOR ABOUT MANY 5% OF OUR EXPECTED SHIPMENTS FOR THE QUARTER IN OUR RFID AND THAT MEANS MOST ADDITIONAL ORDERS EITHER CONTRIBUTE TO UPSIDE WITHIN THE QUARTER OR DRIVE MORE BACKLOG FOR 2021 THIS IS A KEY DRIVER OF OUR GROWTH FOR 2021 AND WE EXPECT THE RFID PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS TO GROW WELL OVER 50% IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2021 VERSUS THE FIRST HALF OF 2020 FOR THE FULL YEAR GROWTH IN THE MID 20% RANGE FOR 2021 AND NOW THE CORE DRIVER OF OUR RFID BUSINESS IS THE MASS MARKET ADOPTION OF RFID INTEGRATED PRODUCTS OUR CUSTOMERS ARE LEADERS IN THEIR OWN INDUSTRIES INCORPORATING RFID DEVICES INTO THEIR PRODUCTS EACH WITH VOLUMES OF 10S OR 100S OF MILLIONS OF UNITS SO THIS IS A HUGE MARKET THAT'S JUST BEGINNING TO GROW IN THE THIRD QUARTER TWO STRONG USE CASES WERE LAUNCHED IN THE MARKET ONE BY CVS AND THE OTHER OF COURSE BY APPLE NOW WE DON'T GENERALLY DISCLOSE CUSTOMERS SO THESE ARE JUST INDUSTRY EXAMPLES TO BE CLEAR BUT BOTH ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF THE RFID MARKET ACCELERATING THEY'RE BOTH BASIC USES THAT ESTABLISHED PLATFORMS TO THEN DRIVE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS FROM ALREADY BIG FIRST LAUNCHES SO FIRST SOME OF YOU SAW IN THE DEMO SESSION WE HAD A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK CVS HAS SPOKEN RX FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE YOU TAP YOUR PHONE TO THE RFID TAG ON THE PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE AND IT READS UP MEDICATION WITH DOSAGE AND ALL THE OTHER INFORMATION FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T READ THE LABEL NOW THAT 13% OF PRESCRIPTIONS GO TO PEOPLE WITH SOME VISUAL IMPAIRMENT AND THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF BILLION PRESCRIPTIONS ANNUALLY SO IN THE US ALONE THAT'S OVER HALF A BILLION RFID TAG EVERY YEAR JUST FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED SECTOR NOW THAT'S THE CURRENT USE CASE AND THE FIRST USE CASE SO SO NOW EXTRAPOLATE WITH THE PLATFORM DEPLOYED EVERY CVS PHARMACY NOW IS SET UP TO PROGRAM AND PUT RFID TAGS ON EVERY PRESCRIPTION AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THEY SHOULD BE ON EVERYONE SO WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE YOU TAP EACH TIME YOU TAKE IT YOU'LL KNOW IF YOU'VE TAKEN IT MORNING OR EVENING OR WHATEVER THE PRESCRIPTION REGIMEN IS UM IT'LL AUTO REFILL AS YOU GET LOW THERE'S ALL KINDS OF CAPABILITIES YOU CAN DO THERE YOU CAN EVEN OPT IN AND YOUR DOCTOR COULD GET INFORMATION ABOUT HOW CONSISTENTLY YOU'RE TAKING YOUR MEDS BECAUSE ANYONE WHO STUDIES THIS AREA KNOWS THAT THAT THE THE BIGGEST ISSUE WITH THE UH PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS IS PEOPLE COMPLYING WITH TAKING THEIR MEDS SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT COMPANIES LIKE CVS ARE THINKING ABOUT NOW THAT THEY'VE MADE THAT INITIAL INVESTMENT THEY CAN REALLY EXPAND IN THE INTO OTHER CATEGORIES SO ULTIMATELY WE THINK THE OPPORTUNITY IS FOR ALL FOUR AND A HALF BILLION OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS THE IN THE US ANNUALLY AND THE US IS ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE WORLD PRESCRIPTIONS SO AGAIN YOU CAN SEE TO THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED APPLICATION THAT'S A COUPLE OF BILLION UNITS WORLDWIDE AND NEARLY 20 BILLION UNITS FOR ALL PRESCRIPTIONS WORLDWIDE NOW OF COURSE IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME BUT YOU CAN SEE THE VOLUME OF POTENTIAL AND AGAIN THE INVESTMENT'S REALLY NOW DONE AND OF COURSE THE READER IN THE APP TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY IN EVERYBODY'S POCKETS IN THEIR PHONES NOW RELATED TO THE MOBILE SPACE AND THE PHONES THE BIGGEST EVENTS OF COURSE WITH APPLE'S LAUNCHED A FULL NFC SUPPORT IN IOS 14 AND THE IPHONE 12 AND ESPECIALLY THE NEW ECOSYSTEM OF PRODUCTS AROUND <INAUDIBLE> SO APPLE'S MADE IT VERY EASY AND SECURE TO CONNECT <UNK> TO THE IPHONE AND THEN THROUGH NFC TO CONNECT THEM INTO CORE IPHONE FEATURES SO JUST AS A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES UM THE FIRST APPLE BRANDED CASES FOR EXAMPLE YOU BUY AN ORANGE CASE YOU POP IT ON YOUR PHONE THE THE THE SCREEN TURNS ORANGE IT GOES THROUGH AN ANIMATION YOU KNOW YOU'VE CONNECTED IT AND YOU KNOW IT'S AN APPLE VERIFIED PHONE IT IT SEEMS PRETTY TRIVIAL BUT WHAT IT'S SHOWING IS THAT PERIPHERALS ARE ACTUALLY COMMUNICATING SECURELY WITH THE PHONE LAUNCHING PROCESSES IN THE PHONE AND ALL SECURED AND CONTROLLED BY APPLE THROUGH A SECURE NFC LANE SO THIS ENABLES A WHOLE WORLD OF NEW PERIPHERALS TO CONNECT TO THE PHONE AND SEAMLESSLY BUT SECURELY LAUNCH APPS AND EXPERIENCES SO THIS IS REALLY THE VISION FOR THIS TYPE OF CONNECTED DEVICE THAT THAT THAT APPLE'S DEPLOYING AND WITH OVER 200 MILLION IPHONES SHIPPED A YEAR CONNECTING MULTIPLE MAGSAFE ENABLED DEVICES EACH AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THE MARKET IN THE BILLION UNITS PLUS RANGE ANNUALLY AND ADDITIONALLY OF COURSE WHERE APPLE AND CVS GO SAMSUNG WALGREENS AMAZON PHARMACY AND OTHERS HAVE TO MATCH SO YOU CAN SEE THE SCALE OF THE MARKETS WE'RE GOING AFTER AND THE VOLUMES THAT ALREADY ARE HAPPENING SO RFID IS GAINING TRACTION RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN THE TRUSTED CO-DEVELOPER AND SUPPLIER FOR SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED APPLICATIONS AND THE MOST DEMANDING COMPANIES THIS IS WHERE THE GROWTH IS AND IT'S WHERE OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IS STRONGEST SO HOW ARE WE GONNA KEEP OUR ADVANTAGE WE'RE EXPANDING OUR TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES AND FOR 2021 WE'RE LAUNCHING SERVICES TO HELP COMPANIES PUT RFID INTO THEIR PRODUCTS NOW WE'RE UNIQUE IN OUR ABILITY TO GO FROM CONCEPT TO OPTIMIZE DESIGN TO EARLY PRODUCTIONS TO SCALING PRODUCTION AND THEN TO IMMEDIATELY START BACK INTO THE NEXT GENERATION OF DEVICES AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE CYCLE THESE CUSTOMERS NEED WE'RE ALSO INNOVATING WITH NEW PRODUCTS ANSWERING NEEDS WE KNOW FROM OUR OWN CUSTOMERS AN EXAMPLE IS A NEW PRODUCT WE'VE LAUNCHED WHEN WE THINK OF THE INDUSTRY'S LOWEST CARBON FOOTPRINT RFID TAG OR ECO TAG INSTEAD OF BEING AN <UNK> ANTENNA ON A PLASTIC SUBSTRATE WE'VE DEVELOPED A UNIQUE LASER CUTTING PROCESS AND IS ON RECYCLABLE PAPER SUBSTRATE WE EVEN USE RECYCLED ALUMINUM FOR THE ANTENNA SO THERE'S NO ACTING CHEMICALS NO LOSS METAL NO PLASTIC LAYERS NO CHEMICAL RUNOFF NOW WHY DO WE DO ALL THIS WELL THE BIGGEST USERS OF HIGH-END RFID ARE CONSUMER FACING COMPANIES AND SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS TO THEM COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON AND APPLE THAT THEY PUBLIC COMMITMENT TO BEING CARBON NEUTRAL AND RFID TAGS ARE CONSUMER VISIBLE DEVICES SO OUR ECO TAG SHOWS THEIR ECO COMMITMENT AND ELIMINATES WHAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE A NEGATIVE ON THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT NOW OUR CUSTOMERS TOLD US THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT IT'S VERY TRICKY TECHNOLOGY BUT WE DEVELOPED IT AND FUNDAMENTALLY THIS IS EXACTLY WHY WE'RE GONNA KEEP OUR LEAD IN THE FAST GROWING RFID MARKET SO THAT'S RFID NOW LET'S LOOK AT PREMISES WHICH HAS SOME SIMILARLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES AND REMEMBER THE CORE TECHNOLOGY IN OUR RFID TAG IS SHARED WITH OUR ACCESS CARDS DOOR READERS IDENTITY READERS AND OTHER PARTS OF OUR PHYSICAL AND DATA SECURITY SOLUTIONS SO ONE GROWTH DRIVER REALLY SUPPORTS THE OTHER SO WITH THE PREMISES INDUSTRY OVERALL GROWING ABOUT 6% WE GREW 26% SEQUENTIALLY AND WE'RE EXPECTING PREMISES TO GROW ABOUT 25% YEAR OVER YEAR THIS QUARTER FOR 2021 WE EXPECT GROWTH IN THE MID TEENS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE INDUSTRY RATE NOW THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS ARE RECURRING REVENUE GROWTH THE SHIFT TO IT DRIVEN BUYERS AND FEDERAL GRIP SO WHY WOULD WE BE GROWING FASTER THAN THE MARKET WITH THESE DYNAMICS JUST LIKE IN OUR RFID WE'RE BOTH THE TRUSTED PROVIDER AND WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND BROADEST PRODUCT RANGE AS CUSTOMERS MOVE TO SOFTWARE DEFINED PLATFORMS THEY NEED TO MIGRATE THEIR ENTIRE PLATFORM ACROSS READER'S CREDENTIALS CONTROLLERS ACCESS VIDEO AND AUDIO AND IT'S ALL GOTTA BE INTEGRATED WITH THEIR ACTIVE DIRECTORY OR OTHER SENSITIVE DATA REPOSITORIES NOW WE'RE THE ONLY COMPANY THAT DELIVERS ALL OF THIS AND WE THINK TOTAL SOLUTIONS AND IT-CENTRIC RECURRING REVENUE PLATFORMS WILL BE THE FASTEST GROUP SECTOR IN PHYSICAL SECURITY AND THE STRATEGIC POSITION OF COMBINED ACCESS VIDEO AND AUDIO MANAGEMENT IS THE KEY FOR ANYONE TRYING TO WIN OUR GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS OUR FREEDOM CLOUD PLATFORM THAT WE JUST LAUNCHED THIS WEEK IT'S THE LIGHTEST WEIGHT IMPLEMENTATION IN IN THE INDUSTRY TOTALLY WEB AND MOBILE BASED AND ESPECIALLY ON THE HARDWARE SIDE OUR FREEDOM BRIDGES ARE EXTREMELY COMPACT AND COST EFFECTIVE IOT DEVICES A BRIDGE THAT CAN CONTRO- CAN CONTROL TWO DOORS IS THE SIZE OF A PACK OF PLAYING CARDS AND THIS IS WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE LOOKING FOR HARDLY NOTICEABLE REALLY INTUITIVE TO DEPLOY AND MANAGE AND A PLATFORM THAT THE IT DEPARTMENT IS TOTALLY COMFORTABLE OWNING AND MANAGING THE SOFTWARE IS BROWSER-BASED AND THE HARDWARE IS MANAGED JUST LIKE A NETWORK SWITCH SO WE'VE DESCRIBED THE GROWTH IN EACH SEGMENT SO PUT IT TOGETHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WE'RE EXPECTING OVERALL REVENUES TO GROW IN THE 25 TO 30% YEAR OVER YEAR RANGE SO LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS DRIVERS FOR NEXT YEAR WE HAVE RFID USE CASES THAT EACH CAN BE 100S OF MILLIONS OF UNITS OVER TIME AND GIVE US CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT INTO 2021 THERE'S STRONG FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEMAND FOR OUR PHYSICAL SECURITY IDENTITY READERS AND MOBILITY APPS AND OUR COMPLETE RANGE OF RECURRING REVENUE PRODUCT IS NOW IN PLACE WITH ALL THESE GROWTH DRIVERS WE COULD SEE FASTER GROWTH IN ANY GIVEN QUARTER BUT TO KEEP OUR PREDICTABILITY WE'VE GIVEN A STRONG BASE GROWTH OUTLOOK AND WE'LL UPDATE AS WE GET FURTHER INTO THE MARKETS' TAKE OFF SO 2020 HAS BEEN A CHALLENGING YEAR BUT WE'RE IN MARKETS THAT ARE TAKING OFF AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STRENGTHEN OUR LEADERSHIP EVEN IF THEY'RE ACCELERATING THE RESULT IS WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO A STRONG FINISH TO THE YEAR AND AN EXCITING 2021 SO WITH THAT LET ME OPEN THE DISCUSSION TO QUESTIONS OPERATOR LADIES AND THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE WILL NOW TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOU DO HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD AT THIS TIME IF YOU'RE USING A SPEAKER PHONE WE ASK THAT WHILE POSING YOUR QUESTION YOU PICK UP YOUR HANDSET TO PROVIDE THE BEST SOUND QUALITY AGAIN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU DO HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD AT THIS TIME WE'LL TAKE OUR FIRST QUESTION FROM JASON SMITH WITH LAKE STREET CAPITAL MARKETS PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY GUYS THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS UH STEVE I APPRECIATE ALL THE COLOR AND SORT OF WHY YOU'RE FEELING SO CONFIDENT IN 2021 BUT CURIOUS IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT SORRY THE BACKLOG COVERAGE TO 2021 AND I- I- IF SOME OF THIS CONFIDENCE IS REALLY JUST DRIVEN BY SOME SIZABLE ORDERS ALREADY IN HAND OR IF IT'S JUST GENERAL CONFIDENCE ESPECIALLY ON THE RFID SIDE THAT YOU ARE JUST SEEING GOING TO SEE THIS BIG GENERAL ADOPTION YEAH THANKS FOR THE QUESTION JASON AND YES BACKLOG UH HAS BEEN GROWING NICELY I THINK WE EARLIER INDICATED THAT UH AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS UP UH IT WAS DOUBLED FROM WHAT IT HAD BEEN UH UH JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS EARLIER AND I MENTIONED THAT WE'VE ALREADY GOT OVER 95% UH OF OUR Q4 SHIPMENT THAT'S ALREADY COVERING BACKLOGS SO ALL THE ORDERS COMING IN ARE 2021 ORDERS AND YET WE ACTUALLY HAVE ORDERS THAT GO THROUGHOUT ALL OF 2021 UM SO WE'VE GOT GOOD VISIBILITY BOTH UH FRONT-END END AND YOU KNOW AS I SAID WE EXPECTED UH THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR ALREADY TO BE UM 50% GROWTH OVER REP UH OVER THE YEAR PRIOR UH AND OBVIOUSLY WE WE WOULDN'T BE SAYING THAT CLEAR NUMBERS WE DIDN'T HAVE FAIR AMOUNT OF VISIBILITY IN IT UH AND THAT'S REALLY DRIVEN BY BY OUR BACKLOG OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL AND IN YOUR PREPARED REMARKS YOU NOTED ABOUT $1 MILLION IN BUSINESS NOT BEING ABLE TO SHIFT IN Q3 COULD YOU JUST COMMENT ON WHAT SORT OF CONSTRAINTS YOU'RE SEEING THERE AND IF THOSE CON- CONSTRAINTS HAVE EASED NOW IN Q4 YEAH ALSO THAN- THANKS FOR UH PICKING UP ON THAT ONE UM YES AS I MENTIONED IN THE SECOND QUARTER CALL WE'VE BEEN EXPANDING OUR CAPACITY RAPIDLY BUT WHEN YOU YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT UH DOUBLING YOUR CAPACITY UH AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT IN Q4 WE'VE GOT TO BE A A BACKLOG DAY YOU KNOW 125% BUT THE YEAR PRIOR UH THAT- THAT'S INDICATING YOU KNOW MORE THAN DOUBLE WHERE WE WERE YEARS A YEAR AGO UM WE'RE BUILDING OUT UH UH SPACE AND WE'RE PUTTING IN MORE EQUIPMENT UM AND THE SOME OF THE DEVICES THAT WE'RE PRODUCING ARE PARTICULARLY COMPLICATED AND HIGH-END WHICH IS GREAT FOR US BECAUSE IT'S UH UH IT'S UH MORE DIFFERENTIATED UM BUT THEY TAKE MORE UH MACHINE CAPACITY BECAUSE THERE'S MULTIPLE PROCESSES MULTIPLE PASSES UM VERSUS SOME OF THE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD PRODUCTS AND THAT THAT OF THOSE OF COURSE THE MORE COMPLICATED PRODUCTS OFTEN GO TO THE THE MORE UH SENSITIVE AND THE HIGH-END CUSTOMERS SO WE ALWAYS WANNA FAVOR THOSE AND SO WE DID UH UH HAVE SOME THAT WE COULDN'T SHIP WE'RE CATCHING UP IN THIS QUARTER UM AND IT WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY BUILT OUT UH BY THE END OF THIS QUARTER AGAIN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BUILDING CAPACITY YOU'RE TALKING YOU KNOW 100 150 GRAND IN UH IN FACILITIES UM YOU KNOW BUILD OUT AND UH AND UH FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT IT'S NOT A MAJOR UH CAPITAL ABSORPTION UM BUT WE HAVE BEEN CATCHING UP THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER AND UH WE'LL BE ALL CAUGHT UP IN A GOOD SHAPE UH GOING INTO 2021 OKAY AND THEN JUST THE LAST ONE AND I'LL JUMP BACK INTO QUEUE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY- MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> THE SCHOOL AND EDUCATION MARKET COULD BE A LITTLE CHALLENGING- MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> WITH BUDGETARY PRESSURES AND WHATNOT BUT JUST CURIOUS IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN THAT MARKET ARE GOING FORWARD IF IT IS SHARPY AS YOU SAY BUT IT'S ALSO UM UH YOU KNOW HIGHLY MOTIVATED FOR SECURITY UH WE YOU KNOW WE WE PUT OUT A WHITE PAPER ON UH UM REMOTE SCHOOL IN CYBER SECURITY FOR EXAMPLE WITH OUR FIDO KEYS THAT WE JUST LAUNCHED YOU KNOW ONE OF THE DIRTY SECRETS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T YOU KNOW FOCUSED ON IS WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE KIDS IN OUR COUNTRY AND AND AND PUT THEM ONLINE TO TO GO TO SCHOOL AND IF ANYONE THINKS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY PROPERLY SECURED THEIR THEIR DATA PIPES UH FOR THEIR LEARNING UM THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC AND SO THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES THERE FOR EXAMPLE TO CYBER SECURE UH MORE OF THE UH UH THE DISTANCE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND THERE'S ALSO AS WE GO BACK TO SCHOOL UM PHYSICAL SECURITY IS AS IMPORTANT AS EVER AND ESPECIALLY PHYSICAL SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOW BEING INTEGRATED WELL WITH WITH THE TYPES OF SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE SO THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES THERE WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF YOU KNOW INTEREST IN KIDS BUT ALSO YOU KNOW SCHOOLS ARE IN FINANCIAL YOU KNOW CHALLENGES AND SO SOME OF THEM ARE GOING AHEAD YOU KNOW FAST AND SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY FRANKLY HUNKERED DOWN SO I DON'T KNOW ON A MONTH BY MONTH BASIS HOW IT'S GOING TO EMERGE UM BUT FROM A MARKET OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR UH I ACTUALLY THINK SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES ARE GONNA BE A VERY GOOD SEGMENT FOR US UM BOTH ON THE CYBERSECURITY SIDE AND ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY PHYSICAL SECURITY SIDE OKAY THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL THANKS A LOT AS A REMINDER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU DO HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD AT THIS TIME WE'LL TAKE OUR NEXT QUESTION FROM MIKE <UNK> WITH NORTHLAND CAPITAL MARKETS PLEASE GO AHEAD GREAT THANKS YEAH GREAT QUARTER THERE UM STEVE I COULDN'T TELL DID DID YOU GIVE SOME GUIDANCE ON WHAT YOU THOUGHT PREMISES WOULD GROW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER I COULDN'T TELL IF YOU YOU YOU SAID THAT OR NOT UH

DRIVING THAT SEQUENTIAL PATTERN THEN YEAH GOOD QUESTION IT'S IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD I AND AND I YEAH YOU YOU JUST PUSH GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT THAT'S ON THE GROWTH DOES <INAUDIBLE> THINK ABOUT UNDERNEATH THE NUMBERS IT'S UH IT'S PROBABLY MORE COMMERCIAL THAN GOVERNMENT UH IN TERMS OF INCREASES UM SEQUENTIALLY OKAY OKAY UM- <INAUDIBLE> WE HAVE SEE WE HAVE SEEN UH A A REBOUND IN ACTIVITY UH IN UH ON THE PREMISES SIDE YOU KNOW YOU CAN ONLY DEPLOY THESE THINGS SO LONG AND UH- MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> UH AND NOT A LOT OF THE INSTALLERS AND NOW THESE ARE ARE GETTING OUT THERE GETTING BACK IN LINE AND ALSO CUSTOMERS UM YOU KNOW UH THINGS LIKE VIDEOS SYSTEMS WHERE MICROSOFT STOPPED SUPPORTING YOU KNOW WINDOWS 7 OR SOMETHING THEY THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SO THERE'S THAT THERE'S UH A BUILT IN UM YOU KNOW MIGRATION A GOOD PATTERN THAT UH WE'RE STARTING TO SEE COME BACK YEP YEP OKAY GOT IT AND THEN ON THE IDENTITY JUST IT SEEMS LIKE A A A TON OF OPPORTUNITY THERE UM I GUESS HO- HOW DIVERSE IS DO YOU SEE THAT REVENUE STREAM BEING IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW CUSTOMER BASE OVER THE NEXT YEAR IS IT GONNA BE YOU KNOW VERY DIVERSE OR IS IT GONNA BE A COUPLE BIG CUSTOMERS REALLY DRIVING THE GROWTH UM ARE YOU ASKING PRIMARILY ABOUT RFID AND IDENTITY YES YES UH SO ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S GONNA BE QUITE DIVERSE UH CERTAINLY WHEN SOME OF THESE GLOBAL CORPORATIONS UH YOU KNOW LAUNCH THEIR NUMBERS ARE BIG- MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> BUT UM THERE'S UH THERE'S SEVERAL OF THEM THAT ARE UH YOU KNOW EITHER ARE ALREADY LAUNCHING OR IN PILOTS AND BUILDING IN THE LAUNCH FOR 2021 UM AND YOU MIGHT'VE NOTICED WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY YOU KNOW 10% PRESENTATION CUSTOMERS UH YOU KNOW JUST CLOSED SO UM IT CERTAINLY SOME UH SOME GORILLAS UH BUT UH BUT A RANGE OF THEM AND INT- OTHER INTERESTING THING IS A RANGE OF APPLICATIONS UH THAT ARE NOT JUST IN ONE VERTICAL UH EITHER THERE'S UH THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT USE CASES THAT ARE UH UH THAT ARE GETTING MOMENTUM YEAH OKAY AND THEN UM YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF CLOUD OFFERINGS NOW MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> YOU KNOW I I I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA BE PROMOTING THAT EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVELY NEXT YEAR I MEAN W- WHAT WOULD BE AND AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BOOK A CLOUD DEAL IT DOESN'T ALWAYS SHOW UP WITHIN THE QUARTER A YEAR OBVIOUSLY BUT LIKE WHAT WHAT WOULD BE SORT OF A GOOD AMOUNT OF CLOUD BOOKING AS FOR NEXT YEAR IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL IS IT YOU KNOW $1 MILLION OR IS IT 5 MILLION LIKE LIKE WH- LIKE WHAT WOULD BE A SUCCESSFUL CLOUD BOOKING YEAR WELL UM I THINK UH WE'RE WE'RE JUST YOU KNOW LEARNING WHAT THE PROFILE LOOKS LIKE BUT I THINK UH YOU KNOW THAT THAT SIX YEARS $650,000 UH YOU KNOW <INAUDIBLE> RIGHT INSTALLATION THAT WE DID IS IS ON THE HIGH-END BUT IT'S CHARACTERISTIC OF HOW THESE THINGS WORK MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> SO IF YOU MEAN HOW MUCH WE RECOGNIZED WITHIN THE YEAR UM YOU KNOW PROBABLY A YOU KNOW COUPLE OF FEW MILLION DOLLARS UH INCREMENTAL TO THE TO THE 6 TO 8% WE'RE ALREADY AT BUT THAT WOULD REPRESENT THE SCORES FIVE TO SIX TIMES AS MUCH IN

        "model_prediction": "Good afternoon, welcome to Identiv's presentation of its third quarter twenty twenty earnings call. My name is Tara and I'll be your operator this afternoon. Joining us for today's presentation are the company's CEO Steve Humphries and CFO Sandra Wallace. Following management's remarks, we will open the call for questions. Before we begin, please note that during this call, management may be making references to non-GAAP measures or projections. Free cash flow. In addition, during the call, management will be making forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characteristics of future events, including financial projections and future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in the documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2021. The company's latest annual report on form 10 K identifies no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak as of today. I will now turn the call over to CEO Steve Humphries for his comments. Sir, please proceed. Thanks, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. In our preliminary results, we said we expected to beat the aggressive growth projections we outlined on our second quarter call, including 80 percent growth in R&D for the full year. This year, 20% sequential growth in physical security from Q2 to Q3 and federal sales up 80% sequentially. With our finalized financial results, we confirm that we beat each of those expectations. This shows both the strong industry trends driving our business and our leadership within the industry. Overall, revenues grew 30% sequentially to $24.99 million, showing strength across the business. We projected our revenue. MIS BUSINESS WHICH IS ABOUT TWO THIRDS FEDERAL TO GROW TWENTY PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY WE ACTUALLY GREW TWENTY SIX PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY IN PREMISES OUR R I F I D BUSINESS GROWS MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY AND OVER A HUNDRED PERCENT YEAR OVER YEAR AND IS ON TRACK FOR EIGHTY PERCENT FULL YEAR GROWTH AND OUR FEDERAL REVENUES GROWS NEARLY NINETY PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY SO THIS HAS US LINED UP FOR A STR We're seeing business momentum continuing, backlog building, and the pipeline for 2022 becoming stronger. But before we talk too much about the future, let's review the operational and financial results from the third quarter. Now, our key focus areas of rfid and our federal business were particularly strong within our identity business, which is predominantly rfid. Revenue increased sequentially by thirty three percent to fifteen point four million and year over year, identity in total. The group grew to 53 percent from 10 million in Q3 1993 to 15.4 million in Q3 2002. The growth was mainly driven by RFID, of course, where we ramped up production volumes for a number of customers. In particular, a major customer whose production started in Q2 came through in Q3 even stronger than we expected. As a result, our RFID business more than doubled the volume we produced a year ago. There was nearly a million dollars worth of shipments we didn't fulfill. We balanced customer requirements to make sure the most critical deliveries were covered. As a business implication, the industry launches we expected are well underway. The mass market adoption of RFID integrated products is happening. Our major customers are incorporating RFID devices into healthcare products, mobility consumer products, appliances, libraries, pharmaceuticals, and app enabling the physical world. The point is... IT IS THAT EACH OF THESE ARE HUNDRED MILLION OR BILLION PLUS UNIT APPLICATIONS IT'S A HUGE MARKET THAT'S JUST BEGINNING TO GROW THE OVERALL TREND CLEARLY SHOWS IN OUR THIRD QUARTER RESULTS AS WELL AS IN THE CONTINUING BACKLOG STRENGTH WHERE WE WENT INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER WITH BACKLOG FOR FOURTH QUARTER SHIPMENTS UP EIGHTY PERCENT OVER LAST YEAR THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS GOING FORWARD OF ALL THESE TRENDS LATER ON THE CALL ALSO WITH IDENT THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OVER LAST YEARS THIRD QUARTER THAT WE ALL EXPECTED THE WORK FROM HOME TREND TO PLATEAU AFTER THE INITIAL LOCKDOWNS IN THE SPRING BUT THIS REALLY SHOWS THAT DEMAND IS CONTINUING THE THIRD QUARTER IS ALWAYS STRONG FOR SMARTPHONE READERS BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL YEAR END SO THE GROWTH COMES OVER A NORMALLY STRONG YEAR PRIOR PERIOD THE REASON IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ESPECIALLY THE DOD ARE ADOPTING POLICIES SUPPORTING Let's talk more about them as we look at twenty twenty one. So turning to our premises business in two three this showed the strength of our full product range as well as of our federal government focus. As I mentioned before premises grew twenty six percent sequentially the federal business for our velocity security platform was the strongest vertical grew ninety percent sequentially but we also saw activity in banking retail utilities and others for example in financial services we quoted our first large large The VRP Prime managed video services order is now closed. A leading bank has adopted our platform across almost a hundred branches. The six-year, six hundred fifty thousand dollar agreement provides video surveillance, analytics, and case management on a subscription basis, setting tens of thousands of dollars in capital expenditures for our customer and assuring a predictable revenue stream of over a hundred thousand dollars annually for our business. To be clear, we've had continuing strong business growth. In our industry, some small dealers and small businesses are under pressure. As are our competitors who focus there. Now, since federal, state, and local government customers are more than two-thirds of the business for our physical access platforms, we're seeing strong performance in premises and our quick pivot to recurring revenues with lower costs of entry has put us in a strong position overall. These include our velocity series products, mobility as a service, and freedom cloud and freedom mobile, which we just launched this week. ALL OF THESE ARE RECURRING REVENUE PRODUCTS, ALL LAUNCHED IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. NOW, AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE SECOND QUARTER, THE BROAD ADOPTION OF RFID IN OUR MAJOR CUSTOMER'S CORE PRODUCTS IS WHAT REALLY GIVES US REASON TO BELIEVE THIS GROWTH IS A LONG-TERM TREND THAT WE'RE JUST STARTING TO SEE TAKE OFF. IT'S BUILDING BACKLOG FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO OVERALL, THE THIRD QU And ninety percent sequential growth in federal sales, thirty-eight percent year over year identity reader growth, and Q4 backlog up sixty-eight percent from last year. There certainly are challenges on the economic environment we're all in, but the strong secular growth we're experiencing with RFID, our strength in federal, work from home going into a second wave of demand, and the products we've launched in the third quarter to take advantage of return to work needs have built a base for a strong fourth quarter and twenty-one. SO LET ME TURN IT OVER TO SANDRA TO GO THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS AFTERWARDS I'LL GO INTO MORE METRICS AND THE INDUSTRY WIDE TRENDS THAT ARE REALLY ACCELERATING OUR BUSINESS INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER AND INTO TWENTY TWO ONE SANDRA BRIEFLY AS STEVE MENTIONED OUR RESULTS SHOW THE CONTINUED DELIVERY OF WHAT WE COMMITTED WITH A SOLID TRAJECTORY FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE RESULTS ARE ALL WITH Revenue Growth Even with the Continued Impact of COVID-19 We Closed Out the Third Quarter of Twenty Twenty with Twenty Four Point Nine Million in Total Revenue Up Thirty Percent Compared to the Second Quarter of Twenty Twenty and Up Eight Percent Compared to the Third Quarter of Twenty Nineteen Our Recurring Revenue Accounted for Six Percent of Our Third Quarter Revenue and Eight Percent of Our Total Revenue in the First Nine Months of Twenty Twenty This Part of Our Business Remained Steady at Eight Percent of Our Total Revenue in the Last Nine Months of Twenty Twenty Total trailing twelve month revenue for the third quarter of twenty twenty are gap and non-gap adjusted gross profit margins were forty and forty one percent respectively. For the trailing twelve month period our non-gap adjusted gross profit margin was forty two percent. For the third quarter of twenty twenty our non-gap adjusted ebitda margin was positive eleven percent with a positive four percent for the trailing twelve month period. Our gap mid-income for the third quarter of twenty twenty was... Twenty-one with a loss of two point seven million in Q2 2020 and net income of one point one million in Q3 2019. With the dividends on the series B preferred are gap net income attributable to stockholders of zero point one million or net income of one cent per share compared with a loss of seventeen cents per share in Q2 2020 and positive five cents per share in Q3 2019. We have provided in the appendix a full bibliography of gap to non-gap information which is also included in our earnings releases. On our next slide, we will further analyze trends by segment. Our premises segment, which includes sales of physical access control and video products, accounted for nine point four million or thirty eight percent of our total revenue in Q3, representing. An increase in dollars of twenty six percent from Q2 twenty twenty and a decrease of twenty seven percent from Q3 twenty nineteen revenue from our identity products which includes sales of access credentials smart card readers RFID transponders and mobile security products total fifteen point four million or sixty two percent of our total revenue in Q3 twenty twenty an increase of dollars of thirty three percent from Q2 twenty twenty Twenty twenty and an increase of fifty three percent from Q3 twenty nineteen our non-gap gross profit was forty one percent in the third quarter of twenty twenty this compares with forty two percent in Q2 twenty nineteen and forty seven percent in Q3 twenty nineteen driven by both the mix of products across segments and within segments our premises segment margins were fifty five percent relatively flat compared to Q2 twenty nineteen The identity segment margins were 30 percent, relatively flat compared to Q2 2020 at 31 percent and lower than Q3 2019 at 33 percent due to a higher proportion of lower margin transponder sales. Moving on to our operating expense management, our gap operating expenses for the third quarter were $37 million. Now, moving to our operating expense management, our gap operating expenses for the third quarter were $37 million. Now, moving to our operating expense management, our gap operating expenses for the third quarter were $37 million. Now, moving to our operating expense management, our gap operating expenses for the third quarter were $37 million. Now, moving to our operating expense management, our gap operating expenses for the third quarter were $37 million. Now, moving to our The sequential decrease was primarily due to the non-recurring one point two million restructuring expense in Q3 2020, which was down from ten million in Q2 2020 and down year over year from nine point three million in Q3 2019. Our non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to thirty percent in the third quarter of 2020 compared to forty percent in the second quarter of 2020. The non-gap operating expenses totaled seven point five million in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. This compares to seven point six million in Q2 of twenty twenty and seven point nine million in Q3 of twenty nineteen. Bringing all the pieces back together, the non-gap adjusted ebitda was two point eight million in the third quarter of twenty twenty. There will be an increase of 2.3 million over Q2 2020. Turning to the balance sheet, we will be comparing our position at September 2020 to the position one quarter ago at June 2020 and the prior year quarter ended September 2019. We exited the third quarter with cash at 12.3 million, a net decrease of 0.8 million from Q2 2020 and a 1.0 million increase from Q3 2020. In nineteen nineteen, net cash activity for the quarter was driven by two point two million of cash provided by our net income excluding non-cash items, three point six million of cash used for working capital and cap x, driven primarily by late c three billings that were not collectible within the quarter and by an increase in working capital to support our singapore growth under financing and foreign currency. We had a zero point six million net cash provided, driven primarily by late c three billings that were not collectible within the quarter and by an increase in working capital to support our singapore growth under financing and foreign currency. We can buy a 0.9% increase in net borrowings under our revolver and a 0.5% reduction through scheduled payments on the term loan facility. We believe that we have adequate capital available to fund our business growth and return to positive non-GAAP free cash flow exiting Q4 2020 as well as retiring the term and note debt on schedule in Q1 2021 in our ten Q filings. We have included the full balance sheet for the earnings release in the appendix. Even with the global disruption continuing, today we are confirming our guidance for the consolidated results of the company for full year 2020 at revenue between 86 and 88 million within our original guidance entering this year. We achieved gap eps profitability in Q3 2020 ahead of expectations. AND CONTINUES TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF OUR ACTIONS TO OPTIMIZE COSTS TO CARRY FORWARD IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE NON GAP FREE CASH FLOW POSITIVE AS COMMITTED DURING Q4 TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND BEYOND IN ADDITION TODAY WE'RE PROVIDING GUIDANCE FOR THE FULL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUILDING ON THE STRONG BASIS OF GROWTH THAT WE HAVE DELIVERED OUR FULL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE GUIDANCE IS FOR REVENUE BETWEEN NINETY SIX AND ONE Point of Our Twenty Twenty Guidance Exceeding the Market Growth by a Factor of Two We Expect Our Normal Seasonality to Continue with Our Lowest Quarter in Q1 Twenty Twenty One and Building Up Quarter Over Quarter Through the End of Twenty Twenty One We Will Be Issuing a Full Set of Guidance at Our Q4 in Full Year Twenty Twenty One Earnings Release Targeted for March Twenty Twenty One With That I Will Conclude the Financial Discussion and Pass It Back to Steve As I said earlier, our RFID growth is predictable for two reasons. It's heavily backlog-driven, and it's driven by major companies who have incorporated RFID devices into their products. Planning for global products is a year-long process, so even now we're getting visibility into plans throughout 2021. First backlog: forming the fourth quarter, our total backlog stood at ten point five million, up sixty-eight percent from last year, and our RFID backlog stood at ten point five million, up sixty-eight percent from last year. Shipment in the fourth quarter is up 125% over last year. We've now gotten in orders for about 95% of our expected shipments for the quarter in RFID and that means most additional orders either contribute to the side within the quarter or drive more backlog for twenty twenty one. This is a key driver of our growth for twenty twenty one and we expect the RFID portion of our business to grow well over fifty percent in the first half of twenty twenty one versus the first half of twenty twenty. The core driver of our RFID business is the mass market adoption of RFID integrated products. Our customers are leaders in their own industries, incorporating RFID devices into their products, each with volumes of tens or hundreds of millions of units. So this is a huge market that's just beginning to grow. In the third quarter, two strong use cases were launched in the market, one by CVS and the other by Apple. We don't generally disclose customers, so these are just industry examples to be clear. But both are great examples of the RFID market accelerating. They're both basic uses that establish platforms to then drive multiple products from already big first launches. So the first, some of you saw in a demo session we had a couple of weeks back, CVS has spoken out for visually impaired people. You tap your phone to the RFID tag on the prescription bottle and it reads out the medication with dosage and all the other information. Information for people who can't read the label. Now about 13 percent of prescriptions go to people with some visual impairment and there are about four and a half billion prescriptions annually. So in the US alone, that's over half a billion rfid tags every year just for the visually impaired sector. Now that's the current use case and the first use case. So now extrapolate with the platform deployed, every cvs pharmacy now is set up to program and put rfid tags on every prescription and that's really where they should be. EVERYONE SO WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE IF YOU TAP EACH TIME YOU TAKE IT YOU'LL KNOW IF YOU'VE TAKEN IT MORNING OR EVENING OR WHATEVER THE PRESCRIPTION REGIMEN IS IT'LL AUTO REFILL AS YOU GET LOW THERE'S ALL KINDS OF CAPABILITIES YOU CAN DO THERE YOU CAN EVEN OPT IN AND YOUR DOCTOR COULD GET INFORMATION ABOUT HOW CONSISTENT YOU'RE TAKING YOUR MEDS BECAUSE ANYONE WHO STUDIES THIS AREA NOTES THAT THAT THE BIGGE NOW THAT THEY'VE MADE THAT INITIAL INVESTMENT, THEY CAN REALLY EXPAND INTO OTHER CATEGORIES. SO ULTIMATELY, WE THINK THE OPPORTUNITY IS FOR ALL FOUR AND A HALF BILLION OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE US ANNUALLY. THE US HAS ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S PRESCRIPTIONS, SO AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THAT TO THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED APPLICATION THERE'S A COUPLE OF BILLION UNITS WORLDWIDE AND NEARLY TWENTY BILLION UNITS FOR ALL PRESCRIPTIONS WORLDWIDE. If the reader in the app technology is already in everybody's pockets in their phones. Now, related to the mobile space and the phones, the biggest event, of course, was Apple's launch of full NFC support in iOS 14 and the iPhone 12, and especially the new ecosystem of products around night mode. So, Apple made it very easy and secure to connect peripherals to the iPhone and then through NFC to connect them into core iPhone features. So, just as a couple of examples, the first is that the first iPhone was released in 2007, and since then, we've seen the release of the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3G, the iPhone Apple branded cases, for example, you buy an orange case, you pop it on your phone, the screen turns orange, it goes through an animation, you know you've connected it, and you know it's an Apple verified phone. It seems pretty trivial, but what it's showing is the peripherals are actually communicating securely with the phone, launching processes in the phone, and all secured and controlled by Apple through a secure NFC link. This enables a whole world of new peripherals to connect to the phone and seamlessly interact with it. Securely launch apps and experiences so this is really the vision for this type of connected device that that apple's deploying and with over two hundred million iPhones shipped a year connecting multiple mag-safe enabled devices each again you can see the market in a billion unit plus range yearly now additionally of course where apple and siri go sam's club walgreens amazon pharmacy and others have to match so you can see the scale of the markets we're going after and the volumes that are already happening. So RFID is gaining traction right now. We've been the trusted co-developer and supplier for some of the most advanced applications and the most demanding companies. This is where the growth is, and it's where our competitive advantage is strongest. So how are we going to keep our advantage? We're expanding our technical capabilities. And for twenty twenty one, we're launching services to help companies put RFID into their products. And we're unique in our ability to go from concept to optimized design to early production. Productions, scaling production and then to immediately start back into the next generation of devices. And that's exactly the cycle that customers need. We're also innovating with new products, answering needs we know from our own customers. An example is a new product we've launched. What we think is the industry's lowest carbon footprint RFID tag, our eco tag. Instead of being an etched antenna on a plastic substrate, we've developed a unique laser cutting process and it's on recyclable paper. Substance: We even use recycled aluminum for the antenna so there's no etching chemicals, no lost metal, no plastic layers, no chemical runoff. Now why do we do all this? Well, the biggest users of high-end RFID are consumer-facing companies, and sustainability matters to them. Companies like Amazon and Apple have made public commitments to being carbon-neutral, and RFID tags are consumer-visible devices, so our eco-tag shows their eco-commitment. This destroys what would otherwise be a negative on their carbon footprint. Our customers tell us this is what they want. It's very tricky technology, but we developed it. And fundamentally, this is exactly why we're going to keep our lead in the fast-growing RFID market. So that's RFID. Now let's look at premises which has some similarly exciting opportunities. And remember, the core technology in our RFID tag is shared with our access cards, door readers, identity readers and other parts of our physical and data security. Solutions so one growth driver really supports the other so with the premises industry overall going about six percent we grew twenty six percent sequentially and we're expecting premises to grow about twenty five percent year over year this quarter for twenty twenty one we expect growth in the mid teens more than double the industry rate now the fundamental drivers are recurring revenue growth the shift to it-driven buyers and federal growth so why will we be? GROWING FASTER THAN THE MARKET IN THESE DYNAMICS JUST LIKE AN R F I D, WE'RE BOTH THE TRUSTED PROVIDER AND WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND BROADEST PRODUCT RANGE AS CUSTOMERS MOVE TO SOFTWARE-DEFINED PLATFORMS THEY NEED TO MIGRATE THEIR ENTIRE PLATFORM ACROSS READERS, PREDELENCE, CONTROLLERS, ACCESS, VIDEO AND AUDIO AND IT'S ALL GOT TO BE INTEGRATED WITH THEIR ACTIVE DIRECTORY OR OTHER SENSITIVE DATA REPOSITOR The centric and clearing revenue platforms will be the fastest growth sector in physical security and the strategic position of combined access, video and audio management is the key for anyone trying to win. A great example of this is our freedom cloud platform that we just launched this week. It's the lightest weight implementation in the industry, totally web and mobile based and especially on the hardware side, our freedom bridges are extremely compact and cost-effective IOT devices. A bridge that can control two doors is the size of a pack of playing cards and this is what customers are looking for. Hardly noticeable, really intuitive to deploy and manage and a platform that the I T department is totally comfortable owning and managing. The software is browser-based and the hardware is managed just like a network switch. So we've described the growth in each segment. So to put it together in the fourth quarter, we're expecting overall revenues to grow in the twenty-five to thirty percent year-over-year range. Looking at the business drivers for next year, we have RFID use cases that each can be hundreds of millions of units over time and give us a clear line of sight into 2022. There's strong federal government demand for our physical security, identity readers, and mobility apps, and our complete range of recurring revenue products is now in place. Now, with all these growth drivers, we could see faster growth than any given quarter, but to keep our predictability, we've given a strong. Phase Growth Outlook and will update as we get further into the markets take off. The twenty twenty has been a challenging year, but we're in markets that are taking off and we've been able to strengthen our leadership even as they accelerate. The result is we're looking forward to a strong finish to the year and an exciting twenty twenty one. So with that, let me open the discussion to questions. Operator? QUESTION: PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD AT THIS TIME. IF YOU'RE USING A SPEAKER PHONE, WE ASK THAT WHILE POSED YOUR QUESTION YOU PICK UP YOUR HANDSET TO PROVIDE THE BEST SOUND QUALITY. AGAIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU DO HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT, PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD AT THIS TIME. WE'LL TAKE OUR FIRST QUESTION FROM JASON SMITH WITH LAKE STREET CAPITAL MARKETS. PLEASE GO A Confident in twenty twenty one but curious if you could talk about sort of the backlog coverage to twenty twenty one and if some of this confidence is really just driven by some sizably orders already in hand or if it's just general confidence especially on the rfid side that you are just seeing gonna see this big general adoption yeah thanks for the question jason and yes backlog has been growing nicely we think we earlier indicated It was stated that at the time it was up, it had doubled from what it had been just a couple of months earlier. It was mentioned that we've already got over ninety five percent of our two-four shipment already covered in backlog, so all the orders coming in are two-thirty-one orders, and we actually have orders that go throughout all of two-thirty-one. So we've got good visibility both front-end and back-end, and as they said, we expected the first half of the year already to be fifty percent growth. ROBERT: OVER UH OVER THE YEAR PRIOR AND OBVIOUSLY WE WOULDN'T BE SAYING THAT'S CLEAR NUMBERS WE DIDN'T HAVE FAR ENOUGH VISIBILITY IN IT AND THAT'S REALLY DRIVEN BY BY OUR BACKLOG OH OK THAT'S HELPFUL AND IN YOUR PREPARED REMARKS YOU NOTED ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN BUSINESS NOT BEING ABLE TO SHIP IN Q3 CAN YOU JUST COMMENT ON WHAT TYPE OF CONSTRAINTS YOU'RE SEEING THERE AND IF THOSE CONSTRAINTS HAVE E YEAH ALSO THANKS FOR PICKING UP ON THAT ONE YEAH AS I MENTIONED IN THE SECOND QUARTER CALL WE'VE BEEN EXPANDING OUR CAPACITY RAPIDLY BUT WHEN YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU SOME OF THE DEVICES THAT WE'RE PRODUCING ARE PARTICULARLY COMPLICATED AND HIGH END, WHICH IS GREAT FOR US BECAUSE IT'S MORE DIFFERENTIATED BUT THEY TAKE MORE MACHINE CAPACITY BECAUSE THERE'S MULTIPLE PROCESSES AND MULTIPLE PASSES VERSUS SOME OF THE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD PRODUCTS AND THAT OF COURSE THE MORE COMPLICATED PRODUCTS OFTEN GO TO THE MORE SENSITIVE AND HIGH END CUSTOMERS SO WE ALWAYS WANT TO FAVOR THOSE Have some that we couldn't ship. We're catching up in this quarter and we'll have the capacity built out by the end of this quarter. Again, when we talk about building capacity, you're talking, you know, hundred, hundred and fifty grand in facilities, you know, build outs and a few hundred thousand dollars in equipment. It's not a major capital absorption but we have been catching up through the third quarter and will be all caught up in a good shape going into twenty twenty one. Okay, and then just the last one, and I'll jump back into queue. I mean, obviously, the school and education market could be a little challenging with budgetary pressures and whatnot, but just curious if you could comment on what your expectations in that market are going forward. It is choppy, as you say, but it's also highly motivated for security. We did put out a white paper on the subject. REMOTE SCHOOLING IN CYBER SECURITY, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH OUR FIDO KEYS THAT WE JUST LAUNCHED YOU KNOW ONE OF THE DIRTY SECRETS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T YOU KNOW FOCUSED ON IS WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE KIDS IN OUR COUNTRY AND AND PUT THEM ONLINE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND IF ANYONE THINKS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY PROPERLY SECURED THEIR THEIR DATA PIPES FOR THEIR LEARNING THERE THERE THEY'RE BEING A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC AND SO THERE'S OPPORTUN Learning Environment, and there's also as we go back to school, physical security is as important as ever, and especially physical security infrastructure is now being integrated with with health and safety infrastructure so there's opportunities there, we're seeing a lot of interest in bids but also schools are in financial challenges and so some of them are going ahead, you know, fast and some of them are really frankly hunkered down so i don't know on a The audio is a conversation between two individuals discussing the importance of cybersecurity in schools and universities.\n\nOne of the individuals mentions that cybersecurity should be a top priority for schools and universities, as it is becoming increasingly important in today's digital age. They also mention that cybersecurity is not just about protecting against cyber attacks, but also about ensuring the safety and privacy of students, faculty, and staff.\n\nThe other individual agrees, stating that cybersecurity is a critical aspect of modern education, and that schools and universities need to take it seriously. They also mention that cybersecurity should be a regular topic of discussion and training for all members of the school or university community.\n\nOverall, the conversation emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity in schools and universities, and the need for all members of the community A question from Mike Latimer with Northland Capital Markets, please go ahead. Great, thanks, yeah, a great question there. Um, Steve, I didn't think you did, did you give some guidance on what you thought premises would grow in the fourth quarter? I couldn't tell if you did, you said that or not. I specifically for premises in the fourth quarter. I know that we've got to go back and look at that. A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONTENT CALENDAR FOR MERCHYNT'S MAGICAL CONT MAN: Something they have to do. So there's a built-in migration and growth pattern that we're starting to see come back. YEAH: YEAH: GOT IT. AND THEN ON THE IDENTITY JUST IT SEEMS LIKE A TON OF OPPORTUNITY THERE. I GUESS HOW DIVERSE YOU YOU SEE THAT REVENUE STREAM BEING IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW CUSTOMER BASE OVER THE NEXT YEAR IS IT GONNA BE YOU KNOW VERY DIVERSE OR IS IT GONNA BE A COUPLE OF BIG CUSTOMERS? Driving the growth. Are you asking primarily about rfid and identity? Yes. So actually, I think it's going to be quite diverse. Certainly, when some of these global corporations launch, their numbers are big. But there's there's several of them that are either already launching or in pilot and building in the launch for 2022 one and you might notice we didn't have any ten percent concentration. A male speaker is discussing the importance of cloud computing and how it is becoming more prevalent in the business world. He notes that cloud computing offers a range of benefits, including the ability to access data from anywhere and at any time, as well as the ability to scale up or down as needed. He also mentions that there are a number of cloud providers available, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. The speaker concludes by saying that cloud computing is an essential tool for businesses looking to stay competitive in today's fast-paced digital world. MAN 1: Even more aggressively next year? What would be? And when you, you know, when you book a cloud, it doesn't always show up within the quarter, obviously. But, like, what would be sort of a good amount of cloud bookings for next year if you're successful? Is it, you know, a million dollars? Is it five million? Like, like, like what would be a successful cloud bookings year? Well, I think we're just learning what the profile looks like. But I think, you know, the six years, six hundred fifty thousand dollars.

THIRD INNATE CELL ENGAGER TO ENTER THE CLINIC AND <INAUDIBLE> A MILESTONE PAYMENT TO US DURING THE THIRD QUARTER IN AN AMOUNT THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DISCLOSE LAST MONTH ANGUS SMITH JOINED US AS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER ANGUS WILL UH INTRODUCE HIMSELF LATER AND DISCUSS OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE US TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY AND DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH OF OUR COMPANY DURING THE ANNUAL JANUARY MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS WHICH WAS HELD ON AUGUST 4TH UH WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT ALL PROPOSED AGENDA ITEMS WERE APPROVED THIS INCLUDES THE ADDITION OF DOCTOR ANNALISA JENKINS AND UH HARRY WELTEN TO THE SUPERVISORY BOARD AS NEW MEMBERS ANNALISA IS A VISIONARY LEADER WHO KNOWS HOW TO TRANSLATE SCIENCE FROM BENCH TO BEDSIDE AND HARRY IS AN ACCOMPLISHED FINANCIAL EXECUTIVE WHO WILL HELP DRIVE VALUE-CREATING STRATEGIES FOR THE COMPANY THESE ADDITIONS TO THE SUPERVISORY BOARD FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRY KNOWHOW EXPERIENCE AND DIVERSITY AS IT IS- AS IT HAS ONLY BEEN A MONTH AND A HALF SINCE WE LAST SPOKE TO YOU WE THOUGHT WE WOULD FOCUS TODAY'S DISCUSSION ON COMPANY ACHIEVEMENTS THUS FAR AND WITH BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IN OUR SCIENCE UPDATE YOU ON OUR PROGRAMS AND THEN HAVE PLENTY OF TIME FOR Q AND A TO GET STARTED I WILL NOW HAND OVER THE CALL TO ANDREAS HARSTRICK OUR CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE ON OUR CLINICAL STAGE PROGRAMS ANDREAS YEAH THANK YOU ADI FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND UH THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE UH PROGRESS IN OUR CLINICAL PROGRAMS UH THAT WE MADE OVER THE- OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS STILL PRESENT GLOBALLY AND IT CONTINUES TO POSE UH CHALLENGES FOR THE CONDUCT OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE ENROLLMENT OF PATIENTS UH THE TWO GUIDING PRINCIPLES WE ARE EMPLOYING AT AFFIMED IS TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY ON THE STUDIES AND TO ENSURE TRIAL DATA INTEGRITY AND THIS IS IN LINE I THINK WITH UH GUIDANCE GIVEN FROM ALL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK HOWEVER UH THE AFFIMED TEAM IS VERY PROACTIVELY WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR PARTICIPATING SITES TO MAKE SURE THAT UH OUR INNOVATIVE TREATMENT IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS UH IN NEED OF NEW THERAPEUTICS AND THAT WE UH MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 TO A MINIMUM POSSIBLE ONE IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT IN THIS REGARD IS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE DRUG SUPPLY FOR ALL OF OUR ONGOING STUDIES AND CAN ENSURE UNINTERRUPTED TREATMENT OF ALL PATIENTS TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL LETS START WITH UH AFM13 OUR UH MOST ADVANCED PROGRAM FIRST AS YOU KNOW AFM13 IS IN UH REGISTRATION DIRECTED UH PHASE TWO STUDY AFM13-202 TREATING PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED AND REFRACTORY PERIPHERAL T-CELL LYMPHOMAS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL UH AVAILABLE STANDARD OF CARE OPTIONS THE ENROLLMENT INTO THE STUDY UH IS AT A STEADY STATE WE WERE ABLE TO ACTIVATE 54 SITES NOW UH CONTRIBUTING PATIENTS IN 10 COUNTRIES UH AROUND THE GLOBE AS YOU KNOW UH THIS IS UH THE STUDY HAS UH <INAUDIBLE> TWO STAGE DESIGN WITH A PRE-PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSIS AFTER 40 PATIENTS IN THE PTCL COHORTS AND AS ADI SAID WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL HAVE THE DATA FROM THIS INTERIM ANALYSIS AVAILABLE BY THE MID OF NEXT YEAR THERE WAS ALSO A THIRD COHORT OR THERE IS A THIRD COHORT UM IN THIS STUDY FOR PATIENTS WITH TRANSFORMED MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES SO A CUTANEOUS FORM OF T-CELL LYMPHOMA THIS THIRD COHORT WITH MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES WAS NEVER PART NEVER INTENDED TO BE PART OF THE REGISTRATION PROGRAM IT WAS A PROOF OF CONCEPT UH COHORT ONLY AND FOR COVID-19 RELATED RESTRICTIONS THE ENROLLMENT UH INTO THIS COHORT IS CURRENTLY ON HOLD AS ADI ALSO MENTIONED WE ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN OUR COLLABORATION WITH MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER WE UH WE HAVE AN ACTIVE IND FOR OUR FIRST UH PHASE ONE STUDY OF AMF13 IN COMBINATION WITH ALLOGENEIC UH NATURAL KILLER CELLS UH AS ADI SAID THE CURRENT STATUS AT THE MD ANDERSON WEBSITE IS RECRUITING AND WE KNOW THAT UH PATIENTS ARE CURRENTLY SCREENED AND CONSIDERED AND WE ARE EXPECTING TO- THE ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST PATIENT AS SOON AS COVID-19 UH RELATED RESTRICTIONS AT MD ANDERSON ARE LIFT UP NOW LETS MOVE TO OUR SECOND PROGRAM AFM24 AS YOU KNOW BY BISPECIFIC TETRAVALENT MOLECULE TARGETING BOTH CD16A TO ACTIVATE NATURAL KILLER CELLS AND MACROPHAGES AND THE EGF RECEPTOR ON SOLID TUMORS THIS UH COMPOUND IS IN A PHASE ONE A DOSE ESCALATION PART OF- OF THE 101 STUDY AND WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACTIVATE ALL FOUR PRE-PLANNED SITES AND ALL FOUR PRE-PLANNED SITES ARE CONTRIBUTING PATIENTS AS WE DISCLOSED EARLIER WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR COHORT ONE WITHOUT OBSERVING DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITIES AND ACTIVELY RECRUITING UH INTO THOSE COHORTS TOO WITH THIS I CLOSE THE OVERVIEW OF THE CLINICAL PROGRESS AND I'M HAPPY TO HAND OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ARNDT SCHOTTELIUS CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER WHO WILL REVIEW WITH YOU SOME OF OUR PRE-CLINICAL DATA THAT UH MAKE US SO EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN CREATE FOR PATIENTS WITH ICES AND ACTIVATING THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM ARNDT PLEASE THANK YOU ANDREAS AND THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING UH IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES I WOULD LIKE TO SUMMARIZE AS ANDREAS MENTIONED THE PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL DATA OBSERVED SO FAR WITH OUR INNATE CELL ENGAGERS UH PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT THESE MOLECULES ARE POTENT AND SAFE FOR OUR- OUR CANDIDATES I'LL START BY SUMMARIZING THE DATA SHOWING THAT OUR ICES ARE POTENT MOLECULES AS YOU SEE ON SLIDE FIVE IF WE TAKE AFM13 AS AN EXAMPLE AFM13 HAS BEEN SHOWING STRONG SINGLE AGENT ANTI-TUMOR RESPONSES AND T-CELL LYMPHOMA WITH AN OVERALL RESPONSE RATE OF 50% THE MOLECULE HAS ALSO SHOWN PROMISING SIGNS OF RAW CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL IN AUGMENTING OTHER IO THERAPIES SUCH AS PB1 INHIBITORS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE HODGKIN LYMPHOMA PHASE ONE B STUDY WE'VE SEEN AN IMPRESSIVE OVERALL RESPONSE RATE OF 88% WITH A COMPLETE RESPONSE RATE OF 42 AND 46% IN THE LOCAL AND THE CENTRAL READ RESPECTIVELY THE LOWER PART OF THE SLIDE WE'VE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED FOR YOU PRESENTATIONS OF THE STUDIES UH PAST AND IN THE FUTURE ADDITIONALLY OUR OWN EXPERIENCE AND THE WORK WITH MD ANDERSON WE'VE SEEN PROMISING PRE-CLINICAL DATA SHOWING THAT THE COMBINATION WITH THE ADOPTIVE TRANSFER OF NK CELLS ENHANCED THE IMMUNE RESPONSE OF AFM13 LEADING TO PROLONGED SURVIVAL IN THE RESPECTIVE MOUSE MODEL AND AS WE MENTIONED THE PHASE ONE B STUDY AT MD ANDERSON IS NOW IN THE LAST STAGES OF PREPARATION IF WE GO TO SLIDE SIX YOU SEE THAT IN OUR PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES WITH AFM24 WE SAW POTENT KILLING OF EGFR POSITIVE TUMOR CELL LINES MEDIATED BY TWO DISTINCTIVE <INAUDIBLE> OF ACTION POTENT ADCC OR ANTIBODY DEPENDENT CELLULAR CYTO TOXICITY IS SEEN IRRESPECTIVE OF THE MUTATIONAL STATUS OF THE TUMOR CELLS AND WE SEE POTENT KILLING MEDIATED OF- BY ADCP OR ANTIBODY DEPENDENCE CELLULAR PHAGOCYTOSIS IN TUMOR CELLS WITH HIGH AND LOW EGFR EXPRESSION IMPORTANTLY IN CELLS BARING THE K-RAS G13D MUTATION AFM24 SHOWS PRESERVED KILLING POTENT KILLING OR ADCP OR PHAGOCYTOSIS WHEREAS THIS ABILITY IS LOST FOR ESTABLISHED TREATMENTS FOR THE ANTI- BCMA CD16 OR RO729 FORMERLY KNOWN AS AFM26 MOLECULE WE ALSO SAW VERY GOOD POTENCY IN <INAUDIBLE> WHERE THERE IS A DOSE DEPENDENT KILLING OF THIS INNATE POSITIVE PLASMA CELLS UM WAS OBSERVED WE BELIEVE THAT WE OBSERVED IMPROVED POTENCY MEDIATED BY THE DUAL MODE OF ACTION OF OUR APPROACH INNATE CELL ENGAGERS ARE EMPLOYING NK CELLS AND MACROPHAGES TO KILL TUMOR CELLS AND THUS ACQUIRE A TWO-PRONGED MODE OF ACTION OF ANTIBODY DEPENDENT CELLULAR CYTO TOXICITY AND ANTIBODY DEPENDENT PHAGOCYTOSIS TO FIGHT CANCER INDEED THIS DUAL MODE OF ACTION IS DIFFERENTIATED FROM OTHER RNA CELL TARGETED APPROACHES AS THESE SPECIFICALLY ACTIVATE NK CELLS ONLY RNA CELL ENGAGERS WORK AT LOW EXPRESSION LEVELS THE POTENCY IS THUS INDEPENDENT OF THE SURFACE TARGET EXPRESSION AND YOU SEE THIS WE CONTINUE IN SLIDE SIX WITH AFM13 WE LEARNED THAT THERE IS A BROAD RANGE OF CELL LINES THAT EXPRESS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TUMOR ANTIGEN AND WE HAVE NOT OBSERVED ANY DEPENDENCY OF TARGET EXPRESSION TO THE POTENCY OF THE MOLECULE THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR AFM24 AND THE ANTI- BMCA ENGAGERS PRE-CLINICALLY BOTH MOLECULES HAVE SHOWN HIGH POTENCY ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF EGFR AND BCMA SURFACE EXPRESSION INCLUDING AT LOW TARGET EXPRESSION LEVELS THIS IMPLIES THAT MORE PATIENTS COULD RESPOND TO TREATMENT WITH AN INNATE CELL ENGAGER VERSUS AND ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE OR ADC IF THE MECHA- MECHANISM OF ADCS HAVE BEEN SHOWN ONLY TO RELY ON CERTAIN LEVELS OF TARGET ANTIGEN THEREBY MISSING THOSE TUMOR CELLS WITH EXPRESSION LEVELS BELOW THE ABILITY OF THE ADC TO BIND TO TARGET CELLS AS WE MOVE ON TO SLIDE SEVEN AND REPORT ON THE SAFETY FRONT PRE-CLINICALLY OUR INNATE CELL ENGAGERS DEMONSTRATE LOW CYTOKINE RELEASE SOME EXAMPLES OF THIS ARE THE IND-ENABLING TOXICOLOGY STUDY IN CYNO MONKEYS WHICH CONSISTENTLY SHOWED NO MEANINGFUL INCREASES IN SER- SERUM CYTOKINES FOR EXAMPLE AT THE JUNE VIRTUAL ASCR CONFERENCE A PRE-CLINICAL POSTER PRESENTATION ON THE RO729 MOLECULE WITH GENENTECH SHOWED POTENT CELL KILLING IN TUMOR CELL LINES EMPLOYING NK CELLS THAT ARE TETRA CELLS WITH MINIMAL INCREASE IN CYTOKINES ALSO A FOUR WEEK SAFETY STUDY IN CYNO MONKEYS SHOWED A FAVORABLE SAFETY PROFILE WITH NO CYTOKINE RELEASE OR ADVERSE FINDING AT THE 15 1-5 AND 50 SO 5-0 MIXED <INAUDIBLE> TESTED DOSE LEVELS AND IN THE CASE OF A AFM24 ONLY A TRANSIENT INCREASE IN ALL SIX WAS OBSERVED BUT WAS FULLY REVERSIBLE WITHIN 24 HOURS BUT NO SIGNS OF CYTOKINE RELEASE WAS OBSERVED THAT WOULD LEAD ONE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A RISK OF A CYTOKINE STORM IN PATIENTS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE IS THAT NONE OF THE CLINICAL STUDIES OF AFM13 HAVE REVEALED ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SERUM CYTOKINES THESE DATA INDICATED THAT OUR ICES HAVE A TOLERABLE AND GOOD SAFETY PROFILE TAKEN ALL TOGETHER THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT OUR INNATE CELL ENGAGERS ARE POTENT ABLE TO ENGAGE AT LOW LEVELS OF ANTIGEN EXPRESSION AND HAVE THUS FAR DEMONSTRATED A GOOD AND TOLERABLE SAFETY PROFILE NOW IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MOLECULES IN ADDITION TO CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AS MONOTHERAPIES WE ARE ALSO PURSUING COMBINATIONS WITH NATURAL KILLER CELLS AND OTHER TREATMENTS SUCH AS CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS SUCH AS PD-1 AND PDL-1 UH WE GO TO SLIDE EIGHT AND FIRST LET ME COMMENT ON OUR COMBINATION APPROACH WITH NK CELLS UH AS YOU SEE ON THE SLIDE THERE IS EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT HIGH NK CELL NUMBERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER OUTCOMES FOR EXAMPLE PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC CUTANEOUS MELANOMA HAVE IMPROVED SURVIVAL RATES IF THEIR TUMORS SHOW EVIDENCE OF NK CELL INFILTRATION WE ALSO KNOW THAT PATIENTS WITH DIFFUSED LARGE B-CELL AND FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMAS TREATED WITH ANTI-CD20 ANTIBODIES THAT HAVE LOW PERIPHERAL NK COUNTS TEND TO HAVE POOR SURVIVAL WE ARE SEEING THAT ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN TREATING PATIENTS IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF NK CELLS SO WE'RE WORKING ON SUPPLEMENTING NK CELLS THROUGH ADOPTIVE TRANSFER AND ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING DIFFERENT APPROACHES AS YOU CAN SEE ON SLIDE NINE AS WE GO TO SLIDE 10 AND AS DISCUSSED EARLIER THE IMPROVED TUMOR KILL- CELL KILLING BY LOADING NK CELLS WITH OUR ICES AS YOU SEE ON THE GRAPH FOR IN VITRO DATA ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF SLIDE 10 IT WILL BE INVESTIGATED IN THE MD ANDERSON PHASE ONE STUDY IN CD30 POSITIVE RECURRENT OR REFRACTORY HODGKIN AND NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA PATIENTS THE PRE-CLINICAL DATA THAT WE SHARED HERE OR THAT WE SHARED BEFORE LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN EXPECT TO SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE EFFICACY OF IN- INNATE CELL ENGAGER AFM13 THROUGH THE ADDITION OF NK CELLS AND ENCOURAGED BY THE SYNERGISTIC POTENTIAL OF COMBINING OUR ICES WITH NK CELLS AND CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE OPPORTUNITY ON OUR DEVELOPING CLINICAL PLANS FOR THESE COMBINATIONS WITH AFM24 UH FINALLY LET ME JUST BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE RECENT POSTERS PRESENTED AT ASCR AS A REMINDER OUR AFRM24 POSTER DEMONSTRATED ITS DISTINCT MECHANISM OF ACTION DIFFERENT FROM OTHER EGFR SIGNALING INHIBITION APPROACHES POTENTIALLY A- ABLE TO UH PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF CANCER PATIENTS AND IN THE CASE OF THE JOINT POSTER WITH GENENTECH THE PRE-CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND SAFETY OF THE BCMA-CD16A INNATE CELL ENGAGER SHOWS POTENT CELL KILLING IN TUMOR CELL LINES EMPLOYING NK CELLS AS EFFECTOR CELLS MINIMAL INCREASE IN CYTOKINES SUGGESTING A LOW RISK OF CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME UH WE HOPE THIS BACKGROUND WAS HELPFUL FOR YOU AND I WILL NOW TURN THE CALL OVER TO ANGUS TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF AND PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE FINANCIALS ANGUS THANK YOU ARNDT BEFORE OUR FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS LET ME JUST SAY THAT I AM THRILLED TO HAVE JOINED AFFIMED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR TEAM TO DELIVER SOME PROMISE OF OUR EXCITING <INAUDIBLE> TURNING TO THE RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER AFFIMED'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS AS ISSUED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD BOARD FOR IASB THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN EUROS WHICH IS THE COMPANY'S FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY THEREFORE ALL FINANCIAL NUMBERS THAT I WILL PRESENT IN THIS CALL UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED WILL BE IN EUROS WE ENDED THE SECOND QUARTER WITH CASH CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS OF $92.6 MILLION EUROS COMPARED TO $104.1 MILLION EUROS ON DECEMBER 31ST 2019 DURING THE QUARTER WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $20.8 MILLION EUROS UNDER OUR AT THE MARKET OR ATM PROGRAM BASED ON OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLAN AND ASSUMPTIONS WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CASH CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS WILL SUPPORT OPERATIONS INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 2022 NET CASH USE AND OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30TH 2020 WAS $15 MILLION EUROS COMPARED TO $5.6 MILLION EUROS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 THE SECOND QUARTER 2019 NET CASH USE AND OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED A MILESTONE PAYMENT TO THE COMPANY FROM THE GENENTECH COLLABORATION TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 WAS $2.9 MILLION EUROS COMPARED WITH $4 MILLION EUROS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 REVENUE IN 2020 AND 2019 PREDOMINANTLY RELATES TO GENENTECH COLLABORATION REVENUE FROM THE GENENTECH COLLABORATION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 WAS COMPRISED OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH SERVICES PERFORMED- PERFORMED DURING THE QUARTER RND EXPENSES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 WERE $11.7 MILLION EUROS COMPARED TO $11.5 MILLION EUROS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 EXPENSES IN 2020 RELATE PREDOMINANTLY TO OUR AFM13 AND AMF24 CLINICAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS TO OUR EARLY STAGE DEVELOPMENT AND DISCOVERY ACTIVITIES TNA EXPENSES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER 2020 FOR $2.6 MILLION EUROS COMPARED TO $2.3 MILLION EUROS IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO 2019 THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER STOCK COMPLIANCE COSTS LEGAL CONSULTING AND AUDIT COSTS NET LOSS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 WAS $12.2 MILLION EUROS OR 16 CENTS PER COMMON SHARE COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $10.3 MILLION EUROS OR 17 CENTS PER COMMON SHARE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 THE WEIGHTED NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR QUARTER ENDED JUNE 20TH 2020 WERE $79.2 MILLION I WILL NOW TURN THE CALL BACK TO ADI ADI THANK YOU ANGUS UM AS YOU CAN SEE FROM OUR PRESENTATION UH TODAY UH WE'RE TAKING UH ADVANTAGE OF UH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE GAINED IN THE FIELD OF INNATE IMMUNITY AND ARE APPLYING IT TO OUR PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD UH THIS EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS SOMETHING THAT IF YOU NEED TO ESTABLISH THAT UM AFFIMED AND IS UH HELPING US IN GUIDING THE DESIGN OF UH UNIQUE THERAPIES WHICH NOW HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS VERY DIFFERENT UH KIND OF UH CANCERS I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT HERE THAT UH THE EGFR IS EXPRESSED IN UH MORE THAN 10 TUMORS AND THAT GIVES US A LOT OF UH OPTIONALITY UH HOW TO TAKE THIS UH MOLECULE FORWARD WE ARE PLEASE WITH HOW THINGS ARE MOVING FORWARD FOR BOTH OUR CLINICAL AND PRE-CLINICAL PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY IN THE UH CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OUR PRE-CLINICAL PROGRAMS ARE ON TRACK AFM13 AND 24 ARE MOVING FORWARD ACCORDING TO PLAN AND GENENTECH IS MOVING THINGS FORWARD WITH THE ANTI- BCMA CD16A INNATE CELL ENGAGER WHAT ARE OUR INFLECTION POINTS FOR THE NEXT UH ONE AND HALF YEARS FOR AFM13 WE'VE MENTIONED THAT UH WE WANT TO PRESENT THE INTERIM DATA IN PERIPHERAL T-CELL LYMPHOMA AROUND UH MIDDLE OF UH NEXT YEAR WE'VE BEEN UH SUCCESSFUL IN OUR COLLABORATION WITH MD ANDERSON MOVING FORWARD THE COMBINATION OF UH AMF13 AND UH <INAUDIBLE> NATURAL KILLER CELLS UH AS WE SAID UH WE ARE READY TO START OR MD ANDERSON IS READY TO START AND WE HOPE TO REPORT FIRST PATIENT IN AND WE WILL PROVIDE UPDATES UH AS WE MOVE FORWARD FOR AFM24 WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF UH THOSE ESCALATIONS IN ORDER TO GENERATE SAFETY AND UH ACTIVITY DATA UH THIS IS QUITE EXCITING FOR US BECAUSE IT'S A DRUG WITH A VERY DIFFERENTIATED PROFILE AS PROFILE AS COMPARED TO THE UH LMOATS CURRENTLY USED IN TARGETING UH EFG RECEPTORS NOW WITH THE DOSE ESCALATION AND UH ESTABLISHING THE SAFETY UH WE OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE THE RECOMMENDED PHASE TWO DOSE UH COMING UP IN ORDER TO THEN DO THE DOSE COHORT EXPANSIONS BUT AS WE HAVE MENTIONED UH EARLIER AS WELL AS THE PLANNING EARLY ON TO MOVE FORWARD INTO COMBINATIONS UH WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE PROGRESS IN THE GENENTECH UH COLLABORATION UH WE'VE JUST PROVIDED THE NEXT UPDATE FOR THE BCMA-CD16A ENGAGER WE HAVE MULTIPLE OTHER PROGRAMS ONGOING AND IF THINGS GO WELL PENDING ON PROGRAM PROGRESSION- UM PROGRESSION WE CAN BRING IN UH ADDITIONAL MILESTONES AND FOR OUR NEWEST ADDITIONS TO THE PIPELINE UH WITH UH AFM28 AND AFM32 WE ARE SORTING <INAUDIBLE> ENABLING STUDIES SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN- AN ID FILING FIRST FOR UM AFM28 FINALLY BEFORE WE OPEN THE SESSION FOR Q AND A I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OUR EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION AND EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE MY GRATITUDE IN PARTICULAR FOR OUR INVESTIGATORS AND THE CLINICAL SITES THE PATIENTS AND- AND ALL THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR INVESTORS WHO ARE SUPPORTING US IN OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THESE INNOVATIVE UH TREATMENTS FOR CANCER PATIENTS IT IS THROUGH THE COMBINED EFFORT OF UH ALL OF YOU THAT KEEPS US ON THE PATH OF UH DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION UH I'M NOW HAPPY TO CLOSE THE PRESENTATION AND WE'RE OPEN NOW FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE WILL NOW BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION AS A REMINDER SHOULD YOU WISH TO ASK A QUESTION YOU NEED TO PRESS STAR AND ONE ON THE TELEPHONE AND WAIT FOR YOUR NAME TO BE ANNOUNCED IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOU CAN JUST PRESS THE POUND OR HASH KEY ONCE AGAIN IT'S STAR AND ONE FOR QUESTIONS FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF MURRAY <UNK> FROM <INAUDIBLE> GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UH CONGRATS ON THE PROGRESS AND UH THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS UM TO START OFF JUST WONDERING FOR AFM24 I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH YOU CAN SAY ON THIS BUT JUST WONDERING IF BOTH PATIENTS IN COHORT TWO HAVE BEEN DOSED AND UM IF YOU CAN TALK MORE UH ABOUT THE- THE TIMING OF DOSING BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH THE FOUR SITES ACTIVATED CAN YOU PROVIDE ANY MORE PERSPECTIVE ABOUT ENROLLMENT PACE GOING FORWARD ANDREAS CAN YOU TAKE THE QUESTION PLEASE UH YEAH SO THERE- THERE WILL- THERE WERE MULTIPLE PARTS OF THE QUESTIONS I HOPE I GOT THEM ALL UM SO WE FACE ONE STUDY AFM 24 UM AS WE SAID WE ARE UH RECRUITING IN THE SECOND COHORT UM WE HAVE NOT YET DISCLOSED HOW MANY PATIENTS UM BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A STANDARD UH THREE BY THREE DESIGN UM WITH- WITH A <INAUDIBLE> UH DOSE MODIFICATION UH BUT WHAT THAT'S- BASICALLY WHAT IT IS UM IN TERMS OF TIMING BETWEEN THE PATIENTS UH THERE IS A MANDATORY EIGHT DAY WAITING PERIOD UH BETWEEN PATIENTS UH SO THEY CANNOT BE TREATED ALL AT THE SAME TIME BUT WILL BE STAGGERED WITH EIGHT DAY INTERVALS AND THERE WAS ANOTHER PART OF THE QUESTION AROUND THE FOUR PARTICIPATING SITES SORRY YEAH JUST WONDERING IF YOU CAN PROVIDE ANY MORE PERSPECTIVE ABOUT UH ENROLLMENT PACE GOING FORWARD UH YEAH CURRENTLY THE ENROLLMENT UH PACE IS UH AS PRE-SPECIFIED BY THE PROTOCOL UH SO ALL SITES ARE VERY ACTIVE IN SCREENING PATIENTS AND AS WE SAID ALL PATIENTS- ALL SITES HAVE ALREADY CONTRIBUTED PATIENTS GOT IT OKAY GREAT AND THEN ALSO FOR AFM24 UM JUST CHECKING IF YOU CAN SAY MORE ABOUT THE TUMOR TYPES THAT THEY'RE SCREENING FOR THE STUDY AND IF YOU CAN ALSO PROVIDE MORE PERSPECTIVE INTO THE- THE CHECKPOINT INHIBITOR AND- AND COMBO PLANS AT THIS POINT UM SO FOR THE UH TUMOR TYPES UH IN THE DOES ESCALATION PART UH WE ARE ACCEPTING ALL UH PATIENTS WITH ALL- ALL HISTOLOGIES THAT ARE EGFR EXPRESSING AND UH WHERE THE PATIENT HAS EXHAUSTED THE RESPECTED STANDARD OF CARE TREATMENTS AS ADI MENTIONED THIS IS A WIDE VARIETY OF POTENTIAL TUMORS UH PROBABLY THE TWO MOST PREVALENT TUMORS WOULD BE COLORECTAL CANCER AND NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER AND UH THESE ARE THE TWO HIST OLOGIES WHERE WE WOULD EXPECT PROBABLY THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS IN THE PHASE ONE UH HAVING SAID THAT UH THE DOSE ESCALATION PART WOULD UH ALSO BE OPEN FOR OTHER EGFR EXPRESSING TUMORS LIKE UH FOR EXAMPLE HEAD AND NECK CANCER GASTRIC CANCER OR- OR OTHER SOLID TUMORS NOW ONCE WE HAVE DEFINED OUR DOSE UH LIMITING TOXICITIES OR IF THERE ARE NO DOES LIMITING TOXICITIES WE HAVE DEFINED RECOMMEND PHASE TWO DOSE UH WE WILL ENROLL INTO UH TUMOR SPECIFIC EXPANSION COHORTS UM AND THESE EXPANSION COHORTS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF BEING DEFINED NOW FOR OUR PD-1 COMBINATION PLANS UM BASED ON THE INTERESTING DATA WE HAVE SEEN WITH PD-1 IN COMBINATION WITH AFM13 WHICH AREN'T REFERRED TO UH WITH THE UH VERY ENCOURAGING COMPLETE RESPONSE RATE UH IN EXCESS OF 40% UH WE PLAN TO HAVE A COMBINATION WITH THE PD-1 OR A PDL-1 INHIBITOR OPEN RATHER SOON PROBABLY UH IN PARALLEL TO THE LAST COHORT OF THE DOSE ESCALATION OF THE SINGLE AGENT STUDIES SO IT WOULD BE MORE OR LESS A PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING RIGHT NOW GREAT OKAY THANKS FOR THE ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS MURRAY WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO OUR NEXT QUESTION NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF UH JIM <UNK> FROM LOS <UNK> PLEASE GO AHEAD JIM YEAH HI GUYS AND CONGRATS ON ALL THE PROGRESS UM MAYBE JUST A FIRST QUICK QUESTION FOR ANGUS UH TO START HIM OFF COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH REVENUES IS THAT EXPECTED TO BE A STABLE NUMBER BETWEEN YOU KNOW A THREE TO FOUR MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL OR IS THERE ANY REASON THAT MIGHT GO UP AS- AS PROGRAMS PROGRESS AND AS WE THINK ABOUT THE MILESTONE THAT GOT PAID IN THE THIRD QUARTER IS IT A SIMPLE MATTER TO BACK OUT THE ASSUMPTIONS AROUND COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH REVENUES AND THAT'LL GIVE US SOME SENSE OF THE MILESTONE UH GIVEN THAT YOU CAN'T SAY IT EXPLICITLY YEAH YEAH THANKS JIM FOR THE QUESTION AND SO YOU KNOW OUR- OUR- OUR REVENUE NUMBERS FLUCTUATE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER YOU KNOW BASED PRIMARILY ON THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT WE'RE- THAT WE'RE WORKING ON UM THE- THE VARIOUS GENENTECH PROGRAMS UM THAT ARE IN PROGRESS UM I MEAN YOU CAN SEE JUST LOOKING BACK AT THE LAST SEVERAL QUARTERS WE'VE BEEN YOU KNOW FAIRLY- FAIRLY RANGE- RANGE BOUND AND COSTS US UH $2 MILLION TO $5 MILLION ZONE YOU KNOW WHEN SEE INCREASES SPECIFICALLY AS A RESULT OF <INAUDIBLE> TIME MILESTONE PAYMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED SO UM YOU KNOW THIS- THIS MILESTONE PAYMENT UM THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY UM THAT WILL- THAT WE'LL GET IN THE THIRD QUARTER UM WILL- WILL LIKELY INCREASE OUR REVENUE IN A- IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND THAT WILL BE SORT OF AN ADD ON TO THE- TO THE RANGE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL QUARTERS AND BACK AGAIN KIND OF TO THE- TO THE $5 MILLION DOLLARS 2 2 OR TO THE $5 MILLION EUROS RATHER GOT IT OKAY OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL AND THEN MAYBE JUST ON UM COHORT ONE FOR AFM24 AND WHAT WE MIGHT LEARN FROM THAT COHORT UM CAN YOU REMIND US IF YOU'RE DOING PRE AND POST BIOPSIES AND WHAT KIND OF TRANSLATIONAL WORK YOU MIGHT BE DOING AND HOW THAT MIGHT INFORM YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO RECRUIT UM INNATE CELLS TO THE TUMOR SITE YEAH UM SO IN THE UH DOSE ESCALATION PART UM WE DO A PRE TREATMENT BIOPSY UH POST OR ON-TREATMENT BIOPSIES ARE OPTIONAL UH WE DO HAVE UH SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIVE SCIENCE PROGRAM LOOKING AT UH PERIPHERAL ACTIVATION MARKERS OF NK CELLS AS WELL AS UM A CYTOKINE PROFILES UH ONCE WE ARE IN THE EXPANSION OF PHASE SO WE ARE RECRUITING INTO TUMOR SPECIFIC COHORTS I THINK THIS IS UH THE PART WHERE WE WILL GET MOST OF THE CORRELATIVE SCIENCE AS WE HAVE MORE HOMOGENOUS PATIENT POPULATION UH WE MAINTAIN OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A PRE-TREATMENT BIOPSY AND UH WILL HAVE POST OR ON-TREATMENT BIOPSIES IN SELECTED COHORTS AND THEN JUST YOU KNOW GIVEN THE COMMENTS ON THE VARIABILITY IN PERIPHERAL NK CELL UH POPULATIONS UM IS THERE ANY SENSE IN SCREENING PATIENTS FOR THEIR NK CELL LEVELS UM GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW PATIENTS WHO SCREEN LOW MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE NK CELLS OR MACROPHAGES TO RECRUIT OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE WITHIN THE VARIABILITY OF INNATE CELL UM IN THE BLOOD THAT- THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND IT'S NOT WORTH SCREENING FOR THAT VARIABLE UH I THINK CURRENTLY IT WOULD BE UH PREMATURE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN WITH- WITH SCREENING SO WE ARE DEFINITELY DETERMINING THE UH LEVELS OF CIRCULATING NK CELLS AND ALSO LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THEIR <INAUDIBLE> I THINK WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO DEFINE A CUTOFF OR A THRESHOLD AND THIS MAY VERY WELL VARY BETWEEN UH TUMOR HIST OLOGIES AND ALSO BE DEPENDENT ON UH THE <INAUDIBLE> OF NK CELLS IN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT UH THE VARIABLE WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR AFM13 UH COLUMBIA STUDY TO HAVE SOME IMPACT ON- ON THE LIKELIHOOD TO RESPONSE OF- OF PATIENTS SO I THINK IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM WE WILL BE OPEN FOR ALL COMERS WE WILL ASSESS ALL OF THESE IMPORTANT BIOMARKERS AND THEN BASED ON THE ACTIVITY DATA AND THE READOUT WE ARE SEEING WE MAY MODIFY THE PROGRAM DEFINING CERTAIN THRESHOLDS BUT CURRENTLY I THINK IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO DO THAT AND MAYBE JUST A FINAL QUESTION JUST UM THE MD ANDERSON COLLABORATION IS FOCUSED ON CORE-BLOOD DERIVED UM NK CELLS IS THERE ANY THOUGHT TO OTHER NK CELL SOURCES INCLUDING UM POTENTIALLY IPFC NK CELLS UM ADI YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS QUESTION OR SHOULD I TAKE IT NO WELL I- ANDREAS WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD <LAUGH> OKAY UH YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT CORE-BLOOD DERIVED NK CELLS IS ONE SOURCE OF NK CELLS AND IF YOU UH WATCH THE FIELD OF NK CELL UM BASED APPROACHED ESPECIALLY THE- THE- THE FIELD AROUND COMPANIES AND INSTITUTES UM PROVIDING DIFFERENT SOURCES OF NK CELLS THERE IS DEFINITELY UH SPEED PICKING UP AND UH THERE IS A VARIETY OF- OF OPTIONS TO- TO LOOK AT AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO NOT ONLY FROM OUR SITE BUT WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED UH PROACTIVE INQUIRIES OF UH POTENTIAL UM WORKING MODELS TO GATHER SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE NK UH CELL FIELD AND THEN EVALUATING VARIOUS OPTIONS THERE GREAT THANKS FOR TAKING THE QUESTIONS GUYS MAY- MAYBE AS A BRIEF COMMENT WE SEE THIS UM CORE-BLOOD DERIVED NK CELLS ALREADY QUITE ADVANCED AND CHEMICALLY RELEVANT SO THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN UH MANY PATIENTS WELL WITH IPSC CURRENTLY UM THERE IS STILL A UM THE <INAUDIBLE> TO BE DETERMINED AND UH OBVIOUSLY IN COMBINATION WITH LEARNING MORE ON THE FUNCTIONALITIES SO THIS IS UH SOMEWHAT UH IN UH TO US ON HOW FUNCTIONAL AN IPSC DERIVED VERSUS A PERIPHERAL NK CELL AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE THE FIRST CLINICAL DATA SO WE'RE QUITE UH UH NOT ONLY HAPPY BUT WE'VE- WE'VE CHECKED SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AT THE MOMENT FOR NK CELLS AND WE ARE INDEED VERY CONVINCED ABOUT UH THE ACTIVITY OF THE CORE-BLOOD DERIVED CELLS FROM UH MD ANDERSON GREAT THANKS ADI THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF IKE <INAUDIBLE> FROM BMO CAPITAL THE LINE IS NOW OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY GOOD MORNING GENTLEMEN THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS THIS IS E.K. ALLEN FOR <UNK> UH JUST A COUPLE REGARDING THE BCMA ENGAGER UM I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU PROBABLY LINKED TO THIS ABILITY ON THE ENTIRETY OF THE CLINICAL DEVELOPED PATHWAY UH BUT IF YOU COULD PROVIDE ANY TYPE OF INSIGHT IN TERMS OF WHAT GENENTECH UH KIND OF HAS PLANNED MAYBE IN TERMS OF COULD THEY POTENTIALLY PURSUE AN ACCELERATED PATHWAY UM FOR THE ASSETS AND SECONDLY UH AGAIN YOU'RE- YOU DON'T PROVIDE UH COMPLETE DETAILS ON THE EXACT MILESTONE PAYMENTS BUT IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US SOME ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THE FUTURE MILESTONES UH FOR THE ASSET MIGHT HOLD UM IN TERMS OF UH YOU KNOW PHASE TWO PHASE THREE THINGS OF THAT SORT UH SHOULD WE EXPECT INCREASING SIZE OF VALUE FOR EACH MILESTONE PAYMENT UH THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US THANKS ADI MAYBE I TAKE THE QUESTION FOR THE PATHWAY AND THEN HAND OVER TO YOU FOR THE MILESTONES YES PLEASE GO AHEAD ARNDT SO YEAH THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN AS YOU ALREADY CORRECTLY SAY WE CANNOT REALLY SPEAK IN DETAIL FOR GENENTECH BUT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU I THINK YOU'RE AWARE OF COURSE UM LICENSING THIS MOLECULE WAS A BIG PART OF THE DEAL WITH GE- GENENTECH THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY EXCITED ABOUT THE STRONG DIFFERENTIATION POTENTIAL OF THE MOLECULE ALSO DEMONSTRATED AT ASCR AT THE- AT THE POSTER JUST TO REVIEW AGAIN THE VERY STRONG UH PRE-CLINICAL CELL KILLING SELECTIVE NO CYTOKINE RELEASE VERY GOOD SAFETY PROFILE AND GOOD PHARMACODYNAMIC MARKER SPECIFIC BCMA UH SPECIFIC PLASMA CELL KILLING IN THE CYNO MONKEY SO YOU KNOW DESPITE THE ALSO RECENT APPROVALS OF THE YOU KNOW THE INCO- THE FIRST INCOMERS IN THE SPACE UM I WOULD THINK- SAY THAT GENENTECH SHARES OUR EXCITEMENT WITH THE DIFFERENTIATION POTENTIAL AND WAIT FOR A POTENTIALLY BEST IN CLASS MOLECULE MAYBE I- I'LL LEAVE IT THERE I THINK IT'S- IT'S A- IT'S A CLEARLY UM UH STRONGLY CLINICALLY VALIDATED SPACE AND I THINK THIS MOLECULE WILL ENABLE UH GENENTECH AND WE AS WE ARE PARTNERED TO YOU KNOW HAVE A STRONG POSITION IN THE SPACE UH YEAH REGARDING THE FINANCIALS SO UH I JUST WANNA RECALL THE DEAL UH WHEN IT WAS SIGNED SO WE RECEIVED $96 MILLION IN UPFRONT CASH AND UH A UH AND CAN GET THE TOTAL OF UH MORE THAN $5 BILLION IN MILESTONES THAT UH ARE D- DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO THERE ARE UH PRECLIN- THERE'S A PRE-CLINICAL MILESTONES PAYMENTS THERE ARE INDEED MULTIPLE CLINICAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS REGULATORY AND SALES MILESTONES AND ON TOP WE CAN RECEIVE ROYALTIES WHICH AS WE DESCRIBED ARE ON THE UH HIGHER END OF WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FOR THE EARLY NATURE OF THE UM LICENSE UH AGREEMENT UH BEYOND THAT WE AREN'T ABLE TO DISCLOSE ANY FURTHER DETAILS UH UNLESS UH GENENTECH WOULD ALLOW US OR ROCHE WOULD ALLOW US TO DO SO UH USUALLY THAT'S JUST A GENERAL STATEMENT THAT'S UH THAT THE PAYMENTS WILL INCREASE THE FURTHER THE PROGRAM PROGRESSES OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT AND JUST ONE MORE QUICK QUESTIONS UH I THINK I MIGHT HAVE MISHEARD IT THIS IS IN REGARDS TO AFM24 UH I BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS A PATIENT UH THAT HAD INCREASED IL6 CYTOKINE LEVELS THAT WOULD RESOLVE OVER 24 HOURS UH JUST CURIOUS WAS THAT SELF-RESOLVING OR WAS THAT- DID THAT PATIENT RECEIVE AND UH IL6 INHIBITOR YEAH I CAN- THANKS FOR BRINGING THAT UP FOR VERIFICATION SO THE TRANSIENT UH IL6 INCREASE WAS REPORTED IN THE <INAUDIBLE> ENABLING CYNO TOX STUDY WHAT YOU- YOU REFERRED TO THE ASCR POSTER INDEED WE SAW THAT WITH THE DOSING A KIND OF MODERATE PEAK THAT QUICKLY WENT DOWN WAS COMPLETELY RESOLVED UH WITHOUT ANY- ANY TREATMENT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW ONE DOESN'T DO THAT IN THE BECAUSE THIS IS CYNO TOX STUDY AND AGAIN WHEN WE SEE THIS IN THE CONTEXT BECAUSE IT WAS TRANSIENT AND FULLY REVERSED LEADS US TO THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH OF COURSE WILL BE LOOKED AT CAREFULLY IN PATIENTS THAT UM WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT ANY KIND OF UH CYTOKINE RELEASE UH SYNDROME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION SURE AND THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF YU-JEN FROM <INAUDIBLE> PLEASE GO AHEAD THE LINE NOW OPEN HELLO YES HI CAN YOU HEAR HI YES SORRY UH MY HEADSET FALL OUT UH THANKS FOR TAKING THE QUESTIONS MY FIRST QUESTION IS THAT FOR THE AFM13 IN THE UH FOR THE REGISTRATION STUDY THAT UH IT'S ASSIGNMENT TO UH SETUP SO UH WHAT MIGHT BE THE THRESHOLD OF <INAUDIBLE> IN THE 40 PATIENTS SO THE INTERIM READOUT BEFORE YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD SO JUST CURIOUS TO WHAT <INAUDIBLE> AND REVIEW ON THAT FRONT UH I'M AFRAID WE CANNOT GIVE A UH CONCRETE RESPONSE RATE IT'S BASED ALSO ON THE PATIENT DESIGN SO THERE IS SOME INTERDEPENDENCE OF RESPONSE RATES BUT UH WE USUALLY DO NOT DISCLOSE THRESHOLDS BUT IT'S A CLASSICAL ASSIGNMENT TWO-STAGE DESIGN OKAY NO PROBLEM AND- AND ALSO JUST CURIOUS IN TERMS OF AFM24 THAT UH YOU ARE DOSE ESCALATING UH AT LEAST BASED ON UH INTERIM DATA IS THERE ANY THOUGHT WHERE- WHEN YOU MIGHT START TO SEE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVE DOSE TO START UH I THINK CURRENTLY IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT UH WHEN WE WILL HAVE THE OPTIMAL UH BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE DOSE UM AS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF- OF CO VARIANTS LIKE BINDING SITES FOR CD16 BINDING SITES FOR EGFR AND THEN DISTRIBUTION UM AND AS YOU KNOW THE- THE ANIMAL MODELS ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO TRANSLATE UM THE RELEVANT TOX SPECIES AND YOU HAVE TO <INAUDIBLE> THAT THERE'S ONLY A TOX SPECIES OF THE CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY UH HOWEVER WE DO NOT HAVE ANY UH CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY TUMOR MODELS AVAILABLE SO UH WE CANNOT REALLY BRIDGE BETWEEN UH WHAT WE SEE IN THE TOXICOLOGY STUDIES AND THEN WHAT WE WOULD SEE IN TERMS OF EFFICACY FOR- FOR TUMORS SO IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT I WILL HAVE TO DEFINE IN OUR- IN OUR CLINICAL PROGRAM OKAY GREAT MAYBE WHAT- UH THINKING OF ONE LAST- ONE LAST QUESTION HERE IS THAT UH IN TERMS OF ADAPTIVE UH NK CELL UH FROM CORE-BLOOD DERIVED NK CELLS UH IS FIRST OF ALL COULD THAT BE POTENTIALLY USED IN SOLID TUMOR AND UH ANY COMMENTS UH COMMENTS IN TERMS OF UH REGARDING THAT UH <INAUDIBLE> POSSIBILITY UH THIS IS AS ADI SAID SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING INTO UM WE'LL STARTING OUT WITH UH LYMPHOMAS OBVIOUSLY WITH AFM13 TARGETING CD30 BUT OUR VISION IS UH THAT ALSO FOR AMF24 WE WILL DEVELOP UH CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS IN COMBINATION WITH NK CELLS UH COULD BE CORE-BLOOD DERIVED NK CELLS COULD BE NK CELLS FROM ANOTHER SOURCE UH THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL DEFINE BUT THE INTENTION IS ALSO TO- TO HAVE A- HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE AFM24 WOULD BE PART THAT WAS UH EXOGENOUS NK CELLS OKAY GREAT THANKS I APPRECIATE IT AND CONGRATS FOR ALL THE PROGRESS UH THIS FAR THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME FOR CLOSING REMARKS WE GO TO OUR SPEAKERS UM YES THANK YOU AGAIN FOR UH LISTENING IN AND UH FOLLOWING OUR- OUR UPDATES UM THE- THE UH THE PROGRESS IS UH COMING SMOOTHLY ALONG DESPITE UH THAT UH WE ARE AFFECTED UH BY- BY COVID WE HAVE STRENGTHENED THE TEAM SIGNIFICANTLY IN ORDER TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES UH THAT MAY RELATE TO THE UH CONDUCTANCE OF THESE UH CLINICAL TRIALS OR UH TO THE UH UH INTERACTIONS WITH THE- WITH THE SPECIFIC UH SITES SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO UH THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS UH ANY OF THE ISSUE THAT HAVE UH BEEN ARISING AND I DID WANT TO THANK AGAIN UH THE ENTIRE TEAM HERE AT AFFIMED FOR UH MANAGING ALL THIS THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT UH TIMES UH WE'RE QUITE EXCITED UH THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD UH THESE PROGRAMS EITHER AS MONO THERAPIES AND NOW LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF UH OF COMBINATION IF YOU'VE HEARD WE FOCUS ON NATURAL KILLER CELLS AND CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS IN PARTICULAR SO PD-1S OR PDL-1S SO WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE UH WITH THE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS ADDRESSING DIFFERENT TARGETS WE CAN PROVIDE A CADENCE OF DATA OVER THE NEXT UH QUARTER AND UH AND

Advancing our science and moving our pipeline forward are beginning to yield data that demonstrate the long-term potential of our innovative approaches and products. Covid nineteen continues to affect societies around the world. we hope that you and your families are well and safe. we are observing some impact by covid nineteen on the progress of our clinical studies. however, at last time, we were taking great efforts to Minimize them as a result, we have been able to continue our progress on the clinical studies of afm thirteen in peripheral t cell lymphoma and of afm twenty four in each if r positive tumors and which is very exciting for us, genetic dose the first patient with r o seven two nine seven o nine which as you remember is the bcma cd sixteen a in scl cell engager. We are also making good progress on our preclinical pipeline for our lead candidate afm 313 our study in patients who have relapsed or refractory peripheral t cell lymphoma in exhausted available standard of care treatments are now being treated with afm 313 as a single agent we are executing according to our development timelines and as previously stated expect to complete the predetermined interim analysis in mid twenty. Twenty one we are also looking at options to enhance afm thirteen's efficacy beyond monotherapy. the first of these options is the combination with allogeneic k cells in a study that is conducted at the m d anderson cancer institute and on i s t m d anderson website now shows that the study is enrolling but the initiation is impacted by the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic in texas a first Than the study is expected as soon as the situation improves for amf twenty four we disclosed that we have completed the first cohort of our dose escalation study without any dose limiting toxicities and we're currently recruiting into the second dose cohort we have all four planned sites active and recruiting following the completion of the dose escalation study Phase of the study we have the option to enroll patients into tumor-specific expansion cohorts where we will look for single-agent activity in a number of well-defined tumor types. in addition, we're planning to initiate combination studies with checkpoint inhibitors and we will be providing updates as the program continues to make progress. we're very pleased with the continued progress in our collaboration with genentech. importantly, the phase one clinical trial is With the bcma c d sixteen na in engager is now enrolling patients. this achievement represents the third inna engager to enter the clinic and triggers a milestone payment to us during the third quarter in an amount that were not able to disclose last month, angus smith joined us as chief financial officer. angus will introduce himself later and discuss our financial position and the flexibility the ability provides us to continue to execute on our strategy and drive future growth of our company during the annual, annual meeting of shareholders which was held in august, were happy to report that all proposed agenda items were approved this includes the addition of dr. ana lisa jenkins and harry welton to the supervisory board as new members ana lisa is a visionary leader who knows how to translate ideas into action Mines from bench to bedside and harry is an accomplished financial executive who will help drive value-creating strategies for the company these additions to the supervisory board further strengthen the company's industry know-how, experience, and diversity as it is as it has only been a month and a half since we last spoke, we thought we would focus today's discussion on company achievements thus far and what gives us confidence in our science up You on our programs and allow plenty of time for q and a to get it i will now hand over to a call to andreas hestrich, our chief medical correspondent to give you a brief update on our clinical stage programs andreas yeah, thank you adi for the introduction and thank you all for joining us today and i'm happy to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs that we made over the last Three months as you all are aware, covid nineteen pandemic is still present globally and it continues to pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment of patients the two guiding principles we are employing at afimed is to ensure patient safety on the studies and to ensure trial data integrity and this is in line, i think, with guidelines given From all competent authorities within this framework, however, the affymetrix team is very proactively working with all of our participating sites to make sure that our innovative treatment is still available for patients in need of new therapies and that we minimize the impact of covid nineteen to a minimum possible one important achievement in this regard is that we were we minimize the impact of covid nineteen to a minimum possible one important achievement in this regard is that we were we minimize the impact of covid nineteen to a minimum possible one important achievement in this regard is that we were we minimize the impact of covid nineteen to a minimum possible one important achievement in this regard is that we were we minimize the impact of covid nineteen to a minimum possible one important achievement in this regard is that we were we minimize Able to secure drug supply for all of our ongoing studies and can ensure uninterrupted treatment of all patients to go into more detail let's start with afm thirteen our most advanced program first as you know afm thirteen is in a registration directed phase two study afm thirteen two o two treating patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral t cell lymphoma who have exhausted all available standard of care options the enrollment into this study is at a steady state we were able to activate fifty four sites now contributing patients in ten countries around the globe as you know this study has a simon two stage design with a preplanned interim analysis after Forty patients in the p t s l cohorts and as ady said we are confident that we will have the data from this intra-analytic analysis available by the mid of next year there was also a third cohort or there is a third cohort in this study for patients with transformed mucocutaneous leishmaniasis so a cutaneous form of t cell lymphoma this third cohort with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis was never part and never will be INTENDED TO BE PART OF THE REGISTRATION PROGRAM IT WAS A PROOF OF CONCEPT COHORT ONLY AND FOR COVID NINETEEN RELATED RESTRICTIONS THE ENROLLMENT INTO THIS COHORT IS CURRENTLY ON HOLD AS ADY ALSO MENTIONED WE ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN OUR COLLABORATION WITH M D ANDERSON CANCER CENTER WHERE WE HAVE AN ACTIVE I N D FOR OUR FIRST PHASE ONE STUDY OF A F M THIRTEEN IN COMBINATION WITH Allogenic national killer cells as we have said the current status at the m d anderson web page is recruiting and we know that patients are currently screened and considered and we are expecting to the enrollment of the first patient as soon as covid nineteen related restrictions at m d anderson lift up now let's move to our second program a f m twenty four As you know, a bispecific tetravalent molecule targeting both c d sixteen a to activate national killer cells and macrophages and the e g f receptor on solid tumors. this compound is in a phase one dose escalation part of the one one study and we are happy to report that we were able to activate all four preplanned sites and all four preplanned sites are contributing. Excluding patients as we disclosed earlier, we have completed our cohort one without observing dose-limiting toxicities and are actively recruiting into dose cohort two. with this, i close the overview of the clinical progress and am happy to hand over to my colleague arun shortey, chief scientific officer who will review with you some Of our preclinical data that make us so excited about the opportunities that we can create for patients with ices and activating the innate immune system aren't please thank you andreas and thank you all for joining in the next few minutes i would like to summarize as andreas mentioned the preclinical and clinical data observed so far with our innate cell engagers providing evidence I intend that these molecules are potent and safe drug candidates i'll start by summarizing the data showing that our i s e s are potent molecules as you see on slide five if we take afm thirteen as an example afm thirteen has been shown to have strong single agent antitumor responses and t cell infoma with an overall response rate of fifty percent The molecule has also shown promising signs of broad clinical development potential in augmenting other i o therapies such as pd 1 inhibitors. for example, in the hutchinson kim former phase one b study we've seen an impressive overall response rate of eighty eight percent with a complete response rate of forty two and forty six percent in the local and central reed respectively. in the lower part of the slide we've also highlighted for you presentations of the studies past and in the future additionally our own experience and the work with andy anderson we've seen promising preclinical data showing that the combination with the adoptive transfer of k cells enhances the immune response of age-related thirteen leading to prolonged survival in the Effective mouse model and as we mentioned the phase one b studied andy anderson is now in the last stages of preparation if we go to slide six you see that in our preclinical studies with afm twenty four we saw potent killing of e g f r positive tumor cell lines mediated by two distinct mechanisms of action potent a d c or antibody dependent killing And cellular saturation toxicity is seen irrespective of the mutational status of the tumor cells and we see potent killing mediated by a d c p or any body dependent cellular phagocytosis in tumor cells with high and low e g of r expression importantly in cells bearing the kras g thirteen d mutation a f twenty four shows preserved killing potent killing of a d c p or phagocytosis whereas this ability is lost for established treatments for the anti b c m a c d sixteen or r o seven two nine formerly known as a f m twenty six molecule we also saw very good potency in syno monkeys whereas a dose dependent killing of b c m a positive plasma cells it was observed we believe that the observed improved potency is mediated by the dual mode of action of our approach the innate cell engagers are employing n k cells and macrophages to kill tumor cells and thus act via a two-pronged mode of action of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis to fight cancer in Indeed, this dual mode of action is differentiated from other nk cell-targeted approaches as these specifically activate nk cells only nk cell engagers work at low expression levels the potency is thus independent of the surface-targeted expression and you see this continued in slide six with aven and thirteen we learned that there is a The broad range of salines that express different levels of tumor antigens and we have not observed any dependence of target expression to the potency of the molecule. the same holds true for erythropoietin twenty four and the anti b c m a engagers preclinically both molecules have shown high potency across a wide range of e g f r and b c m a surface expression including a low target expression level. Levels this implies that more patients could respond to treatment with an in situ engager versus an antibody drug conjugate or adc as the major mechanism of adcs have been shown only to rely on certain levels of target antigen, thereby missing those tumor cells with expression levels below the ability of the adc to bind to target cells As we move on to slide seven and report on the safety front, preclinically, our innate selling agents demonstrate low cytokine release. some examples of this are the i n d-enabling toxicology study in simian monkeys, which consistently showed no meaningful increases in serum cytokines. for example, at the june virtual a s r conference, a preclinical poster presentation on the r o seven nine molecular fuel of genetics showed potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing n k cells as effector cells with minimal increase in cytotoxins also a four week safety study in seno monkeys showed a favorable safety profile with no cytotoxin release or adverse findings at the fifteen one five and fifty so five zero mix per kilo tested dose levels in the case of afn twenty four only a transient increase in il six was observed that was fully reversible within twenty four hours but no signs of cytokine release was observed that would lead one to believe that there is a risk of a cytokine storm in patients important to note here is that none of the clinical studies of afn thirty three have revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines These data indicate that r-i-c-s have a tolerable and good safety profile taken altogether these data suggest that r-i-c-s are potent able to engage at low levels of antigen expression and have thus far demonstrated a good and tolerable safety profile now in order to maximize the opportunity of r-i-c-s in addition to clinical development as monoclonal antibodies Therapies we are also pursuing combinations with natural killer cells and other treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors such as p d one and p d l one we go to slide eight and first let me comment on our combination approach with n k cells as you see on the slide there is evidence showing that high n k cell numbers are associated with better outcomes for example patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma have improved survival rates if their tumors show evidence of nk cell infiltration we also know that patients with diffuse large b cell and follicular lymphomas treated with anti cd twenty antibodies that have low peripheral nk counts tend to have poor survival we are seeing that one of the limitations in treating patients is that they We don't have the appropriate amount of nk cells so we're working on supplementing nk cells through adoptive transfer and are currently assessing different approaches as you can see on slide nine as we go to slide ten and as discussed earlier the improved tumor cell killing by loading nk cells with our i cees as you see on the Raff for in vitro data on the right-hand side of slide ten it will be investigated in the m d anderson phase one study in c d thirty positive recurrent or refractory hodgkin's lymphoma patients the preclinical data that we share here and have shared before leads us to believe that we can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy of innate cell engager afm 33 through the addition of Nk cells and encouraged by the synergistic potential of combining our i sis with nk cells and checkpoint inhibitors, we are currently evaluating the opportunity on our developing clinical plans for these combinations with a f m twenty four. finally, let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at ascr as a reminder of our a f m twenty four posters. finally, let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at ascr as a reminder of our a f m twenty four posters. finally, let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at ascr as a reminder of our a f m twenty four posters. finally, let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at ascr as a reminder of our a f m twenty four posters. finally, let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented demonstrated its distinct mechanism of action different from other egr signaling inhibition approaches potentially able to provide benefit to a broad range of cancer patients and in the case of the joint poster with genetics the preclinical pharmacology and safety of the bcma cdc6 in vivo engager shows potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing K cells as effector cells minimal increase in sakicins suggesting a low risk of sakicin release syndrome we hope this background was helpful for you and i will now turn the call over to angus to introduce himself and provide an update on the financials angus thanks And i look forward to working with our talented team to deliver on the promise of our exciting pipeline turning to the results for the quarter apimed's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ifrs as issued by the international accounting standard board or iasb the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros which is the company's functional and presentation currency therefore all financial actual numbers that i will present in this call unless otherwise noted will be in euros we ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets of ninety two point six million euros compared to a hundred and four point one million euros on december thirty first two thousand and nineteen during the quarter, we received net proceeds of approximately twenty point eight million euros under our at the market or atm program based on our current operating plan and assumptions we anticipate that our cash cash equivalents and current financial assets will support operations into the first half of twenty twenty two net cash used in operating activities for the quarter ended june thirtieth twenty twenty was fifteen million euros compared to five point six million euros in the second quarter of two thousand nineteen the second quarter two thousand nineteen net cash used in operating activities included a milestone payment to the company from genentech The genet collaboration total revenue for the second quarter of twenty twenty was two point nine million euros compared with four million euros in the second quarter of twenty nineteen revenue in twenty twenty and twenty nineteen predominantly relate to the genet collaboration revenue from the genet collaboration in the second quarter of twenty twenty was comprised of revenue recognized for collaborative research services performed during the quarter r and d expenses for the second quarter of twenty twenty were eleven point seven million euros compared to eleven point five million euros in the second quarter of two thousand and nineteen expenses in twenty twenty relate predominantly to our amf thirteen and amf twenty four clinical programs as well as to our early stage development and discovery activities g n a expenses for the second quarter of twenty twenty were two point six million euros compared to two point three million euros in the second quarter of two thousand and nineteen the increase is primarily related to higher socks. Compliance costs legal consulting and audit costs net loss for the second quarter of twenty twenty was twelve point two million euros or sixteen cents per common share and the net loss of ten point three million euros or seventeen cents per common share during the second quarter of two thousand and nineteen the weighted number of common shares outstanding for the quarter ended june thirtieth twenty twenty were seventy nine point two million euros i will now turn the call back to ady ady Thank you, angus. as you can see from our presentation today, we're taking advantage of the knowledge that we've gained in the field of innate immunity and are applying it to our programs going forward. this experience in working with the innate immune system is something that we have uniquely established at afimed and is helping us in guiding the design of our unique Therapies which now have the potential to address very different kind of cancers i just want to point out here that the egrf is expressed in more than ten tumors and that gives us a lot of optionality how to take this molecule forward we are pleased with how things are moving forward for both our clinical and preclinical programs, especially in the current environment. our breach of contract programs are on track afm thirteen and twenty four are moving forward according to plan and chinanti is moving things forward with the anti b c m a c s d sixteen in s l engager what are our inflection points for the next one and a half years for afm thirteen we've mentioned that we want to present the interim data in peripheral t cell lymphoma around Middle of next year we've been successful in our collaboration with m d. anderson, moving forward the combination of afm thirteen and collagen derived natural killer cells as we said we're ready to start our m d. anderson is ready to start and we hope to report first patient in and we will provide update as we move forward for afm twenty four we are in the midst of dose Aggregation in order to generate safety and activity data this is quite exciting for us because it's a drug with a very differentiated profile as profile as compared to the atumoities currently used in targeting e g receptor now with the dose escalation and establishing the safety we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the targeting e g receptor now with the dose escalation and establishing the safety we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the targeting e g receptor now with the dose escalation and establishing the safety we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the targeting e g receptor now with the dose escalation and establishing the safety we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up Those cohort expansions but as we've mentioned earlier as well as we're also planning early on to move forward into combinations we're very happy with the progress in the geneteca collaboration we've just provided the next update for the bcma c d six a engager we have multiple other programs ongoing and if things go well pending on program progression we can bring in additional milestones and And for our newest additions to the pipeline with afm twenty eight and afm thirty two, we are starting the i.d. enabling studies so that we can have an i.d. filing first for afm twenty eight. finally, before we open the session for q and a, i would like to thank all our employees for their contribution and express our gratitude, my gratitude, in particular, for our investigators and the clinical sites the patients and And all their families and our investors who are supporting us in our efforts to develop these innovative treatments for cancer patients it is through the combined efforts of all of you that keeps us on the path of discovery and innovation i am now happy to close the presentation and we are open now for questions thank you Question you will need to press star and the number one in the telephone directory for an announcement if you wish to cancel it press the pound or hash key once again it's star and one for a question first question comes from the line of mawi at rakhov's from jeffrey stevens go ahead your line is now open good morning everyone that's the progress and thanks for taking my questions to start off just wondering for afm twenty four am i correct I'm not sure how much you can say on this, but just wondering if both patients in core to have been dosed and if you can talk more about the timing of dosing between patients. and with the four sites activated, can you provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward andres, can you take the question please? yeah, so there were multiple parts to the questions i hope i got them all. As we said, we are recruiting in the second cohort. we have not yet disclosed how many patients as you know, it's a standard three by three design with a basijun dose modification. but that's basically what it is. in terms of timing between the patients, there is a mandatory eight day waiting period between patients so they can be cannulated. not be treated all at the same time but will be staggered with eight day intervals and there was another part of the question around the four participating sites right, yeah, just wondering if you can provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward and currently the enrollment pace is as prescribed by the protocol so all sites are very active in screening patients And as we said, all patients, all sites have already contributed patients, got it. okay, great. and then also for a n m twenty four, just checking, if you can say more about the tumor types that you're screening for the study and if you can also provide more perspective into the checkpoint inhibitor and combination plans at this point. so for the tumor types in this study, the dose escalation part we are accepting all patients with or all histologies that are e g f r expressing and where as a patient has exhausted the respective standard of care treatments as ady mentioned this is a wide variety of potential tumors probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal cancer and non small cell lung cancer and these are the two histologies where we would expect probably the majority of patients in the phase one having said that the dose escalation part would also be be open for other ijf are expressing tumors like for example head and neck cancer, gastric cancer or other solid tumors now once we have defined our dose limiting toxicities or if there are no dose limiting toxicities we have defined our dose escalation toxicities we have defined our dose escalation toxicities we have defined our dose escalation toxicities we have defined our dose escalation toxicities we have defined our dose escalation toxicities we have defined our dose escalation toxicities we have defined our dose escalation toxicities we have defined our dose escalation toxicities we have Phase two dose we will enroll into tumor-specific expansion cohorts and these expansion cohorts are currently in the process of being defined now for our pd1 combination plans based on the interesting data we have seen with pd1 in combination with afm 13 which aren't referred to was a very encouraging complete response response rate in excess of forty percent we plan to have a combination with a p d one or p l one inhibitor open rather soon probably in parallel to the last cohorts of the dose escalation of the single agent studies so it will be more or less a parallel development that we are anticipating right now great thanks for the additional perspective Any follow-up questions lori? okay. we will now proceed to the next question. the next question comes from the line of jim burton off from washington, d.c. please go ahead, jim. yeah, guys, congrats on all the progress. maybe just a first quick question for angus to start him off. Collaborative research revenues, is that expected to be a stable number between the, you know, three to four million dollar level or is there any reason that might go up as programs progress? and as we think about the milestone that got paid in the third quarter is it a simple matter to back out the assumptions around collaborative research revenues and that'll give us some sense of the milestone i'm given that you can't say it explicitly yeah, yeah, thanks, jim, for the question. so Um, you know, our, our revenue numbers fluctuate from quarter to quarter, you know, based primarily on the number of hours that we're working on the various genentech programs that are in progress. i mean, you can see just looking back at the last several quarters, we've been fairly, fairly range-bound and call it the two million to five million zone, you know, when you see increases, it's typically a result of point in time milestone payments that we receive. so um, this, this milestone payment, it's typically a result of point in time milestone payments that we receive. so um, this, this milestone payment, it's typically a result of point in time milestone payments that we receive. so um, this, this milestone payment, it's typically a result of point in time That we discussed today that will well in the third quarter will likely increase our revenues in the third quarter and that would be sort of an add-on to the to the range you've seen over the last several quarters. so, again, kind of to the to the two to five million dollars, or to the five to five million euros, rather got it. okay, that's that's helpful. and then maybe just on cohort one for amf24 and what we might learn from that cohort Doing pre- and post-biopsies and what kind of translational work you might be doing and how you know how that might inform you know the ability to recruit inate cells to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we do a pre-treatment biopsy post or on-treatment biopsies are optional we do have a significant correlative science program looking at it Add peripheral activation markers of nk cells as well as on cytokine profiles once we are in the expansion phase so we are recruiting into tumor-specific cohorts i think this is the part where we will get most of the correlative science as we have a more homogeneous patient population we maintain our requirement for a pre-treatment biopsy and will have post or on-treatment biopsy Biopsies and selected cohorts and then just you know given the comments on the variability in peripheral n k cell populations is there any sense in screening patients for their n k cell levels given that you know patients who screen low may not have adequate n k cells or macrophages to recruit or you feel like within the variability the idea of an eight cell in the blood that that you'll be able to have an effective treatment and it's not worth screening for that variable i think currently it would be a premature to depends on what you mean with with screening so we are definitely deferring the levels of circulating nk cells and also looking at some of their characteristics and effects i think we currently do not have enough data To define a cutoff or a threshold and this may very well vary between tumor histologies and also be dependent on the infiltration of nk cells in the tumor microenvironment a variable which we have seen in our afp colombia study to have some impact on on the likelihood to respond to patients so think in the beginning of the program we will be Open for all comers. we will assess all of these important biomarkers and then based on the activity data and the readout that we are seeing we may modify the program, defining certain thresholds. but currently i think it would be premature to do that. and maybe just a final question. just the amy andersen collaboration is focused on cord blood derived nk cells. is there any thought to other nk cell sources? Including potentially ipsc-derived nk cells? yes, that's correct. andy, do you want to take this question or should i take it? no, well, andy, why don't you go ahead. okay, you're right. cord blood-derived nk cells is one source of nk cells, and if you watch the field of nk cell Based approaches, especially the field around companies and institutes providing different sources of nk cells, there is definitely speed picking up and there is a variety of options to look at. This is what we do not only from our side but we have also received proactive inquiries of potential working. Models together. so we're looking at the entire nk cell field and then evaluate various options there. great. thanks for taking the questions, guys. maybe as a quick comment, so we see this cobalt-derived nk cells already quite advanced in clinical development. so they have already been many patients treated with the i p s c's currently there is still a obviously in combination we learn more on their functionalities. so this is somewhat yet to us on how functional an ipsc derived versus a peripheral kcs is and it's good to see the first clinical data. so we're quite not only happy but we've we've checked so many different options at the moment for ipsc cells and we're indeed very convinced about the activity of the co-cultured derived cells from m.d. anderson. Great, thank you. our next question comes from the line of i. o. g. from bmo capital. the line is now open. please go ahead. hey, good morning, gentlemen. thanks for taking my question. this is e. k. on for do kim. just a couple of questions regarding the dse may and nengajer. i understand that you have limited visibility on the entire dse may and nengajer. Of the clinical trial pathway but if you can provide any type of insight in terms of what genetic kind of has planned in terms of could it potentially pursue an accelerated pathway for the asset and secondly again you don't provide complete details on the exact milestone payments but if you can provide some additional details on that that would be great. Perspective on what the future milestones for asset might hold in terms of phase two, phase three, things of that sort. should we expect increasing size of value for each milestone payment? that would be helpful for us. thanks. alyssa, maybe i take the question on the pathway and then hand it over to you with the milestones. yes, please go ahead, aunt. So yeah, thanks for the question. I mean, as you already correctly say, we cannot really speak in detail for genentech, but we can share with you. I think you're aware, of course, licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal we did with genentech. They're obviously excited about the strong differentiation potential of the molecule also demonstrated at a c r at the poster just to review again a very strong Biological cell killing, selective nonspecific release, very good safety profile, and good pharmacodynamic marker. Specific bcma plasma cell killing in the synovial monkey. So, you know, despite the also recent approvals of the, you know, first incomers into the space, i would say that genetic shares our excitement with the differentiation potential and a way forward. Potentially best-in-class molecule. Maybe i i leave it there. i think it's it's it's clearly a strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule will enable janssen and we as their partner to have a strong position in this space yeah, regarding the financial so i just want to recall the deal when it was signed so we received ninety six million In upfront cash and can get a total of more than five billion in milestones that are in different categories. so there are preclinical milestones, there are clinical milestones, there are regulatory milestones, and there are sales milestones. and on top of that, we can receive royalties which, as we described, are on the higher end of the range. of what you would expect for the early nature of the license agreement beyond that, we are not able to disclose any further details unless genetic will allow us or rush will allow us to do so usually, and that's just a general statement is that the payments will increase the further the program progresses ok, thank you for that. A quick question, i think i might have missed it, and this is in regards to afm twenty four. i believe you mentioned that there was a patient that had increased a s six cytokine levels that would resolve over twenty four hours. i'm just curious, was that self-resolving or did that patient receive an a s six inhibitor? Our sixth increase was reported in the ionine enabling sine tox study what you you're referring to the aiacr poster indeed we saw that with the dosing a kind of moderate peak that quickly went down as completely resolved without any any treatment obviously you know one doesn't do that in the because this is a sine tox study and again when we see this in the context because it was transient and fully reversed leads us to the conclusion Conclusion, which of course will be looked at carefully in patients that we should not expect any kind of cytokine release syndrome. okay, thank you for that clarification. sure. Hi, can you hear me? hi, sorry, that my headset's fallen out. thanks for taking the questions. my first question is that for the amf thirteen in the for the registration study that it's an assignment too set up so what might be the threshold of oar in the forty patients and sort of inter-rater reliability before you can move forward? so just curious. What any information can you reveal on that front? um, i'm afraid we cannot give a concrete response rate. it's based also on a bayesian design, so there are some interdependencies of response rates, but we usually do not disclose thresholds. but it's a classical simon two-stage design. okay, no problem. and also, just curious, in terms of afm twenty four, For that your dose escalating but at least based on the animal data is any thoughts where when you might start to see the potential effective dose to star? i think currently it's not possible to predict when we will have the optimal biologically active dose as there are a number of co-variants like binding sites for a s d Eighteen binding sites for egr and and distribution and as you know the animal models especially in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are very difficult to translate the relevant talk species and we have found that it's only a talk species is the simian monkey however we do not have any simian monkey tumor models available So we cannot really bridge between what we see in the toxicology studies and then what we would see in terms of efficacy for for tumors so it will be something that we will have to define in our in our clinical program okay, great, maybe a what stick in one last question here is that in terms of adaptive immune cells from the bone marrow derived cells first of all, could that be potentially used in solid tumors and any comments comments in terms of regarding that possibility? this is as adi said, something that we are actively looking into. we'll start out with lymphomas, obviously, with afm thirteen targeting cd thirty but our vision is that we'll start out with lymphomas, obviously, with afm thirteen targeting cd thirty but our vision is that we'll start out with lymphomas, obviously, with afm thirteen targeting cd thirty but our vision is that we'll start out with lymphomas, obviously, with afm thirteen targeting cd thirty but our vision is that we'll start out with lymphomas, obviously, with afm thirteen targeting cd thirty but our vision is that we'll start out Also for afm twenty four we will develop certain development options in combination with nk cells could be cord blood derived nk cells could be nk cells from another source that is something that we will define but the intention is also to have a program where afm twenty four would be partnered with exogenous nk cells And congratulations on all the progress this far. and for the question of this time, for any closing remarks, please go ahead, speakers. and, yeah, thank you again for listening in and following our our updates the the progress is coming smoothly along despite that we are affected by by code. we have strengthened the team significantly in order to address any issues that may relate to the conduct of this clinical trials or to the interactions with the specific sites. so we're very happy to be able to have have been able to address any of the issues that have been arising and i indeed want to thank the entire team here at apharma for managing all of that through this Difficult times we're quite excited that we can move forward these programs either as monotherapies and now looking at different options of combination if you have heard we focus on natural killer cells and checkpoint inhibitors in particular pd1 ones and pdl ones so we feel that we have with the multiple programs addressing different targets we can provide a cornucopia of data over the next year. Quarters and years and very happy to report any additional updates as we move along. thanks a lot again for listening in and all the best. goodbye thank you for attending the conference today. thank you all for participating in the alaska connect stay safe everyone thank you bill"

FOR OFFSHORE WIND AND ONSHORE WIND SOLAR WAS DUE TO THE VERY GOOD WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND ONSHORE CAPACITY ADDITIONS THE HYDRO BIOMASS GAS DIVISION MAINLY BENEFITS FROM THE RESUMPTION OF GB CAPACITY MARKET AND THE SUPPLY AND TRADING DIVISION OUTPERFORMED AFTER A SUCCESSFUL START INTO THE YEAR WAS CONTINUED WHICH CONTINUED IN THE SECOND QUARTER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OUR

DEMONSTRATION PROJECT TOGETHER WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE AS WELL AS MITSUBISHI CORPORATION WE WILL DEVELOP A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT OFF THE COAST OF MAINE WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND BECAUSE WE SEE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR FLOATING WIND FARMS WORLDWIDE IN PARTICULAR IN COUNTRIES LIKE THE US WITH DEEPER COASTAL WATERS LET'S MOVE ONTO AN UPDATE OF OUR CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM IT IS PROGRESSING WELL APART FROM SOME COVID-19 RELATED DELAYS MAINLY AT US CONSTRUCTION SITES SO THAT WE HAD TO SHIFT UD OF APPROXIMATELY 500 MEGAWATT FROM ' 20 TO ' 21 DUE TO THE ADJUSTED COMMISSIONING

ON THE BASIS OF THE ADJUSTED TIMELINE CONSTRUCTION WORK IS ON TRACK COMMISSIONING RAMP UP WILL START SOON AND AT THE LYMAN THEIR SOLAR FARM THE GOOD REGISTRATION PROCESS TOOK MORE TIME THAN EXPECTED DUE TO THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES CUD HAS THEREFORE SLIPPED INTO Q1 ' 21 IN TOTAL WE WILL BRING 1.3 GIGAWATT ONLINE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR MAINLY BACKEND LOADED WITH THAT WE CAN MOVE TO THE DETAILS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS THE OFFSHORE WIND DIVISION REALIZED AN ADJUSTED EBITDA OF 585 MILLION EUROS YEAR ON YEAR THIS IS AN INCREASE OF 19% THANKS TO HIGHER WIND SPEEDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ROSS CASH INVESTMENTS IN H1 AMOUNT TO 316 MILLION EUROS MAINLY DRIVEN BY TRITON OR CONSTRUCTION WORK THE SALE OF THE SEA BREEZE INSTALLATION <INAUDIBLE> IS THE MAIN DRIVER FOR ROSS CASH DIVESTMENTS WE CONFIRMED THE OUTLOOK FOR THE OFFSHORE DIVISION OUR ONSHORE WIND SOLAR DIVISION INCREASED 12% YEAR ON YEAR AND ADJUSTED EBITDA AMOUNTED TO 273 MILLION EUROS AT H1 WHETHER YOU DRIVE US AN INCREASE IN CAPACITY OF APPROXIMATELY 380 MEGAWATTS YEAR ON YEAR AS WELL AS HIGHER EARNINGS IN EUROPE FROM ABOVE AVERAGE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR MOST OF THE GROSS CASH INVESTMENTS ARE FOR THE US ONSHORE PROJECTS BIG RAYMOND SCOTIA RICH AND CASSADAGA AS WELL AS BOILING SPRINGS DESPITE THE SMALL TO MEDIUM DOUBLE DIGIT MILLION EURO NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM TIGHTER COMMISSIONING PHASES AND THE DELAY AT BIG RAYMOND AND <UNK> WE CONFIRM THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR THE HYDRO BIOMASS GAS DIVISION DELIVERED A GOOD PERFORMANCE OVER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS HIGHER EARNING RESULTS MAINLY FROM THE BRITISH CAPACITY MARKETS IN CONTRAST TO THE STRONG FIRST WATER AT H1 EARNINGS FROM THE COMMERCIAL OPTIMIZATION OF CO-OP POWER PLANT DISPATCH HAVE NORMALIZED IN JUNE WE SIGNED A CONTRACT TO SELL OUR GEORGIA BIO-MASS BUSINESS TO NVIVO PARTNERS FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF 175 MILLION US DOLLARS THE TRANSACTION WAS CLOSED AT THE END OF JULY AFTER SUCCESSFUL MERGER CLEARANCE THE DISPOSAL IS ALREADY REFLECTED IN THE GUIDANCE WE GAVE YOU IN MARCH THE EBITDA CONTRIBUTION FOR PROFORMA 2019 WAS A GOOD 30 MILLION EUROS IN 2020 IT IS APPROXIMATELY HALF THIS AMOUNT AS WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED TO THE MARKET THE FIRE AT THE <INAUDIBLE> POWER PLANT HAS CAUSED AN INTERRUPTION TO THE BIOMASS CO-FIRING WHICH WE EXPECT TO LAST UNTIL NOVEMBER 2020 THIS WILL IMPACT THE OUTLOOK BY A SMALL TO MEDIUM DOUBLE DIGIT MILLION EURO AMOUNT DESPITE THIS WE ALSO CONFIRM THE GUIDANCE FOR THIS DIVISION MOVING ON TO ANOTHER QUARTER OF FAVORABLE EARNINGS DEVELOPMENT FROM THE SUPPLY AND TRADING DIVISION AT H1 ADJUSTED EBITDA AMOUNT TO 322 MILLION EUROS ON THE BACK OF A STRONG TRADING PERFORMANCE AND GOOD RESULTS FROM THE GAS AND ENERGY BUSINESS WE DIDN'T EXPECT THE DIVISION TO REPLICATE THE EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF LAST YEAR THE DIVISION'S OUTLOOK IS 150 TO 350 MILLION EUROS GIVEN THE STRONG H1 WE EXPECT TO END THE UPPER END OR EVEN ABOVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HAVING NOW REPORT ON THE CORE BUSINESS LET'S MOVE TO THE COAL AND NUCLEAR DIVISION ADJUSTED EBITDA HAS DOUBLED YEAR ON YEAR AND AMOUNT TO 310 MILLION EUROS AS WE ALREADY MENTIONED AT Q1 EARNINGS IMPROVED DUE TO HIGHER REALIZED WHOLESALE PRICES AND AN UPDATED PRODUCTION PLANT IN THE <INAUDIBLE> SYSTEM NEVERTHELESS WE NEED TO CONSIDER IMPLICATIONS FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACCELERATED EXIT PLAN FOR THE FULL YEAR WE CONFIRMED THE DIVISIONS OUTLOOK MOVING ONTO THE EARNINGS DRIVERS DOWN TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME ADJUSTED NET INCOME AMOUNTED TO 795 MILLION EUROS DUE TO THE HIGH ADJUSTED EBITDA OF RWE GROUP THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL RESULT OF MINUS 150 MILLION EUROS FROM Q1 WERE PARTLY COMPENSATED BY THE E.ON DIVIDENDS OF 182 MILLION EUROS WE RECEIVED IN THE SECOND QUARTER ADJUSTMENT IN TAX APPLIED WITH A GENERAL TAX RATE OF 15% IN LINE WITH EXPECTED MIDTERM TAX LEVEL FOR THE GROUP THE TAX RATE OF 15% HAS BEEN DERIVED FROM ALL INCOME STREAMS IT IS BASED ON BLENDED LOCAL TAX RATES THE USE OF LOSS CARRIED FORWARD AND THE LOW TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS INCLUDING THE E.ON AND <INAUDIBLE> DIVIDENDS AND NOW ONTO THE ADJUSTED OPERATING CASHFLOW THE ADJUSTED OPERATING CASHFLOW SHOWS THE IMPACT ON THAT DEBT FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IT IS ADJUSTED FOR SPECIAL ITEMS AND TIMING EFFECTS THAT BALANCE OUT OVER TIME THE UTILIZATION OF NUCLEAR PROVISIONS IS NOT INCLUDED AS YOU WILL REMEMBER WE CONSIDER THIS AS A FINANCIAL CASHFLOW AS WHEN THE NUCLEAR PROVISIONS ARE UTILIZED THEY CAN BE REFINANCED VIA FINANCIAL DEBT IN H1 THE ADJUSTED OPERATING CASHFLOW TOP 2 BILLION EUROS AND IS BUILD UP ON THE HIGH ADJUSTED EBITDA AS WELL AS A POSITIVE EFFECT IN WORKING CAPITAL CHANGE IN OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL OF 437 MILLION EUROS IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE PAYMENT FROM THE BRITISH CAPACITY MARKET FROM 2018 AND ' 19 WHICH WE RECEIVED IN Q1 AS WELL AS THE REDUCTION OF GAS INVENTORIES FOR THE FULL YEAR 2020 WE EXPECT THIS LINE ITEM TO REMAIN POSITIVE FOR THE SAME REASONS TURNING TO THE DETAILS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NET DEBT AT THE END OF JUNE NET DEBT INCREASED TO ROUGHLY 7.8 BILLION EUROS FIRST AND FOREMOST THIS WAS DUE TO TIMING EFFECTS FROM HATCHING ACTIVITIES OF ROUGHLY 1 BILLION EUROS MAINLY RELATED TO CO2 ANOTHER DRIVER OF NET DEBT IS THE COMPANY'S NET CASH INVESTMENTS CLEARLY LINKED TO OUR STRATEGY TO EXPAND IN RENEWABLE ENERGY THE DIVIDEND PAYMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 IS ALREADY REFLECTED IN THE NET DEBT FIGURE AT H1 WE SEE A LEVERAGE FACTOR OF AROUND THREE TIMES NET DEBT TO CORE ADJUSTED EBITDA AT YEAR END WHICH CONSIDERS INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 400 MILLION EUROS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE TWO-PART SEVEN <INAUDIBLE> NORDEX DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE VOLATILITY IN COMMODITY PRICES AND INTEREST RATES COULD TEMPORARILY DRIVE IT SLIGHTLY ABOVE THREE TIMES BUT IF THIS IS THE CASE WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE WOULD RETURN TO OUR TARGET LEVEL IN THE MEDIUM TERM WITHOUT AN IMPACT ON OUR PLAN CAPEX PROGRAM FINALLY MOVING ON TO THE OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 AS I ALREADY SAID WE CONFIRMED OUR OUTLOOK FOR THIS YEAR ADJUSTED EBITDA OF THE CORE BUSINESS WILL COME OUT BETWEEN 2.15 AND 2.45 BILLION EUROS ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE GROUP WE RAISED BETWEEN 2.7 TO 3 BILLION EUROS AND ADJUSTED EBIT BETWEEN 1.2 TO 1.5 FOR BOTH ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT WE EXPECT TO SEE RESULTS AT THE UPPER END OF THE GUIDES OUR GUIDANCE FOR ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS 850 MILLION TO 1.15 BILLION EUROS AND WE EXPECT IT TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RANGE DUE TO THE NEGATIVE ONE OFF IN THE FINANCIAL RESULTS WHICH WE EXPERIENCED IN Q1 DIVIDEND TARGET IS UNCHANGED 85 EURO CENTS PER SHARE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 AND WITH THIS I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND I'M NOW HAPPY TO TAKE ALL YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU MARCUS AND AS ALWAYS IF YOU HAVE TIME YOU KNOW PLEASE STICK TO TWO QUESTIONS ONLY OPERATOR PLEASE START THE Q&A SESSION LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS * 1 ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AND WISH TO WITHDRAW YOUR QUESTION PLEASE PRESS * 2 YOU WILL BE ADVISED WHEN TO ASK YOUR QUESTION OUR FIRST QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF AVANDA SAVINASCA FROM CREDIT SUISSE PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON I'M AVANDA SAVINASCA CREDIT SUISSE TWO QUESTIONS FROM ME THE FIRST ONE IS ON THE NEGATIVE POWER PRICE IN THE UK THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THE MOST OF THE CFDS TO SAY THAT IF THE POWER PRICE GOES NEGATIVE FOR MORE THAN SIX HOURS THEN BASICALLY CFD <INAUDIBLE> IS TO APPLY FOR O FOR THAT THAT TIME DOES IT DOES THE RULE APPLIES FOR ALL YOUR ASSETS IN THE UK AND IT'S AND THAT'S THE SAME OR SIMILAR RULE EXIST IN OTHER MARKETS THAT RWE OPERATES IN AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS UH ON THE RENEWABLES TARGET GROWTH WHEN CAN WE EXPECT RWE TO RISE THE ANNUAL RENEWABLES TARGET GROWTH I MEAN WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY NG INCLUDING THE ANNUAL TARGETS FROM THREE TO FOUR GIGAWATT PER ANNUM THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION I MEAN UM YES THE NEGATIVE PRICE RULE APPLIES TO UH THE UK UM AND WE HAVE A SIMILAR ONE BUT THE TECHNICAL DETAILS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ALSO IN GERMANY I MEAN I HAVE TO ADMIT I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT DETAILS AND SO FAR UM I THINK UM I MEAN YOU CAN YOU CAN USUALLY PLAN IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR POWER PRICE FORECAST ON A ON A QUARTERLY HOUR BASIS FOR THE FULL YEAR AND UH I MEAN IT HAS NOT HAD A A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT WHICH WAS NOT PLANNED FOR US EVEN THIS YEAR SO FOR US IT'S UH IT'S A MINOR TECHNA TECHNICALITY UM ON AND IF YOU WANT THE DETAILS I THINK PLEASE CALL THE TEAM ALSO TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE DRUM MEASURED <INAUDIBLE> FROM THE UK ONE UM ON THE TARGETS I MEAN WE ALREADY G GAVE YOU AN INDICATION WITH THE NORDEX PIPELINE THAT COMES ON TOP OF OUR TARGETS BUT I MEAN OUR TARGETS HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATED UM IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO SO DON'T EXPECT THAT WE GIVE YOU NEW TARGETS EVERY MONTH SO WHEN WE DEEM IT APPROPRIATE THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE THE THE MARKET ABOUT NEW PLANS OR REVISE PLANS WE WILL DO IT BUT WE WILL DO NOT DO IT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THANKS I MEAN I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO ME ON THE ON THE DETAILS ON THE TECHNICAL DETAILS ON THE NEGATIVE POWER PRICE I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE ISSUE FOR THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR BUT WE SEE MORE AND MORE OFTEN NEGATIVE POWER PRICE ON THE MARKET YES WE WILL COME BACK THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I MEAN I I I JUST TO REMARK I MEAN UH THE MOMENT IT BECOMES VIABLE YOU USUALLY I MEAN UM BUT AS THE TEAM COMES BACK BUT I THINK I MEAN FOR US I THINK IT'S AN OVERRATED ISSUE ALSO GOING FORWARD BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE IS UM WE GET MORE AND MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE SYSTEM IN MANY MARKETS SO THE PERIODS OF VERY NEGATIVE POWER PRICES SHOULD NATURALLY COME TO AN END I MEAN NOT FOR THE SPECIFIC PLAN YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING FOR A CFD PLAN BUT THE MARKET OVERALL BECAUSE INCENTIVIZES INVESTMENTS IN FLEXIBILITIES LIKE BATTERIES UM AND THAT THESE IF YOU'LL GET MORE OF THAT IT WILL DEFINITELY TAKE AT FIRST THE NEGATIVE POWER PRICES AWAY SO WE DON'T SEE IT AS A BIG ISSUE GOING FORWARD BUT THE TEAM WILL COME BACK ON THE TECHNICALITIES THANKS A LOT THANK YOU AVANDA NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF VINCENT <INAUDIBLE> FROM JP MORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD YES GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON UH QUICK ONE UM COULD YOU PROVIDE US A BIT MORE COLOR ON THE NORDEX PIPELINE BUT AT AN ASSET LEVEL SO WE UNDERSTAND WE SEE THE GEOGRAPHIES SO MAINLY IT SEEMS TO BE UH UH A FOOTPRINT IN UH IN THE FRENCH UH ONSHORE UH MARKET UM SO WE UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGY BEHIND IT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD GET A BIT MORE COLOR ON THE ON THE PROJECT LEVEL UH WHILE THE BIG PROJECTS WHICH ARE IN THERE UM AND UH BASICALLY WHAT IS THE EXPECTED TIME FOR CONTRIBUTION THERE UH SO THAT WOULD BE THE QUESTION ONE AND BOUNCING BACK ON THIS UM WHAT IS YOUR VIEW REGARDING ACQUISITION OF RENEWABLE ASSETS UH GIVEN CURRENT PRICES BUYING A PIPELINE IS ONE THING BUYING EXISTING OPERATING ASSETS IS ANOTHER ONE UH DO YOU SEE THAT LIKE VALUE ACCRETIVE AND UH WOULD YOU UM IN SUCH A SITUATION CONSIDER UH POTENTIALLY EVEN SOUNDING UH LARGE ACQUISITIONS UH UM BY UH RECONSIDERING YOUR <INAUDIBLE> THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH UM THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION LET ME START WITH THE LATTER ONE I THINK FOR US I MEAN HAVING A UM A A DEEP PIPELINE UH WHERE WE CAN INVEST OUR MONEY IT WOULD NOT BE UM LET'S LET'S PUT IT VALUE OPTIMAL TO ACTUALLY ACQUIRE EXISTING ASSETS BECAUSE WE WANNA WE WANT TO BUILD THEM WE WANT TO OPERATE THEM UM AND US BECOMING A FINANCIAL INVESTOR I MEAN I SEE IT DIFFICULT THAT THAT IS REALLY VERY ACCRETIVE IT'S A DIFFERENT THING IF IF YOU CAN MAYBE SWAP ASSETS HERE AND THERE TO UM TO TO CHANGE THE PORTFOLIO MIX AND GET SOME SYNERGIES HERE AND THERE BUT I I DON'T SEE IT AS VERY RELEVANT FOR THE NEAR FUTURE SO I MEAN WE ARE INTERESTED IN STRENGTHENING OUR PIPELINE ESPECIALLY AS WE HAVE DONE WITH NORDEX I'LL COME TO THAT IN A MINUTE BUT UM ACQUIRING EXISTING ASSETS UM ASSET BY ASSET IS NOT PART OF OUR UM INVESTMENT UH INVESTMENT PLAN I MEAN ON THE NORDEX PIPELINE I MEAN LET ME LET ME START FIRST WITH WHY THIS WAS STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT AS I SAID IN MY SPEECH BECAUSE FRANCE IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE ONSHORE MARKET WITH I MEAN THE DOUBLE SIDED CFD FOR 20 YEARS IN INFLATION LINK UM WE HAVE SEEN PRICES IN THE LAST OPTIONS BETWEEN 62 AND 67 EUROS SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE UM AND IT WAS ON THE EUROPEAN LANDSCAPE THE ONE TARGET MARKET WHERE WE REALLY MISSED THE PRESENCE SO IT WAS REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US WE LOOKED INTO THE PIPELINE IN IN DETAIL AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IN THE DUE DILIGENCE AND I MEAN WE HAVE VERY GOOD LOCATIONS GOOD WIND CONDITIONS UH CLUSTERS IN IN GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY THAT THAT UM THEY PROVIDE EFFICIENCIES AND UM I MEAN I CAN I WILL NOT TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS NOW BECAUSE THE TRANSACTION IS NOT CLOSED AND WE ARE BOUND TO CONFIDENTIALITY SO I CAN GIVE YOU A VIEW OF HOW THE PORTFOLIO WILL LOOK LIKE I WILL GIVE YOU MORE COLOR IN A MINUTE BUT I CANNOT TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC SITES UH UM I MEAN WE CAN WE CAN GIVE YOU MORE COLOR UM AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION UM WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY SAID IS 15% OF THE PIPELINE IS UM IS CLOSE TO FID OR VERY LATE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND WE EXPECT THE FIRST CUDS AT 21 ON AVERAGE WE WOULD AT LEAST EXPECT 100 MEGAWATTS FROM THE PIPELINE PER ANNUM SO THAT WE HAVE BY 25 ANOTHER 500 MEGAWATTS UNDER OPERATIONS UM INCLUDING THE THE PURCHASE PRICE OF 400 2.5 MILLION WE EXPECT THAT THE IRS OF THE PROJECTS WITH US IN OUR GIVEN RANGE UH THE CAPITAL MARKET DAY WE SET FOR MATURE ONSHORE PV MARKETS WE EXPECT 5 4.5 TO 8% BUT PLEASE I MEAN THIS IS A VERY UM UM MATURE MARKET AND WE HAD TO BUY IT SO DON'T EXPECT IT AT THE UPPER END OF THE 4.5 TO 8% BUT UM CLEARLY IN THE IN THE RANGE WE SAW THE PRICE AS ATTRACTIVE I MEAN IT'S ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE OR ASSESS THE PRICE UH FROM THE OUTSIDE IN BUT WE HAVE ALSO SEEN OTHER PIPELINES WE'VE PARTICIPATED IN MANY DUE DILIGENCE IN FRANCE UM SO WE KNOW ALSO OUR OTHER PIPELINES LOOK LIKE AND JUST LOOKING AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE IN WE HAVE SEEN ACQUISITIONS IN THAT MARKET WHICH WERE PRICED AT 150 TO 250 EUROS PER MEGAWATT AND WE ARE AT THE LOWER END OF THAT BUT I MEAN THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT COMPARING PRICES UM ON THAT LEVEL PIPELINE BY PIPELINE THE SPLIT OF THE OF THE MATURITY OF THE PIPELINE IS MORE OR LESS IN LINE WITH THE MATURITY OF OUR OVERALL UM OF OUR OVERALL PIPELINE I MEAN AROUND AS I SAID 15% IS CLOSE TO FID AND LATE STAGE WE HAVE AROUND 30% MID STAGE AND THE REMAINING PART IS AN EARLY STAGE DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF PETER BISZTYGA FROM BOFA SECURITIES PLEASE GO AHEAD HI YEAH UM THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION SO JUST A ANOTHER ONE ON THE NORDEX UH PORTFOLIO COULD YOU SORT OF TELL US HOW THE 400 MILLION ACQUISITION PRICE AND THE UH I GUESS ADDITIONAL CAPEX THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE SPENDING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS FITS INTO YOUR EXISTING 5 BILLION CAPEX BUDGET DOES IT DISPLAY SOMETHING ELSE OUT OF THAT BUDGET OR IS IT AN ADDITION AND I GUESS IF IT'S AN ADDITION THEN WHERE HAVE YOU FOUND THE EXTRA BALANCE SHEET CAPACITY PLEASE UH AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION AS SHE WAS JUST ON CARBON UM WHICH HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN UH VERY VOLATILE UH OVER THE LAST UM COUPLE OF QUARTERS I GUESS YOUR SUPPLY AND TRADING DIVISION MIGHT HAVE PROFITED FROM THAT BUT UM I WAS JUST WONDERING COULD YOU COULD YOU GIVE US YOUR VIEWS AS TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN DRIVING THE CARBON PRICE PARTICULARLY UM YOU KNOW AS IT REACHED THE SORT OF MID TO HIGH HIGH TWENTIES THANK YOU YEAH PETER THANKS FOR THE QUESTION UM ON THE NORDEX PIPELINE YES IT WILL COME ON TOP OF THE UH 5 BILLION AS WE HAVE SAID WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TRANSACTION AND NOW UM QUESTION REGARDING UM UM FUNDING I MEAN AS I'VE SAID IN THE SPEECH UM WE EXPECT UM TO BE WITHIN THE LEVERAGE TARGET UM OF THE THREE TIMES NET DEBT TO EBITDA UM INCLUDING THE 400 MILLION AND I MEAN WE HAVE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS I MEAN IF WE ASSUME AND I ALSO HINTED TO THAT THAT COMMODITY PRICES ESPECIALLY GAS AND CO2 AND INTEREST RATES STAY WHERE THEY WERE AT END OF JUNE THEN WE HAVE A GOOD VIEW WHAT ARE THE MOVING CASH ITEMS OPERATING CASHFLOW INVESTMENTS WE KNOW OUR DIVESTMENT I HINTED TO GEORGIA BIOMED YOU'RE GOING TO PAY BACK THE HYBRIDS I MEAN THAT IS ALL VERY STABLE AND WE CAN FORESEE THAT WE END THE YEAR AT AROUND 3.0 BUT OF COURSE WE CANNOT CONTROL COMMODITY PRICES AND WE CANNOT CONTROL INTEREST RATES BUT THESE ARE ONLY I MEAN TIMING EFFECTS I MEAN THIS WILL NORMALIZE OVER TIME THAT'S WHY ARE CONFIDENT IF WE MOVE UP UM THEN IT'S REALLY COME DOWN WITHOUT IMPACTING THE CAPEX THEN LATER UH THE PROJECT INVESTMENTS AFTER THE I MEAN WHEN WE WHEN WE DO CUDS THAT WILL BE PART OF THE OF THE UM CAPITAL ALLOCATION APPROACH BUT OF COURSE AS I HINTED TO UM IT WILL COME ON TOP OF OUR EXISTING TARGETS BUT I MEAN 100 MEGAWATTS HERE AND THERE THAT WILL NOT UH MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THE COMPANY OF OUR SIZE AND CARBON SORRY CARBON SORRY EXACTLY CARBON UM YEAH I MEAN EVEN EVEN WITHIN THE TEAM HERE WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT VIEWS AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD REFLECTION OF HOW I SEE THE MARKET SHORT TERM IS MORE BEARISH UH BECAUSE UM I MEAN WITH THE COVID SITUATION WITH UH VERY LOW GAS PRICES SIGNIFICANT FUEL SWITCHING UH MUTED INDUSTRIAL DEMAND I MEAN THE DEMAND FOR COMM CERTIFICATES IS DEFINITELY MUCH LOWER THAN IT HAS BEEN IT HAS BEEN EXPECTED UM ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT THE MORE POLITIC THE MID TO LONG-TERM VIEW IS MORE BULLISH BECAUSE I MEAN SOMEHOW THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION NEEDS TO IMPLEMENT THE MORE AGGRESSIVE CO2 REDUCTION TARGET AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY GO TO I DON'T KNOW 50 55 OR EVEN 60% REDUCTION BY 2030 A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT UH MAYBE EVEN UM MORE THAN HALF NEEDS TO COME FROM THE EUETS AND THAT WILL DEFINITELY MEAN THAT PRICES WILL GO UP AND MAYBE WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME THAN IN THE LAST FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE LAST FINANCIAL CRISIS WE HAVE SEEN THAT A LOT OF INDUSTRIALS WHO WERE SITTING ON EXCESS UM CERTIFICATES UM WERE IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE AND THEY NEEDED TO SELL UM JUST TO TO GET TO GET LIQUIDITY THIS IS WITH A HUGE PROGRAM OF THE CENTRAL BANKS AND THE PHYSICAL SUPPORT NOW DIFFERENT MAYBE SOME INDUSTRIALS TO TAKE MORE THE POLITICAL LONG-TERM VIEW AND USE THE LIQUIDITY THEY STILL HAVE TO BUY UH CHEAPER THAN THEY EXPECT THE PRICES TO BE I THINK THESE ARE THE TWO CAMPS UH SHORT-TERM LONG-TERM UM AND SINCE THIS MARKET IS NOTHING YOU CAN FUNDAMENTALLY ANALYZE THAT IT'S ALWAYS A SENTIMENT QUESTION AND I THINK THE MORE DOMINANT FACTOR IS DEFINITELY THE MID-TERM TO LONG-TERM POLITICAL VIEW <CROSSTALK> I CAN SIMPLY NOT IMAGINE THAT IF PRICES GO DOWN TO 15 EUROS AGAIN THAT THE POLITICIANS WILL SIT THERE AND DO NOTHING OKAY INTERESTING THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF ALBERTO KENDALVILE FROM GOLDMAN SACHS PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON UH THE FIRST ONE IS TO GO BACK TO THE E.ON STAKE WE HEARD IN THE PAST THAT MAYBE BADLY COUNTED ABOUT HALF OF THAT COULD BE USED LEAKED NET LIABILITIES AND THE REST COULD BE USED FOR GROWTH COULD YOU PLEASE CONFIRM THAT AND WHEN IT COMES TO GROWTH CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC WOULD IT BE CONTINGENT TO MAYBE BIG OFFSHORE THE WIND OR PERHAPS TO IDENTIFYING SOMETHING EXTERNAL LIKE YOU JUST DID WITH WITH NORDEX AND BECOME EVEN BIGGER AND SECONDLY IT'S JUST THINKING ABOUT THEM IN A FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE LIKE RWE AS A POTENTIAL TARGET SO WE ARE SEEING ALL COMPANIES VERY QUICKLY MOVING INTO THE SPACE UH YOU KNOW VP WITH A 50 GIGAWATTS NEXT TARGET BY BY 2030 UM COMPANY LIKE YOURSELF WOULD BE LIKE A PLUG AND PLAY YOU KNOW DEVELOPING WITH EXISTING CAPACITY SO DO YOU THINK THERE IS A RACE TO SCALE HERE AND WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY FOR YOU TO FEND OFF A FACT LIKE THIS ONE UM YEAH ALBERTO THANKS FOR THE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN ON THE E.ON STAGE I CAN JUST RECONFIRM THAT EVERYTHING IS TO VALID WHICH WE HAVE SET IN THE PAST UM I MEAN THE E.ON STATE IS NOT TIED TO THE LEAKED NET PROVISIONS WE JUST SAID WE CURRENTLY USE IT WE COULD ALSO BACK THE LEAK NET PROVISIONS BY OTHER FINANCIAL PORTFOLIOS UM AND I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE THE POTENTIAL SOURCING OF OF FINANCING YES I MEAN WE POTENTIALLY NEED HALF OF IT TO BACK THE LEAKED NET PROVISION AND THE OTHER HALF WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO CAPITAL ROTATION UM BUT UM I MEAN THAT HAS NOT CHANGED IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SAID BEFORE UM USUALLY WE HAVE TWO QUESTIONS SO YOU HAVE THREE WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER NOW THE THE OIL QUESTION OR THE OTHER ONE I START WITH THE OIL QUESTION AND THEN LET'S SEE WHETHER WE STILL HAVE TIME PERFECT THANK YOU BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE MORE INTERESTING ONE I I DO AGREE THAT IT COULD THAT WE COULDN'T AND THE SITUATION THAT UM IT'S THE RACE FOR SCARCITY BECAUSE I MEAN IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO IF YOU PUT TOGETHER ALL THE ALL THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT PLANS OF EVERYBODY AROUND IN THIS IN THIS FIELD UM IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO EMPLOY THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY UNTIL LET'S SAY 2030 UH BECAUSE THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH PROJECT AS YOU HAVE MORE LEAD TIMES TO DO IT SO EXISTING PIPELINES BECOME MUCH MORE UM VALUABLE I THINK THE INVESTORS OF BIG OIL AND OTHERS NEEDS TO ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION WHETHER IT'S REALLY GREEN A GREEN INVESTMENT IF YOU BUY EXISTING STUFF FROM OTHERS UM BECAUSE THAT IS NOT A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION UM IT'S JUST I MEAN UM OVER BIDDING IN PRICES SO I MEAN ON THE QUESTION WHETHER WE COULD BECOME A TARGET OR NOT I THINK YOUR COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED TO HELP THE OIL COMPANIES FIGURING THAT OUT AND WE SIT AND WAIT WHAT HAPPENED UM GOT IT WELL I MEAN THAT'S SPECULATION I MEAN THAT'S NOT IN OUR CONTROL WHAT SO WHAT CAN WE DO I MEAN I'M I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY THAT ALSO OTHERS SEE THE FIELD OF RENEWABLES AND THE OVERALL POWER SECTOR IS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THAT'S OUR THAT'S THE CORE OF OUR STRATEGY AND I THINK WE HAVE ALL THE INGREDIENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE A VERY EXPERIENCED TEAM WE HAVE A DEEP PIPELINE WHICH ACTUALLY NEEDED TO BE DEVELOPED OVER A DECADE UM AND OF COURSE WE HAVE HAVE INVESTMENT DISCIPLINE AND WE'LL ENSURE THAT WE PUT THE MONEY WHERE WE GET A DECENT RETURN AND WE WILL CONTINUE DOING THAT I MEAN DEVELOPING OUR PIPELINE UM INVESTING IN GOOD PROJECTS AND ALSO BEING ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL FOREFRONT BE IT BATTERY SPEED H2 OR BE IT UM FLOATING OFF SHORE WHERE I ACTUALLY DON'T SEE LIMITING FACTORS IF THE THE LONG-TERM MARKET GROWS BECAUSE THE LONG-TERM MARKET GROWS OVER RENEWABLES AND ALSO POWER OVERALL IS I MEAN TREMENDOUS GLOBALLY UH THE TREND TO ELECTRIFICATION AND TO GREEN IS VERY SUPPORTING AND THERE ALSO DON'T SEE A LIMITING FACTOR OF FUNDS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE GOOD PROJECTS I THINK INVESTORS ARE ACTUALLY UM LOOKING FOR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND NOW YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF WHO ACTUALLY BRINGS WHAT TO THE TABLE I MEAN THE MARKET CLOSES THERE ITSELF FUNDS IS NOT THE PROBLEM SO WHAT YOU NEED IS EXPERIENCE IN THE PIPELINE THANK YOU THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU ALBERTO NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF ROB PAULINE FROM MORGAN STANLEY PLEASE GO AHEAD HI UM YES GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE UM SO UM FIRST QUESTION MARKUS UM IS UM PLEASE TALK ABOUT THE EU RECOVERY FUND UM AND HOW DO YOU THINK INTERNALLY THAT RWE WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS UM AND A A SECOND PART TO THAT NOT A SECOND QUESTION CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND PRACTICALLY HOW THE MONEY FLOWS FROM A NUMBER ON A PRESENTATION SLIDE INTO ACTUAL PROJECTS 'CAUSE THAT'S STILL SEEMS VERY UNCLEAR UM AND THE SECOND QUESTION AND HOPEFULLY A LOT SIMPLER UM IS YOU HAVE SECURITY TO MAKE YOUR AGENT IN UK UM COULD YOU PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE PROCESS YOU HAVE FOR LEASES FOR SOME OF THE OTHER EXTENSIONS YOU'D LIKED THAT THE CMD NAMELY GREATER GABBARD GALLOPER AND RAMPION UM HAS THAT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IS THAT UNDERWAY OR IS THAT NOT THIS YEAR'S BUSINESS THANK YOU UH LET ME START WITH THE EASIER ONE ROB UM I MEAN WE ARE WORKING ON THE LEASE EXTENSIONS AND UM WE IT WILL BE AROUND 800 TO 1.2 800 MEGAWATTS TO 1.2 GIGAWATTS AND UM WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN UH FINALIZE IT AND BY THEN UH BOOK IT AS UM AS UH AT LEAST SECURED BY THE END OF THE YEAR UM BUT IT'S GOING UM IT'S GOING WELL UM AND UH ON THE EUROPEAN RECOVERY FUND LET ME START WITH THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION UM YEAH I MEAN I THINK WE WILL WE WILL WE WILL LEARN ABOUT IT OVER THE NEXT UM LET'S SAY TWO QUARTERS UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR HOW THE FLOW OF THE MONEY WILL REALLY GO BECAUSE USUALLY THE EUROPEAN UNION WORKS IN A WAY THAT IT'S JUST UH THEY DON'T HAVE THEY HAVE ONLY LITTLE FUNDS LIKE THE JUST TRANSITION FUND AND STUFF LIKE THAT WHERE IT'S DOUBLE DIGIT MILLION WHERE THEY PUT MONEY DIRECTLY INTO SPECIFIC PROJECTS USUALLY THE EUROPEAN UNION'S BUDGET IS A HUGE KIND OF I MEAN SHIFTING MECHANISMS SO PEOPLE ARE PAYING NET IN AND GETTING MONEY IN THAT OUT SO WHAT NOW AS A NEXT STEP NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES NEEDS TO COME UP WITH PROGRAMS AND PLANS WHERE TO INVEST THE MONEY AND IF THAT TICKS ALL BOXES THEY WILL GET THEIR PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THE MONEY SO WE NEED TO WAIT FOR NATIONAL ACTIONS WHERE THEY KIND OF PUT AND WHERE THEY WANT TO INVEST AND HOW THEY SUPPORT CERTAIN THINGS IS ALSO UNCLEAR I MEAN YOU CAN DO IT WITH DIRECT SUBSIDY YOU CAN DO IT WITH THE REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK IS SIMPLER SIMPLER FINANCING I MEAN IT'S IT'S STILL TOTALLY UNCLEAR UM AND UM THE ONLY THING WHAT WE CAN DO AND THAT'S THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION I MEAN WE ARE UM WE ARE ALSO NOW ACTIVELY LOOKING ESPECIALLY IN IN THE IN THE EVOLVING H2 SECTOR AND OF COURSE WHAT IS OBVIOUS IS IF MORE RENEWABLE POWER IS NEEDED AND YOU GET INDIRECT REMUNERATION FROM AND FOR RENEWABLE POWER VIA THE SUPPORT OF DEMAND FOR GREEN HYDROGEN WE ARE DEFINITELY READY TO BUILD MORE RENEWABLES BUT WE ARE ALSO WILLING TO INVEST INTO THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT AGREEMENT WE FIND WITH THE PARTNERS IS IT BETTER OF OUR MONEY OR THERE AND HOW DO YOU STRUCTURE THE CONTRACT THE QUESTION IS WHO PUTS MONEY INTO TRANSPORTATION MAYBE MAYBE MORE OTHERS IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THAT NEEDS TO BE UNBUNDLED I MANY OPEN QUESTIONS SO I THINK THE IMPORTANT STEP NOW IS TO GET THE RIGHT PARTNERS UM TOGETHER AND THINKING THROUGH UM WHAT IS FEASIBLE AND YOU SHOULD USUALLY START WITH THE DEMAND I MEAN WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS THE HYDROGEN AND THEN UH YOU YOU DO UM YOU BACKWARD YET UM AND I MEAN I THINK THESE ARE THE BIG FEARS UM OUR ACCOUNT BUSINESS ALREADY SAW ESPECIALLY RENEWABLES AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGY AND THE NEW ONE WHICH WILL COME IN ADDITIONAL IS HYDROGEN BUT ALSO I WANT TO KIND OF NOT SPOIL THE PARTY BUT I MEAN IF YOU TALK ABOUT PROFITS FROM ESPECIALLY HYDROGEN PROBABLY WE NEED TO WAIT A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE IT IS RELEVANT UM IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PROFITABILITY UM AND MAYBE UM THE KICKSTART OF THE OF THE SOLAR AND WIND BUSINESS IS A GOOD PROXY IT COULD EASILY TAKE AT LEAST HALF A DECADE MAYBE A DECADE BEFORE IT BECOMES A RELEVANT PROFIT FIGURE THAT'S SUPER INTERESTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD LUCK WITH THE UM WITH THE LEASE FUNCTION THANK YOU WE WILL UPDATE YOU WHENEVER WE UH HAVE GOOD NEWS THANKS ROB NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF SAM HARRY FROM UBS PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION AND UM UH UH GREAT RESULTS TODAY I JUST WANTED TO ASK UM TWO QUESTIONS ONE ON RETURNS AND ONE ON FARM DOWN SO ONE ON RETURNS I THINK UM YOU HAD SPOKEN AT THE CMD ABOUT 100 TO 300 BITS SPREAD ABOVE WATTS AS BEING TYPICAL UH IN THE RENEWABLE BUSINESS THESE DAYS A 100 TO 300 BITS DOESN'T ACTUALLY SOUND THAT CRAZY AS AN ESTIMATE OF THE WATTS ACTUALLY UM AS WELL AND I DON'T KNOW THE LOWER THE WATTS THE LOWER THE SPREAD THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE THE SAME KIND OF VALUE CREATION RATIO SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT A YEAR OR TWO AGO IT WAS COMING TO TALK ABOUT HIGH SINGLE DIGIT RETURNS IN RENEWABLES OR MID TO HIGH SINGLE DIGIT RETURNS I'M TALKING ABOUT UN LEVERED PROJECT RETURNS BUT ARE WE NOW MORE LIKELY TO BE GOING INTO THE LOW SINGLE DIGIT RETURNS TERRITORY AND IS THAT YOU KNOW IS THAT POSSIBLY A FAIR OUTLOOK FOR OFFSHORE WIND AS WELL WHEREVER RETURNS IF THEY'VE BEEN A BIT HIGHER JUST LOVES TO LOVE TO KNOW WHAT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT THAT THAT THE KIND OF INDUSTRY LEVEL AND THEN MY FARM DOWN QUESTION IS JUST LOOK I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOING TO SEE OVER TIME AND MORE AND MORE PRESSURE FROM AUCTIONS AND TENDERS AND DEVELOPERS MAY BE EVENTUALLY FORCED TO BRING THE FARM DOWN PARTNER WITH THEM TO THE TENDER SO IF YOU LIKE THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE OF AUCTIONS WILL MEAN THAT THIS KIND OF EXTRA VALUE OF THE CHARGE THAT YOU CURRENTLY GET IN A FARM DOWN MIGHT EVENTUALLY GET CAPTURED BY THE CONSUMER UH OR YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC POLICY DURING THE TENDER SO I'M JUST WONDERING DO YOU THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER IN THE FUTURE YOU WILL SORT OF AS STANDARD GO TO AUCTIONS OR TENDERS WITH A WITH A FINANCE PARTNER ALONGSIDE AND HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANY SPECIFIC FUNDS OR PARTNERS ABOUT THAT KIND OF LONG-TERM APPROACH RETURNS AND FARM DOWN THANK YOU UH SAM THANKS UH THANKS FOR THE DISCUSSION I MEAN ON RETURNS I AGREE THAT UM WE DEFINITELY SEE THAT THE VEX ARE COMING COMING DOWN I MEAN I ALSO CAREFULLY READ YOUR YOUR REPORT AND YOU ALSO PUT NOW VERY LOW NUMBERS TO VEX UM WHICH I THINK IS IS THE RIGHT THING UM AND UM BUT I'M NOT THERE THAT I WOULD SAY WE SEE NOW LOW SINGLE DIGIT RETURNS FOR UM FOR FOR OFFSHORE THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE I MEAN DEFINITELY IF WE HAVE PROMISED YOU UH THE AVERAGE HIGHER OUT OF AN UN LEVERED PROJECT OF 650 BASIS POINTS UM FOR THE FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM WE HAVE OUTLINED UNTIL 2022 UM POTENTIALLY THE ABSOLUTE RETURNS NOT THE VALUE CREATION BUT THE ABSOLUTE RETURNS OF THE NEXT CAPEX PROGRAM WILL BE LOWER BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE VEX IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL I'M NOT AT UM LOW MEDIUM I MEAN LOW FOR ME IS THREE AND THREE SOMETHING IT WILL COME DOWN BUT I MEAN WHAT WE SEE IS NOT FOR THE FOR THE PROJECTS WHICH WE WHICH WE HAVE AFTER THE 22 HORIZON ALREADY VISIBILITY OF THE PROFITABILITY I WOULDN'T CALL THAT LOW IT'S MORE MEDIUM SAM NOW I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I GOT YOUR QUESTION I DON'T SEE I CLEARLY DON'T SEE THAT YOU HAVE TENDERS WHERE YOU NEED TO BRING YOUR FINANCING OR WHERE YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IF YOU DON'T GO INTO THE AUCTION ALONE AND GETTING AN ADVANTAGE WHEN YOU ALREADY BRING THE FINANCING PARTNER I HAVEN'T SEEN THINGS LIKE THAT WHAT IS MORE AND MORE OBVIOUS IS THAT ALSO NOW THE NEW TENDER DECIDE TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE FOR TAIWAN THAT UM LOCAL I MEAN LOCAL PRODUCTION BECOMES A DOMINANT THEME THAT UM IF YOU WANT TO PUT MONEY IN SOME PLACE YOU NEED TO PROVE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD FOR THE REGIONS WHERE YOU GET THE LEASE IT'S GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE YOU CREATE JOBS UH YOU USE LOCAL SUPPLIERS AND IT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE SUPPORT VERY IMPORTANT BUT WHAT I DON'T SEE IS THAT IT'S ADVANTAGE THAT YOU ALREADY WITH THE AUCTION SAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT OF BRING A FINANCING PARTNER INTERESTING <CROSSTALK> WANT TO HAVE CLARIFICATION NO NO NO THAT'S FINE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME BUT I'M SURE WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS AGAIN AND THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR <INAUDIBLE> TO THEM WE WILL THANK YOU THANK YOU SAM NEXT QUESTION THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF JOHN MUSK FROM RBC PLEASE GO AHEAD YES UH MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE UH FIRSTLY ON THE HEDGING OF THE OUTRIGHT BOOK IT LOOKS AS IF YOU'VE ACCELERATED THE FULLY HEDGED PORTION PARTICULARLY IN 2022 UM OBVIOUSLY IT'S A QUITE A SMALL CHART BUT FROM MAYBE ROUGHLY 30 TO 50% WHICH UH IS PROBABLY MORE THAN YOU WOULD NORMALLY DO IN A QUARTER SO JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND SOME THINKING BEHIND THAT IS THERE A PARTICULAR VIEW ON ON POWER PRICES OR SPREADS THAT THESE LEVELS UH AND THEN SECONDLY ON THE THE THREE TIMES LEVERAGE FACTOR JUST TO CONFIRM THAT'S NOT INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL ASSET ROTATION AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME SOME HEADLINES IN IN RECENT DAYS AROUND SOME OF YOUR YOUR OFFSHORE ASSETS THAT YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING TO SELL DOWN UM JOHN THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN ON HEDGING YOU ARE RIGHT WE INCREASED UH THE OUTRIGHT HEDGE SO BUT WE ACTUALLY CLOSED BY THAT WAS THE SPREAD POSITION UM IS THERE I MEAN WHAT YOU COULD READ INTO IT IS UM IF YOU THINK SPREADS ARE FAIR IS PART OF OF DE-RISKING NOW TO CLOSE IT UM AND UM I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT CURRENT MARKET PRICES AND SPREADS I THINK EVERYBODY EXPECTS A HUNDRED PERCENT RECOVERY BY 22 AND IF YOU WANT TO LOCK THAT IN YOU BETTER CLOSE THAT POSITION NOW UM AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT WE I MEAN WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WILL LOOK LIKE BUT IT'S BETTER TO LOCK IT IN NOW THAN TO KEEP IT OPEN UM ON THE LEVERAGE SIDE UM THE THREE TIMES A NET DEBT TO EBITDA INCLUDES OUR PLANS ON CAPITAL ROTATION SO IT IS IT IS IT IS OUR NET INVESTMENT TARGET I MEAN WE HAVE OUTLINED A NET INVESTMENT UM OF AROUND 1.5 TO 2 BILLION PER ANNUM SO IF UM WE'RE GONNA INVEST GROSS MORE UH GIVEN THE THE THE PROFILE AND IT ALSO INCLUDES DIVESTMENT I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT WE DIVESTED UM WHICH IS NOT YET IN THE FINANCIALS UH GEORGIA BIOMASS FOR CLOSE TO $200 MILLION 175 AND SOME ADJUSTMENTS UM AND UM I MEAN ON THE OTHER THINGS WE ARE CONSIDERING OUR OPTIONS UM SO UM WE WILL BRING IT TO THE NET FIGURE BUT I NOW DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON GROSS AND NET BECAUSE WE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE LEADING METRICS IS 13 GIGAWATT NET SO WHATEVER WE DO ON DISPOSALS WE WILL REACH THE 13 GIGAWATT NET AND ALSO THE EBITDA GUIDE IS FOR 2022 IT'S A NET GUIDANCE YEAH SO AND HOW ARE WE GONNA ACHIEVE IS THIS HOW MUCH COSTS AND HOW MUCH DISPOSALS THAT UH WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTIES IN SOME MARKETS WE NEED TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY AND I MEAN IF YOU NOW WANT TO GET A COMMENT ON THE UM ON THE ON THE RUMORS ON THIS PROVIDENCE I MEAN THE COMMENT IS NO COMMENT BECAUSE SIR I MEAN UH WE WILL UPDATE YOU WHEN WE HAVE TAKEN A DECISION NOT UH WE WILL NOT UPDATE YOU WHETHER WE HAVE ON A CERTAIN ASSETS A MARKET CHEST OR NOT OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU JOHN NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF DEEPA VENKATESWARAN FROM BERNSTEIN PLEASE GO AHEAD UH THANK YOU UH SO MY TWO QUESTIONS FOR <INAUDIBLE> UM IN THE US SO IF WE DO HAVE A POSSIBILITY FOR JOE BIDEN AND UH THEY BRING IN UH THE 2 TRILLION PLAN I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW DOES THAT CHANGE WOULD YOU ACCELERATE YOUR GROWTH YOUR DE-CONVERSION OF YOUR PIPELINE IN THE US OR PRACTICALLY HOW MIGHT IT CHANGE ANYTHING FOR YOU UH AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS UH IS ON THE IS ON GERMANY ITSELF UH SO OBVIOUSLY GERMANY HAS PRETTY LOFTY TARGETS FOR 2030 BUT WE'RE SEEING THE AUCTIONS ARE CONTINUING TO GO UNDER SUBSCRIBE ON ONSHORE WIND DO YOU SEE THIS SITUATION CHANGING WITH ANY KIND OF REFORMS AND WOULD YOU BE UH TAKING THE LEAD AS I DON'T KNOW GERMANY'S NATIONAL CHAMPION ON THIS TOO TO ALSO GRAB MAYBE MORE MORE OF THE SHARES AND THE GERMAN RENEWABLE MARKETS THANK YOU YEAH DEEPA THANKS FOR THE QUESTION THE FIRST ONE IS EASY WE ACTUALLY DON'T EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FROM A POTENTIAL FEDERAL ELECTION OUTCOME IN THE US ON OUR BUSINESS I MEAN UM I MEAN EVEN TODAY I MEAN MANY THINGS DEPEND ON NON-STATE LEVEL UM OF COURSE THE TECH SUPPORT IS A FEDERAL THING UM BUT ALSO THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION UM EXTENDED THE PTCS UH GIVEN THE COVID SITUATION SO I MEAN AS IT'S PURE SPECULATION I WOULD SAY IT WILL NOT MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE UM AND UH ON GERMANY UM OF COURSE WE WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE IN ONSHORE AND UM IN ONSHORE IN GERMANY UM AND WE SEE UNDER SUBSCRIBED OPTIONS THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PROJECTS ARE NOT READY UM TO BE BID INTO THE OPTIONS UM WE HAVE PERMITTING ISSUES WE HAVE UM PENDING LAW CASES AND SO ON BUT THERE IS SOME INTERESTING UM DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS HE TABLED A LAW A DRAFT LAW YESTERDAY OR TWO DAYS AGO WHERE THEY REALLY WANNA ACCELERATE THE PERMITTING PROCESS AND THE COURT PROCEEDINGS AND UM THEY ALSO INTRODUCED SOMETHING WHICH IS NOW HEAVILY DISCUSSED ALSO WITH THE NGOS THAT EVEN IF YOU UM IF YOU DISPUTE A PERMISSION IN COURT UM THAT SHOULD STILL UNTIL THE DECISION IS THERE ALLOW THE CONSTRUCTION TO GO ON UM AND THAT WOULD BE BOTH VERY HELPFUL SO SPEEDIER PROCESSES AND YOU CAN UH GO STRAIGHT TO THE FINAL COURT LEVEL TO GET A DECISION AND YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO THE HIERARCHY AND ALSO UM THAT NOBODY CAN BY PURE TACTICS IN THE COURT UH DELAY PROJECTS UM BUT LET'S SEE HOW THE DRAFT WILL GO THROUGH PARLIAMENT BUT THE DRAFT VERSION AT LEAST LOOKS VERY FAVORABLE FOR THE INDUSTRY PERFECT THANK YOU THANK YOU DEEPA NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF PETRO SOLOWSKI FROM CT PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS PETRO SOLOWSKI FROM CT I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS UM THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE A SMALL ON NORDEX UH CAN YOU UH SAY WHAT'S THE KIND OF A CURRENT COST STRUCTURE OF IT HOW IS IT SIGNIFICANT NUMBER SMALL NUMBER IN ANNUAL EURO FIGURE AS A COST AS YOU TAKE OVER THE WHOLE COMPANY AND SECONDLY UM I WANTED TO ASK YOU ON THIS YEAR TO GO BACK TO THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE UH BEFORE THE COVID 19 I THOUGHT THAT IS AN EQUILIBRIUM WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE SWITCHING BETWEEN COAL AND GAS AS POWER PLANTS NOW IF WE TAKE COAL UH ASSETS OUT WHAT WILL BE ACCORDING TO YOU UH YOUR EXPECTATION THE NEXT EQUILIBRIUM KIND OF THRESHOLD HOW WE WILL THE MARKET WILL RESTORE LONGER TERM UH EQUITY OF DEMAND THE CO2 PROJECT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ELIMINATION OF CO2 WHAT'S THE NEXT THING TO LOOK FOR UH PETRO THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN ON NORDEX IT'S EASY I MEAN WE TAKE OVER THE COMPANY YES BUT IT'S A DEVELOPING COMPANY SO WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS THE SALARIES AND OPEX FOR THE 70 PEOPLE AND OF COURSE THE DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES FOR THE TO DEVELOP PROJECTS BUT I MEAN PART OF THAT IS ALSO CAPITALIZED SO IT'S A VERY I MEAN IN TERMS OF ADDITION TO THE COST BASE IT'S ALMOST NOT RELEVANT UM I MEAN THE MOST RELEVANT ONE WILL BE UH THE WEBEX FOR THE PROJECT AND THEN THE CAPEX UM ON CO2 EQUILIBRIUM I MEAN UM YEAH ACTUALLY THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THE CURRENT CO2 PRICE IS ALREADY ABOVE THE FUEL SWITCHING PRICE FROM HARDCORE TO GAS UH THE GAS TAKING MOST OF THE TIMES LOOKS UM GAS FIRST THEN LIQUID AND THEN UM HARD COAL SO IF YOU TAKE OUT UM HARD COAL NOW THAT SHOULDN'T CHANGE THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN UM FOR THE CO2 RELEVANT SHOOT SWITCHING PRICE THERE SHOULDN'T BE A CHANGE THE INTERESTING ELEMENTS AS I SAID IT'S ALREADY TRADING ABO ABOVE THE CURRENT <INAUDIBLE> LEVEL UH THAT CAN ONLY BE UM EXPLAINED THAT ACTUALLY THE INDUSTRY EXPECTS A SHORTAGE AND UM THIS IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE BECAUSE THIS MARKET IS NOT UH UM IN ANY OF THE MARKET IT'S ALSO SINCE YOU CAN EASILY KEEP YOUR CERTIFICATES FOR LONGER UM YOU CAN ALSO SAY IT'S PARTLY A VIEW ON WHAT TO COME IN FUTURE YEARS UM SO I WOULD NOT OVERRATE UH THE ANNUAL PRICE WHICH CAUSES FUEL SWITCHING THAT WAS IN THE OLD DAYS OF OVERSUPPLY A GOOD INDICATOR BUT NOW THE SIGNIFICANT MORE TIME IS TO COME MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE RELEVANT INDICATOR ANYMORE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU PETRO NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF ELSIEN MAMADOV FROM BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE PLEASE GO AHEAD HI THERE TWO QUESTIONS FROM ME PLEASE UH THE FIRST ONE IS ON NEGATIVE PRICES AND I'M SORRY IF YOU COVERED IT BEFORE I MISSED THE VERY BEGINNING BASICALLY <INAUDIBLE> REPORTED YESTERDAY IT WAS A SMALL ISSUE FOR THEM BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW IF THE PRICE HAS BEEN NEGATIVE FOR THE UH SUBSEQUENT FEW HOURS YOUR CFD AND WHATNOT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T RECOUP IT YOURSELF WITH IT SO UM IS THAT UH HAVE YOU SEEN IT BEING AN ISSUE WITH YOU FOR THE UH FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND UM DO YOU THINK THE NEGATIVE PRICES WILL BECOME MORE OR LESS PREVALENT GOING FORWARD THE SECOND QUESTION IS ON HYDROGEN UM IT CAN UM W WHERE DO YOU THINK THE VALUE WILL LIE IS IT IN THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN TRANSPORTATION OF HYDROGEN CONVERTING IT TO OTHER FUELS LIKE KEROSENE ET CETERA WHERE DO YOU THINK THE MONEY WILL BE AND WILL YOU BE A BIG PLAYER THERE THANK YOU UM IF I COULD ANSWER THE LAST QUESTION <LAUGH> UM LIFE WOULD BE EASIER IF I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL IT ALSO DEPENDS ON HOW WILL THE HOW WILL THE INCENTIVIZATION FRAMEWORK LOOK LIKE AND HOW BIG WILL THE MARKET BECOME UM AND OF COURSE IT HAS HAS THE TWO ANGLES YOU CAN INCENTIVIZE GREEN PRODUCTION AND YOU CAN INCENTIVIZE DEMAND FOR GREEN HYDROGEN UM AND UM IN THE END IT WILL BE THEN KIND OF DEMAND-SUPPLY ON ON ON ON THE DIFFERENT ANGLES WHERE I ACTUALLY DON'T SEE SCARCITY IN UM THE PRODUCTION OF GREEN HYDROGEN IN TERMS OF ELECTROLYZERS I MEAN THAT'S A PROVEN TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE DEFINITELY HAVE UM SCARCITY ALREADY TODAY IS UM RENEWABLE PROJECTS BECAUSE UM I MEAN UM IF YOU BELIEVE UM ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR GAS AND I HAVE NO DOUBTS THAT THERE IS UH A GOOD ASSESSMENT WE NEED SO MUCH GREEN ENERGY UM THAT EVERY PROJECT WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN THE PIPELINE OF SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE BUILT ONE DAY IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TIME SO THIS IS REALLY A SCARCITY UM ON THE DEMAND SIDE I THINK THAT WILL BE A COMPETITION BY THE OFF-TAKERS WHO IS WHO CAN WHO CAN WHO CAN DO IT CHEAPER IT'S NOTHING FOR US I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU ASK ME WHERE I SEE OUR ROLE IT'S DEFINITELY ON THE UM PRODUCTION SIDE GREEN POWER POTENTIALLY DEPENDING ON HOW THE CONSORTIA WILL WILL LOOK LIKE ALSO THE PRODUCTION OF GREEN HYDROGEN AND THEN THE STRUCTURING OF THE OFF-TAKE I MEAN AS WE ARE CURRENTLY ALSO A VERY RELEVANT PLAYER IN GAS TRADING UH AND PROVIDING SOLUTIONS TO CUSTOMERS AND THAT WILL ALSO OUR ROLE BE IN H2 AND YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT PRODUCING AS WE CURRENTLY DO WITH LNG AND NATURAL GAS THE FIRST QUESTION ON NEGATIVE PRICES I MEAN FOR US I MEAN WE HAVE SEEN IT UM IN THE UK AND GERMANY BUT UM IT'S NOT UH IT WAS NOT A RELEVANT ISSUE I MEAN IT WAS NOT A BIG NUMBER OKAY THANKS A LOT APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF <UNK> FROM <UNK> PLEASE GO AHEAD YES HI THANK YOU UM TWO QUESTIONS FROM MY SIDE AS WELL I WAS JUST WONDERING IF IF WE COULD GET A LITTLE BIT MORE COLOR FROM YOU AROUND THE SORT OF HOW DO YOU SEE THIS AS THE VALUE CREATION OPPORTUNITY RELATING TO THE NORDEX PIPELINE ESPECIALLY THE SORT OF THE NEAR TERM ASSETS BECAUSE YOU YOU MENTIONED IT'S A IT'S A MATURE MARKET SOME OF THE NEAR TERM PROJECTS ARE FAIRLY WELL-DEVELOPED CLOSE TO SCALE SORT OF MARKET WHERE WE HAD SCALE IN THE PAST I WAS INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT MORE HOW YOU SEE THE SORT OF THE VALUE PROPOSITION FROM COMMODITY AND I GUESS THE SECOND QUESTION IS UM RELATING TO THAT I THINK YOU MENTIONED EARLIER RIGHT THIS WAS ONE OF THE MARKETS YOU DIDN'T HAVE PRESENCE AND AND THEREFORE YOU WERE YOU WERE SORT OF LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES LOOKING AT YOUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO EITHER FROM A PIPELINE PERSPECTIVE OR A SKILL PERSPECTIVE ARE THERE ANY SORT OF SPECIFIC GAPS THAT YOU SEE THAT YOU THINK SORT OF THIS SORT OF SCALING UP PUT SORT OF BENEFIT BENEFI YOU QUITE BENEFICIAL THANK YOU YEAH PERFECT UM THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN ON UM I WOULD NOT SAY THAT WE FAILED ON FRANCE BECAUSE WHERE WE WE WERE SIMPLY NOT PRESENT UM IT WAS ALWAYS A STRATEGIC TARGET TO GET A FOOT IN THE DOOR AND NOW WE HAVE NOT ONLY A FOOT IN THE DOOR BUT A A SIGNIFICANT PIPELINE AND THE NORDEX TEAM WAS ACTUALLY VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE FRENCH MARKET I THINK THEY'RE RANKED NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF SUCCESS RATES IN TWO AUCTIONS IN THE LAST YEARS AND THEY HAVE NOT ONLY BUILT THIS PIPELINE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL WAS TO BUILD AND THEN WHEN THEY WERE CLOSE TO FID AND THEY GOT THEM TO THE AUCTION THEY SOLD THE PROJECTS TO THEIR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS UM AND I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS THE VALUE CREATION POTENTIAL FOR US I MEAN UH IT'S WE CONTINUE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST AND WE CLOSE OUR STRATEGIC GAP UM AND THE TEAM IS NOT THERE JUST TO DELIVER THE PIPELINES WHICH WE HAVE ACQUIRED THEY WILL CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOP PROJECTS AND THE FRENCH MARKET OVERALL IS VERY ATTRACTIVE UM IT'S IT'S NOT NOT SO DENSELY POPULATED LIKE GERMANY SO YOU HAVE MORE SPACE UM THEY HAVE HUGE BUILD OUTS TARGET AND EVEN BETTER REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK WITH A DOUBLE SIDED-20 YEAR INFLATION-LINKED CFD UM SO IF YOU BELIEVE THAT UM UM ONSHORE WIND IN FRANCE IS GOOD IT WILL DEFINITELY CREATE VALUE AND I MEAN WE ARE A FIRM BELIEVER THAT ALSO THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN FRANCE UM AND THEIR TARGETS WAS TO GO STRAIGHT FROM NUCLEAR TO RENEWABLES UM WILL NOT BE WILL NOT BE QUESTIONED BY SOME OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT SO IT'S IT'S A VERY INTACT UH CROSS-PLATFORM THE GAPS IN OUR PIPELINE I MEAN I THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO BE HONEST I MEAN IF YOU LOOK INTO THAT UM WE ARE VERY WIND HEAVY SO DOING MORE ON THE SOLAR SIDE WOULD DEFINITELY BE GOOD UM LET'S SEE HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE IT I MEAN WE HAVE DEFINITELY RAMPED UP OUR UM OUR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND YOU WILL SEE UH MORE TO COME ESPECIALLY IN THE ATTRACTIVE SOLAR MARKET LIKE IN THE US UM BUT STILL IT'S COMPARED TO THE WIND SIDE UM UNDERREPRESENTED AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH IS DEFINITELY SIGNIFICANTLY TOUGHER MAYBE IMPOSSIBLE TO CLOSE IF YOU LOOK INTO OUR OFFSHORE PIPELINE THERE IS IN TERMS OF COD DATES AND THAT'S HISTORICALLY EXPLAINABLE BECAUSE E.ON STOPPED AND ENERGY HAD ALSO FUNDING ISSUES UM BUT WE HAVE A GAP BETWEEN ' 22 UH WHERE WE WILL COMMISSION TRYTANOL AND THEN MAYBE THE NEXT PROJECT WILL BE COMMISSIONED ACCORDING TO THE PIPELINE AT AROUND ' 25 MAYBE ' 26 AND THAT IS I MEAN THIS IS A PROFILE HOW WILL HOW IT LOOKS LIKE AND IF YOU ASK ME YOU HAVE TWO WISHES I WOULD LIKE TO FILL THAT TIME GAP AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE ON THE SOLAR SIDE THANK YOU VERY CLEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU AHMAD NEXT QUESTION PLEASE THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF FIRMINO MOCADO FROM MAN GLG PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME HELLO UM JUST UH I MEAN TWO QUICK QUESTIONS ONE YOU'VE SEEN UH DEEP OFFSHORE UH WINDS FLOATING I MEAN WHAT'S YOUR VIEW IN TERMS OF UH THE THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AROUND AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ENVISION THAT WILL BE THE THE ROLE OF RWE OKAY AND THANKS FOR THE QUESTION BECAUSE I MEAN I CAN USE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY WHAT OUR INTEREST IS I MEAN WE ARE NOT TURBINE MANUFACTURERS SO UM WE ARE NOT BETTING ON A CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY UM AND UM I HAVE NO VIEW AND ALSO THE TEAM HAS NO VIEW WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL BEST FLOATING TECHNOLOGY FOR WHICH MARKET UH AND WHICH UM SEA SEA CONDITIONS UM SO WHAT WE SAID IS LET'S PARTICIPATE IN DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES BE IT THE BE IT CONCRETE OR BE IT STEEL I MEAN YOU HAVE ALSO DIFFERENT I MEAN I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THAT BUT YOU PROBABLY YOU ARE YOU HAVE TOTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THAT AND WHAT WE SAID IS WE WANT TO BE PART OF CONSORTIUM OF SEVERAL TECHNOLOGIES TO BE AN EARLY LEARNER WE WANT TO LEARN HOW THIS STUFF WORKS BECAUSE UM IT IS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN A FIXED BOTTOM IT IS UH IN TERMS OF WIND FIELD IN TERMS OF MAINTENANCE COSTS AND SO ON UM AND WE WANT TO LEARN THAT WITH DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WILL IN FUTURE IF WE GO INTO OFFSHORE ONLY USE THE TECHNOLOGIES WHERE WE HAVE BEEN A PARTNER EARLIER ON WE CAN ALSO USE OTHERS SO <CROSSTALK> AND YOU UH YOU ASKED FOR OUR ROLE OUR ROLE IS WE WANT TO BE UM WE WANT TO CONSTRUCT AND WE WANT TO OPERATE ALSO OFFSHORE WIND FARMS BUT WE DON'T WANT TO BUILD THE TURBINES OR THE OR THE UH THE FOUNDATION VERY CLEAR AND AND JUST PERHAPS TO TIE UP WITH ALBERTA'S QUESTION AND THE ROLE OF OIL COMPANIES I MEAN YOU <INAUDIBLE> ACTUALLY THAT DEPO FALL UH YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE UH THAT TO DO YOU KNOW IN IN IN IN JOINT VENTURE OR IN CONCEPTION WITH OIL COMPANIES THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED FROM OFFSHORE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S SPECULATION I MEAN BUT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR UM PARTNERSHIP UM LANDSCAPE I MEAN WE ARE OPERATING ONE OFFSHORE WIND FARM TOGETHER WITH EQUINOR I MEAN THEY ARE PARTNERS OF ONE OF OUR FARMS ONE OF THE FLOATING UM TECHNOLOGIES WE ARE IN VIA TOGETHER WITH SHELL IN BUT I THINK I MEAN THAT CAN GO THE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER I MEAN IT'S TOO EARLY I MEAN WE ARE OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS UM BUT WE COULD ALSO DO IT OURSELVES I MEAN AND AND UH AND RELATED QUESTION W WHEN I COMPARE RWE AND YOUR STRATEGY AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT IT TO BE WITH THE WITH THE LEADERS IN THE IN RENEWABLES SO YOU KNOW IN EUROPE THE <INAUDIBLE> SETTLING ONE OF THE COMPONENTS MISSING ON THE INVESTMENT PIECE IS IS IS THE FULL COMMITMENT TO A GROWING DIVIDEND I MEAN W WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN HAVE THAT FULL COMMITMENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF GROWTH DO YOU ENVISION THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU YOU CAN SUSTAIN I WOULD NOT COMPARE TO <UNK> I MEAN ENOL IS A FULLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES WITH UM I MEAN MOST OF THE VALUE SITTING IN THE NETWORKS AND THEY DON'T OPERATE OFFSHORE I MEAN OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS I MEAN IS D IS DIFFERENT UM WE HAVE ACTUALLY GIVEN A CLEAR COMMITMENT TO A GROWING DIVIDEND WE SAID UM WE WANT TO CONTINUOUSLY GROW WITH THE GROW THE DIVIDEND BROADLY IN WHY LINE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OF UM OF THE EARNINGS OF OUR OPERATING CORE BUSINESS UM AND SINCE THE CORE BUSINESS GIVEN OUR INVESTMENT PLANS WILL DEFINITELY GROW ALSO THE DIVIDEND SHOULD GROW UM AND WE DISCUSSED IT BEFORE SO I SAID I MEAN A GOOD PROXY IS MAYBE THE FIVE CENTS ON TOP EVERY YEAR WHICH WE HAVE NOW DELIVERED UH FOR THE LAST YEARS I MEAN UM THAT CAN BE MAYBE EVEN MORE BECAUSE OF COURSE THE PERCENTAGE GOES TO ON IF YOU STICK TO A TO AN ABSOLUTE CENT NUMBER BUT I THAT'S A COMMITMENT WE HAVE GIVEN WE WANT TO GROW THE DIVIDEND IN LINE WITH UM EARNINGS DEVELOPMENT IN CORE BU IN THE CORE BUSINESS BUT IF THE CORE BUSINESS FOR WHATEVER REASON CANNOT SUSTAIN UH UH UH I MEAN CANNOT GROW I MEAN WHAT'S YOUR COMMITMENT AND YOU WILL CUT THE DIVIDEND IN LINE WITH THE WITH THE DECLINE OF EARNINGS ON THE CORE BUSINESS YOU SHOULD KNOW I MEAN WE SHOULD STICK TO THE TWO QUESTIONS RULE SO I'LL STILL ANSWER THAT ONE BUT THEN WE SHOULD GIVE THE NEXT ONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OTHERWISE WE NEED TO DO IT IN A IN A IN A ONE-ON-ONE SESSION OBVIOUSLY <INAUDIBLE> UM I MEAN IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES I MEAN THE FIRST THING WHICH IS QUESTIONABLE THEN IS WHY DO YOU ONLY PAY OUT 50% OF YOUR PRACTICE AS DIVIDENDS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT EMPLOY IT SOMEWHERE SO THAT WOULD TOTALLY CHANGE THE DIVIDEND POLICY BUT IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF A CAP THEN THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION PLEASE AS A REMINDER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS * 1 ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF ROB PAULI ROB PAULINE FROM MORGAN STANLEY PLEASE GO AHEAD YEAH HI ROB PAULINE I REJOINED TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION IF THAT'S OKAY UM BUT GIVEN YOU'VE ANSWERED OR NOT ANSWERED THE QUESTION ON THE HUMBER CAN I ASK ABOUT US DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES A WONDERFUL SUBJECT UM A US EXPOSE UTILITY REPORTED YESTERDAY A LARGE TAX CHARGE AS PROJECTS REACHED COD AND THEY ENTERED INTO A TAX EQUITY PARTNERSHIP SO WILL WE SEE A SIMILAR TAX IMPACT AT RWE AS IT REACHES COD ON YOUR US PROJECTS THANK YOU UM THE TAX ANSWER THE QUESTION TO THE TEXT THE ANSWER TO THE TEXT QUESTION IS EASY NO WE DON'T EXPECT ANY HUGE NUMBER UM BUT MAYBE THE SITUATION IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU SAID A US UTILITY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TAX CAPACITY OURSELVES SO SINCE WE DON'T HAVE TAX CAPACITY OUR TAXES IN THE US

        "model_prediction": "MUSIC PLAYS I'm joined by our CFO, Marcus Kreber, who will run through the presentation before we move on to Q&A later in the call. As in Q1 this year, in order to compare like for like, our presentation focuses on the pro forma figures in comparison to twenty nineteen. Meaning that assets taken over from Ion in the third quarter last year are included for adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA for the full year twenty nineteen. AND WITH THIS, LET ME HAND OVER TO MARCUS FOR THE UPDATE ON PAGE HUNDRED TWENTY TWENTY. THANK YOU THOMAS AND A WARM WELCOME TO EVERYONE ON THE PHONE. IT'S GOOD TO SPEAK TO YOU AND I REALLY HOPE YOU ARE SAFE AND SOUND WHEREVER YOU ARE DYING IN FROM TODAY. THE OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY HAS BEEN GOOD OVERALL AND SO FAR WE HAVE ONLY SEEN A SMALL IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS FROM THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEM This year or next year, adjusted EBITDA of our core business increased nine percent to one point five billion euros. The RWE groups adjusted EBITDA stands at one point eight billion euros. We confirm our full year guidance and now expect adjusted EBITDA to be at the upper end of the guidance. We also confirm our target to increase the dividend payment to eighty five cents per share for this year. STANDS AT SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION YUROS THIS IS A DECREASE BY Roughly NINE HUNDRED MILLION YUROS COMPARED TO QU ONE OUR CLEAR TARGET IS TO MEET A LEVERAGE FACTOR OF AROUND THREE TIMES ADJUSTED CORE IBDTA TO NET DEBT AT YEAR END AND WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT THE ASSET SWAP WITH AON IS FINALLY FULLY CLOSED THE LEGAL INTEGRATION AND THE H R INTEGRATION HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED THE TEAMS ARE NOW OPERATING IN THE TARGET MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE ACRO Let me remind you that the energy activities which we transferred back to AWE have been recorded in our group figures already as they were commercially assigned to us. We do not see any relevant effect from the final closing in our finances. What else? We are excited about our latest announcement on the deal to acquire Nordex's two point seven gigawatt development pipeline in onshore. WIND AND SOLAR THIS GIVES US GREAT OPTION FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND A BROAD ENTRY INTO THE FRENCH MARKET I WILL COME TO BACK I WILL COME BACK TO THAT IN A MINUTE REGARDING OUR COAL AND NUCLEAR BUSINESS WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE COAL PHASE OUT ACT WHICH FOUND BROAD CONSENSUS WAS BROUGHT INTO GERMAN LAW THE LIGNITE PHASE OUT IS SUPPLEMENTED BY A PUBLIC LAW CONTRACT DRAWN UP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE OPERATORS WHICH WILL PASS THE GERMAN PARLIAMENT THE LAW AND CONTRACT ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL UNDER U S STATE AID LAW. WE EXPECT THIS PROCESS TO HAPPEN IN AUTUMN THIS YEAR. WITH THIS, WE NOW HAVE A CLEAR PATH ON HOW TO EXIT FROM OUR REMAINING COAL OPERATIONS. LADY AND GENTLEMEN, LET ME BRIEFLY COME BACK TO THE TRANSACTION WITH NODAX ON PAGE FOUR. THIS TRANSACTION IS A STRATEGIC PIPELINE ENHANCEMENT AND OUR END OUR BROAD MARKET ENTRY INTO FRANCE. Strengthens our existing pipeline of twenty two gigawatts and the projects to be built will come on top of the targets announced at the capital market day. We expect cfds as early as next year and additional capacity of approximately five hundred megawatts in operations by twenty twenty five. We are also pleased that this creates a great opportunity to enter the french market. One point nine gigawatts of the development projects are in france of which roughly three hundred megawatts are close. France is a very attractive onshore market with huge built-out targets and a solid renumeration framework. France was the only large market in Europe where we were missing a pipeline and a strong development team together with a pipeline and an experienced team of seventy professionals mostly based in France will join us to drive our growth ambitions in France further in markets. WHERE WE ALREADY OPERATE ASSETS, THE PIPELINE GIVES ADDITIONAL OPTIONS. SPAIN APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATT, SWEDEN APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATT, AND POLAND A SMALL POSITION OF MORE THAN TEN MEGAWATT. WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS? WE HAVE AGREED AN EXCLUSIVE PUT OPTION WITH NODEX ON A PURCHASE PRICE OF FOUR HUNDRED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION EUROS. NODEX KICKS OFF THE CONSULTATION PROCESS WITH THE FRENCH WORKS COUNCIL WHICH NEED The transaction is also subject to foreign investment clearance in France and the completion of common carve-out processes. It is assumed that the transaction could be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. Now, back to the financials for H1 2022 on page five. In our core business adjusted EBITDA increased by nine percent to one point five billion euros as a result of a good performance in all segments. Broadly speaking, the good H1 2022 on page five. One result for offshore wind and onshore wind solar was due to the very good weather conditions in the first quarter and onshore capacity additions. The hydro biomass gas division mainly benefited from the resumption of gb capacity markets and the supply and trading division outperformed after a successful start into the year which continued in the second quarter. Ladies and gentlemen, our wind and solar business is progressing well. INSTALLED CAPACITY REMAINS UNCHANGED AT EIGHT POINT NINE GIGAWATT BUT THERE IS MORE TO COME IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND WE MADE GOOD PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR GROSS TARGETS FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO AMONGST OTHERS WE HAVE TAKEN THE F I D FOR THE HICKORY PARK SOLAR FARM IN THE US WHICH HAS A CAPACITY OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX GIGAWATT AND THE CO-LOCATED FORTY MEGAWATT BATTERY WHICH IS DUE TO BE COMMISSIONED IN TWENTY A thirty year PPA with Georgia Power regarding the period after twenty twenty two, the Avonmore offshore wind farm has secured an agreement for lease with the Crown Estate. The project is an extension of our operating Gwynt y Môr wind farm. The additional capacity is three hundred megawatts. What are the next steps? The development of the project will continue with a view to participating in CfD auction rounds in three to five years. Furthermore, we welcome the announcement from the Irish government that the Dublin Array offshore project has been designated as one of seven relevant projects, meaning it will be fast-tracked to the new marine planning regime. The project will add three hundred megawatts of capacity and is currently in the development phase. Subject to an updated consent application and investment decision construction could begin in twenty four with co d in twenty six. AND LASTLY, WE ARE NOW PARTICIPATING IN THE THIRD FLOATING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT, TOGETHER WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE AS WELL AS MITSUBISHI CORPORATION. WE WILL DEVELOP A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT OF THE COAST OF MAINE. WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND BECAUSE WE SEE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR FLOATING WIND FARMS WORLDWIDE, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES LIKE THE US WITH DEEPER COASTAL WATERS. LET'S MOVE ON TO AN UPDATE OF OUR CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. It is progressing well, apart from some COVID-19 related delays mainly at US construction sites, so that we had to shift CUDO of approximately five hundred megawatts from twenty to twenty-one. Due to the adjusted commissioning plan, we expect the overall financial impact for this year to be a small to medium double-digit million-euro amount. Please note that the PTC income level of the US project is secured in any cases. On all sides now, we'll take a look at the status of the individual projects we presented to you at Q1. Starting with the offshore division, our Trident Oil project offshore construction work started earlier this year and everything is progressing as planned. At the Kashkari project, contracts with main suppliers are signed, so preparation work is continuing and going according to plan. The construction work will start in Q3. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE the Klockanuk forest onshore wind farm is already generating and receiving revenues from the contract for difference as soon as wind farm testing is completed and CUO is reached fully reported as installed capacity grid availability at the Crannell onshore site has been achieved and the commissioning of the individual wind turbines is ramping up the actual commissioning date is scheduled for this month we have updated Our milestones and our big raymond onshore wind project one part of the project namely raymond west with twenty two hundred forty megawatts will slip into q one twenty one where the commissioning of raymond east with two hundred megawatts is expected in the second half of q four twenty twenty c u d of scotty rich has moved within the fourth quarter to the end of december this year on the basis of the adjusted timeline construction work is ongoing TRACK, COMMISSIONING RAMP UP WILL START SOON AND AT THE LYMEDALE SOLAR FARM, THE GUIDE REGISTRATION PROCESS TOOK MORE TIME THAN EXPECTED DUE TO THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES C U D HAS THEREFORE SLIPPED INTO PUEW ONE TWENTY ONE IN TOTAL WE WILL BRING ONE POINT THREE GIGAWATT ONLINE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR MAINLY BACK END LOADED WITH THAT WE CAN MOVE TO THE DETAILS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS THE OFFSHORE WIND DIVISION REALIZED AN ADJ EBITDA of five hundred eighty five million euros year on year this is an increase of nineteen percent thanks to higher wind speeds in the first quarter gross cash investments in h one amounted to three hundred sixteen million euros mainly driven by triton no construction work the sale of the sea brew installation vessel is the main driver for gross cash divestments we confirm the outlook for the offshore division our onshore wind division The Solar Division increased twelve percent year on year and adjusted EBITDA amounted to two hundred seventy three million euros at H1. Value drivers are an increase in capacity of approximately three hundred eighty million watts year on year as well as higher earnings in Europe from above average weather conditions in the first quarter this year. Most of the gross cash investments are for the US onshore projects Big Reedman, Scottyrich, and Cassadaga. AS WELL AS BOILING SPRINGS. DESPITE THE SMALL TO MEDIUM DOUBLE DIGIT MILLION EURO NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM TYPHOON COMMISSIONING PHASES AND THE DELAY AT BIG RAYMOND AND LYMANDALE WE CONFIRM THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR. THE HYDRO BIOMASS GAS DIVISION DELIVERED A GOOD PERFORMANCE OVER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. HIGHER EARNINGS RESULTS MAINLY FROM THE BRITISH CAPACITY MARKETS. IN CONTRAST TO THE STRONG FIRST WATER AT H1. FROM THE COMMERCIAL OPTIMIZATION OF OUR POWER PLANT DISPATCH HAVE NORMALIZED IN JUNE WE SIGNED A CONTRACT TO SELL OUR GEORGIA BIOMASS BUSINESS TO ANB PARTNERS FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION US DOLLARS THE TRANSACTION WAS CLOSED AT THE END OF JULY AFTER SUCCESSFUL MERGER CLEARANCE THE DISPOSAL IS ALREADY REFLECTED IN THE GUIDANCE WE GAVE YOU IN MARCH THE IBITDA CONTRIBUTION FOR PERFORMAER TWENTY NINE Nineteen was a good thirty million euros. In twenty twenty, it is approximately half this amount. As we have already reported to the market, the fire at the Ems-Hafen power plant has caused an interruption to the biomass co-firing which we expect to last until November twenty twenty. This will impact the output by a small to medium double digit million euro amount. Despite this, we also confirm the guidance for this division. Moving on to another quarter of favourable earnings development from the supply and trading division. At H1, adjusted ebitda amounted to three hundred twenty two million euros on the back of a strong trading performance and good results from the gas and lng business. We didn't expect the division to replicate the exceptional performance of the first six months of last year. The division's outlook is one hundred fifty to three hundred fifty million euros, given the strong performance. ONE WHICH WE EXPECT TO END AT THE UPPER END OR EVEN ABOVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HAVING NOW REPORTED ON THE CORE BUSINESS LET'S MOVE TO THE COAL AND NUCLEAR DIVISION A JUSTIFIED E B D A HAS DOUBLED HERE ON YEAR AND AMOUNTED TO THREE HUNDRED TEN MILLION YUROS AS WE ALREADY MENTIONED AT Q1 ONE ERNINGS IMPROVED DUE TO HIGHER REALIZED HOLESALE PRICES AND AN UPDATED PRODUCTION PLAN IN THE LIGNITE SYSTEM NEVERTHELESS WE TO CONSIDER IMPLICATIONS FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACCELERATED EXIT PLAN FOR THE FULL YEAR WE CONFIRM THE DIVISION'S OUTLOOK MOVING ON TO THE EARNINGS DRIVERS DOWN TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME ADJUSTED NET INCOME AMOUNTED TO SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION YUROS DUE TO THE HIGH ADJUSTED EBITDA OF AR WE GROUP THE NEGATIVE EFFECT IN THE FINANCIAL RESULT OF MINUS HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION YUROS FROM Q1 WERE Partly compensated by the ion dividend of one hundred eighty two million euros we received in the second quarter. Adjustments in tax are applied with a general tax rate of fifteen percent in line with the expected mid-term tax level for the group. The tax rate of fifteen percent has been derived from all income streams. It is based on blended local tax rates, the use of loss carry forward and the low taxation of dividends including the ion and amphenol dividend. And now onto the adjusted operating cash flow. The adjusted operating cash flow shows the impact on their debt from operating activities. It is adjusted for special items and timing effects and balances out over time. The utilization of nuclear provisions is not included. As you will remember, we consider this as a financial cash flow. As when the nuclear provisions are utilized, they can be refined via cash flow. FINANCIAL DEBT IN AGE ONE THE ADJUSTED OPERATING CASH FLOW TOPS TWO BILLION YUROS AND IS BUILT UP ON THE HIGH ADJUSTED E B D A AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE EFFECTS IN WORKING CAPITAL A CHANGE IN WORKING OPERATING CAPITAL OF FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN MILLION YUROS IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE PAYMENT FROM THE BRITISH CAPACITY MARKET FROM TWENTY EIGHT THIRTEEN AND NINETEEN WHICH WE RECEIVED IN QUO ONE AS WELL AS THE REDUCTION OF G FOR THE FULL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY WE EXPECT THIS LINE ITEM TO REMAIN POSITIVE FOR THE SAME REASONS TURNING TO THE DETAILS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NET DEBT AT THE END OF JUNE NET DEBT INCREASED TO RUGHLY SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION YUROS FIRST AND FOR MOST THIS WAS DUE TO TIMING EFFECTS FROM HATCHING ACTIVITIES OF RUGHLY ONE BILLION YUROS MAINLY RELATED TO CO2 TWO ANOTHER DRIVER OF NET DEBT IS THE COMPANY'S NET CASH INVESTMENTS CLEARLY LINKED TO OUR STRATEGY TO EXPAND IN RENEWABLE ENERGY THE DIVIDEND PAYMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN IS ALREADY REFLECTED IN THE NET DEBT FIGURE AT H ONE WE SEE A LEVERAGE FACTOR OF AROUND THREE TIMES NET DEBT TO CORE ADJUSTED EBITDA AT YEAR END WHICH CONSIDERS THE INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION YUROS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE TWO POINT SEVEN GIGAWATT NORDICS DEVELOPMENT PIPE COULD TEMPORARILY DRIVE IT SLIGHTLY ABOVE THREE TIMES BUT IF THIS IS THE CASE WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE WOULD RETURN TO OUR TARGET LEVEL IN THE MEDIUM TERM WITHOUT AN IMPACT ON OUR PLANNED KAPEX PROGRAM FINALLY MOVING ON TO THE OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AS I ALREADY SAID WE CONFIRM OUR OUTLOOK FOR THIS YEAR ADJUSTED EBITDA OF THE CORE BUSINESS WILL COME OUT BETWEEN TWO POINT ONE FIVE AND TWO POINT FOUR FIVE Adjusted EBITA for the group will range between two point seven to three billion euros and adjusted EBIT between one point two to one point five for both. Adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT we expect to see results at the upper end of the guidance. Our guidance for adjusted net income is eight hundred fifty million to one point one five billion euros and we expect it to be in the middle of the range due to the negative one of in the financial result which we have. EXPERIENCE IN QU ONE DIVIDEND TARGET IS UNCHANGED EIGHTY FIVE EURO CENTS PER SHARE FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY AND WITH THIS I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND I'M NOW HAPPY TO TAKE ALL YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU MARCOS AND AS ALWAYS IN VIEW OF TIME YOU KNOW PLEASE STICK TO TWO QUESTIONS ONLY OPERATOR PLEASE START THE Q N A SESSION LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AND WISH TO WITHDRAW YOUR QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR TWO YOU WILL BE ADVISED WHEN TO ASK YOUR QUESTION OUR FIRST QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF VANDA SERGIENKOVSKA FROM CREDIT SWEDISH PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON VANDA SERGIENKOVSKA CREDIT SWEDISH TWO QUESTIONS FOR ME THE FIRST ONE IS ON THE NEGATIVE POWER PRICE IN THE UK THERE IS A CLOSE IN THE MOST OF THE CDFS TO SAY THAT IF THE POWER PRICE GOES HOURS THAN BASICALLY SEE F D I T IS TO APPLY FOR THAT TIME DOES THAT RULE APPLY FOR ALL YOUR ASSETS IN THE UK AND IS IT AND THAT SAME SIMILAR RULE EXISTS IN OTHER MARKETS THAN R W B OPERATES IN AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS ON THE RENEWABLES TARGET GROWTH WHEN CAN WE EXPECT R W TO RISE THE ANNUAL RENEWABLES TARGET GROVE I KNOW WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY N G I INCREASING THE ANNUAL RENEWABLES TARGET GROVE It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you very much. Yeah, thanks for your question. I mean, yes, the negative price rule applies to the UK and we have a similar one but the technical details are slightly different also in Germany. I mean, I have to admit I don't know the exact details. And so far I think I mean you can you can usually plan it because you know your power price forecast on a on a quarterly hour basis for the full year. And I MEAN IT HAS NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT WHICH WAS NOT PLANNED FOR US EVEN THIS YEAR. SO FOR US IT'S A IT'S A MINOR NEGATIVE TECHNICALITY. ON AN IF YOU WANT THE DETAILS I THINK PLEASE CALL THE TEAM ALSO TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE GERMAN MEASURES DEVIATE FROM THE UK ONE. ON THE TARGETS I MEAN WE ALREADY GAVE YOU AN INDICATION WITH THE NOXPIPELINE THAT COMES ON TOP OF OUR TARGETS BUT I MEAN OUR TARGETS HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATED It was created a couple of months ago, so don't expect us that we give you new targets every month. So when we deem it appropriate that we need to update the market about new plans or revised plans, we will do it. But we will not do it on a quarterly basis. Thank you, I mean, I would appreciate if you could get back to me on the details, on the technical details, on the negative power price. I know that it's not the issue for this year or next year, but we see more and more negative power prices on the market. YES WE WILL COME BACK THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I MEAN JUST A REMARK I MEAN THE MOMENT IT BECOMES VIABLE YOU USUALLY I MEAN UM BUT THE TEAM COMES BACK BUT I THINK I MEAN FOR US I THINK IT'S AN OVERRATED ISSUE ALSO GOING FORWARD BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE IS WE GET MORE AND MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE SYSTEM IN MANY MARKETS SO THE PERIODS OF VERY NEGATIVE POWER PRICES SHOULD NATURALLY COME Too many requests in 1 hour. Try again later. I'm sorry from J P Morgan please go ahead yes good morning good afternoon a quick one could you provide us a bit more color on the nordic pipeline but at an asset level so we understand we see the geography so mainly it seems to be a footprint in the french onshore market so we understand the strategy behind it it would be great if we could get a bit more color on the project level while we're at it BIG PROJECTS AND WHICH ARE IN THERE AND BASICALLY WHAT IS THE EXPECTED TIMEFUL CONTRIBUTION THERE SO THAT WILL BE THE QUESTION ONE AND BASING BACK ON THIS UM WHAT IS YOUR VIEW REGARDING ACQUISITION OF RENEWABLE ASSETS GIVEN CURRENT PRICES BUYING A PIPELINE IS ONE THING BUT BUYING AN EXISTING OPERATING ASSET IS ANOTHER ONE DO YOU SEE THAT LIKE VALUE ACQUISITIVE AND WOULD YOU IN SUCH A SITUATION CONSIDER POTENTIALLY EVEN FUNDING IT BUYING LARGER ACQUISITIONS BY RECONSIDERING YOUR FINANCIAL NEEDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION LET ME START WITH THE LATTER ONE I THINK FOR US I MEAN HAVING A A DEEP PIPELINE WHERE WE CAN INVEST OUR MONEY IT WOULD NOT BE LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET LET L I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're trying to say. Could you please rephrase or provide more context? OUR INVESTMENT INVESTMENT PLAN I MEAN, ON THE NOXD PIPELINE I MEAN, LET ME LET ME START FIRST WITH WHY THIS WAS STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT, AS I SAID IN MY SPEECH, BECAUSE FRANCE IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE ONSHORE MARKET WE HAVE, I MEAN, THE DOUBLE SIDED CDF FOR TWENTY YEARS, INFLATION LINKED WE HAVE SEEN PRICES IN THE LAST AUCTIONS BETWEEN SIXTY TWO AND SIXTY SEVEN EUROS, SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND IT WAS ON THE ONE TARGET MARKET WHERE WE REALLY MISS A PRESENCE. SO IT WAS REALLY A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US. WE LOOKED INTO THE PIPELINE IN IN DETAIL, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IN THE DUE DILIGENCE. AND I MEAN WE HAVE VERY GOOD LOCATIONS, GOOD WIND CONDITIONS CLUSTERS IN IN GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY THAT THAT WILL PROVIDE EFFICIENCIES. AND I AM I CAN I WILL NOT TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS NOW BECAUSE THE TRANSACTION IS NOT CLOSED. AND WE ARE BOUND TO GIVE YOU A VIEW OF HOW THE PORTFOLIO WILL LOOK LIKE. I WILL GIVE YOU MORE COLOR IN A MINUTE. BUT I CANNOT TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC SITES. I MEAN WE CAN WE CAN GIVE YOU MORE COLOR AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION. WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY SAID IS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE PIPELINE IS IS IS CLOSE TO FIDO OR VERY LATE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND WE EXPECT THE FIRST CHIU DUES BY TWENTY ONE ON AVERAGE WE WOULD AT LEAST EXPECT HUNDRED MEGAW Mega watts under operations including the purchase price of four hundred two point five million we expect that the i r s of the projects will be within our given range at the capital market day we set for mature onshore pv markets we expect five point four point five to eight percent but please i mean this is a very mature market and we had to buy it so don't expect it at the upper end of the four and a half to eight percent range. REALLY IN THE IN THE RANGE WE SAW THE PRICE AS ATTRACTIVE. I THINK IT'S ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE OR ASSESS THE PRICE FROM THE OUTSIDE IN. BUT WE HAVE ALSO SEEN OTHER PIPELINES. WE PARTICIPATED IN MANY NEW DRILLINGS IN FRANCE. SO WE KNOW ALSO OUR OTHER PIPELINES LOOK LIKE AND JUST LOOKING AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE IN YOU HAVE SEEN ACQUISITIONS IN THAT MARKET WHICH WERE PRICED AT HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS PER MEGAW Comparing prices on that level, pipeline by pipeline. The split of the of the maturity of the pipeline is more or less in line with the maturity of our overall, of our overall pipeline. I mean, around, as I said, fifteen percent is close to FID and late stage. We have around thirty percent mid stage and the remaining part is then early stage development. THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION PLEASE the next question is coming from the line of peter bishteg from bofa securities please go ahead HI YEAH THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION so just another one on the nordic portfolio could you sort of tell us how the four hundred million acquisition price and the i guess additional capex that you're going to be spending over the next couple of years fits into your existing five billion capex budget does it DISPLACE SOMETHING ELSE OUT OF THAT BUDGET OR IS IT IN ADDITION AND IF IT'S IN ADDITION THEN WHERE HAVE YOU FOUND THAT EXTRA BALANCE SHEET CAPACITY PLEASE AND MY SECOND QUESTION AS SHE WAS JUST ON CARBON WHICH HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN A VERY VOLATILE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS I GUESS YOUR SUPPLY AND TRADE DIVISION MIGHT HAVE PROFITED FROM THAT BUT I'M JUST WONDERING COULD YOU GIVE US YOUR VIEWS AS TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN DRIVING THE CARB BRIEFLY URUM, YOU KNOW, AS ITS REACH WAS SORT OF MID TO HIGH HIGH TWENTIES THANK YOU YEAH PETER THANKS FOR THE QUESTION ON THE NODAX PIPELINE YEAH IT WILL COME ON TOP OF THE FIVE BILLION AS WE HAVE SAID WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TRANSACTION AND NOW UR QUESTION REGARDING FUNDING I MEAN AS WE AS I HAVE SAID IN THE SPEECH WE EXPECT TO BE WITHIN THE LEVERAGED TARGET OF THE THREE TIMES NET DEBT TO EBITDA UR Including the four hundred million, and I mean we have a lot of moving parts. I mean, if we assume, and I also hint to that, that commodity prices, especially gas and C2 and interest rates stay where they were at end of June, then we have a good view, what are the moving cash assets, operating cash flow, investments, we know our divestments are hinted to to Georgia biomass, we're gonna pay back the hybrids. I mean, that's all very stable, and we can foresee that we end the year at... AROUND THREE POINT ZERO BUT OF COURSE WE CANNOT CONTROL COMMODITY PRICES AND WE CANNOT CONTROL INTEREST RATES BUT THESE ARE ONLY I MEAN TIMING EFFECTS I MEAN THIS WILL NORMALIZE OVER TIME THAT'S WHY WE ARE CONFIDENT IF WE MOVE UP THEN IT WILL COME DOWN WITHOUT IMPACTING THE CAPEX THEN LATER THE PROJECT INVESTMENTS AFTER THE I MEAN WHEN WE WHEN WE DO C U O D THAT WILL BE PART OF THE OF THE HURDLE OF THE HURDLE OF THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRO IT WILL COME ON TOP OF OUR EXISTING TARGETS. BUT I MEAN A HUNDRED MEGA WATT HERE AND THERE THAT WILL NOT MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THE COMPANY OF OUR SIDE. I MEAN WITH THE COVID SITUATION, WITH VERY LOW GAS PRICES, SIGNIFICANT FUEL SWITCHING MUTED INDUSTRIAL DEMAND I MEAN THE DEMAND FOR CARBON CERTIFICATES IS DEFINITELY MUCH LOWER THAN IT HAS BEEN IT HAS BEEN EXPECTED ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT THE MORE POLITICAL MID TO LONG TERM VIEW IS MORE BULLISH BECAUSE I MEAN SOMEHOW THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION NEEDS TO IMPLEMENT THE MORE AGGRESSIVE CO2 REDUCTION Target and it doesn't matter whether they go to i don't know fifty fifty five or even sixty percent reduction by twenty thirty a significant part of that maybe even more than half needs to come from the eu ets and that will definitely mean that prices will go up and maybe what is different this time than in the last financial crisis in the last financial crisis we have seen that a lot of industrials who were sitting on excess capacity Certificates were in financial trouble and they needed to sell just to get liquidity. This is with the huge program of the central banks and the fiscal support now different. Maybe some industrialists take more the political long-term view and use the liquidity they still have to buy cheaper than they expect the prices to be. I think these are the two camps short-term long-term and since this market is nothing you can fundamentally analyze. That's always a sentiment question and i think the more dominant factor is definitely the midterm to long-term political view i can i can simply not imagine that if prices go down to fifteen euros again that the politicians will sit there and do nothing okay interesting thanks very much for that the next question is coming from the line of alberto gondolffi from goldman sachs please go ahead the next question is coming from the line of alberto gondolffi from goldman sachs please go ahead GO AHEAD THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON THE FIRST THING IS TO GO BACK TO THE ION STAKE WE HEARD IN THE PAST THAT MAYBE BADLY COUNTERED ABOUT HALF OF THAT COULD BE USED AGAINST LIGNETIC LIABILITIES AND THE REST COULD BE USED FOR GROWTH CAN YOU PLEASE CONFIRM THAT AND WHEN IT COMES TO GROWTH CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC WOULD IT BE CONTINGENT TO MAKE BIGGER OFFSHORE WINDS OR PERHAPS TO IDENTIFY SOMETHING EXTERNAL LIKE YOU JUST DID WITH NORTH From a different perspective, like RWE is a potential target. So we're seeing all companies very quickly moving into the space you know VP with a fifty gigawatt net target by but by twenty thirty company like yourself would be like a plug and play, you know developing with existing capacity. So do you think there is a race to scale here and what would be the best way for you to fend off a threat like this one? UMER ALBERTO THANKS FOR THE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN ON THE ION STAKE I CAN JUST RECONFIRM THAT EVERYTHING IS STILL TO VALID WHICH WE HAVE SAID IN THE PAST UM I MEAN THE ION STAKE IS NOT TIED TO THE LIGNA PROVISIONS WE JUST SAID WE CURRENTLY USE IT WE COULD ALSO BACK THE LIGNA PROVISIONS BY OTHER FINANCIAL PORTFOLIOS UM I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DAR UM THE POTENTIAL SOURCING OF FINANCING YES I MEAN WE POTENTIALLY NEED HALF OF IT PROVISION AND THE OTHER HALF WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO CAPITAL ROTATION BUT I MEAN THAT HAS NOT CHANGED IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SAID BEFORE USUALLY WE HAVE TWO QUESTIONS SO YOU HAD THREE WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER NOW THE OIL QUESTION OR THE OTHER ONE I START WITH THE OIL QUESTION AND LET'S SEE WHETHER WE STILL HAVE TIME PERFECT THANK YOU I THINK THAT THE MOST INTERESTING THING I I DO AGREE THAT IT COULD THAT WE COULDN'T In a situation that it's the race for scarcity because I mean it might be difficult to if you put together all the all the capital investment plans of everybody around in this in this field it's almost impossible to employ that amount of money until let's say twenty thirty because they are simply not enough projects and you have more lead times to do it so existing pipelines become much more VALUABLE I THINK THE INVESTORS OF BIG OIL AND OTHERS NEED TO ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION WHETHER IT'S REALLY GREEN, A GREEN INVESTMENT IF YOU BUY EXISTING STUFF FROM OTHERS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION IT'S JUST I MEAN OVERBIDDING IN PRICES SO I MEAN ON THE QUESTION WHETHER WE COULD BECOME A TARGET OR NOT I THINK YOUR COMPANY IS VERY POSITIONED TO HELP THE OIL COMPANIES FIGURING THAT OUT AND WAIT WHAT HAPPENS SPEECH: I MEAN THAT'S NOT IN OUR CONTROL WHAT SO WHAT CAN WE DO I MEAN I'M I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY THAT ALSO OTHERS SEE THE FIELD OF RENEWABLES AND THE OVERALL POWER SECTOR AS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE CORE OF OUR STRATEGY AND I THINK WE HAVE ALL THE INGREDIENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE THE VERY EXPERIENCED TEAM WE HAVE A DEEP PIPELINE WHICH ACTUALLY NEEDED TO BE DEVELOPED OVER A DECADE AND OF COUR CONTINUE DOING THAT. I MEAN DEVELOPING OUR PIPELINE INVESTING IN GOOD PROJECTS AND ALSO BEING ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL FOREFRONT BE IT BATTERIES BE IT H TWO OR BE IT FLOATING OFFSHORE WHERE I ACTUALLY DON'T SEE LIMITING FACTORS IS THE LONG TERM MARKET GROWTH BECAUSE THE LONG TERM MARKET GROWTH OF RENEWABLES AND ALSO POWER OVERALL IS I MEAN TREMENDOUS GLOBALLY THE TREND TO ELECTRIFICATION AND TO GREEN IS VERY SUPPORTING We also don't see a limiting factor as funds because if you have good projects, I think investors are actually looking for investment opportunities. And now you need to ask yourself who actually brings what to the table. I mean, the market is there itself. Funds is not the problem. So what you need is experience in the pipeline. Thank you. That's great. Thank you, Albert. Next question, please. GO AHEAD HI YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH Y In the second question, and hopefully a lot simpler, is you have secured some acreage in the UK. Could you provide an update on the process? You have leases for some of the other extensions you flagged at the CMD, namely Great Gabbard, Galloper, and Rampion. Has that been successful? Is that underway or is that not this year's business? EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE POINT TWO, EIGHT HUNDRED MEGABYTES TO ONE POINT TWO GIGABYTES AND WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN FINALIZE IT AND BY THEN BOOK IT AS AS LEASED SECURED BY THE END OF THE YEAR BUT IT'S GOING IT'S GOING WELL AND ON THE EUROPEAN RECOVERY FUND LET ME START WITH THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION YEAH I MEAN I THINK WE WILL WE WILL LEARN ABOUT IT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS Let's say two quarters until the end of the year, how the flow of the money will really go because usually the European Union works in a way that it's just they don't have, they have only little funds like the just transition fund and stuff like that, that's a double digit million where they put money directly into specific projects. Usually the European Union's budget is a huge kind of, I mean, shifting mechanism, so people are paying net in and getting money net out. SO WHAT NOW AS THE NEXT STEP NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES NEEDS TO COME UP WITH PROGRAMS AND PLANS WHERE TO INVEST THE MONEY. AND IF THAT TICKS ALL BOXES THEY WILL GET THEIR PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THE MONEY. SO WE NEED TO WAIT FOR NATIONAL ACTIONS WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO PUT AND WHERE THEY WANT TO INVEST. AND HOW THEY SUPPORT CERTAIN THINGS IS ALSO UNCLEAR. I MEAN YOU CAN DO IT WITH DIRECT SUBSIDY, YOU CAN DO IT WITH RENUMERATION FRAMEWORK. IT'S SIMPLER FINANCING I MEAN IT'S IT'S STILL TOTALLY UNCLEAR UM AND THE ONLY THING WHAT WE CAN DO AND THAT'S THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION I MEAN WE ARE WE ARE ALSO NOW ACTIVELY LOOKING ESPECIALLY IN AGE IN THE IN THE EVOLVING AGE TWO SECTOR AND OF COURSE WHAT IS OBVIOUS IS IF MORE RENEWABLE POWER IS NEEDED AND YOU GET AN INDIRECT RENUMERATION FORMULA FOR RENEWABLE POWER VIA THE SUPPORT OF DEMAND FOR GREEN HYDROGEN WE ARE DEFINITELY READY TO BUILD MORE RENEWABLES BUT WE ARE ALSO WILLING TO INVEST INTO THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT AGREEMENT WE FIND WITH OUR PARTNERS IS IT BETTER OUR MONEY OR THERE AND HOW DO YOU STRUCTURE THE CONTRACTS THE QUESTION IS WHO PUTS MONEY INTO TRANSPORTATION MAYBE MAYBE MORE OTHERS REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THAT NEEDS TO BE UNBUNDLED I HAVE MANY OPEN QUESTIONS SO THINK THE IMPORTANT STEP NOW IS TO GET THE Usually, we start with the demand. I mean, who actually needs the hydrogen? And then you do, you do backward engineering. And I mean, I think these are the big fields. Our current business already so, especially renewables and storage technology, and the new one which will come in addition is hydrogen. But also, I want to kind of not spoil the party, but I mean, if you talk about profits from, especially hydrogen, probably we need to wait a couple of years. Before it is relevant in terms of investments but also in terms of profitability and maybe the kickstart of the of the solar and wind business is a good proxy. It could easily take at least half a decade, maybe a decade before it becomes a relevant profit figure. That's super interesting. Thank you very much and good luck with the least the least possible. Thanks Rob, next question please. The next question is coming from the line of Sam Arie from UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for the presentation and a great set of results today. I just wanted to ask, two questions, one on returns and one on farm land. So, on returns, I think you had spoken at the CMD about one hundred to three hundred. So, I think you had spoken at the CMD about one hundred to three hundred.

So, I think you had HUNDRED BITS SPREAD ABOVE WACK AS BEING TYPICAL IN THE RENEWABLE BUSINESS THESE DAYS A HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED BITS DON'T ACTUALLY SOUND THAT CRAZY AS AN ESTIMATE OF THE WACK ACTUALLY AS WELL AND I DON'T KNOW THE LOWER THE WACK THE LOWER THE SPREAD THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE THE SAME KIND OF VALUE CREATION RATIO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT A YEAR OR TWO AGO IT WAS COMMON TO TALK ABOUT HIGH SINGLE DIGIT RETURNS IN RENEWABLES MID TO H PROJECT RETURNS BUT ARE WE NOW MORE LIKELY TO BE GOING INTO THE LOW SINGLE DIGIT RETURNS TERRITORY AND IS THAT YOU KNOW IS THAT POSSIBLY A FAIR OUTLOOK FOR OFFSHORE WINDS AS WELL WHERE RETURNS HAS THOROUGHLY BEEN A BIT HIGHER I JUST LOVE THAT LOVE TO KNOW WHAT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT THAT THAT THE KIND OF INDUSTRY LEVEL AND THEN MY FARM DOWN QUESTION IS JUST LOOK LOOK I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GONNA SEE OVER TIME MORE AND MORE PRESSURE FROM AU AND TENDERS. AND DEVELOPERS MAY BE EVENTUALLY FORCED TO BRING THE FARM DOWN PARTNER WITH THEM TO THE TENDER. SO IF YOU LIKE THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE OF AUCTIONS WILL MEAN THAT THIS KIND OF EXTRA VALUE ARBITRAGE THAT YOU CURRENTLY GET IN A FARM DOWN MAY EVENTUALLY GET CAPTURED BY THE CONSUMER OR YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC BODY THAT'S DOING THE TENDER. SO I'M JUST WONDERING DO YOU THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION AND IF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WH ALONG SIDE AND HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANY SPECIFIC FUNDS OR PARTNERS ABOUT THAT KIND OF LONG TERM APPROACH RETURNS AND FUND DOWNS THANK YOU SAM THANKS THANKS FOR THE DISCUSSION I MEAN ON RETURNS I AGREE THAT WE DEFINITELY SEE THAT THE VAX ARE COMING COMING DOWN I MEAN I ALSO CAREFULLY READ YOUR YOUR REPORT AND YOU ALSO PUT NOW VERY LOW NUMBERS TO VAX WHICH I THINK IS THE RIGHT THING AND BUT I'M NOT THERE THAT I WOULD SAY WE SEE NOW LOW SINGLE DIGIT RETURNS FOR FOR OFFSHORE THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE I MEAN DEFINITELY IF WE HAVE PROMISED YOU THE AVERAGE I R O F AN UNLIVERED PROJECT OF SIX HUNDRED FIFTY BASIS POINTS FOR THE FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM WE HAVE OUTLINED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO POTENTIALLY THE ABSOLUTE RETURNS NOT THE VALUE CREATION BUT THE ABSOLUTE RETURNS OF THE NEXT CAPEX PROGRAM WILL BE LOWER BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE WEAK IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL I'M NOT AT LOW MEDIUM, I MEAN LOW FOR ME IS THREE AND THREE SOMETHING IT WILL COME DOWN BUT I MEAN WHAT WE SEE IS NOT FOR THE FOR THE PROJECTS WHICH WE WHICH WE HAVE AFTER THE TWENTY TWO HORIZON ALREADY VISIBILITY OF THE PROFITABILITY I WOULDN'T CALL THAT LOW IT'S MORE MEDIUM FARMERS I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I GOT Y I DON'T SEE I CURRENTLY DON'T SEE THAT YOU HAVE TENDERS WHERE YOU NEED TO BRING YOUR FINANCING OR WHERE YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IF YOU DON'T GO INTO THE AUCTION ALONE AND AND GETTING AN ADVANTAGE WHEN YOU ALREADY BRING THE FINANCING PARTNER I HAVEN'T SEEN THINGS LIKE THAT WHAT IS MORE AND MORE OBVIOUS IS THAT ALSO NOW THE NEW TENDER DESIGNED TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE FOR TAIWAN THAT LOCAL PRODUCTION BECOMES A DOMINANT THEME BUT IF YOU WANT TO PUT MONEY IN SOME PLACE YOU NEED TO PROVE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD FOR THE REGIONS WHERE YOU GET THE LEASE. IT'S GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE YOU CREAT JOBS YOU USE LOCAL SUPPLIERS THAT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT IMPORTANT BUT WHAT I DON'T SEE IS THAT IT'S ADVANTAGE THAT YOU ALREADY WITH THE AUCTION SAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FARM OUT BRING A FINANCING PARTNER WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE A CLARIFICATION NO NO THAT'S FINE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME BUT I'M SURE WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS AGAIN AND THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU TWO TOO MANY ANSWERS JUST THANK YOU WE WILL THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK You've accelerated the fully hedged portion, particularly in twenty twenty two. Obviously, it's a quite small chart, but from maybe roughly thirty to fifty percent, which is probably more than you would normally do in a quarter. So, just wanted to understand some thinking behind that. Is there a particular view you have on power prices or spreads at these levels? And then, secondly, on the three times leverage factor, just to confirm, that's not including? ANY POTENTIAL ASSET ROTATION AT THE MOMENT? BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME SOME HEADLINES IN RECENT DAYS AROUND SOME OF YOUR YOUR OFFSHORE ASSETS THAT YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING TO SELL DOWN JOHN THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. I MEAN ON HEDGING YOU ARE RIGHT. WE INCREASE THE OUTRIGHT HEDGE. SO WHAT WE ACTUALLY CLOSED BY THAT WAS THE SPREAD POSITION IS THERE. I KNOW WHAT YOU COULD READ INTO IT IS IF YOU THINK SPREADS ARE FAIR IT'S PART OF OFF RISKING NOW TO AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT CURRENT MARKET PRICES AND SPREADS, I THINK EVERYBODY EXPECTS A HUNDRED PERCENT RECOVERY BY TWENTY TWO. AND IF YOU WANT TO LOCK THAT IN, YOU BETTER CLOSE YOUR POSITION NOW. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE. THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT WE I MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WILL LOOK LIKE. BUT IT'S BETTER TO LOCK IT IN NOW THAN TO KEEP IT OPEN ON THE LEVERAGED SIDE THE THREE TIMES N So it is it is it is our net investment target. I mean we have outlined a net investment of around one point five to two billion per annum. So if we're going to invest gross more given the the profile and it also includes divestment. I have already said that we divested um which is not yet in the financial georgia biomass for close to two hundred million dollars one seventy five and some adjustments. BUMS AND I MEAN ON THE OTHER THINGS WE ARE CONSIDERING OUR OPTIONS SO WE WILL BRING IT TO THE NET FIGURE BUT I NOW DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON GROSS AND NET BECAUSE WE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE LEADING METRIC IS THIRTEEN GIGABIT NET SO WHATEVER WE DO ON OUR DISPOSES WE WILL REACH THE THIRTEEN GIGABIT NET NET AND ALSO THE IBIDA GUIDANCE FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS A NET GUIDANCE SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO ACHIEVE THIS WITH AS MUCH GROSS The current uncertainties in some markets we need to have some flexibility. And I mean, if you now want to get a comment on the on the on the rumors on on disposals, I mean, the comment is no comment, because sir, I mean, we will update you when we have taken a decision, not we will not update you whether we have on a certain asset, a market check or not. Okay, thank you. John, next question please. Coming from the line of Depa Vincintecheran from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Thank you. For my two questions, firstly in the U.S. if we do have a possible victory for Joe Biden and they bring in the two trillion plan. I'm just wondering how does that change would you accelerate your growth your the conversion of your pipeline in the U.S. or practically how might it change anything for you? And my second question is on the is on Germany. Self. So obviously Germany has pretty lofty targets for 2030, but we're seeing the auctions are continuing to go under subscribe on onshore wind. Do you see this situation changing with any kind of reforms? And would you be taking the lead as, as I don't know, Germany's national champion on this too, to also grab maybe more, more of the share in the German renewables market? Thank you. POTENTIAL IMPACT FROM A POTENTIAL FEDERAL ELECTION OUTCOME IN THE U S ON ON OUR BUSINESS I MEAN I MEAN EVEN EVEN TODAY I MEAN MANY THINGS DEPEND ON ON STATE LEVEL OF COURSE THE TAX SUPPORT IS A FEDERAL THING BUT ALSO THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION EXTENDED THE P E T S I S GIVEN THE COVID SITUATION SO I MEAN THAT'S PURE SPECULATION I WOULD SAY IT WILL NOT MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND ON JERMANY Money, of course, we would like to do more in onshore and offshore in Germany and we see under-subscribed auctions. The problem is that the projects are not ready to be bid into the auctions. We have permitting issues, we have pending law cases, and so on. But there is some interesting development because the minister of economic affairs he tabled a law a draft law yesterday or the day before. Two days ago where they really want to accelerate the permitting process and the court proceedings and they also introduced something which is now heavily discussed also with the NGOs that even if you if you dispute a permission in court that should still until the decision is there allow the construction to go on and that would be both very helpful so speedier processes and you can go straight to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the FINAL COURT LEVEL TO GET A DECISION AND YOU DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH THE HIERARCHY AND ALSO THAT NOBODY CAN BY PURE TACTICS IN THE COURTS DELAY PROJECTS. BUT LET'S SEE HOW THE DRAFT WILL GO THROUGH PARLIAMENT. BUT THE DRAFT VERSION AT LEAST LOOKS VERY FAVOURABLE FOR THE INDUSTRY. CITY, PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI, GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S PIOTR GIENCIOWSKI FROM CITY. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE A SMALL ON NORDEX. CAN YOU SAY WHAT'S THE KIND OF A CURRENT COST STRUCTURE OF IT? HOW IS IT SIGNIFICANT NUMBER, SMALL NUMBER IN ANNUAL EURO FIGURE AS A COMPANY? SECONDLY, I WANTED TO ASK YOU ON THE C 2 O TO GO BACK TO THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE BEFORE THE COVID NINETY NINE THERE WAS A DISCUSSION A Ethereum, which is determined by the switching between coal and gas as power plants. Now, if we take coal assets out, what will be, according to you, your expectations? The next ethereum kind of threshold. How will the market restore longer-term ethereum on the crypto prices, which should be looking at the number of eliminations of crypto to what the next next thing to look for? DAVID JOYCE: PHIL JOYCE: THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK ON NORDICS IT'S EASY. I MEAN WE TAKE OVER THE COMPANY YES BUT IT'S A DEVELOPMENT COMPANY. SO WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS THE SALARIES AND OPEX FOR THE SEVENTY PEOPLE AND OF COURSE THE DEVELOPMENT EXPENDERS FOR THE TOO BIG TO FAIL DEVELOPED PROJECTS BUT I MEAN PART OF THAT IS ALSO CAPITALIZED SO IT'S A VERY I MEAN IN TERMS OF ADDITION TO THE COST BASE IT'S AL Than the capex um on c 2 o 2 equilibrium um i mean um actually the interesting thing is that the current c 2 o 2 price is already above the fuel switching price from from hard coal to gas the current stock in most of the times looks gas first than then lignite and then hard coal so if you take out hard coal now that shouldn't change the equilibrium RELIBILITY BETWEEN FOR THE FOR THE C O T TWO RELEVANT FUEL SWITCHING CRISIS THERE SHOULD BE A CHANGE. THE INTERESTING ELEMENTS AS I SAID IS ALREADY TRADING ABOVE THE CURRENT FUEL SWITCHING LEVEL THAT CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED THAT ACTUALLY THE INDUSTRY EXPECTS A SHORTAGE AND BUT THIS IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE BECAUSE THIS MARKET IS NOT AN ANNUAL MARKET IT'S ALSO SINCE YOU CAN EASILY KEEP YOUR CERTIFICATES FOR LONGER You can also say it's partly a view on what to come in future years. So I would not overrate the annual price which causes fuel switching. That was in the old days of oversupply, a good indicator. But now, with significant more tightness to come, maybe that's not the relevant indicator anymore. Elchin Mamadov from Bloomberg Intelligence, please go ahead. Hi there, two questions for me, please. The first one is on negative prices. And I'm sorry if you covered it before, I missed the very beginning. Basically, Orsted reported yesterday it was a small issue for them because of, you know, if the prices stay negative for the subsequent few hours, your cfds and whatnot, you know, your country could recover some of it. So is that, is that been an issue with you for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the, FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND DO YOU THINK THE NEGATIVE PRICES WILL BE SOME MORE OR LESS PREVALENT GOING FORWARD THE SECOND QUESTION IS ON HYDROGEN AGAIN WHERE DO YOU THINK THE VALUE WILL LIE IS IT IN THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN TRANSPORTATION OF HYDROGEN CONVERTING IT TO OTHER FUELS LIKE METHANE ET CETERA WHERE DO YOU THINK THE MONEY WILL BE AND WILL YOU BE A BIG PLAYER THERE THANK YOU IF I COULD ANSWER THE LAST QUESTION LIFE WOULD BE EASIER IT'S I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL IT ALSO DEPENDS ON HOW WILL THE HOW WILL THE INCENTIVIZATION FRAMEWORK LOOK LIKE AND HOW BIG WILL THE MARKET BECOME AND OF COURSE IT HAS HAS TWO ANGLES YOU CAN INCENTIVIZE GREEN PRODUCTION AND YOU CAN INCENTIVIZE DEMAND FOR GREEN HYDROGEN AND IN THE END IT WILL BE THEN KIND OF A DEMAND SUPPLY ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON ON The different angles where we actually don't see scarcity is the production of green hydrogen in terms of electrolyzers. I mean, that's a proven technology where we definitely have scarcity already today is renewable projects. Because I mean, if you believe all the demand forecasts, and I have no doubts that that is a good assessment. We need so much green energy that every project which is actually in the pipeline of somebody needs. MUST BE BUILT ONE DAY JUST A QUESTION OF TIME SO THAT IS REALLY A SCARCE SCARCITY ON THE DEMAND SIDE I THINK THAT WILL BE A COMPETITION BY THE OFF TAKERS WHO IS WHO CAN WHO CAN WHO CAN DO IT CHEAPER THAT'S NOTHING FOR US I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU ASK ME WHERE I SEE OUR ROLE IT'S DEFINITELY ON THE ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE GREEN POWER POTENTIALLY DEPENDING ON HOW THE CONSORCIA WILL LOOK LIKE ALSO THE PRODUCTION SIDE ACTION OF GREEN HYDROGEN AND THEN THIS STRUCTURING OF THE OFF TAKE. I MEAN AS WE ARE CURRENTLY ALSO A VERY RELEVANT PLAYER IN GAS TRADING AND PROVIDING SOLUTIONS TO CUSTOMERS THAT WILL ALSO OUR ROLE BE IN H TWO AND YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT PRODUCING AS WE CURRENTLY DO WITH LNG AND NATURAL GAS THE FIRST QUESTION ON NEGATIVE PRICES I MEAN FOR US IT I MEAN WE HAVE SEEN IT IN THE UK AND GERMANY BUT IT'S NOT IT WAS NOT A RELEVANT ISSUE I MEAN IT WAS NOT Okay, thanks a lot, appreciated. Thank you. Next question, please. The next question is coming from the line of Ahmed Farman from Jeffries. Please go ahead. Yes, hi, thank you. Two questions from my side as well. I'm just wondering if we could get a little bit more color from you around these sort of value creation opportunities relating to the Nordic pipe line, especially the sort of the near-term assets. Because you mentioned it's it's a mature market, some of the near-term projects are fairly well-developed, close to fidelity, sort of a market where augmented reality had scale in the past. I'm interested in understanding a little bit more how you see sort of the value proposition from fidelity. And I guess the second question is related to that. I think you mentioned earlier, this was one of the markets you didn't have presence in, and therefore, you were sort of looking for opportunities. Looking at your existing markets, you didn't have presence in, and therefore, you were sort of looking for opportunities. Looking at your existing markets, you didn't have presence in, and therefore, you were sort of looking for opportunities. Looking at your existing markets, you didn't have presence in, and therefore PORTFOLIO EITHER FROM MY PIPELINE PERSPECTIVE OR FROM A SKILL PERSPECTIVE ARE THERE ANY SORT OF SPECIFIC GAPS THAT YOU SEE THAT YOU THINK SORT OF SCALE UP PUT SORT OF BENEFIT BENEFITS QUITE BENEFICIAL THANK YOU YEAH GOT IT THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN ON I WOULD NOT SAY THAT WE FAILED ON FRANCE BECAUSE WE WERE SIMPLY NOT PRESENT IT WAS ALWAYS A STRATEGIC TARGET TO GET A FOOT IN THE DOOR AND NOW WE HAVE NOT ONLY A FOOT IN THE DOOR B A SIGNIFICANT PIPELINE. AND THE NOD EXT TEAM WAS ACTUALLY VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE FRENCH MARKET. I THINK THEY RANKED NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF SUCCESS RATES IN TWO AUCTIONS IN THE LAST YEAR. AND THEY HAVE NOT ONLY BUILT THIS PIPELINE. THEIR BUSINESS MODEL WAS TO BUILD AND THEN WHEN THEY WERE CLOSE TO F I D AND THEY GOT THEM THROUGH THE AUCTION THEY SOLD THE PROJECTS TO THEIR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND I MEAN WHAT IS THE VALUE CREATION POTENTIAL FOR US I MEAN IF We have a strategic gap and the team is not there just to deliver the pipeline which we have acquired. They will continuously develop projects. The French market overall is very attractive. It's not so densely populated like Germany, so you have more space. They have huge build-out targets, an even better renourishment framework with a double-sided twenty-year inflation-linked CfD. So, if you believe that onshore wind in France is good, it is. WILL DEFINITELY CREAT VALUE. AND I MEAN WE ARE A FIRM BELIEVER THAT ALSO THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN FRANCE AND THEIR TARGETS TO GO STRAIGHT FROM NUCLEAR TO RENEWABLES WILL NOT BE WILL NOT BE QUESTIONED BY SOME OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT. SO IT'S IT'S A VERY INTACT GROWTH PLATFORM. THE GAPS IN OUR PIPELINE I MEAN I THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO BE HONEST. I THINK IF YOU LOOK INTO THAT WE ARE VERY WIND HEAVY. SO DOING MORE ON THE SOLAR SIDE WOU DEFINITELY BEE GOOD LET'S SEE HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE IT. I MEAN WE HAVE DEFINITELY WE HAVE DEFINITELY RAMPED UP OUR OUR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND YOU WILL SEE MORE TO COME ESPECIALLY IN THE ATTRACTIVE SOLAR MARKET LIKE IN THE US BUT STILL IT'S COMPARED TO THE WINDSIDE UNDER REPRESENTED AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH IS DEFINITELY SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CLOSE IF YOU LOOK INTO OUR OFFSHORE PIPELINE There is, in terms of CUDA dates and that's historically explainable because Aon stopped and energy had also funding issues but we have a gap between twenty two where we will commission triton null and then maybe the next project will be commissioned in accordance to the current pipeline around twenty five, maybe twenty six and that is I mean this is a profile how we how it looks like and if you ask me you have two wishes I would like to fill that time gap and I would like to have more on the solar side.

And you've got the dividend in line with the decline of earnings on the core business? I mean, we should now, I mean, we should stick to the two questions rules, so I still answer that one, but then we should give the next one the opportunity to ask questions. Otherwise, we need to do it in a, in a one on one session, over the internet, please. Opportunities I mean the first thing which is questionable then is why do you only pay out fifty percent of your profits as dividend because you cannot employ it somewhere so that would that would totally change the dividend policy but it's not question of a cut then thank you next question please as a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad as a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM THE LINE OF ROBERT POLLEY FROM MORGAN STANLEY PLEASE GO AHEAD YEAH ROBERT POLLEY I REJOYNED TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION IF THATS OK BUT GIVEN YOU ANSWERED OR NOT ANSWERED THE QUESTION ON THE HUMBLE CAN I ASK ABOUT US DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES A WONDERFUL SUBJECT A US EXPOSED UTILITY REPORTED YESTERDAY A LARGE TAX CHARGE AS PROJECTS REACHED C O D AND THEY ENTERED INTO A TAX EQUITY PARTNERSHIP SO WILL WE SEE A SIMILAR TAX IMPACT AT R W E AS IT REACHES C O D ON YOUR U S PROJECTS THANK YOU THE TAX ANSWER THAT THE QUESTION TO THE TAX THE ANSWER TO THE TAX QUESTION IS EASY NO WE DON T EXPECT ANY HUGE NUMBER BUT MAYBE THE SITUATION IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU SET A U S UTILITY BECAUSE WE DON T HAVE TAX CAPACITY OUR TAXES IN THE U S ARE ZERO AND WE NEED TO ACTUALLY BRING IN FINANCING PARTNERS TO REAP THE TAX BENEFITS.

CHALLENGING PERIOD WE HAVE FACED OPERATIONALLY IN MANY DECADES ALTHOUGH THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE AMO- AMONG OUR BUSINESS UNITS BUT ALSO WE SAW A SEVERE IMPACT FROM COMI- CONTINUING LACK OF CONSUMER MOBILITY IN THE GEOGRAPHIES WE SERVE THAT TRANSLATED INTO SOFT PERFORMANCE FOR MOST OF OUR CATEGORIES AND CONSUMER OCCASIONS AND THE CHALLENGE WAS COMPOUNDED BY THE LACK OF BEER SUPPLY THAT ONLY BEGAN TO RECOVER IN THE MONTH OF JUNE OUR HEALTH DIVISION FARED BETTER AS DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTION PRODUCTS REMAINED HIGH BUT SALES WERE CONSTRAINED BY STRICT RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON CONSUMERS AND THEIR ABILITY TO MOVE AROUND PARTICULARLY IN OUR KEY SOUTH AMERICAN MARKET THE FUEL DIVISION WAS IMPACTED MOST AS VEHICLE UTILIZATION FELL QUICKLY AND DRASTICALLY HOWEVER FROM A DEEPER VALUE AND IN RELATIVE TERMS IT IS THE RETAIL OPERATION THAT SEEMS TO BE REBOUNDING FASTER FOR ITS PART COCA-COLA FEMSA WAS QUITE RESILIENT LEVERAGING EXECUTION CAPABILITIES TO ONCE AGAIN ADAPT TO

MILLION IN THE WAXIE NORTH AMERICAN PLATFORMS AS WELL AS THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGE TAX PAYMENTS MENTIONED BEFORE WHILE WE ARE ON THE DOC- IN THE TARGET OF DEBT WE SHOULD MENTION THAT DURING THE QUARTER WE PLACED $700 MILLION IN THE SECOND REOPENING OF OUR 30-YEAR DOLLAR-DENOMINATED BOND ISSUANCE BRINGING THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO $2.50 BILLION WHICH WAS OUR ORIGINAL TARGET THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE YIELD FOR A TOTAL ISSUANCE WAS 3.5% WHICH WAS ALSO OUR TARGET BACK IN SEPTEMBER WHEN WE STARTED THE WITH THIS PROJECT AND I HIGHLIGHT THIS BECAUSE IT TOOK US NINE MONTHS AND WE WENT TO THE MARKET ON

WHILE WE MANAGED TO OPEN A NUMBER OF NEW STORES DURING THE QUARTER WE ALSO HAVE TO CLOSE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR STORE BASE DUE TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS AND EFFECTS SOME OF THE CLOSURES WILL BE TEMPORARY BUT SOME WILL BE PERMANENT AS WE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE CERTAIN MARGINAL STORES FROM OUR BASE THE NUMBERS FOR THE QUARTER WENT LIKE THIS 159 NEW OPENINGS 85 REOPENING AFTER REMODELING AND MAINTENANCE 24 DEFINITIVE CLOSURES AND 260 TEMPORARY CLOSURES AS A RESULT WE RECORDED A NET REDUCTION OF 40 STORES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER TO REACH 950 NET STORE OPENINGS FOR THE LAST 12 MONTHS IN ADDITION TO THE STORE CLOSURES WE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF OPERATING SHIFTS FROM THREE TO TWO IN A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR STORES AS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN OPERATIONS IS NOT VIABLE OR NECESSARY

CUSTOMER TICKET HERE IT IS ALSO USEFUL TO PAUSE AND DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ENTIRE QUARTER BECAUSE WE DID SEE MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES AS THE QUARTER WENT BY DURING APRIL AS YOU MAY RECALL WE STILL HAD RELATIVE AVAILABILITY OF BEER THROUGH MOST OF THE MONTH AS WELL AS SOME PANIC BUYING FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS AND THIS MITIGATED THE BLOW IN LATE APRIL THE LEAST THE LAST MONTH OF THE QUARTER FOR OXXO DURING MAY HOWEVER WE BASICALLY DEPLETED OUR BEER INVENTORIES AND WE SAW THE STEEPEST CONTRACTIONS IN TRAFFIC MAKING THE WORST MONTH OF THE QUARTER FINALLY IN JUNE WE BEGAN TO RECOVER BEER AVAILABILITY AND WE ALSO BEGAN TO OBSERVE A GRADUAL SHIFT IN CONSUMER DYNAMICS DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE QUARTER MOST OF THE CONSUMER DEMAND WEAKNESS CAME FROM MOBILITY RESTRICTIONS AND LOCK-DOWNS WITH THE THIRST AND CRAVING OCCASIONS SUFFERING FROM THE ABSENCE OF CUSTOMERS GOING ABOUT ON THE STREET AND THE GATHERING OCCASION REELING FROM SOCIAL DISTANCING HOWEVER LATE IN THE QUARTER THE WEAKNESS IN DEMAND IN DEMAND SEEMS TO BE DRIVEN INCREASINGLY BY ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AS SO MANY CONSUMERS HAVE LOST THEIR INCOME MAKING THE CRISIS TODAY A BIT MORE SIMILAR TO PRIOR DOWNTURNS BUT ALSO MORE PRONOUNCED ADDING TO THE HEADWINDS AS MUCH AS HALF OF OUR STORES IN MEXICO WERE UNDER SOME TYPE OF OPERATING RESTRICTION FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES DURING THE QUARTER ALSO

IT SEEMS THE CRISIS IS STEADILY EVOLVING IN THE BEGINNING ITS MAIN DRIVERS WERE SEVERE HEALTH CONCERN AND THE LACK OF CONSUMER MOBILITY AND THIS REMAIN A PROBLEM HOWEVER WE ARE INCREASINGLY SEEING THE SIGNS OF ANOTHER SET OF MORE TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC HEADWINDS COME INTO PLAY THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE WITH ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE WE CONTINUE TO LOOK

ALL SAFE AND SOUND EDUARDO JUAN AND UM AND WELL EUGENIO WELCOME WELCOME ON BOARD SO UM MY MY ONE QUESTION WOULD BE ON THE MORE RECENT UM PERFORMANCE IN OXXO AND YOU'VE ELABORATED HOW IT WENT THROUGH THE QUARTER BUT IF YOU COULD SHED A LITTLE LIGHT ON UH THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE OVER THE MOST RECENT WEEKS UH INTO JULY WHERE WE'VE SEEN UH MORE STATES UH GOING INTO THE THE ORANGE PHASE UH SOME OF THE REOPENINGS AND IF YOU COULD ALSO SHARE WITH US ON THE UH THE THE TEMPORARY STORE CLOSURES UM HOW MANY YOU YOU CURRENTLY STILL HAVE CLOSED AND HOW DO YOU THINK THE REOPENING IS GOING TO EVOLVE CONSIDERING SOME OF THE TOURIST RESTRICTIONS AS WELL AS OFFICE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE STILL IN PLACE THAT WOULD BE MY QUESTION THANK YOU UH THANK YOU BEN UH UH LET ME TELL YOU WE WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS UH AS I SAID IN THE QUARTER 50% HAD HAD RESTRICTIONS NOW I WOULD SAY 35% HAVE RESTRICTIONS THE UH SAME-STORE SALES HAVE IMPROVED A LITTLE BIT UH MOBILITY IS IS IS COMING STILL BUT BUT THERE'S STILL UM UH IF WE YOU KNOW IF WE UH UH WE JUST PAY ATTENTION LET LET'S SAY TO THIS GLOBAL MOBILITY INDEX AND AND THE GLOBAL MOBILITY INDEX IN MEXICO IS DOWN AROUND 40% AND AND THAT REALLY I MEAN ME- OXXO REALLY LIVES BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE GO AND MOVING AND AND AND THIS IS REALLY UH BEING THE MAJOR CAUSE WE THINK THAT PEOPLE UH UH ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND AND ADAPT TO THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT MOBILITY IS COMING UP LITTLE BY LITTLE AND AND AND NOT ONLY CAR MOBILITY BUT PRODUCTION MOBILITY TOO AND I THINK IT ALL DEPENDS THAT UH HOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN THE NEXT UH UM UH QUARTER UH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH WITH UH OFFICES OPENING OR OR KEEPING IT CLOSED SO I THINK WE'RE OPTIMISTIC IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE UNDERSTANDING THE PANDEMIC BETTER UM YOU KNOW UH I COULD TELL THAT THE UH LACK OF CONTAGIOUS OF UM UM UM OF THIS UH PANDEMIC IN THE STORES IS VERY LOW VERY VERY LOW BASICALLY THE THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH THE THE THE UH THE UH OUR PERSONNEL IS MORE BECAUSE THE THE LOCK-DOWNS THEY LEAVE THEIR HOUSE AND THE LACK OF OF OF OF OF CARE THEY HAVE WITH WITH CONNECTION WITH SOME FAMILY MEMBERS AND AND AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD UH THE THE PANDEMIC GOES TO THE UH HOUSE NOT NE- NOT REALLY FROM FROM FROM THE TRAFFIC TO THE TO THE WORK OR THE STORE SO WE ARE OPTIMISTIC BUT THE THING IS THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE FEELING NOW THE PAIN THAT THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IS BECOMING IS IS IS IS STAYING HERE AND AND AND AND WE'LL WE WE WE ARE ADAPTING THE THE THE OFFERING TOO BUT WE ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO BE WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM BOB FORD OF BANK OF AMERICA HEY THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY AND AND THANK YOU FOR FOR TAKING MY QUESTION EDUARDO ON YOUR OPENING COMMENTS YOU MENTIONED THE 24 CLOSURES THAT ARE ANNOUNCED I WAS CURIOUS IS IT REALLY FOR A WIDER ASSESSMENT OF THE STORE BASE AND AND AND HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE FOOTPRINT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF MAYBE REALLOCATING THOSE RESOURCES TO OTHER LOCATIONS OR OR MAYBE JUST UH TRIMMING IT IN ANTICIPATION OF UH YOU KNOW MORE TRADITIONAL HEADWINDS IN TERMS OF THE THE SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY WELL AS I SAID THE A LOT OF THE LOCK-DOWNS THAT WE HAD HA- HAD THE RESTRICTIONS OF ALCOHOLIC UH CURFEWS OR OR LOCK-DOWNS OR THE POSSIBILITY OF OPEN STORES IN CERTAIN UH COMMERCIAL AREAS AND AND UH THAT WAS THE NUMBER THAT WE HAD AROUND 50% HAVE THESE KIND OF RESTRICTIONS AS I SAID NOW UH OUT OF THE 19,000 UH STORES THERE ARE AROUND 7,000 THAT MIGHT THAT HAVE HAD SOME KIND OF RESTRICTIONS FOR INSTANCE IN THE STATE OF TAMAULIPAS THE PREVIOUS WEEKEND WE WERE NOT ALLOWED UH TO TO TO SELL WE HA- WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CLO- CLOSE NOT ONLY NOT SELL ALCOHOL BUT TO CLOSE THE THE UH COMPLETELY THE STORE AND AGAIN I THINK THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING TO BEST THEIR BEST TO ADAPT AND AND AND AND AND HAVE COUNTERMEASURES AGAINST THIS PANDEMIC SOME ARE EFFECTIVE AND SOME ARE NOT UH I WOULD SAY AND AND AND BUT THE THING IS WE TRY TO TO LOBBY AND AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHORITIES IS PLANNING TO DO AND HELP THEM TO ACCOMPLISH THE THE OBJECTIVES NOT NECESSARILY BY BY BY UM UNSTABILIZING THE THE THE WAY WE WE WE WORK WITH THE STORES UM UH I THINK ANOTHER PROBLEM IS REALLY THROUGH THE LOCKDOWN THE THE LACK OF SOCIAL MOBILITY AND THE SOCIAL DISTANCING NIGHT SHIFTS ARE VERY VERY WEAK UM AND AND WE HAVE HAD SOME UH BESIDES THE THE LOCKDOWN RESTRICTIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH SOME AUTHORITIES OR SELLING OF ALCOHOL IN SOME UH SOME STORES ALSO WE ARE REALLY CLOSING SOME OF THE NIGHT SHIFTS BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS NO NO NO CONSUMERS AROUND SO BUT AGAIN WE THINK THAT IT WILL BE TEMPORARY AND UH AND WE ARE ADAPTING THE BEST WE CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU BOB AND AGAIN AS A REMIND THAT IS STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION AND IF YOU FIND THAT YOUR QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED YOU CAN REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE QUEUE BY PRESSING STAR TWO WE WILL NOW GO TO MIGUEL TORTOLERO OF GBM HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANKS FOR THE THANKS FOR THE QUESTIONS UH CONSIDERING THE TIMING OF THIS CRISIS THAT THAT CAME RIGHT AFTER YOU BOUGHT OR INVESTED IN A COUPLE OF COMPANIES WHICH OF THEM WOULD YOU SAY THAT HAVE HAD THE MOST CHALLENGING START NOW IN THE IN THE SENSE OF DIRECTION UH YOU KNOW WE WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE UH WITH OUR PARTNERS AND WITH THE COMPANIES WE ACQUIRED UH THEY ARE IN THE JAN-SAN BUSINESS AND AS AS YOU IMAGINE JAN HAS HAD A UH UH UH UH A GREAT UH UH DEMAND UH FOR FOR THE PRODUCTS OUT OF THE TWO UH WAXIE IS MORE FOCUSED TO JAN-SAN AND NORTH AMERICAN HAD A MORE DIVERSE PLATFORM AND IN FACT NORTH AMERICAN HAD HAD TO SELL UH TO SOME UH UH HOSPITALITY UH UH UH CUSTOMERS AND I THINK PROBABLY THAT IS THE ONE THAT HAS SUFFERED THE THE MOST BUT I THINK BOTH COMPANIES HAVE ADAPTED TREMENDOUSLY TO IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO TO PROTECT THEIR THEIR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND PROT- AND AND AND AND BUT THE AT THE VERY SAME TIME TRYING TO SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS SO WE'RE EXTRAORDINARILY HAPPY WITH THEM WE HAVE GREAT PARTNERS AND I THINK THAT UH WE ARE UH GOING TO BUILD AN EXTRAORDINARY PLATFORM WITH THE HELP OF THEM AND AND UH WE LOOK FORWARD WITH A VERY OPTIMISTIC UH UH UH UH FUTURE YEAH I I THINK I WOULD ADD UM UH MIGUEL THIS IS JUAN UM EVEN ON THE ON THE JETRO RESTAURANT DEPOT WHICH IS ALSO ONE OF THE RECENT INVESTMENTS UH WHICH BEING AS EXPOSED AS THEY ARE TO THE RESTAURANT SECTOR UH ONE WOULD THINK OR AT LEAST ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A FEW MONTHS AGO UH THAT THIS WOULD BE A COMPLICATED PERIOD FOR THEM AND I'M NOT SAYING IT IT HASN'T BEEN COMPLICATED BUT CERTAINLY UH THEY HAVE BEEN UH ADJUSTING AND NAVIGATING THE SITUATION UH QUITE FRANKLY EXCEEDING EXCEEDING AT LEAST MY PERSONAL EXPECTATIONS UH WHICH UH KIND OF CONFIRMS OUR VIEW THAT THIS IS A VERY WELL-POSITIONED AND VERY WELL-RUN COMPANY SO THEY HAVE BEEN DOING UH AS I SAID BETTER THAN BETTER THAN EXPECTED ADJUSTING AND I THINK THEIR CUSTOMERS AS WELL UH THE LITTLE RESTAURANTS ADAPTING TO YOU KNOW CURBSIDE DELIVERY UM AND THINGS BEGIN TO OPEN UP IN MANY OF THE MARKETS THAT THEY SERVE SO OVERALL I WOULD SAY ON THE RESTAURANT DEPOT FRONT UM YOU KNOW A POSITIVE SURPRISE GREAT THANK YOU BOTH <CROSSTALK> AND NOW WE WILL TAKE A QUESTION FROM MARCELLA RECCHIA OF CREDIT SUISSE AND MARCELLA IF YOU COULD CHECK YOUR MUTE FUNCTION WE'RE UNABLE TO HEAR YOU HI UH ARE YOU LISTENING ME NOW YES PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION YES OKAY HI JUAN HI EDUARDO I HOPE YOU ARE WELL UH JUST TWO QUICK QUE- QUE- QUESTIONS HERE FROM MY SIDE THE FIRST ONE IS ABOUT G&A UH I SAW THAT UH BASICALLY YOUR G&A UH INCREASED UH ACROSS THE BUSINESS DIVISIONS SO JUST TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S DRIVING SUCH INCREASE AND SECONDLY VERY BRIEFLY UH IF YOU CAN GIVE VIEWS UH YOUR IMPRESSIONS ABOUT THE MEXICAN PENSION REFORM IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS FOR FOR FEMSA THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL I I WILL GO TO TO THE SECOND ONE AND I THINK UH I'LL LET JUAN ANSWER THE FIRST ONE THE THE PENSION REFORM I THINK IT IS UM THIS HOLE LED THERE AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING THAT WE ALTOGETHER TRIED TO SOLVE IT BECAUSE IT WILL BE UH VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT TO TO TO SOLVE AND AND WHAT WE WOULDN'T LIKE TO HAVE TO SOLVE IT IN A DESPERATE WAY AND AND THAT THAT COULD DISRUPT THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN MEXICO I THINK WHAT WE HAVE IN UH FOR THE FUTURE IS IS IS KIND OF PAINFUL BUT I THINK IT'S WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I THINK BETWEEN THE UH UM UH THE UH UH UH PRIVATE COMPANIES AND THE GOVERNMENT I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S A GOOD TREND THAT WE ARE TOGETHER HERE TO TO FIX THE HOLE FOR THE LONG RUN UH AND THE OTHER ONE UH JUAN WHY DON'T YOU GO AND TRY TO ANSWER THE THE VERY FIRST QUESTION PLEASE YES HI MARCELLA SO WE WE ARE HAVING UH SOME UH AMORTIZATION OF IT INVESTMENTS UH I THINK ON THE OXXO FRONT THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO TO UH INVEST IN THEIR NEW VERSIONS OF SOME OF THE SOFTWARE UH AS WELL AS DEVELOPING THE DIGITAL UH PLATFORMS ACROSS THE BOARD UM WE HAVE HAD SOME UH CLOSURES OF STORES UH AND WE'VE HAD SOME UH ASSET WRITE-DOWNS BOTH AT COKE FEMSA AND AND AT FEMSA SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE PLAYING UH A PART ON THAT OBVIOUSLY UH WE CAN WE CAN ALSO FOLLOW UP OFFLINE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW MAKING THE NUMBERS MATCH BUT I THINK OFF THE TOP OF OUR HEADS THAT THOSE ARE UH CONCEPTS THAT COME TO MIND OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH GUYS THANK YOU AND NEXT WE WILL GO TO GUSTAVO OLIVEIRA OF UBS HI UH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION UH IT'S ON OXXO UH GROSS MARGIN YOU MENTIONED THAT UH YOU YOUR YOUR NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY VERY GOOD UH THERE WAS A VERY LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE YOU MENTIONED THAT THE BEER SHORTAGE OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS YOUR PROFITABILITY BUT THAT WAS OFFSET BY BY THE SERVICE CATEGORY ON THE RECOVERY UH DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE AN EXPANSION IN YOUR GROSS MARGIN AS THE I DON'T KNOW IF THE SERVICE CATEGORY UH REALLY REMAINS STRONG UH AND THE BEER CLEARLY COULD RECOVER UH COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE A BIT ON ON THE TREND FOR FOR THE GROSS GROSS MARGIN FOR FOR OXXO WELL LET LET ME GIVE YOU A SUMMA- OUR BUSINESS OUR SUPPLIERS AND US ARE CONCERNED WITH THE LACK THE UH LACK OF CONSUMER UH UH UH UH ECONOMIC STRENGTH BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IS TO COME UP WITH WITH DIFFERENT OFFERINGS TO TO REALLY ESTIMATE DEMA- THE DEMAND UM AND HERE WE ARE UH WE HAVE OUR OUR OUR OUR OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR PARTNERS AND AND TRYING TO DO SOMETHING UH GREAT FOR THEM FOR THE CONSUMER IN IN IN UH IN IN IN COVID TIMES BUT I DON'T KNOW UH JUAN WHY DO YOU GO AND AND GO FOR THE UH DETAILS OF THE NUMBERS PLEASE SURE UH I I THINK ON THE GROSS MARGIN I MEAN HISTORICALLY OR AT LEAST FOR FOR A A LONG TIME NOW THE TWO MAIN DRIVERS OF GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION HAVE BEEN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES CATEGORY AND UH YOU KNOW UH THE COMMERCIAL INCOME THAT WE THAT WE RECEIVE FROM OUR FROM OUR UH SUPPLIER PARTNERS RIGHT NOW AS EDUARDO HA- HAS SAID UM YOU KNOW I'M I THINK A POSITIVE SURPRISE HAS BEEN THE RESILIENCE AND EVEN THE YOU KNOW UH FASTER GROWTH OF FINANCIAL SERVICES DURING THE DOWNTURN UM AS CONSUMERS HAVE KIND OF MADE SURE THAT THEY'RE KEEPING CURRENT WITH THEIR WITH THEIR MEMBERSHIPS AND THEIR UTILITIES AND AND UM YOU KNOW REALIZING OR OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S IT'S A LOT EASIER TO GO TO OXXO THAN THAN TO GO TO THE BANK AND IT'S LESS TIME-CONSUMING AND SO EVEN THOUGH FINANCIAL SERVICES HAD BEEN CONTRACTING OR AT LEAST IT HAS BEEN GROWING LESS IN RECENT QUARTERS IN THE LAST TWO THREE QUARTERS UH THIS QUARTER IT ACTUALLY UH THE GROWTH CAME CAME IN THE IN THE HIGH SINGLE DIGITS WHICH WAS A A POSITIVE SURPRISE AND I THINK CONTRIBUTES TO THE TO A HIGH GROSS MARGIN THE OTHER QUESTION UH ON COMMERCIAL INCOME IS A LITTLE BIT TRICKIER UH BECAUSE YOU KNOW SO UH SOME OF THOSE AGREEMENTS AS EDUARDO ALSO REFERRED TO UM ARE ARE TIED TO TO VOLUME AND SO IT'S HARD TO PREDICT I MEAN WE WE DO NEED UH VOLUMES TO COME UP UH TRANSACTIONS TO GO UP FOR COMMERCIAL INCOME TO GO UP UH YOU KNOW IN CONSEQUENCE SO I WOULD SAY VISIBILITY FOR GROSS MARGIN IS IS IS NOT AS CLEAR AS AS WE WOULD LIKE UM I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY PREDICT AT THIS POINT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TO EXPAND IT UM YOU KNOW MORE THAN MORE THAN TREND UH BUT AT LEAST DURING THE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER UH IT DID UH KIND OF HOLD ITS OWN THANK YOU I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU UH I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT PROBABLY THE UH UH THERE THERE WERE A SMALL INCREASE ALSO IN IN IN IN UH THE LACK OF BEER ALSO UH SHIFT DEMAND TO UH TO SOME OTHER ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND UM THAT THOSE UH HAVE UH UH THAT COMPENSATED THE MARGIN A LITTLE BIT TOO AND THAT IT ACTUALLY BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING POINT UH EDUARDO BECAUSE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT UH CONSUMERS DID UH SHIFT TO UH HIGHER CONSUMPTION OF SPIRITS UH DURING THE QUARTER UM AND INTERESTINGLY I THINK WHAT WHAT THE OXXO UH OUR OXXO COLLEAGUES WERE OBSERVING IN RECENT WEEKS WAS THAT EVEN AS THE BEER CAME BACK THAT THE VOLUME FOR SPIRITS WAS STILL UH HOLDING UP STRONG SO MAYBE YOU KNOW IF UH IN THE IN THE EFFORT TO LOOK FOR THE FOR THE SILVER LINING OR THE GLASS HALF FULL UH YOU KNOW AS CONSUMERS REALIZE WHAT THE ASSORTMENT AND THE THE PRICING IS FOR FOR SPIRITS UH AT THE OXXO STORES THAT THIS BECOMES A CATEGORY THAT THAT IS UH YOU KNOW THAT IS STRONGER THAN THAT HISTORICALLY BECAUSE HISTORICALLY WE HAVEN'T SOLD AS MUCH SPIRITS AS AS WE ARE SELLING RIGHT NOW SO HOPEFULLY THIS REMAINS AFTER THE AFTER THE PANDEMIC IS IS UH GONE AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT QUESTION AND THAT WILL BE FROM ALAN ALANIS OF SANTANDER THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE EDUARDO HELLO ALAN HELLO DID DID WE LOSE ALAN IT LOOKS LIKE WE MAY HAVE LOST ALAN WE'LL GO NEXT TO ULISES ARGOTE HI EVERYONE THANKS FOR THE FOR THE SPACE FOR QUESTIONS SO HERE UH I WANTED TO TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS A LITTLE BIT ON ON ANY POTENTIAL UH PRODUCT PORTFOLIO RATIONALIZATION THERE THERE IN OXXO UH AND MAYBE IF YOU CAN SHARE ANY ANY COLOR ON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF OF THE SHIFT IN IN MIX MORE RECENTLY NOW IN JULY MAYBE GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE TO THE MORE PROFITABLE CATEGORIES THAT YOU GUYS HAVE THERE UH THANK YOU YOU KNOW UNLESS WE THINK THAT THIS UH LACK OF MOBILITY WILL STAY FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME UM UH WHICH WE NOT WHICH WE WE DON'T THINK IT IS THE CASE I THINK WE WE BE- WE HAVE TO ADAPT BETTER AND WE HAVE TO ADAPT MORE TO THE UM TO THE UM UM LACK OF OF OF CONSUMER ECONOMIC UH POWER AND AND BY BY PROBABLY WITH A DIFFERENT ASSORTMENT PROBABLY THE THE THE LOOKING FOR FOR CHEAPER OR OR LESS EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS UM OUR RETURNABLE UH UH CUN- UH UH UH SOFT DRINKS UH IS IS NOT AS STRONG AS WE UH UH WE SHOULD HAVE IT NOW AND AND AND THOSE KIND OF SHIFT WE CAN WE CAN FORESEE IT FOR THE FUTURE BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN IN THE TYPES OF OF OF OF OF CONSUMER DEMAND OF OF OF OF UH THIRST OR OR OR UH BREAKFAST OR OR PEOPLE GATHERING DEPENDING ON UH WE THINK THAT EVENTUALLY UH THOSE THOSE UH TYPE OF OF CONSUMER DEMAND WILL STAY IT IS MORE THE LACK OF ECONOMIC POWER THE CONSUMER THAT WE'RE MORE CONCERNED THAN THAN THE UH REAL SHIFT OF OF OUR CONSUMER OCCASIONS THAT THAT'S PERFECT AND AND A BIT MORE ON THE ON THE SHORT TERM KIND OF THINKING NOW ON ON JUNE-JULY AFTER THE THE BEER CATEGORY'S BACKEND ETC UH DO YOU HAVE ANY ANY COLOR THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH US KIND OF THERE ON ON THE SHIFT BACK LET'S SAY IN IN MIX YEAH JUAN YEAH I I I THINK YOU KNOW ONE ONE THING TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT AND I THINK EDUARDO TOUCHED ON IT IN HIS UH OPENING REMARKS WAS THAT UM THE QUARTER ITSELF WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A UH I DON'T KNOW IF A V SHAPE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A STRONG UH DESCRIPTOR BUT CERTAINLY THE THE THE TROUGH OF THE OF THE OF THE TREND WAS WAS THE MONTH OF MAY UM AND WE BELIEVE THAT UH WE HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT WILL MARK THE THE LOWEST POINT OF THIS DOWNTURN UH SHOULD BE THE MONTH OF MAY UM AND THEN AS AS BEER COMES BACK UH IT IT IT HELPS EVERYTHING RIGHT IT IT HELPS OPERATING LEVERAGE AND IT HELPS MARGINS AND UH GENERALLY BEGINS TO TO TURN THIS INTO A UH UH A MORE TRADITIONAL DOWNTURN SO SO TO SPEAK UM AND SO YOU KNOW THE UH AS EDUARDO SAID IN THE BEGINNING WE WE ARE SEEING IMPROVING IMPROVING METRICS AND IMPROVING UH TRAFFIC AND AND UH REALLY THE THE ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS NOT TO CONVEY THE THE VIEW THAT YOU KNOW ONCE THE THE MOBILITY RESTRICTIONS ARE ARE GONE THAT WE GO BACK TO NORMAL UH IMMEDIATELY RIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THESE UH SYMPTOMS AND AND SIGNS OF A OF A MORE TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC-DRIVEN UH DOWNTURN BUT UH AGAIN YOU KNOW YOU WHEN YOU GO WHEN YOU GO DRY AND THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE ON THE BEER SIDE UH OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE BOTH OF OUR SUPPLIERS ON THE BEER FRONT UH WORKING HARD TO RESTOCK THE THE SHELVES UM CONSUMERS THEMSELVES ARE ARE PROBABLY BUYING A LITTLE BIT MORE BEER THAN THEY NORMALLY DO UH TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GO DRY AGAIN AND SO YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE SEEING UH POSITIVE TRENDS ON ON ON SOME OF THESE UH IMPORTANT CATEGORIES ESPECIALLY BEER UM SO I WOULD EXPECT THAT TO TO CONTINUE AND UH YOU KNOW WE WE WILL OBVIOUSLY MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS UH EDUARDO REFERENCED SOME IN TERMS OF OF UH PACKAGING AND AND AND MIX FOR SOME IMPORTANT CATEGORIES UM I THINK WE NEED TO TO BE CAREFUL AND WORK HARD AT AT UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU KNOW HOW QUICKLY AND AND WHAT THE NEW NORMAL EVENTUALLY ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE UH IN THE SENSE THAT WE WILL I'M SURE ADAPT OUR VALUE PROPOSITION TO THAT UH WHETHER IT MEANS UH YOU KNOW SOME INCREMENTAL SKUS OR A SHIFT IN THE MIX UM AND THAT SORT OF THING SO SO WE'RE WE'RE STILL NOT UH AT THE END OF THIS UH BUT WE KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THE CONSUMER IS UH ADJUSTING HABITS THAN WE DID A COUPLE MONTHS AGO UM AND WE ARE ACTING IN IN CONSEQUENCE <UNK> YEAH <UNK> AND WE WILL NOW GO BACK TO ALAN ALANIS OF SANTANDER <LAUGH> LET'S SEE IF THIS TIME WORKS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION AND AGAIN GOOD MORNING HOPE YOU GUYS ARE AND YOUR FAMILIES ARE SAFE UM EDUARDO OR JUAN UM I GUESS I MEAN WE ON THE SELL SIDE MOST OF US HAVE A BUY RATING ON THE STOCK I MEAN BECAUSE OF THE OF OF THE LUXURY VALUATION OF OXXO IMPLIED HERE NOW THE THE THE RESULT OF THIS QUARTER I GUESS THE QUESTION IS UH IS IS THIS RESULT PUTTING TO QUESTION THE BUSINESS MODEL OF OXXO IN THE LONG RUN THIS IS THE FIRST QUARTER EVER THAT YOU CLOSED STORES UH SO I GUESS THE SPECIFIC QUESTION IS UM AND AND SORRY IF I MISSED IT UH WHAT WHAT'S THE EXPECTATION REGARDING STORE OPENINGS GOING FORWARD AND THE SECOND THING AND THIS IS A QUESTION WE GET A LOT AND I'M I'M SURE JUAN ALSO GETS IT A LOT AND EDUARDO IT IS WHY THE RELUCTANCE TO STAY AWAY FROM E-COMMERCE UM AND INVEST HERE IN JOB YOU'VE BEEN SAYING EVERY TIME YOU GUYS MENTIONED THE COPILOT WITH AMAZON OR SO FORTH THE STOCK REACTS POSITIVELY WHY NOT INVEST IN A IN A BASEMENT OR IN A SECOND FLOOR IN AS IN AS MANY OFFICES AS POSSIBLE TO USE THEM AS DISTRIBUTION FOR E-COMMERCE AND AND LEVERAGE THAT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE THE CHANGES OF THE PANDEMIC WILL COST AND THE THIRD AND LAST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH WITH CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT I MEAN I THINK THAT THE PUSHBACK HAS BEEN VISIBILITY IN TERMS OF CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT EDUARDO YOU MENTIONED ABOUT PATIENCE AND DISCIPLINE I THINK THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR FOR INVESTORS THAT YOUR YOU YOU GUYS ARE VERY PATIENT BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPAND ON IN TERMS OF OF GIVING COMFORT TO INVESTORS THAT YOU WILL REMAIN DISCIPLINED IN TERMS OF THAT CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT GIVEN THE THE THE VERY STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW GENERATION THAT YOU THAT YOU GENERATE THOSE WILL BE MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH WELL LET ME TELL YOU WE WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC OF OXXO IN IN IN THE MEDIUM AND LONG RUN UH I THINK WE HAVE A EXTRAORDINARY PLATFORM AND AND AND UH IT'S IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE UH THE RIGHT CONSUMER UH UH UH THE ADJUSTMENTS AND AND AND THE LACK OF MOBILITY THAT THAT THAT WILL HELP US TO BE ON TRACK AGAIN UM UM IN TERMS OF OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE E-COMMERCE WE'RE WE'RE VERY MUCH- MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> UH UH UH UH WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT WE ARE NOT PREPARED YET TO DISCLOSE BUT I THINK WE ARE IN IN THE FINANCIAL UH IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR WE SEE THE EVOLUTION THERE AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED AND ALSO THE LOYALTY PROGRAM IS RELATED AND CONNECTED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL PLATFORM UM WE WE UH THE CURRENT THE CURRENT UH THE IF IF YOU WANT TO SEE UH THOSE ARE THE UH THE ONES UH THE LINKAGES THAT WE ARE MAKING WITH THE CURRENT PLATFORMS LIKE AMAZON AND EVERYTHING WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC UH WITH THOSE TWO WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET IS THE- MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> UH THE UH UH HOME DELIVERY HOME DELIVERY STILL WE DON'T SEE HOW THE UH IM- IMPACT THE ONES THAT ARE DOING HOME DELIVERY IN SMALL PURCHASES NOT GROCERIES MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> BUT SMALL PURCHASES ARE THE ONES WE DELIVER NO NOBODY MAKES MONEY NOBODY MAKES MONEY MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> AND AND AND THEY ARE STILL UH TRYING TO TO CATCH UP AND FIND A A BETTER WAY SO UH IF WE WERE IN THE GROCERY BUSINESS WITHOUT DOUBT THAT WE WILL BE DELIVERING A LOT OF THINGS FOR THE FOR THE UH FOR HOMES BECAUSE EC- ECONOMICALLY THOSE MAKE SENSE AND THE OTHER THE OTHER ONES WE HAVEN'T SEEN YET ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SOME TEST TO DELIVER IN A VERY EFFICIENT WAY WITH SOME BACK STORES AND EVERYTHING BUT I THINK THERE ARE STILL SOME LEARNINGS AND AND UH EFFICIENCIES TO COME UH TO COME IN INTO PLACE TO TO PERFORM BETTER I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD UH UH UH UH TO THE QUESTION JUAN THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU EDUARDO YES I DO <LAUGH> I THINK ALAN'S FIRST UH ATTEMPT AT THE QUESTION DIDN'T WORK BUT THE SECOND ATTEMPT HE MADE SURE THAT HE COVERED A FAIR AMOUNT OF BIG TOPICS SO I WILL I WILL TRY TO TO TO ADD TO TO SOME OF THESE UH SO ON THE STORE FRONT UH ALAN YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS UH YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE BEEN OPENING MORE STORES EVERY YEAR THAN THE PREVIOUS UH YOU KNOW WE GOT AS HIGH AS 1,350 I THINK AT THE AT THE TOP MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> UM AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY UH TO LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A LAYER OF STORES THAT ARE PROBABLY MARGINAL IN TERMS OF OF WHAT THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THE NUMBERS AND WE'RE WE'RE FI- YOU KNOW FIGURING OUT WHICH OF THOSE STORES ACTUALLY SHOULD NOT BE OPEN UH KIND OF PRUNING THE THE BASE OF A SMALL UH NUMBER OF STORES THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE OPEN AND JUST GENERALLY I THINK UH YOU KNOW THE THE BUDGET FOR STORES THIS YEAR BEFORE PANDEMIC YOU KNOW KIND OF REARED ITS ITS UGLY HEAD WE WERE THINKING ABOUT 1,200 STORES FOR MEXICO SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS A LEVEL THAT IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN THE TOP THAT WE REACHED A COUPLE YEARS AGO UH BUT YOU KNOW WE WE WERE ALREADY KIND OF MOVING INTO A PHASE WHERE YOU ARE YOU ARE BECOMING MORE DEMANDING ABOUT WHAT YOU EXPECT OF YOUR NEW STORES IN ORDER TO ENSURE UH PROFITABILITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF THE NEW STORES AND AT THE SAME TIME THE BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR HAD US WITH ABOUT 150 STORES OUTSIDE OF MEXICO SO I THINK UM WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THAT PROCESS WHERE UH INTERNATIONAL WILL BEGIN TO ADD UH YOU KNOW MORE MEANINGFUL NUMBERS TO THE NUMBER OF STORES AND OBVIOUSLY ONCE WE GET SOME SCALE IN COLOMBIA CHILE EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY BRAZIL THAT THIS BECOMES UH NOT JUST A MEXICO STORY BUT MORE OF A OF A OF A CONTINENTAL STORY UH SO WE ARE AT THAT STAGE AND I THINK THIS YEAR WITH THE PANDEMIC WITH THE DYNAMICS UH WE DECIDED TO TO TO START CLOSING A FEW OF THOSE KIND OF MARGINAL STORES I'M ALSO OPTIMISTIC ON THE STOREFRONT THAT FOR CENTRAL AND WESTERN MEXICO NOW THAT WE HAVE UH THE YOU KNOW BOTH PORTFOLIOS OF BEERS UH THAT THERE WILL BE A LARGE NUMBER OF LOCATIONS IN PLACES LIKE GUADALAJARA LEON QUERETARO UH EVEN THE THE VALLEY OF MEXICO WHERE UH THE FACT THAT YOU NOW HAVE UM THE ABI PORTFOLIO UH KIND OF TAKES A LOT OF THOSE LOCATIONS THAT WERE JUST SHORT OF BEING VIABLE MAKES THEM VIABLE UM AND AGAIN KIND OF UH YOU KNOW ENSURES THAT WE CAN CONTIN- CONTINUE TO OPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF STORES IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY UM I THINK ON THE E-COMMERCE FRONT I MEAN EDUARDO TOUCHED ON IT IN TERMS OF UH ALSO OBVIOUSLY REALIZING THE THE POTENTIAL AND THE POWER OF OF THE OXXO PLATFORM UM TO BANKARIZE PEOPLE OR TO GET PEOPLE TO ADOPT UH NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR NEW PRODUCTS I MEAN I THINK WE WE WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE SALDAZO EXPERIENCE THAT GIVES US A LOT OF COMFORT UH IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO GET PEOPLE TO SIGN UP AND AND ADOPT UH UM NEW NEW MEANS OF PAYMENT OR NEW MEANS OF OF OF OF SAVING UH BUT ONE THING WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS TO OVERPROMISE AND AND UNDERDELIVER SO UH WE ARE WORKING HARD AT UH THE THREE-LEGGED STOOL OF UH OUR DIGITAL PLATFORM AT AT OXXO WHICH INVOLVES LAST-MILE DELIVERY UH AND I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY THE LOYALTY PROGRAM AND THE E-WALLET AND UH HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW THE MARKET UH YOU KNOW TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR AND THEN FINALLY ON CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT UH I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU'VE SEEN US FOR OVER THE YEARS UM FEMSA BASICALLY HAS A COUPLE OF WAYS THAT THAT WE GROW UH WE EITHER TAKE WHAT WE DO WELL TO A NEW GEOGRAPHY OR WE TAKE WHAT WE DO WELL AND WE EXPAND IT BY A COUPLE OF DEGREES AND EXAMPLES OF OF THIS ABOUND UM WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JUGOS DEL VALLE OR SANTA CLARA OR OR THE DRUGSTORE BUSINESS WHERE YOU TOOK KIND OF OXXO AND AND EXPANDED UH WHAT IT DOES BY A FEW DEGREES AND AND YOU YOU KNOW DECIDE TO GO INTO INTO DRUGSTORES SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THE MARKET UH TO YOUR POINT IN IN TERMS OF HOW YOU FRAME THE QUESTION UH IT'S STILL KIND OF GETTING ITS HANDS AROUND UH YOU KNOW WHY IT IS THAT WE MADE A COUPLE OF INVESTMENTS IN THE US UM OR HOW DOES THE THE JAN-SAN BUSINESS FIT INTO THE OVERALL STRATEGY UM I THINK YOU'RE SEEING US DO KIND OF WHAT WE USUALLY DO WHICH IS FIGURING OUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO WELL AND THEN TAKING IT TO ANOTHER ANOTHER COUNTRY OBVIOUSLY WITH THE BENEFIT OF VERY STRONG PARTNERS UM AS WE HAVE IN IN IN THE US UM SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE YOU KNOW WE WE ARE ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF COMPLEXITY TO THE TO THE ORG CHART UM WE WILL TRY TO ADDRESS THAT UH TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN BY INCREASING THE DISCLOSURE AND WHERE WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO START OPENING UP THE NUMBERS FOR S- UH THE LOGISTICS BUSINESS AS WELL AS FOR THE JAN-SAN BUSINESS UH FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR UM SO YOU KNOW CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT UH THESE INVESTMENTS AND AND AND ADDRESSING THE COMPLEXITY THAT IT BRINGS TO THE EQUATION ARE VERY MUCH UH TOP OF MIND FOR FOR THE TEAM AND AND HOPEFULLY WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING IT GOT IT GOT IT NO THANK YOU SO MUCH I MEAN YOU YOU GUYS ARE EXTREMELY GOOD IF NOT THE BEST IN IN THE REGION IN TERMS OF LARGE-SCALE LOGISTICS OF MOVING THINGS IT'S JUST LIKE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A LOT OF INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO BUY I MEAN THAT LOGISTICS EXPERTISE HASN'T BEEN MOVED TO LIKE ALL THE WAY TO SMALL DELIVERY LIKE EDUARDO SAID IT'S YOUR LARGEST POINT I MEAN I KNOW I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING VERY HUMBLY AND THINGS THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW BUT UH AMAZON TESLA FACEBOOK UH ALL OF THESE COMPANIES STARTED WITHOUT MAKING MONEY INITIALLY AND UH THEY JUST AND YOU GAINED THE SCALE AND UH THESE COLOMBIAN GUYS RAPPI IT'S A QUESTION MARK IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO THEN TO CONTROL THE SMALL THE SMALL DROP SIZE DELIVERY AND I JUST THINK THAT AND I THINK A LOT OF INVESTOR THINKS THAT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE THE BALANCE SHEET YOU HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND I THINK THAT YEAH INITIALLY WELL NOBODY WILL MAKE MONEY AND PROBABLY YOU GET IN YOU PROBABLY WON'T MAKE MONEY EITHER BUT UH ONCE YOU GET THE SCALE EVENTUALLY I THINK CONSUMERS WILL PAY A PREMIUM FOR USING UBER FOR PAY- USING PAYGROUP OR USING AMAZON AND SO FORTH AND WITH A LONG-TERM VISION THAT FEMSA HAS I THINK THAT A LOT OF INVESTORS ARE ASKING WHY WHY AREN'T YOU GETTING INTO THAT WITH MORE STRENGTH IN USING YOUR YOUR MUSCLE AND YOUR EXPERTISE BUT ANYWAYS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS THANKS STAY SAFE AND HAVE A GREAT DAY THANK YOU THANK YOU ALAN <CROSSTALK> THANK YOU ALAN I MEAN I'LL JUST WRAP THAT QUESTION UH YOU KNOW THE THE THE CONCEPT OR THE NOTION OF THE SUPER APPS AND HOW IN IN OTHER IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIES OBVIOUSLY UH THINGS HAVE EVOLVED VERY QUICKLY UH BUT WE DO HAVE THE ASPIRATION WITH THE YOU KNOW WITH THE RIGHT PLATFORM AND THE RIGHT PARTNERSHIP UH TO HOPEFULLY BECOME BECOME ONE OF THOSE UH OR PART OF PART OF ONE OF THOSE ECOSYSTEMS UH DOWN THE ROAD AND LEVERAGE QUITE FRANKLY THE THE 20,000 UH BRICKS-AND-MORTAR STORES THAT WE HAVE UM WHICH ARE A DIFFERENTIATING FACTOR VIS-A-VIS OTHER FOLKS GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH JUAN THANK YOU EDUARDO THANKS ALAN THANK YOU ALAN AND NOW WE'LL GO TO RODRIGO ECHAGARAY OF SCOTIABANK THANK YOU UH GUYS UM THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE STATE OF THE MOM-AND-POP STORES IN MEXICO I MEAN ON THE ONE HAND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE MANY WILL WILL NOT GO ON THEIR COURSE UH AND ON THE OTHER HAND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT MAY PUSH MANY SORT OF SHOP IN THE INFORMAL ECONOMY SO ANY ANY THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND WOULD BE APPRECIATED WELL UH I I I THINK THE MOM-AND-POPS WERE HARDLY HIT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF BEER AND THAT WAS UH UH UH UH UM AND AND AND AND ALSO THE LACK OF CIGARETTES BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ONLY BEER IN CIGARETTES I THINK WE WERE ABLE TO TO UH TO UH UM PREPARE OURSELVES WITH GOOD INVENTORIES AND BUT AGAIN THE UH SO THOSE TWO WERE UH MAJOR UH UH THEY HAVE MAJOR EFFECTS ON THAT UH IN THE OTHER HAND I THINK THE UM THE TRADITIONAL MOM-AND-POPS ARE CLOSED WHERE PEOPLE LIVE SO I THINK I WOULD SAY THERE ARE DIFFERENT MOM-AND-POPS TO WHERE WHERE WHERE THE THE WHERE MOBILITY WAS A MAJOR ROLE YES THEY'VE BEEN HARD HARDLY HIT BUT THESE ARE AND I THINK THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE UH NEIGHBORHOODS I THINK THEY ARE THEY ARE COMING UP WITH A WITH A GOOD UH UH PERFORMANCE I WOULD SAY ALSO THAT THAT WE ARE BETTER PREPARED IN THE RETURNABLE BOTTLES THAT THE ONES THE RETURNABLE SOFT DRINKS COMPARED WITH WITH OXXO SO THAT WAS UH UH UH A SMALL ADVANTAGE BUT YES AG- AGAIN I I THINK THEY WILL RECUPERATE BECAUSE I THINK THE UH UH THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM BIMBO AND AND ALIKE ARE VERY MUCH WI- WILLING TO SUPPORT AND AND AND HELP UH AND AND UH HELP THEM TO TO COMPETE AND AND AND SO I I DO SEE THAT THE PANDEMIC IN THOSE LEVELS I THINK IS IS HELPING THEM TO TO TO TO SUSTAIN BUT YES BUT THE THEY WERE VERY HARDLY HIT THE ONES THAT HAVE UH LACK OF BEER IN IN IN DURING THIS UH INITIAL PERIOD OF THE DOWNTURN GREAT THANK YOU AND AND JUST RELATED TO THE LAST QUESTION I GUESS UM YOU YOU HAVE UH TAKEN SOME STAKES IN IN CERTAIN STARTUPS UM AND I HAVE SEEN THAT UH ONE OF THOSE UH JUSTO UH HAVE BEEN UH GROWING QUITE QUITE A BIT UH ANY INSIGHTS OR THINGS THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED ON ON THE DELIVERY IN IN IN THESE STAKES THAT THAT YOU CAN SHARE YES YOU KNOW WE WE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SUPPORT THE UH VEN- UH WITH SOME PENSION MONEY UH TO SUPPORT THOSE SUPPLIERS UH THAT ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH US SO WE'LL HELP THOSE UH TO ENHANCE OUR OUR VALUE PROPOSITION AND AND I I DON'T KNOW UH SPECIFICALLY THE ONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JUAN WELL MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF OF BUT YES WE'RE WORKING NOT ONLY WITH TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPLIERS BUT ALSO WITH WITH UH NORMAL SUPPLIERS WHERE WE COULD HELP THEM UH TO BECOME LARGER AND IN FACT WE DID THAT WITH A UM A GREAT SUPPLIER THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS CAFFENIO WHICH IS THE ONE THAT SUPPORTED ALL THE COFFEE OPERATIONS AND I THINK WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE WE COULD BE OF OF GREAT UH UH SUPPORT TO THEM SO THIS PANDEMIC WE ALSO UM UH WE WE ALL THE SMALL UH UH VENDORS WE ARE HELPING THEM TO PAY THEM VERY QUICKLY SO THEY DON'T HAVE THIS CASH CURRENCY PROBLEM THAT THIS PANDEMIC WILL COST TO THEM AND AND UH SO THAT THAT THAT THOSE ARE THE THE YES BUT OUR OUR SMALL-SCALE SUPPLIERS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND THE STRATEGIC ONES WE WANT TO INVEST WITH THEM SO THEY CAN GROW BETTER AND FASTER TO BECOME A MAJOR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO US YEAH I THINK ON THE ON THE UH JUSTO OR JUSTO UM INVESTMENT I MEAN CERTAINLY WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO TO HELP UH THESE THESE NEW VENTURES THROUGH THROUGH OUR FEMSA VENTURES ARM UH BUT ALSO LEARN UH ABOUT UH YOU KNOW THINGS THAT THAT WOULD HELP US IN OUR OWN UH VALUE PROPOSITION OR OR THE WAY THAT WE OPERATE AND CERTAINLY UH DISTRIBUTION THE USE OF UM YOU KNOW DARK DARK WAREHOUSES OR DARK KITCHENS DARK STORES UM THE HANDLING OF PERISHABLES UH THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO TO BE BETTER AT AND TO KNOW MORE ABOUT AND THIS THIS INVESTMENT IN PARTICULAR OBVIOUSLY HAS HAS UH TUR- IT TURNED OUT TO BE UH AN INTERESTING ONE UM I MEAN THE THE THE THE THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED ARE ARE NOT HUGE AND RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF FEMSA BUT CERTAINLY IT'S A STARTUP THAT IS DOING VERY WELL AND OF COURSE UH I KNOW THAT YOU STAY CLOSE TO TO TO THESE COMPANIES AND AND AND THEIR YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING AND AND HOW QUICKLY THEY'RE GROWING AND AND THIS IS SO FAR A VERY NICE SUCCESS STORY WELL UH THANKS UH EDUARDO AND JUAN <UNK> AND WE WILL GO TO ALVARO GARCIA OF P- BTG PACTUAL GOOD MORNING EDUARDO JUAN EUGENIO UH MY QUESTIONS I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS SORRY I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE ON HEINEKEN I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT YOUR POSITION ON THE STAKE ON OWNING YOU KNOW THIS THIS 15% HAS CHANGED OR NOT GIVEN THE NEW TAX AGREEMENT WITH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND TWO UH ON M&A IS IT FAIR TO SAY YOU'RE IN INTEGRATION MODE IT WOULD SEEM TO BE A NICE TIME TO SORT OF TAKE A BREATHER AND AND AND INTEGRATE A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT UH ASSETS YOU YOU BOUGHT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS UM THOSE ARE MY TWO QUESTIONS THANK YOU WELL THE HEINEKEN THE HEINEKEN SHARES UH YES IT'S A TEMPORARY INVESTMENT WE JUST HAVE TO TRY TO UH A WAY TO UH UH DEPLOY THAT CAPITAL IN A BETTER WAY AND AND AND UM IT IT IS IT IT IS AS AS NOT AS OPTIMAL AS AS IT WAS IN THE PAST AS YOU ARE REFERRING UH BUT IT'S WE JUST HAVE TO FIND THE THE THE RIGHT TIME UH AND AND THE RIGHT PATH TO TO UH DEPLOY THAT CAPITAL AND AND AND HAVE THAT UM UM USE OF THOSE PROCEEDS UM THE THE SECOND QUESTION UH I FORGOT UH JUAN WOULD UH UH I I I FORGOT THE SECOND THE THE SECOND POINT <CROSSTALK> ARE WE READY TO TAKE A BREATHER AFTER A LOT OF ACTIVITY ON THE M&A FRONT UM AND I THINK I MEAN I I THINK THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT IS IS YES UH FOR THE MOST PART- THAT'S GOOD UH YOU SHOULD EXPECT US TO TO START INTEGRATING UH CAPTURING SYNERGIES AND KIND OF UH DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF UH OF ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS UM I WOULD I WOULD SAY THERE THERE'S PROBABLY ONE ONE UH EXCEPTION UH AND YOU KNOW THE THE JAN-SAN PLATFORM UH YOU KNOW A BIG PART OF THE OF THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THAT BUSINESS INVOLVES UM A GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND EVENTUAL INTEGRATION AND YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO TELL AT THIS POINT WHETHER THERE WILL BE UH TRANSACTIONS KIND OF COMING ALONG UH IN THE COMING MONTHS AND QUARTERS BUT IF THEY WERE UM I THINK WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TAKING LOOKS UH BUT OTHER THAN THAT FOR THE MOST PART AND UNDERSTANDING THAT M&A IS HARD TO PREDICT UH GENERALLY SPEAKING THE THE OUR STANCE IS IS ONE OF AS YOU SAY KIND OF SITTING A LITTLE BIT MORE ON OUR HANDS UM AND DIGESTING THE THE THE NUMBER OF BITES THAT WE TOOK OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS YES AND ALVARO EH UH UM UH THINKING ABOUT THE FOURTH PLATFORM THAT WE ARE LOOKING I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE IT SO WE WE THE THE UH WE DON'T THINK TO OPEN A NEW VECTOR UH UH A DIFFERENT VECTOR FOR GROWTH WE THE ONES WE HAVE IS IS ALREADY WELL WELL ESTABLISHED THE PROXIMITY HEALTH UM UH AND AND UM UH AND NOW THIS JAN-SAN PLATFORM I THINK WE'RE ALREADY VERY MUCH FOC- WE WILL BE VERY MUCH FOCUSED IN INTO THE PLATFORM THAT WE ALREADY HAVE GREAT THAT'S VERY CLEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WE WILL TAKE OUR NEXT QUESTION FROM SERGIO MATSUMOTO OF CITI UH YES HI GOOD MORNING UH THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS UH I I HAVE UH UH TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS I WANTED TO GO BACK ON THE UH AGAIN PORTFOLIO AND THE THE ASSORTMENT QUESTION UH AT OXXO UH UH YOU SPOKE ABOUT HOW YOU CAN YOU KNOW CHANGE SOME OF THE ASSORTMENTS UH GIVEN THE THE THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN BUT UH COULD YOU UH EXPLAIN MORE ON THE ASSORTMENT CHANGES YOU CAN MAKE UH IN THE FACE OF THE THE THE REDUCED MOBILITY UH AND AND ESPECIALLY OVER THE LONG TERM IF THIS CHANGES THE THE CONSUMER HABITS UH LIKE IF IF UH THE MOBILITY STAYS LOW FOR A LONG TIME THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS IN BRAZIL LOGISTICS UH WHICH ARE THE BIGGEST INDUSTRIES THAT THAT UH THOSE BUSINESSES SERVE UH SERGIO UH I I THINK IN IN WE HAVE BETTER ABILITIES AND AND COMPETENCIES TO SUIT THE ASSORTMENT FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN UM LACK OF MOBILITY IS IT WILL BE UH UH DIFFERENT BECAUSE REALLY THEY'RE ALSO DESIGNED TO SERVE UH PEOPLE THAT ARE ON ON THE GO AND ARE ON THE STREET WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST UH THE DAILY AND REPLENISHMENT CATEGORY AND AND THAT IS THE UH GROCERIES WE COULD NOT REALLY BIND THE GROCERIES AND ALSO IT'S REALLY THE ONE THAT THE THE THE ONE THAT YOU ARE LEFT OUT IN YOUR PANTRY AND AND REALLY THAT'S REALLY THE OCCASION THAT WE HAVE HAVE BEEN SHARING I THINK IN THIS PANDEMIC WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO UH TO COMPEL UH AND THE CONSUMER THAT WE HAVE A UH UH A GOOD ASSORTMENT OF OF OF FOR FOR THAT UH PANTRY UH UH UM UH WELL TO FIND THE PRODUCT YOU ARE THAT THAT YOU ARE LEFT OUT IN IN YOUR IN IN YOUR PANTRY AND AND I THINK BY TESTING MORE AND FINDING MORE THEY ARE FINDING THAT WE HAVE BE- UH GOOD PRICES BUT I THINK THAT CATEGORY UM IT WILL UM IF LACK OF MOBILITY WILL BE IN PLACE WE'LL HAVE TO EXPAND THAT CATEGORY COMPARED WITH THE UH UM UH UH QUENCH OR OR OR SOME OTHER CATEGORIES THAT ARE MORE DESIGNED TO SERVE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE GO BUT I THINK THAT WOULD TAKE MORE UH THE MORE UH TIME AND AND EFFORT THAN PRODUCT TO THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN JUAN YES NO I I THINK UH UH UH I MEAN ON ON THAT FRONT UH IT IT IT WILL BE INTERESTING FOR ALL OF US TO TO SEE UM WHETHER YOU KNOW THE CONSUMER BEGINS TO PRIVILEGE PROXIMITY EVEN MORE RIGHT IN TERMS OF THESE UH TRADITIONALLY KIND OF SUPERMARKET-TYPE CATEGORIES AND WHETHER OUR ASSORTMENT AND OUR PRICING UH IS IS COMPELLING ENOUGH UH WHICH PROBABLY WE WILL WE WILL EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE UH FOR SOME OF THESE CUST- CONSUMERS TO DECIDE TO NOT JUST UH BUY THE YOU KNOW THE COOKING OIL OR THE RICE THAT THEY FORGOT OR THAT THEY RUN OUT OF UH DURING YOU KNOW BETWEEN TRIPS TO THE SUPERMARKET BUT THAT THEY WILL USE OXXO AS A MORE UH FREQUENT UH SOURCE OF THIS TYPE OF PRODUCTS AND THEN WE WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS AS AS WE GO ALONG UH I THINK ON AND I MENTIONED EARLIER THE YOU KNOW THE THE COMMENT ABOUT SPIRITS AS ANOTHER UH POTENTIAL UH CATEGORY WHERE WE UH HOPEFULLY UH WILL BECOME MORE KIND OF TOP OF MIND FOR THE CONSUMER IN TERMS OF HOW HOW GOOD AN ASSORTMENT AND AND HOW GOOD OUR PRICING IS UH FOR FOR THAT UH CATEGORY UM I THINK YOU ALSO TOUCHED ON ON THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION ON UH THE CATEGORIES FOR BRAZIL LOGISTICS UM I THINK GENERALLY AS WE HAVE BEEN MOVING UH TOWARDS THE LTL THE LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD BUSINESS UH AND THE SPECIALIZED WAREHOUSING UH CERTAINLY PHARMA UH IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS VERY WELL SUITED UM FOR THE FOR THE TYPE OF UH LOGISTICS THAT THAT THAT WE DO UH NOT JUST IN THE DISTRIBUTION PART BUT ALSO ON THE ON THE WAREHOUSING SIDE IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT AGV THE THE COMPANY THAT WE ACQUIRED A FEW MONTHS AGO UH THE YOU KNOW THEIR BIGGEST THEIR BIGGEST CATEGORY UH ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH WITH HEALTH UH CERTAINLY A BIG COMPONENT OF OF UH ANIMAL OR VETERINARY HEALTH BUT ALSO HUMAN HEALTH I THINK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE THE THE EQUATION OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SIZE OF THE PRODUCTS UH THE WEIGHT AND THE AND KIND OF THE VOLUME AND THE COST UM AND AND THE TYPE OF UH CONDITIONS THAT THEY REQUIRE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION AND THEIR STORAGE UH IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE INDUSTRY IT'S A PROFITABLE INDUSTRY AND IT'S A VERY GOOD FIT WITH WITH WHAT WE DO SO I WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD EXPECT US TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO GROW IN IN THAT FRONT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE OTHERS THERE ARE CPG PRODUCTS AND CATEGORIES AND COMPANIES ELECTRONICS COMPANIES BUT UH CERTAINLY THE HEALTH UH YOU KNOW FOR BOTH UH HUMAN AND AND VETERINARY UH STAND STAND OUT AS AS AS UH PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST IF NOT THE BIGGEST THANK YOU AND NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM CARLOS LABOY OF HSBC GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UM JOHN AND UH CONSTANT- HI CARLOS HI EDUARDO JOHN AND CONSTANTINO SPOKE OF A CONCENTRATE PRICE READJUSTMENT YESTERDAY UM UH UH AS THE CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER AND WITH REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHTS IN YOUR EQUITY AGREEMENT WITH COKE WHAT ROLE IS FEMSA PLAYING IN THIS NEGOTIATION AND WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE LONG-TERM CLARITY OF PROFIT SPLIT WITH THE BRAND OWNER WELL- ARE THEY ARE THEY ADEQUATE FOR YOU AT THIS POINT CARLOS THIS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED LIKE UH FOUR YEARS AGO AND YES WE WANT TO HAVE WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MORE STABLE AND CERTAIN LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP MODEL AND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR US AND AND AND AND IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR THE UH FEMSA'S CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR MANAGEMENT BECAUSE THE WAY WE WE COMPENSATE THE MANAGEMENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME CERTAINTY BECAUSE UH UH THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE LONG RUN AND ALSO FOR THE UH UH MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS UH THE ONLY UH THE COCA-COLA COMPANY IS IS UH UH UNDERSTAND THIS AND AND I THINK IT IT REALLY IS IS UM WE JUST HAVE TO BE VERY CREATIVE AND AND AND AND AND AND AND EMPATHETIC FROM BOTH SIDES IN THE STAND BUT WE ARE AT THE SAME SHIP THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE PROBABLY IN THE IN THE PAST WE WERE NOT AS EMPATHETIC OF TO UNDERSTAND THE INCOME STATEMENT OF THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND PROBABLY THEY WERE NOT AS EMPATHETIC TO UNDERSTAND OUR INCOME STATEMENT AND I THINK WITH THROUGH THESE UH CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH THEM WE ARE VERY MUCH ALIGNED AND THEN THEY HAVE A TOTAL UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE EXACTLY IN THE SAME BOAT AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE CURRENT CONSUMER UH UH UH BEHAVIOR WE HAVE TO BE VERY MUCH ALIGNED SO WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD AS MUCH ALIGNED AS POSSIBLE ALIGNMENT AS POSSIBLE AND CERTAINTY SO WE CAN INVEST AND AND DEVELOP AND TACKLE THE CONSUMER THE BEST WE CAN AND AS I SAID WE LOVE AND AND I THINK THE MAIN TWO OBJECTIONS HAVE TO BE FULLY ALIGNED FULLY ALIGNED AND THE UH UH BUILD CERTAINTY AND TRUST IN THE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE LONG RUN SO THE TENURE OF THE LAST AGREEMENT WAS A 10-YEAR AGREEMENT THIS ONE YOU JUST GOT A NEGOTIATION FOUR YEARS AGO THAT JUST JUST YOU JUST FINISHED MAKING YOUR LAST PAYMENTS ON IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE TENURE OF THIS AGREEMENT IS GOING FORWARD OR ARE WE JUST REALLY NEGOTIATING A LONG-TERM AGREEMENT NOW UH NO WE WE WE HAVE THIS ESTABLISHED AND AND AND UH BUT IT'S IT'S UM UM SOMETHING THAT THEY THEY HAVE THE TIME AND AND AND AND WE WE CANNOT DISCLOSE THIS TO YOU TO YOU UH WITHOUT THEM UH UH BEING FULLY AWARE BUT DON'T WORRY WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH IT AND AND AND UH AND IN FACT WE LOVE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF AGREEMENT EVERYWHERE ELSE WE HAVE GIVEN THE CERTAINTY FOR THE LONG RUN AND ALIGNMENT ALIGNMENT CERTAINTY AND TRUST THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU YEAH I THINK CAR- CARLOS IF I IF IF I COULD UM YOU KNOW A FEW WEEKS AGO IN IN IN ONE UH OF THE UH GROUP CALLS THAT THAT YOU YOU YOU'VE UH HELPED US UH SET UP WITH WITH INVESTORS YOU YOU ASKED ME THE QUESTION OF UH YOU KNOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A UH A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH COKE WHERE WHERE BOTH PARTNERS UH REALIZE UH UH UH A REASONABLE SPREAD OF ROIC VERSUS WACC AND AND MY ANSWER UH WAS WAS YES YES YES WE CAN RIGHT I MEAN YES IT IS POSSIBLE AND I THINK THE POINT I WOULD MAKE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THIS IS DEFINITELY UH NOT AT ODDS WITH WHAT UH YOU KNOW WHAT JOHN AND CONSTANTINO SAID YESTERDAY I MEAN UH THE ALIGNMENT THAT EDUARDO IS TALKING ABOUT THE EXPECTATION THAT THERE IS A FORMULA UH WHERE BOTH PARTNERS CAN MAKE THE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF RETURNS UH IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THANK YOU AND NOW WE'LL TAKE A QUESTION FROM RICARDO ALVES OF MORGAN STANLEY GOOD MORNING GENTLEMEN THANKS FOR THE CALL UM MOST OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED BUT UH IF I MAY JUST INSIST A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE JAN-SAN ASSET APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER NOW PERHAPS A BIT MORE OF A STRATEGIC QUESTION I MEAN HOW HOW DO YOU YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE UNLOCKING VALUE ON THIS ACQUISITION IN THE LONG RUN I MEAN JUAN JUST MENTIONED THE THE M&A POTENTIAL UH BUT YOU KNOW UH AS YOU MERGE THE TWO COMPANIES YOU COME UP WITH THE VENTURE SYNERGIES AND SO FORTH WHAT'S THE PLAN HERE IN TERMS OF HOW IT FITS TO THE OVERALL UM FEMSA PLATFORM OR PERHAPS IT'S JUST THAT THE GROWTH PROFILE OF THESE ASSETS JUST IMPROVED A LOT WITH THE DYNAMIC AND THEN YOU KNOW M&A WOULD REALLY BE THE KEY DRIVER FOR FOR FUTURE CASH GENERATION SO JUST A FEW THOUGHTS THERE WOULD BE HELPFUL UM AND AND THEN JUST A QUICK UPDATE ON THE JV IN BRAZIL UH AS WELL YEAH I I THINK WE HAVE A UH UH UH VERY GOOD PLATFORMS FOR THE MEDIUM AND LONG RUN I THINK THIS PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED SOME SOME SOME UH UH DAMAGES BUT I THINK IN THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERM WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC WE HAVE THE HEALTH DIVISION WHERE AND WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES THERE FOR GROWTH WE HAVE THE PROXIMITY DIVISION AND THEN WE HAVE UH UH WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC OF OF THE OF THE PERFORMANCE WE'RE MAKING IN IN SOUTH AMERICA AND THE JV WE MADE IN IN IN IN BRAZIL AND ALSO WITH OUR PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN IN IN IN IN IN IN THE UNITED STATES WE'RE VERY PI- OPTIMISTIC WE HAVE UH TWO GREAT PLATFORMS WE HAVE THE UH UH THE JETRO RESTAURANT DEPOT WITHOUT DOUBT UH JETRO HAS BEEN EATING SHARE PART OF THE COMPETITORS AND AT LEAST A MAJOR COMPETITIVE UH UM UH UH UH STRENGTH THAT THEY HAVE AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT AND ON THE OTHER HAND IN IN IN IN IN THE JA- JA- UH JAN-SAN BUSINESS WE ARE UM UM UH I THINK WE MADE UH UH THE RIGHT DECISION WITH THE COMPANIES WE'RE WITH IT WITH THE PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE AND THE PLATFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TOO FOR INTEGRATION UH UH AND AND GOING FORWARD FOR A NA- MORE NATIONAL UH UH UH UH FOOTPRINT UM AS AS I SAID WE DON'T PLAN TO OPEN UP A NEW VECTOR FOR GROWTH I THINK THE ONES ARE THERE AND WE JUST HAVE TO BE VERY KEEN AND AND PROBABLY THOSE NE- SHORT-TERM UH UH UH PANDEMIC DISTURBANCE UH UH COPE WITH IT ALIGN BETTER UH MAKE EFFICIENCIES AND AND PROBABLY MAKE SOME DECISIONS TO ADJUST OURSELVES TO THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT BUT WE HAVE GREAT PLATFORMS FOR GROWTH UH IN UH IN THE FUTURE JUAN YEAH NO I I THINK I WOULD UH JUST FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID A WHILE AGO UM YOU KNOW ON THE WHOLE JAN-SAN UH PLATFORM UH THERE'S CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS VERY HIGHLY FRAGMENTED UM WHERE YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A HUGE INCUMBENT UM AS A PLATFORM THAT WE ARE FORMING BY COMBINING UH WAXIE IN NORTH AMERICAN ALREADY BECOMES UH ONE OF THE LARGER PLAYERS UM WITH UH YOU KNOW THE THE THE WAXIE SINCE IT HAS UH UH KIND OF A BIAS TO THE WEST COAST OF THE US UH NORTH AMERICAN OUT OF CHICAGO HAS MORE OF A MIDWEST UH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO FLORIDA COVERAGE BUT YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE UH PLAYERS WITH ANYTHING RESEMBLING A BIG NATIONAL PRESENCE AND SO THE SYNERGY COMPONENT UM THE UH THE ASPIRATION TO INTEGRATE MORE OF THESE ASSETS UM AT THE RIGHT TIME AND IN THE RIGHT WAY IT'S A BIG PART OF I THINK THE THE ASPIRATION THAT THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT BUSINESS SCALE IS A BEAUTIFUL THING WE WE WE HAVE UH BEEN THE BENEFICIARIES OF OF OF SCALE IN IN MANY OF OUR UH BUSINESSES UM AND THIS IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE WE THINK THAT COULD WORK UH ITS ITS MAGIC IF DONE AT IN THE RIGHT WAY UM I THINK YOU ALSO UH MENTIONED AT THE END OF YOUR QUESTION SOMETHING ABOUT AN UPDATE ON THE ON THE JV IN BRAZIL UM YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE THE PANDEMIC UH THROWS A LITTLE BIT OF SAND INTO THE GEARS UH IN TERMS OF THE THE THE PACE OF OPENINGS UH DOWN THERE BUT QUITE FRANKLY UM WE ARE ALMOST UH ON TRACK UH IN TERMS OF UH OPENINGS FOR BOTH THE FIRST UH NEW STORES ON THE SELECT SIDE ON THE ON THE GAS STATIONS OF RAIZEN UH BUT ALSO ON THE ON THE STANDALONE OXXO SIDE SO WE WE DO ASPIRE TO START OPENING STORES UH OXXO STORES UH TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR UH IN IN BRAZIL WE'RE ALREADY UH MAKING PROGRESS IN TERMS OF UH SETTING UP OUR FIRST DISTRIBUTION CENTER DOWN THERE AS WELL UH SO THINGS ARE GOING UH VERY MUCH ACCORDING TO PLAN AND LIKE I SAID I THINK THE PANDEMIC HAS NOT UH FORCED THE TEAM DOWN IN IN IN BRAZIL TO DEPART VERY MUCH FROM THE ORIGINAL UH PLAN OBVIOUSLY THIS IS UH WE'VE SAID BEFORE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A PIECE OF CAKE UH YOU KNOW FIGURING OUT THE RIGHT VAL- VALUE PROPOSITION FOR FOR THE BRAZILIAN OXXO IS IS GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME UH BUT THE THE SIZE OF THE OPPORTUNITY AND AND CERTAINLY THE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE UH MAKE US VERY VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT UH THIS WILL EVENTUALLY BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PORTFOLIO AND I THINK THE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH WITH COSAN AND AND AND UH I THINK IF UH IF WE FOUND UH THAT THE PROXIMITY DIVISION REALLY UH ENTIRE COMMERCIAL FOUND THE RIGHT WAY TO GO INTO BRAZIL THEY ARE VERY HAPPY THEY ARE LEARNING A LOT IN FACT THEY ARE LEARNING UH THROUGH UH UM AND AND THEY ARE GOING TO DO ADOPT SOME OF THE SELECT OPERATIONS TO THIS NEW SCHEME AND I THINK THERE IS A UH A LOT OF UH WE SEE A LOT OF GROWTH UH AND AND POTENTIAL TO ADJUST THE VALUE PROPOSITION OF THE SELECT STORES AND THE OXXO STORES IN THE FIELD AND I THINK THAT WILL BE VERY UM UH UH UH BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME IT WILL TAKE TIME BUT I THINK WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC GOT IT THANK YOU SO MUCH NOW WE GO BACK TO A FOLLOW-UP FROM GUSTAVO OLIVEIRA OF UBS UH THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY FOLLOWUP QUESTION YOU KNOW IF I MAY UM YESTERDAY AT WALMEX UH CONFERENCE CALL THEY MAY SHOW UH UH SOME RISKS UH WITH RESPECT TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW LABELING UH REGULATION RULES THAT WILL START ALREADY IN OCTOBER UH COULD YOU PLEASE UH HELP US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT COULD BE THE IMPACT OF THOSE UH NEW LABELING RULES UH IN YOUR IN YOUR OXXO BUSINESS PERHAPS DURING THE TRANSITION TIME NOW UH AS AS AS IT'S IMPLEMENTED IN OCTOBER AND PERHAPS IN IN YOUR ABILITY OF OF OR ON YOUR SUPPLIERS' ABILITY TO PUSH FOR FOR SALES GROWTH WE WE THINK THAT THE UH SOMETIMES TOO MUCH INFORMATION FOR THE CONSUMER AND AND AND AND AND IT SEEMS LIKE UH WHAT I'VE BEEN LEARNING I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO INFORM THE CONSUMER SO THE CONSUMER CAN DO THE BETTER DECISION FOR THE UH THEIR THEIR UH I DON'T KNOW FOR THEIR HEALTH AND AND AND THEN NUTRITION AND EVERYTHING SOMETIMES IF THE IF THE IF THE UH LABELING GOES A BIT TOO FAR THE CONSUMER MIGHT BE BLOCKING SOME OF SOME OF UH SO SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO UH UH UH UH HE HE'S JUST UH OVERLOADED BY THIS UH UH UH LABELING WE DON'T KNOW REALLY WHERE WE WOULD STAND AND AND I THINK BUT BUT BUT CURRENTLY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH UH WITH THE WITH THE OUR SUPPLIERS AND I THINK WE'LL BE VERY IN IN A VERY GOOD POSITION TO ADAPT TO THIS NEW UH ENVIRONMENT WE DON'T SEE MAJOR DERAILS UH UH HA- HAPPENING UM I DON'T KNOW YOU WANT TO ADD TO UH TO THIS ONE I MEAN UH JUST JUST THE POINT THAT I THINK ON ON ON BEVERAGES CERTAINLY ON THE COKE FEMSA SIDE GENERALLY UM THE CONSUMER HAS BEEN WELL INFORMED FOR MANY YEARS NOW ABOUT UH YOU KNOW CALORIE COUNT AND THAT SORT OF THING AND THEN THE THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN EVOLVING FOR A WHILE INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF THE OF THE PORTFOLIO THAT HAS REDUCED UH OR NO CALORIES AT ALL UM AND SO I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES FROM THE FROM THE RELABELING INVOLVE MORE YOU KNOW THE COSTS AND THE KIND OF THE THE OPERATING UH CONUNDRUMS OF YOU KNOW CHANGING LABELS OR ADJUSTING YOUR PACKAGING THAT SORT OF THING BUT NOT SO MUCH IN TERMS OF THE INCREMENTAL INFORMATION THAT THE CONSUMER WILL RECEIVE THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER CATEGORIES WHERE UH MAYBE THE THE CONSUMER HAS NOT BEEN AS AS AS EXPOSED TO NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION UM AND I THINK FOR THOSE THERE THERE THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF ADAPTATION UH BUT TO EDUARDO'S POINT UH YOU KNOW I THINK ALSO IS IS IS IT'S VERY WELL POSITIONED AND THE THE THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE THE THE LEVEL OF UH DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION WITH SUPPLIERS UH LEADS I THINK TO TO WHAT SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY SMOOTH TRANSITION WHEN THIS EVENTUALLY BECOMES A UH UH A FACT UH DURING THIS TRANSITION UH JUAN AND EDUARDO UH DO YOU FORESEE UH UM THE RISK OF A UH A MORE AGGRESSIVE MARKDOWN JUST TO GET RID OF THE INVENTORY THAT IS WITH THE OLD LABELING AND BEFO- OR OR SUPPLIERS ARE GOING TO UH ASSUME THE COST UM YOU KNOW OF OF THAT OPERATION I THINK THAT COULD IMPACT YOUR YOUR 4Q RESULTS OR PERHAPS PART OF YOUR 3Q RESULTS NO BUT I I I THINK IF WE WE UH I NE- BUT I NEVER UH THE TURNOVER OF INVENTORY IN IN IN IN OXXO GOES VERY FAST AND IF THERE WILL BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES THERE WE WILL THEN WE'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE SOME MORE MONEY UH UH YES I I I THINK IT'LL BE YEAH PROBABLY UH UH AN ALTERNATIVE I DON'T KNOW IF JUAN NO I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT UH OUR INVENTORY LEVELS AND UH YOU KNOW TEND TO BE SMALL AND AND THERE THE TURNOVER IS JUST AS FAST AND I'M SURE WE WILL WORK WITH SUPPLIERS AND COME UP COME UP WITH PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY AS REQUIRED UM AND I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS THAT IS CAUSING US TO LOSE A LOT OF SLEEP AT THIS POINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU THANKS GUSTAVO THANK YOU AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT IS ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR QUESTIONS TODAY I WILL NOW TURN THE CONFERENCE BACK TO MR PADILLA FOR CLOSING ADDITIONAL REMARKS UH WELL THANK YOU EVERYONE

AND TODAY WE WERE ALSO JOINED BY OHANGA GARDA. WE HOPE THAT YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES ARE HEALTHY AND SAFE. THE SECOND QUARTER WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING PERIOD WE HAVE FACED OPERATIONALLY IN MANY YEARS. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE AMONG OUR BUSINESS UNITS BUT ALSO WE SAW A SEVERE IMPACT FROM THE LACK OF CONSUMER MOBILITY IN THE GEOGRAPHICS WE SERVE THAT TRANSLATED INTO SOFT PERFORMANCE Attributes and consumer occasions and the challenge was compounded by the lack of beer supply but only began to recover in the month of June our health division fared better as demand for its production products remained high but sales were constrained by strict restrictions imposed on consumers and their ability to move around particularly in our key south american markets the field division was impacted the most as deuces were imposed on consumers and their ability to move around particularly in our key south american markets the field division was impacted the most as deuces were imposed on consumers and their ability to move around particularly in our key south american markets the field division was impacted the most as deuces were imposed on consumers and their ability to move around particularly in our key south american markets the field division was impacted the most as deuces were imposed on consum The utilization fell quickly and drastically. However, from a deeper valley and a relative terms, it is the retaliation that seems to be rebounding faster. For its part, the coalition offensive was quite resilient, nevertheless, its execution capabilities to once again adapt to the needs and minimize the negative impact of the retaliation. Having said all that, our team continues to execute at a high level in very complex environments and we continue to focus on the safety and health of our people. AND WERE CUSTOMERS ABOVE ALL ELSE MOVING ON TO DISCUSS CENSUS SENSUS CONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY NUMBERS TOTAL REVENUE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER DECREASED TEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT WHILE INCOME FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT ON ORGANIC BASIS TOTAL REVENUE DECREASED FOURTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT AND INCOME FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED BY FORTY POINT FOUR PERCENT FOR THIS QUARTER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REPORTED AND OR We have drug stores in Ecuador, a full quarter of the AGV operation in Brazil, and forty-five days of the Waxie and North American Jan-Chan distribution platforms acquired in the United States. Net income decreased significantly, driven by number one, lower income from operations, as I just described. Number two, higher other non-operating expenses, including ancillary charges related to the extraordinary payment of almost all. Eight point eight billion pesos agreed with the mexican tax authority as well as impairments including certain assets of coca cola femsa and the closure of our specialties operations and number three tensa participation in hennessy results which were lower relative to the comparable figure we reported last year in terms of our consolidated net debt position during the first quarter it increased by approximately ten billion pesos compared to the previous year. THIS QUARTER TO REACH A LEVEL OF SEVENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS AT THE END OF JUNE THIS REFLECTS OUR INVESTMENT APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN PLATFORMS AS WELL AS THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGE PACKAGED PAYMENTS MENTIONED BEFORE WHILE WE ARE ON THE ADULT SIDE OF BETS WE SHOULD MENTION THAT DURING THIS QUARTER WE PLACE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SECOND REOPENING OF OUR NON MEDIATE To two point five billion dollars, which was our original target. The weighted average yield for a total insurance was three point five percent, which was also our target back in September when we started with this project. And I highlight this because it took us nine months and we went to the market on three separate occasions in order to get the amount we wanted at the cost we wanted. We were very patient and it paid off. This is the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the approach and the AND THIS IS THE APPROACH AND THE DEEP DIVE WE WILL TRY TO BRING TO OUR FINANCIAL DECISIONS MOVING ON TO DISCUSS OUR OPERATIONS AND BEGINNING WITH TENNESSEE'S COMMERCIAL PROXIMITY DIVISION WE SHOULD START WITH A COMMENT ABOUT STORE OPENINGS WHILE WE MANAGE TO OPEN A NUMBER OF NEW STORES DURING THE QUARTER WE ALSO HAVE TO CLOSE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR STORE BASE DUE TO COVID NINETEEN RESTRICTIONS AND IMPACTS SOME OF THE CLOSURES WILL BE TEMPOR AND AS WE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE CERTAIN MARGINAL STORES FROM OUR BASE THE NUMBERS FOR THE QUARTER WENT LIKE THIS HUNDRED FIFTY NINE NEW OPENINGS EIGHTY FIVE REOPENINGS AFTER REMODELING AND MAINTENANCE TWENTY FOUR DEFINITE CLOSURES AND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TEMPORARY CLOSURES AS A RESULT WE RECORDED A NET REDUCTION OF FORTY STORES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER TO REACH NINE HUNDRED FIFTY NET STORE OPENINGS FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS IN ADDITION TO We reduced the number of operating shifts from three to two in a large percentage of our stores. As 24 seven operations are not viable or necessary given current consumer dynamics. Also, same store sales were down twelve point four percent for the second quarter, reflecting a twenty four point four percent decline in store traffic and an increase of fifteen point four percent in average customer ticket. HERE IT IS ALSO USEFUL TO PAUSE AND DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT QUARTER BECAUSE WE DID SEE MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES AS THE QUARTER WENT BY. DURING APRIL, AS YOU MAY RECALL, WE STILL HAD RELATIVE AVAILABILITY OF BEER THROUGH THE MOST OF THE MONTH AS WELL AS SOME PLANNED BUYING FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS. AND THIS MITIGATED THE BLOW AND MADE APRIL THE NICEST BAD MONTH OF THE QUARTER FOR US DURING MAY We basically depleted our beer inventories and we saw the steepest contractions in traffic making the worst month of the quarter. Finally in June we began to recover available availability and we also began to observe a gradual shift in consumer dynamics. During the first part of the quarter most of the consumer demand weakness came from mobility restrictions and lockdowns with the absence of customers going about on the street. AND THE GATHERING OCCASION REELED FROM SOCIAL DISTANCING HOWEVER LATER IN THE QUARTER THE WEAKNESS IN DEMAND AND DEMAND SEEMED TO BE DRIVEN INCREASINGLY BY ECONOMIC HARSHNESS AS SO MANY CONSUMERS HAVE LOST THEIR INCOME MAKING THE CRISIS TODAY A BIT MORE SIMILAR TO PRIOR DOWNTURNS OR ALSO MORE PRONOUNCED ADDING TO THE HEADWINDS AS MUCH AS HALF OF OUR STORES IN MEXICO WERE UNDER SOME TYPE OF COOPERATING RESTRICTION FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES The quarter often relates to the sale of alcohol in certain time windows, which respect most of the restrictions to be temporary. Moving down the income statement for the second quarter, gross margin contracted by ten basis points, reflecting a negative sales mix effect caused by the beer shortage in May and an improved performance of our dairy and refreshment categories partially offset by a high single-digit increase of our other categories. For our services category, income operations decreased almost sixty six percent and operating margin contracted to three hundred twenty basis points, reflecting significant operating losses. Moving on to our commercial health division, we reduced our store count by seven drug stores, and the amount of temporary closures was enough to set the stage for the number of stores we opened during the quarter. Having said that, we have a total of three hundred three thousand. ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE OPEN UNITS ACROSS OUR TERRITORIES AT THE END OF JUNE AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT TOTAL NET NEW STORES FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS REVENUE INCREASED TWO PERCENT WHILE ON AN ORGANIC BASIS THEY DECREASED NINE POINT ONE PERCENT THINKS TO OURSELVES DECREASED AN AVERAGE OF NINE POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN MEXICAN PESOS REFLECTING THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE STRICT MOBILITY RESTRICTIONS IMPLEMENTED IN OUR SOUTH AM Refuse partially offset by a solid performance in operations in mexico gross margin expanded by eight basis points in the quarter reflecting number one a positive sales mix effect driven by consumer behavior shifts in connection to the pandemic number two more effective collaboration with key supply partners in our operations in south america and number three better margin performance of our business in ecuador where we're applying circular forestry operational practices Best practices is very important. Operating margin contracted one hundred and thirty basis points, reflecting lower operating leverage in South America. As we anticipated, last quarter, commercial field division was the most exposed to the current environment of lockdowns and reviews mobility teams. And the impact is visible in our quarterly results while we were able to add one new net, one new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, new net, The same station sales decrease an average of almost fifty percent in the second quarter. Gross margin reached thirteen point three percent, but operating margin was one point eight percent of total revenues. Reflecting considerable operating leverage, operating expenses decreased fifty percent as a result of tight expense control and increased efficiency. As a result, this business is the one that seems to be the most profitable. It is recovering more quickly in relative terms, showing the sequential improvement in recent weeks, but rising from a very deep contraction. Finally, moving on briefly to Coca-Cola FEMSA, as John highlighted yesterday, the results show a sequential improvement in Mexico, improvement in Brazil and Colombia, and continued strength in Guatemala. The development of digital and omnichannel initiatives in team markets and the ability to deliver solid profitability in Mexico and Central America, even in the context of the current pandemic. For more detail, you can listen to the webcast of the acquirer conference call. Looking ahead, uncertainty remains high and it is hard to make predictions. However, as I mentioned before, it seems the crisis has accelerated the trend towards digital and omnichannel initiatives in team markets. Evolving. In the beginning, its main drivers were severe health concerns and the lack of concern for mobility. These remain a problem. However, we are increasingly seeing the signs of another set of more traditional economic headwinds coming to play. This is not possible. But at least we have more experience with economic downturns. As you might imagine, we continue to look for at our entire business in an effort to optimize it for the changes taking place today. FOR THOSE THAT SEEM TO BE ON THE WAY AND UNDERSTAND FOR THOSE THAT SEEM TO BE ON THE WAY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO GO OUR COMPANY TO MEET THE MOMENT AND TO COME OUT IN BETTER SHAPE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND WITH THAT WE CAN OPEN THE CALL FOR QUESTIONS OPERATOR THANK YOU THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION WILL BEGIN AT THIS TIME IF YOU'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION DURING THIS TIME PLEASE S I M P L I Y P R E S S DH AH0 S T AA1 R sil DH EH1 N N AH1 M B ER0 W AH1 N AO1 N Y UH1 R T EH1 L AH0 F OW2 N K IY1 P AE1 T sil IH1 F Y UW1 W UH1 D L AY1 K T UW1 W IH0 TH D R AO1 Y UH1 R K W EH1 S CH AH0 N P R EH1 S DH AH0 P AW1 N D sil S T AA1 R sil T UW1 sil Y UW1 sil Y UH1 R K W EH1 S CH AH0 N W AH0 L B IY0 T EY1 K HELLO GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME HOPE YOU'RE ALL SAFE AND SOUND EDUARDO JUAN AND ERNESTO WELCOME WELCOME ABOARD SO MY ONE QUESTION WOULD BE ON THE MORE RECENT PERFORMANCE IN OAXACA AND YOU'VE ELABORATED HOW IT WENT THROUGH THE QUARTER BUT IF YOU COULD SHED A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE OVER THE MOST RECENT WEEKS INTO JULY WHERE WE'RE SEEING MORE STATES GOING IN BUT THE ORANGE FACE, SOME OF THE REOPENINGS AND IF YOU COULD ALSO SHARE WITH US ON THE TEMPORARY STORE CLOSURES HOW MANY YOU YOU CURRENTLY STILL HAVE CLOSED AND HOW DO YOU THINK THE REOPENING IS GOING TO EVOLVE CONSIDERING SOME OF THE TOURISM RESTRICTIONS AS WELL AS OFFICE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE STILL IN PLACE THAT WILL BE MY QUESTION THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I said in the quarter, fifty percent have restrictions. Now, I would say thirty-five percent have restrictions. The sensor cells have improved a little bit. Mobility is coming, still, but there's still a lot of work to be done. If we, you know, we just pay attention to yesterday's Google mobility index, and the Google mobility index in Mexico is down around forty percent. AND THAT REALLY LIVES BY THAT PEOPLE ARE ON THE GO AND MOVING AND AND THIS IS REALLY BEING THE MAJOR COST WE THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND AND ADAPT TO THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT MOBILITY IS COMING UP LITTLE BY LITTLE AND AND NOT ONLY CAR MOBILITY BUT PEDESTRIAN MOBILITY TOO AND I THINK IT ALL DEPENDS THAT HOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH SCHOOL SYSTEM THE NEXT QUARTER WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN WITH OFFICES OPENING OR KEEPING IT CLOSED SO I THINK WHAT WORKS TO ME IS THE WAY THAT WE ARE UNDERSTANDING THE PANDEMIC BETTER YOU KNOW I COULD SAY THAT THE LACK OF CONTAGIOUS AH UM AH UM PANDEMIC IN THE STORES IS VERY LOW VERY VERY LOW BASICALLY THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH THE PANDEMIC IS VERY VERY LOW BASICALLY THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH THE PANDEMIC IS PERSONNEL IS MORE BECAUSE THE LOCKDOWNS ARE LEAVING THEIR HOUSES AND THE LACK OF CARE THEY HAVE WITH CONNECTION WITH SOME FAMILY MEMBERS AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THE PANDEMIC GOES THROUGH THE HOUSE NONE IS NOT REALLY FROM FROM THE TRAFFIC TO THE WORK OF THE STORE SO WE ARE OPTIMISTIC BUT THE THING IS THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE FEELING NOW THE PAIN THAT THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IS BECOMING It is staying here and and and we will we will we are adopting the offering too but we are cautiously optimistic yes that's what we have to be well thank you very much our next question will come from Bob Ford of Bank of America For taking my question, it was on your opening address, you mentioned the twenty four closed systems, and you announced that you're currently working on a wider assessment of the store base. And in how do you think about the footprint right now in terms of maybe re-allocating those resources to other locations or or maybe just trimming it in anticipation of these more traditional headwinds in terms of the slowdown in the economy well, as i said, the a lot of the lockdowns that we have, and well, as i said, the a lot of the lockdowns that we have, and well, as i said, the a lot of the lockdowns that we have, and well, as i said, the a lot of the lockdowns that we have, and well, as i said, the a lot of the lockdowns that we have, and well Had restrictions of alcoholic purveyors or lockdowns or the possibility of opening stores in certain commercial areas and and that was the number that we had around fifty percent have these kind of restrictions for example in the state of california there are around seven thousand stores that have had some kind of restrictions for instance in the state of california there are around nineteen thousand stores that have had some kind of restrictions for instance in the state of california there are around nineteen thousand stores that have had some kind of restrictions for instance in the state of california there are around nineteen thousand stores that have had some kind of restrictions for instance in the state of california there are around nineteen thousand stores that have had some kind of restrictions for instance in the state of california there are around nineteen thousand stores that have had some kind of restrictions for instance in the WE CAN'T WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SELL WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CLOSE NOT ONLY NOT SELL ALCOHOL BUT TO CLOSE THE COMPLETELY THE STORE AND AGAIN I THINK LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING THE BEST THE BEST TO ADOPT AND AND AND HAVE CONTAMINATION MEASURES AGAINST THIS PANDEMIC SOME ARE EFFECTIVE AND SOME ARE NOT I WOULD SAY AND BUT THE THING IS WE TRY TO To lobby and understand what the authorities are trying to do and help them to accomplish the objectives, not necessarily by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by AND WE HAVE HAD SOME BESIDES THE LOCK DOWN RESTRICTIONS THAT WE HAVE SOME AUTHORITIES OR SELLING OF ALCOHOL AND SOME OF SOME STORES ALSO WE HAVE REALLY ENCLOSING SOME OF THE NIGHT SHIFTS BECAUSE THERE IS NO NO CONSUMERS AROUND SO BUT AGAIN WE THINK THAT WOULD BE TEMPORARY AND WE ARE ADAPTING THE BEST WE CAN And again, as a reminder, that is Star One to ask a question. And if you find that your question has been answered, you can remove yourself from the queue by pressing Star Two. We will now go to Miguel Torres of Gp.m. Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for your question. Considering the timing of this crisis that came right after you bought or invested in a couple of companies, which of them would you say that has had the most significant impact? You start now on the central direction you know we are very happy with the with our partners and with the companies we acquired they are on the janssen business and as you imagine janssen has a great demand for the products out of the two wuxi is more focused to janssen and north american have a more diverse platform and in fact north american have added to janssen and wuxi is more focused to janssen and north american have a more diverse platform and in fact north american have added to janssen and wuxi is more focused to janssen and north american have a more diverse platform and in fact north american have added to janssen and wuxi is more focused to janssen and north american have a more diverse platform and in fact north american have added to janssen and wuxi is more focused to j SELF TO SOME HOSPITALITY CUSTOMERS AND I THINK PROBABLY THAT IS THE ONE THAT HAS SUFFERED THE MOST BUT I THINK BOTH COMPANIES HAVE ADOPTED TREMENDOUSLY TO THIS ENVIRONMENT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TO PROTECT THEIR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND AND AND AND BUT AT THE VERY SAME TIME TRY TO SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS SO WE'RE EXTRAORDINARILY HAPPY WITH THEM WE HAVE GREAT PARTNERS AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO BUILD Mastech Digital Platform with the help of them and we look forward to a very optimistic future. I think I would add, Amit, this is Juan. Even on the, on the Jetty Restaurant Depot which is also one of the recent investments which being as exposed as they are to the restaurant sector one would think or at least one would have thought a few months ago that it would be a complicated period for them. And they're not saying it hasn't been, but they're not saying it hasn't been. It has been complicated, but certainly they have been adjusting and navigating the situation quite frankly, exceeding at least my personal expectations, which kind of confirms our view that this is a very well-positioned and very well-run company. So they have been doing, as I said, better than expected, adjusting, and I think they are customers as well. The little restaurants adapting to, you know, curbside delivery. AND THINGS BEGIN TO OPEN UP IN MANY OF THE MARKETS THAT THEY SERVE. SO OVERALL I WOULD SAY ON THE RESTAURANT DEPOT FRONT YOU KNOW A POSITIVE SURPRISE GREAT THANK YOU BARRY MERCEDES FLEETWOOD CHECK YOUR MUTE FUNCTION WE'RE UNABLE TO HEAR YOU HI ARE YOU LISTENING MINO? YES PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION OH MY GOD HI HAOAN HI EDWARD HOPE YOU ARE WELL JUST TWO QUICK QUESTIONS HERE FROM MY SIDE THE FIRST ONE IS ABOUT DNA I SAW THAT BASICALLY YOUR DNA HAS INCREASED ACROSS THE BUSINESS DIVISIONS SO JUST TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S DRIVING SUCH AN INCREASE If you can give you so your impressions about the mexican pension reform in terms of potential impacts for for fensa thank you very much well i will go to the second one and i think let one answer the first one the pension reform i think is this whole work there and i think it's a good thing that we all together try to solve it because it would be very difficult for the government to do so AND AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE TO SOLVE IT IN A DESPERATE WAY AND AND THAT THAT COULD ABSORB THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN MEXICO. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE FOR THE FUTURE IS IT'S IT'S KIND OF PAINFUL BUT I THINK IT'S WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I THINK BETWEEN THE AH AH THE PRIVATE COMPANIES AND THE GOVERNMENT I THINK IT'S A GOOD FRIEND THAT WE ARE TOGETHER HERE TO TO FIX THE HOLE FOR THE LONG RUN AND THE OTHER ONE ONE WHAT DID YOU GO AND TR TO ANSWER THE VERY FIRST QUESTION PLEASE YES HI MARCELLA SO WE ARE HAVING SOME AMORTIZATION OF I T INVESTMENTS I THINK ON THE OXFORD FRONT THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO TO INVEST IN THEIR NEW VERSIONS OF SOME OF THE SOFTWARE AS WELL AS DEVELOPING THE DIGITAL PLATFORMS ACROSS THE BOARD WE HAVE HAD SOME CLOSURES OF STORES AND WE HAVE HAD SOME ASSET RIGHT DOWNS BOTH AT COD PHENCE AND AT AMAZON The given transcript is in a foreign language and it is difficult to understand the context and meaning of the conversation. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this question. However, if you could provide more information about the context and purpose of the conversation, I would be happy to help you with the transcription. It's on Oxo gross margins. You mentioned that your numbers are actually very good. There was a very little contraction there. You mentioned that the beer shortage obviously affects profitability. But that was offset by the service category. On the recovery, do you think that you could actually see an expansion in your gross margins? I don't know if the service category we remain strong and the beer clearly could recover. COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE A BIT ON THE TREND FOR THE GROSS GROSS MARGIN FOR OXOXO WELL LET ME GIVE YOU A BRIEF OUR SUPPLIERS AND US ARE CONCERNED WITH THE LACK OF CONSUMER ECONOMIC STIMULUS BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO COME UP WITH DIFFERENT OFFERINGS TO REALLY JUST TO MAKE THEM DEMAND BUT HERE WE ARE WE HAVE OUR OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR PARTNERS AND I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING GREAT FOR THEM FOR THE CONSUMER IN CURRENT TIMES BUT I DON'T KNOW ONE WHAT DO YOU GO AND GO FOR THE DETAILS OF THE NUMBERS PLEASE SURE I THINK ON THE GROSS MARGIN I MEAN HISTORICALLY OR AT LEAST FOR A LONG TIME NOW THE TWO MAIN DRIVERS OF GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION HAVE BEEN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES CATEGORY AND YOU KNOW THE COMMERCIAL INCOME THAT WE RECEIVE FROM OUR FROM OUR SUPPLIER PARTNERS RIGHT NOW AS WELLARD HAS SAID YOU KNOW AND I THINK A POSITIVE SURPRISE HAS BEEN THE RESILIENCE AND EVEN THE YOU KNOW FASTER GROWTH OF FINANCIAL SERVICES DURING THE DOWNTURN AS CONSUMERS HAVE KIND OF MADE SURE THAT THEY'RE KEEPING CURRENT WITH THEIR WITH THEIR MEMBERSHIPS AND THEIR UTILITIES AND YOU KNOW REALIZING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S A LOT EASIER TO GO TO WELLS FARGO THAN TO GO TO THE BAN TIME CONSUMING AND SO EVEN THOUGH FINANCIAL SERVICES HAD BEEN CONTRACTING OR AT LEAST IT HAD BEEN GROWING LESS IN RECENT QUARTERS IN THE LAST TWO THREE QUARTERS THIS QUARTER IT ACTUALLY THE GROWTH CAME IN IN THE HIGH SINGLE DIGITS WHICH WAS A POSITIVE SURPRISE AND I THINK CONTRIBUTES TO THE TO THE TO THE HIGH GROWTH MARGIN THE OTHER QUESTION ON COMMERCIAL INCOME IS A LITTLE BIT TRICKIER BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE AGREEMENTS AS A AND SO IT'S HARD TO PREDICT. I MEAN WE DO NEED VOLUMES TO COME UP TRANSACTIONS TO GO UP FOR COMMERCIAL INCOME TO GO UP YOU KNOW IN CONSEQUENCE SO I WOULD SAY VISIBILITY FOR GROSS MARGIN IS IS NOT AS CLEAR AS WE WOULD LIKE I WOULDN'T NECESARILY PREDICT AT THIS POINT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TO EXPAND IT YOU KNOW MORE THAN MORE THAN TREND BUT AT LEAST DURING THE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER IT DID KIND OF HOLD ITS OWN Sorry about that. I think it's very clear. Thank you. I will also add that probably the were a small increase also in in and and the lack of beer also shifted demand to some other alcoholic beverages and that those have a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a One interesting point to note is that consumers did shift to higher consumption of spirits during the quarter. And interestingly, I think what the Oxxo, our Oxxo colleagues were observing in recent weeks was that even as the beer came back that the volume for spirits was still holding up strong. So maybe you know, in the effort to look for the silver lining. The lining or the glass half-full you know consumers realize what the assortment and the pricing is for for spirits at the oxo stores that this becomes a category that that is you know that is stronger than than historically because historically we haven't sold as much spirits as we are selling right now so hopefully this remains after the after the pandemic is is gone We'll move on to our next question, and that'll be from Alan O'Leary of Sentinel. Thank you very much, good morning, everyone. Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much. It looks like we may have lost Alan. We'll go next to Ulysses Argueta. Thanks for the space for questions. So here, I wanted to get your thoughts a little bit on any potential product portfolio rationalization there in Nokia and maybe if you can share any color on what you're seeing in terms of of the ship in in mix more recently now in July, maybe going back a little bit more to the to the more profitable categories that you guys have there. Thank you.\n\nYou know, unless we think that this lack of availability will stay for a very long period of time.

But again, you know, when you go dry and this has never happened before on the beer side, obviously, you have both of our suppliers on the beer front working hard to restock the goods. THE SHELVES CONSUMERS THEMSELVES ARE ARE PROBABLY BUYING A LITTLE BIT MORE BEER THAN THEY NORMALLY DO TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GO DRY AGAIN AND SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE SEEING POSITIVE TRENDS ON SOME OF THESE IMPORTANT CATEGORIES ESPECIALLY BEER SO I WOULD EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE AND YOU KNOW WE WILL OBVIOUSLY MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS WE NEED IN TERMS OF PACKAGING AND MIX FOR SOME IMPORTANT CATEGORIES I THINK WE NEED TO TO BE CAREFUL AND WORK HARD AT UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU KNOW HOW QUICKLY AND WHAT THE NEW NORMAL EVENTUALLY ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE IN THE SENSE THAT WE WILL I'M SURE ADAPT OUR VALUE PROPOSITION TO THAT WHETHER IT MEANS YOU KNOW SOME INCREMENTAL S K Y U S OR A SHIFT IN THE MIX AND THAT SORT OF THINGS SO SO WE'RE STILL NOT AT THE END OF THIS BUT WE KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THE CONSUMER Adjusting habits than we did a couple of months ago and we are acting in consequence. And we on the sell side, most of us have a buy rating on the stock. I mean, it's because of there, of the look-through valuation of oxco implied here. Now, the result of this quarter, i guess the question is, does this result put to question the business model of oxco in the long run? This is the first quarter ever that you've closed losses. So, i get the specific question is, what, in your opinion, is the business model of oxco in the long run? Is this the first quarter ever that you've closed losses. So, i get the specific question is, what, in your opinion, is the business model of oxco in the long run? Is this the first quarter ever that you've closed losses. So, i get the specific question is, what, in your opinion, is the business model of EXPECTATIONS REGARDING STORE OPENINGS GOING FORWARD AND SECOND THING, AND THIS IS THE QUESTION WE GET A LOT, AND I'M SURE JOHN ALSO GETS A LOT, IT'S WHY THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO STAY AWAY FROM E-COMMERCE AN INVESTOR JOE BIDDLE GUIDE SAYING EVERY TIME YOU GUYS MENTION THE COMPETITORS WITH AMAZON OR SO FORTH, THE STOCK ACTS POSITIVELY, WHY NOT INVEST IN A BAGGAGE OR IN A SECOND STORE IN AS MANY OFFICES AS POSSIBLE TO AND LEVERAGE THAT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE CHANGES THAT THE PANDEMIC WILL CAUSE AND THE THIRD LAST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH CAPITAL DEPLOYMENTS. I MEAN I THINK THAT THE PUSH BACK HAS BEEN DISABILITY IN TERMS OF CAPITAL DEPLOYMENTS. AND ROBERT YOU MENTIONED ABOUT PATIENCE AND DISCIPLINE. I THINK THAT IT IS VERY CLEAR FOR INVESTORS THAT YOU ARE VERY PATIENT BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPAND ON IN TERMS OF GIVING COMFORT TO INVESTORS THAT YOU WILL REMAIN DIS CHUNKY CASH GENERATION THAT YOU THAT YOU GENERATE THOSE WILL BE MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH WELL LET ME TELL YOU WE WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC OF OXFORD IN THE INDUSTRY LONG LONG AH THINK WE HAVE HAD A STRONG PLATFORM AND AND IT IS JUST THAT THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT CONSUMER ADJUSTMENT IN THE LACK OF MOBILITY THAT THAT WILL HELP US TO BE ON TRACK AGAIN IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT E-COMMERCE WE ARE WE ARE VERY MUCH AH WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT WE ARE NOT PREPARED YET TO DISCLOSE BUT I THINK WE ARE IN THE FINANCIAL IN FINANCIAL SECTOR WE SEE THE EVOLUTION THERE AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED AND ALSO THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS RELATED AND CONNECTED WITH THE DIGITAL PLATFORM WE WE WE THE CURRENT THE CURRENT THE IF YOU WANNA SEE THOSE ARE THE WAYS AS THE DIGITAL PLATFORM WE W The links that we're making with the current platforms like amazon and everything are very optimistic with those too. What we don't know yet is the the home delivery home delivery still we don't see how the it in fact the ones that are doing home delivery in small purchases not groceries but small purchases are the ones that will deliver. Nobody makes money nobody makes money and small purchases are the ones that will deliver. AND AND THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO TO CATCH UP AND FIND A BETTER WAY SO IF WE WERE IN THE GROCERY BUSINESS WITHOUT DOUBT THAT WE WOULD BE DELIVERING A LOT OF THINGS FOR THE FOR THE FOR HOMES BECAUSE ECONOMICALLY IT DOES MAKE SENSE AND THE OTHER THE OTHER ONES WE HAVEN'T SEEN YET THOUGH WE HAVE SOME TESTS TO DELIVER IN A VERY EFFICIENT WAY WITH SOME BACKSTORES AND EVERYTHING BUT I THINK THERE STILL SOME LEARNINGS AND AFFECIENCIES WE NEED TO COME IN PLACE TO PERFORM BETTER I DON'T KNOW WE WANT TO ADD TO THE QUESTION WELL THANK YOU RAYMOND YES I DO I THINK AYLAN'S FIRST ATTEMPT THAT THE QUESTION DIDN'T WORK BUT THE SECOND ATTEMPT HE MADE SURE THAT HE COVERED A RANGE OF BIG TOPICS SO I WILL I WILL TRY TO ADD TO SOME OF THESE SO ON THE STOREFRONT AYLAN YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WE HAD FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE BEEN BUILDING OPENING MORE STORES EVERY YEAR THAN THE PREVIOUS YOU KNOW WE GOT AS HIGH AS THIRTY FIFTY I THINK AT THE TOP AND WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LAYER OF STORES THAT ARE PROBABLY MARGINAL IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THE NUMBERS AND WE'RE WE'RE YOU KNOW FIGURING OUT WHICH OF THOSE STORES ACTUALLY SHOULD NOT BE OPENED KIND OF KR NUMBER OF STORES THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE OPEN AND JUST GENERALLY I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE BUDGET FOR STORES THIS YEAR BEFORE YOU KNOW THE PANDEMIC KIND OF REARED ITS UGLY HEAD WE WERE THINKING ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED STORES FOR MEXICO SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS A LEVEL THAT IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN THE TOP THAT WE REACHED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BUT YOU KNOW WE WERE ALREADY KIND OF MOVING INTO A PHASE WHERE YOU ARE YOU A PROFITABILITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF THE NEW STORES AND AT THE SAME TIME THE BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR HAD US WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY STORES OUTSIDE OF MEXICO. SO I THINK WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THAT PROCESS WHERE INTERNATIONAL WILL BEGIN TO ADD YOU KNOW MORE MEANINGFUL NUMBERS TO THE NUMBER OF STORES AND OBVIOUSLY WAITS YOU GET SOME SCALE IN COLOMBIA, CHILE, EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY BRAZIL THAT THIS BECOMES NOT JUST A MEXICO STORE BUT MORE OF AT THAT STAGE AND I THINK THIS YEAR WITH THE PANDEMIC WITH THE DYNAMICS WE DECIDED TO TO START CLOSING A FEW OF THOSE KINDS OF MARGINAL STORES I'M ALSO OPTIMISTIC ON THE STOREFRONT THAT FOR CENTRAL AND WESTERN MEXICO NOW THAT WE HAVE THE YOU KNOW BOTH PORTFOLIOS OF BIERS THAT THERE WILL BE A LARGE NUMBER OF LOCATIONS IN PLACES LIKE GUADALAJARA LEON GUERRERO EVEN THE VALLEY OF MEXICO WHERE THE FACT THAT YOU NOW HAV The ABI portfolio kind of takes a lot of those locations that were just short of being viable makes them viable and again, kind of, you know, insures that we can continue to continue to open large numbers of stores in that part of the country. I think on the e-commerce front, I've a lot of the touches on it in terms of also obviously realizing the potential and the power of the oxo platform to bankruptcy people or to get people to adopt. NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR NEW PRODUCTS. AND I THINK WE WE WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE SALVADOR EXPERIENCE THAT GIVES US A LOT OF COMFORT IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO GET PEOPLE TO SIGN UP AND ADOPT A NEW NEW NEW MEANS OF PAYMENT OR NEW MEANS OF OF OF SAVING BUT ONE THING WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS TO OVERPROMISE AND UNDERDELIVER. SO WE ARE WORKING HARD AT THE THREE LEGGED STOOL OF OUR DIGITAL PLATFORM AT AXOS WHICH INVOLVES LAST MILE DELIVER AND I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY THE LOYALTY PROGRAM AND THE Y WALLET AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW THE MARKET TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR AND THEN FINALLY ON CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU'VE SEEN US FOR OVER THE YEARS FEMSA BASICALLY HAS A COUPLE OF WAYS THAT THAT WE GROW WE EITHER TAKE WHAT WE DO WELL TO A NEW JURISDICTION OR WE TAKE WHAT WE DO WELL AND WE EXPAND IT BY A COUPLE OF DEGREES AND EXAMPLES WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HUGO'S DEL VALLE OR SANTA CLARA OR THE DRUGSTORE BUSINESS WHERE YOU TOOK A KIND OF OXYCODONE AND EXPANDED WHAT IT DOES BY A FEW DEGREES AND YOU DECIDED TO GO INTO DRUGSTORES. SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THE MARKET TO YOUR POINT IN TERMS OF HOW YOU FRAME THE QUESTION IS STILL KIND OF GETTING ITS HANDS AROUND YOU KNOW WHY IT IS THAT WE MADE A COUPLE OF INVESTMENTS IN THE US OR WE USUALLY DO WHICH IS FIGURING OUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO WELL AND THEN TAKING IT TO ANOTHER ANOTHER COUNTRY OBVIOUSLY WITH THE BENEFIT OF VERY STRONG PARTNERS AS WE HAVE IN THE US SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU YOU WE ARE ADDING A LITTLE BIT OF COMPLEXITY TO THE TO THE ORG CHART WE WILL TRY TO ADDRESS THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN BY INCREASING THE DISCLOSURE AND WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO START OPENING UP THE NUMBERS FOR THE LOGISTICS AS WELL AS FOR THE JANSSEN BUSINESS FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR SO YOU KNOW CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT THESE INVESTMENTS AND AND ADDRESSING THE COMPLEXITY THAT IT BRINGS TO THE EQUATION ARE VERY MUCH TOP OF MIND FOR FOR THE TEAM AND AND HOPEFULLY WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING IT GOT IT GOT IT NOW THANK YOU SO MUCH I MEAN YOU GUYS ARE EXTREMELY GOOD NOT THE BEST IN THE REGION IN TERMS OF LARGE SCALE LOGISTICS OF MOVING THINGS IS IT A PUZZLE FOR A LOT OF BUY I MEAN THAT LOGISTIC EXPECTATION HASN'T BEEN MOVED TO LIKE ALL THE WAY TO SMALL DELIVERY LIKE EDWARDO SAID AND TO EDWARDO'S POINT I MEAN I KNOW I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING VERY HUMBLY AND THINGS THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW BUT AMAZON TESLA FACEBOOK ALL OF THESE COMPANIES STARTED WITHOUT MAKING MONEY INITIALLY AND THEY JUST GAINED THE SCALE AND THIS COLOMBIAN GUY IS RAPING IT'S A QUESTION MARK IF THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO The small, the small drop shipping delivery and that just think that and i think a lot of investors think that you have a great opportunity, you have the balance sheet, you have the expertise and i think that yeah, initially, nobody will make money, it probably you get in, you probably won't make money either but once you get the scale, eventually i think consumers will pay a premium for using uber, for using pay pal, for using amazon and so forth. And with a long term vision that turns out to have WHY ARE YOU GETTING INTO THAT WITH MORE STRENGTH THAN YOU MUSTERED YOUR EXPECTATIONS? BUT ANYWAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS STAY PATIENT STAY PATIENT AND HAVE A GREAT DAY THANK YOU PART OF ONE OF THOSE ECOSYSTEMS DOWN THE ROAD AND LEVERAGE QUITE FRANKLY THE TWENTY THOUSAND BRICKS AND MORTAR STORES THAT WE HAVE WHICH ARE A DIFFERENTIATING FACTOR VIS A VIS THE OTHER FOLKS I'd like to hear your thoughts on the state of mom-and-pop stores in Mexico. On the one hand, it's hard to imagine many will not go under, of course. On the other hand, higher unemployment may push many to set up shop in the informal economy. So, any thoughts on what you're seeing on the ground would be appreciated. Well, I think the mom-and-pop stores were hardly hit unfortunately because of the lack of beer. The lack of cigarettes, because it wasn't only deer and cigarettes. I think we were able to, to, to prepare ourselves with good inventories and but again, the, the so those two were major, they have major effects on it in the other hand, I think the, the traditional mall parks are closed where people live so i think there are different mall parks, the world where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, A MAJOR ROLE YES THEY DIDN'T HAVE HARDLY HIT BUT THEY HAD I THINK THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE SMALLER NEIGHBORHOODS I THINK THEY ARE COMING UP WITH WITH A GOOD PERFORMANCE I WOULD SAY ALSO THEY ARE THERE BETTER PREPARED IN RETURNABLE BOTTLES THAT THE ONES THAT THE RETURNABLE SOFT DRINKS COMPARE WITH WITH OLSON SO THAT WAS A SMALL ADVANTAGE BUT YES AGAIN I THINK THEY WILL RECOUPERATE BECAUSE I THINK THE COCA COLA ASSISTAINT GERMAN AUDIO TRANSCRIPTION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AUDIO TRANSLATION\n\nGERMAN AU TO THE LAST QUESTION I GUESS YOU HAVE TAKEN SOME STAKES IN CERTAIN STARTUPS AND I HAVE SEEN THAT ONE OF THOSE HOUSTOLL HAS BEEN GROWING QUITE QUITE A BIT ANY INSIGHTS OR THINGS THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED ON THE DELIVERY IN IN THE STAKES THAT YOU CAN SHARE? TO SUPPORT THOSE SUPPLIERS THAT ARE VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH US THAT WILL HELP US TO ENHANCE OUR OUR VALUE PROPOSITION AND I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY THE ONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT ONE THAT MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF BUT YES WAS WORKING NOT ONLY WITH TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPLIERS BUT ALSO WITH NORMAL SUPPLIERS WHERE WE COULD HELP THEM TO BECOME LARGER AND IN FACT WE NEED THAT WITH A The supplier that we have with us, caffeine, is the one that supported all the coffee operations. And I think with that knowledge, we could be of great support to them. So this pandemic will also we we all the small vendors, we are helping them to pay them very quickly so they don't have this cash crunch problem that this pandemic will cost to them and and so that those are the yes, but our our small vendors, we are helping them to pay them very quickly so they don't have this cash crunch problem that this pandemic will cost to them and and so that those are the yes, but our our small vendors, we are helping them to pay them very quickly so they don't have this cash crunch problem that this pandemic will cost to them and and so that those are the yes, but our our small Old-school suppliers are very important and the strategic ones we want to invest in with them so they can grow better and faster to become a major competitive advantage to us. Yeah, I think on the on the justo or justo investment, I mean, certainly we're we're trying to to help these new ventures to through our venture arm but also learn about things that would help us in our own value proposition or the way that we operate. Certainly, distribution, the use of dark, dark warehouses or dark kitchens, dark stores, the handling of perishables, these are all things that we would love to be better at and to know more about. And this, this investment in particular, obviously has, has turned out to be an interesting one. I mean, the amounts involved are not huge in relation to the size of Fema, but certainly it's a startup that is doing very well, and of course, I know that you stay close to that. To these companies and and they're, you know, the different rounds of financing and and how quickly they're growing and and this is so far a very nice success story. MY QUESTION HAS TWO QUESTIONS, SORRY, I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. ONE, ON HYNEMAN, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT YOUR POSITION ON THE STAKE, ON OWNERSHIP, YOU KNOW, THIS FIFTEEN PERCENT HAS CHANGED OR YOUR NOT GIVEN THE NEW TAX AGREEMENT WITH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. AND TWO, ON MNA, IT'S FAIR TO SAY OR AN INTEGRATION ROLE. IT SEEMS TO BE A NICE TIME TO TAKE A BREATHER AND AND INTEGRATE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASSETS YOU BUY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS UNDERSTANDS MY TWO QUESTIONS THANK YOU WELL THE HAYNACHEN THE HAYNACHEN SHARES YES IT'S A TEMPORARY INVESTMENT WE JUST HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DEPLOY THAT CAPITAL IN A BETTER WAY AND AND IT IS IT IS AS NOT AS OPTIMAL AS IT WAS IN THE PAST BUT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IT IS WE JUST NEED TO FIND A WAY TO DEPLOY THAT CAPITAL IN A BETTER WAY TO FIND THE RIGHT TIME AND THE RIGHT PATH TO DEPLOY THAT CAPITAL AND HAVE THAT USE OF THOSE RULES PROCEEDS THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT ONE I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND QUESTION I FORGOT THE SECOND Q FOR THE MOST PART YOU SHOULD PREPARE US TO TO START INTEGRATING CAPTURING SYNERGIES AND KIND OF DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS I WOULD I WOULD SAY THERE THERE'S PROBABLY ONE ONE EXCEPTION AND YOU KNOW THAT THE JAMSTEC PLATFORM YOU KNOW A BIG PART OF THE OF THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THAT BUSINESS INVOLVES GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND EVENTUAL INTEGRATION AND YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO TELL AT THIS POINT WHETHER THERE W LONG IN THE COMING MONTHS AND QUARTERS. BUT IF THEY WERE I THINK WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TAKING LOOKS BUT OTHER THAN THAT FOR THE MOST PART OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT M N A IS HARD TO PREDICT GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT OUR STANCE IS ONE OF AS YOU SAY KIND OF SITTING A LITTLE BIT MORE ON OUR HANDS AND DIGESTING THE NUMBER OF BITES THAT WE TOOK OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS YEAH We don't think to open a new vector a different vector for growth with the ones we have already well established, the proximity health and and now this young platform I think we are already very much focused we will be very much focused into the platform that we already have great that's very clear thank you very much A city? Yes, yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. One is, I want to go back on the portfolio and the assortment question at Oxo. You spoke about how you can change some of the assortments given the economic slowdown. Could you explain more on the assortment question at Oxo? Changes you can make in the face of the reduced mobility and especially over the long term if this changes the consumer habits like if the mobility stays low for a long time that's the first question and the second question is in brazil logistics which are the biggest industries that those businesses serve? JEFF: I THINK IN THAT WE HAVE BETTER ABILITIES AND COMPETENCIES TO SUIT THE ABSORBENT NEEDS FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN LACK OF MOBILITY IS IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT BECAUSE REALLY IT'S ALSO DESIGNED TO SERVE PEOPLE ARE ON THE GO ARE ON THE STREETS WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST THE DAILY AND THE REPLENISHMENT NEEDS And that is the groceries and not really buying the groceries and also is really the one that the one that you are left out in your country and and this really is the occasion that we have been serving i think through this pandemic we would have been able to to compel and the consumer that we have a a good assurance of for for that a a country a a good assurance of for for that a a country a a good assurance of for for that a a country a a good assurance of for for that a a country a a good assurance of for for that a a country a a good assurance of for for that a a country a a good assurance of for for that a a country a a good assurance of for for that a a country a a good assurance of for for that a a country a a good assurance of for for that a a country WELL TO FIND THE PROBLEM YOU ON THAT THAT THEY ARE LEFT OUT IN YOUR IN YOUR COUNTRY AND I THINK BY TESTING FOR A FINDING MORE THEY ARE FINDING THAT WE HAVE A BETTER PRICES BUT I THINK THAT THAT CATEGORY IT WILL UM IF LACK OF MOBILITY WILL BE IN PLACE WE WILL HAVE TO EXPAND THAT CATEGORY COMPARE WITH THE AH AH AH AH MORE DESIGNED TO SERVE PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDERGOING DOWNTURN BUT I THINK THAT WOULD TAKE MORE TIME AND AN EFFORT THAN TO ADAPT TO THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN ONE YES NO I THINK I MEAN ON THAT FRONT IT WILL BE INTERESTING FOR ALL OF US TO SEE WHETHER YOU KNOW THE CONSUMER BEGINS TO PRIVILEGE PROXIMITY EVEN MORE RIGHT IN TERMS OF THESE TRADITIONALLY KIND OF SUPERMARKET TYPE CATEGORIES AND WHETHER OUR ASSORTMENT AND OUR PRICING IS COMPELLING ENOUGH THAT WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE WILL EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE FOR SOME OF THESE CONSUMERS TO DECIDE TO NOT JUST BUY THE YOU KNOW THE COOKING OIL OR THE RICE THAT THEY FORGOT OR THAT THEY RAN OUT OF DURING YOUR KNOW BETWEEN TRIPS TO THE SUPERMARKET BUT THAT THEY WILL USE ALSO AS A MORE FREQUENT SOURCE OF THIS TYPE OF PRODUCTS AND THEN WE W NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS AS WE GO ALONG I THINK ON AND I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE COMMENT ABOUT SPIRITS IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL CATEGORY WHERE WE HOPEFULLY WILL BECOME MORE KIND OF TOP OF MIND FOR THE CONSUMER IN TERMS OF HOW GOOD AN ASSORTMENT AND HOW GOOD OUR PRICING IS FOR THAT CATEGORY I THINK YOU ALSO TOUCHED ON THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION ON THE CATEGORIES FOR BRAZIL LOGISTICS I THINK GENERALLY AS WE HAVE BEEN MOVING Towards the ltl the less and truckload business and specialized warehousing certainly farma is an industry that is very well suited for the for the type of logistics that that we do not just in the distribution part but also on the on the warehousing side in fact if you look at agv the the company that we acquired a few months ago the you know their biggest their biggest category ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH HEALTH CERTAINLY A BIG COMPONENT OF ANIMAL OR VETERINARY HEALTH BUT ALSO HUMAN HEALTH. I THINK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE EQUATION OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SIZE OF THE PRODUCTS THE WEIGHT AND THE KIND OF VOLUME AND THE COST AND THE TYPE OF CONDITIONS THAT THEY REQUIRE FOR THEIR TRANSPORTATION AND THEIR STORAGE IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE INDUSTRY IT'S A PROFITABLE INDUSTRY AND IT'S A VERY GOOD FIT WITH WHAT WE DO. SO I WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD EXPECT US TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO GROW IN THAT FRONT. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE OTHERS THERE'S S C P G PRODUCTS AND CATEGORIES IN COMPANIES ELECTRONICS COMPANIES BUT CERTAINLY THE HEALTH YOU KNOW FOR BOTH HUMAN AND VETERINARY STAND OUT AS AS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST IF NOT THE BIGGEST THANK YOU HEY THERE EVERYBODY GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY JOHN AND CONSTANTINO HI LADIES AND GENTLEMEN JOHN AND CONSTANTINO SPOKE OF A CONCENTRATED PRICE READJUSTMENT YESTERDAY AS THE CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER AND WITH REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHTS IN YOUR EQUITY AGREEMENT WITH COKE WHAT ROLE IS FENSA PLAYING IN THIS NEGOTIATION AND WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE LONG TERM CLARITY OF THIS AGREEMENT PROFIT SPLIT WITH THE BRAND OWNER WELL ARE THEY ADAPTED FOR YOU AT THIS POINT CHADOWS THIS AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED LIKE FOUR YEARS AGO AND YES WE WANT TO HAVE WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MORE STABLE AND CERTAIN LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP MODEL AND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR US AND IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL CHAIRHOLDER IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR MANAGEMENT THE WAY WE COMPENSATE MANAGEMENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME CERTAINTY BECAUSE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE LONG RUN AND ALSO FOR THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS THE OTHER COMPANY COMPANY IS IS UNDERSTANDS THIS AND I THINK IT REALLY IS IT IS IT YOU JUST HAVE TO BE VERY CREATIVE AND PATIENT ON BOTH SIDES TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE THE SAME SHIP THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE PROBABLY IN THE PAST WE WERE NOT AS SYMPATHETIC OF TO UNDERSTAND THE INCOME STATEMENT OF A CORPORATION COMPANY AND PROBABLY WE WERE NOT AS SYMPATHETIC TO UNDERSTAND OUR OWN INCOME STATEMENT. AND I THINK THAT THROUGH THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD WITH THEM WE ARE VERY MUCH ALIGNED AND THEY HAVE A COMMON UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WEREN'T EXACTLY THE SAME BOTH AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE CURRENT CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WE HAVE TO As much alignment as possible, alignment as possible, uncertainty. So we can invest and and develop and tackle the consumer the best we can. And as I said, we love. And I think the main two objectives have to be fully aligned, fully aligned and the build certainty and trust in the relationship for the long run.\n\nSo the tenure of the last agreement was a ten year agreement.

THANK YOU. A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE GENESIS ASSET APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER NOW PERHAPS A BIT MORE OF A STRATEGIC QUESTION I MEAN HOW HOW DO YOU YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU GONNA BE UNLOCKING VALUE ON THIS ACQUISITION IN THE LONG RUN I MEAN ONE JUST MENTIONED THE B D M D POTENTIAL BUT YOU KNOW AS YOU MERGE THE TWO COMPANIES YOU COME UP WITH VENTURE SYNERGIES AND SO FORTH WHAT'S THE PLAN HERE IN TERMS OF HOW IT FITS TO THE OVERALL SENSE PLATFORM OR The role of five of these assets just increased a lot with the pandemic, and then you know, M&A would really be the key driver for future cash generation. So just a few thoughts there would be helpful. And then just a quick update on the JV in Brazil as well. Optimistic. We have the health edition and we have opportunities there for growth. We have the proximity edition and then we have a very detailed statistics of the performance we're making in south america and the jb we made in in brazil. And also with our partnerships that we have here in in in the united states we're very optimistic. We have two great platforms. We have the getha restaurant depot without south korea getha restaurant depot without south korea getha restaurant depot without south korea getha restaurant depot without south korea getha restaurant depot without south korea getha restaurant depot without south korea getha restaurant depot without south korea getha restaurant depot without south korea getha restaurant depot without south korea HAS BEEN EATING SHARE OUT OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE AND THIS IS A MAJOR COMPETITIVE STRENGTH THAT THEY HAVE AND WE WILL BE HAPPY THAT AND OTHER HAND IN BUSINESS WE ARE I THINK WE MADE A RIGHT DECISION WITH THE COMPANY'S IN WEST WITH THE PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE AND THE PLATFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO FOR INTEGRATION M E A N I NG AH0 N D G O I N IH0 NG F AO1 R W ER0 D F AO1 R AH0 N AO1 T M AO1 R N AE1 SH AH0 N AH0 L F UH1 T P R IH2 N T sil AE1 Z sil AY1 S EH1 D sil W IY1 D OW1 N P L AE1 N T UW1 AH1 P AH0 N D AO1 F sil AH0 N Y UW1 V EH1 K T ER0 F AO1 R G R OW1 TH sil AY1 TH IH1 NG K DH AH0 W AH1 N Z AA1 R DH EH1 R sil AE1 N D W WE HAVE GREAT PLATFORMS FOR GROWTH IN THE FUTURE ONE YEAH I KNOW I THINK I WOULD JUST FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID A LOT ABOUT YOU KNOW ON THE WHOLE JANSSEN PLATFORM THERE'S CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS VERY HIGHLY FRAGMENTED WHERE YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A HUGE INCUMBENT AS A PLATFORM THAT WE ARE FORMING BY COMBINING WAXY IN NORTH AMERICA ALREADY BECOMES ONE OF THE LARGER PLATFORMS THAT PLAYERS WITH YOU KNOW THE WEST COAST OF THE U S NORTH AMERICAN OUT OF CHICAGO HAS MORE OF A MID WEST ALL THE WAY DOWN TO FLORIDA COVERAGE BUT YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE PLAYERS WITH ANYTHING WE SEEMING A BIG NATIONAL PRESENCE AND SO THE SYNERGY COMPONENT THEY THE ASPIRATION TO INTEGRATE MORE OF THESE ASSETS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND IN THE RIGHT WAY IS A BIG PART OF I THINK THE GAME THE ASPIRATION THAT THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT BUSINESS SCALE IS A BEAUTIFUL THING WE WE HAVE BENEFICIARIES OF SCALE IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THIS IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE WE THINK THAT COULD WORK IT'S ITS MAGIC HAVE DONE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY I THINK YOU ALSO MENTIONED AT THE END OF YOUR QUESTION SOMETHING ABOUT AN UPDATE ON THE J V IN BRAZIL YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE PANDEMIC THROWS A LITTLE BIT OF SAND INTO THE GEARS IN TERMS Also, the pace of openings down there. But quite frankly we are almost on track in terms of openings for both the first new stores on the select site on the gas stations of raisin but also on the standalone oxo side. So we do aspire to start opening stores oxo stores towards the end of the year in brazil. We are already making progress in that regard. IN TERMS OF SETTING UP OUR FIRST DISTRIBUTION CENTER DOWN THERE AS WELL SO THINGS ARE GOING VERY MUCH ACCORDING TO PLAN AND LIKE I SAID I THINK THE PANDEMIC HAS NOT FORCED THE TEAM DOWN IN BRAZIL TO DEPART VERY MUCH FROM THE ORIGINAL PLAN OBVIOUSLY THIS IS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A PIECE OF CAKE YOU KNOW FIGURING OUT THE RIGHT VALUE PROPOSITION FOR FOR THE BRAZILIAN OXO IS GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT THE SIZE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE MAKES US VERY, VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS WILL EVENTUALLY BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PORTFOLIO. AND I THINK THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH COSSANT AND AND AND I THINK IT'S IF WE FOUND THAT THE PROXIMITY DIVISION BUILDS PENTA COMMERCE FOUND THE RIGHT WAY TO GO INTO THIS MARKET. THEY ARE VERY HAPPY. THEY ARE LEARNING A LOT. IN FACT, THEY ARE LEARNING THROUGH AH Going to be the adapt some of the select operations to this new scheme and i think there's a lot of we see a lot of growth and and potential to adjust the value proposition of the select stores and the off-price stores in the field and i think that will be very but it will take time it will take time but i think we are very optimistic Much. Now we'll go back to a follow-up from gustavo oliva of ubs. thank you for taking my follow-up question, if i may. yesterday at walmart's conference call, they did mention some risks with respect to the introduction of the new labeling and regulation rules that will start already in october. Could you please help us to understand what could be the impact of those new labeling rules in your in your oxfam business? Perhaps during the transition time now as it's implemented in october and perhaps in your ability of of or on your suppliers ability to push for for sales growth we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we CONSUMER AND AND AND AND AND IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT I'VE BEEN LEARNING I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO FORM THE CONSUMER SO THE CONSUMER CAN DO THE BETTER DECISION FOR THE THE THE THE I DON'T KNOW FOR THEIR HEALTH AND NUTRITION AND EVERYTHING SOMETIMES IT'S BIT TOO FAR THE CONSUMER MIGHT BE BLOCKING SOME SOMETHING OUT SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE HE JUST OVERLOADED BY THIS LABORING WE DON'T KNOW REALLY WHERE WE'LL STAND AND AND I THINK BUT BUT CURRENTLY WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR SUPPLIERS AND I THINK WE'D BE VERY IN A VERY BAD POSITION TO ADOPT THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT WE DON'T SEE MAJOR RISES HAPPENING I DON'T KNOW WOULD YOU WANT TO ADD TO THIS ONE?\n\nME AND JUST JUST A JUST POINT THAT I THINK ON ON ON BEVERAGES CERTAINLY ON THE COKE FEMSA SIDE GENERALLY THE CONSUMER HAS BEEN WELL INFORMED FOR MANY YEARS NOW ABOUT YOU KNOW THE CALORIE COUNT AND THAT SORT OF THING AND THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN EVOLVING FOR A WHILE INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF THE OF THE PORTFOLIO THAT HAS REDUCED OR NO CALORIES AT ALL AND SO I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES FROM THE FROM THE FROM THE The relabeling involve more, you know, the costs and the kind of the operating conundrums of, you know, changing labels or adjusting your packaging, that sort of thing. But not so much in terms of the incremental information that the consumer will receive. There are other categories where maybe the consumer has not been as as exposed to nutritional information and i think for those there will be a period of adaptation. But to aldo's point, you know, i think also is, is also true. IS ITS VERY WELL POSITIONED AND THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE LEVEL OF DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION WITH SUPPLIERS LEADS I THINK TO TO WHAT SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY SMOOTH TRANSITION WHEN THIS EVENTUALLY BECOMES A FACT AND BEFORE OR OUR SUPPLIERS ARE GOING TO ASSUME THE COSTS OF THAT OPERATION. I THINK THAT COULD IMPACT YOUR YOUR FOUR Q RESULTS OR PERHAPS PART OF YOUR THREE Q RESULTS NO BUT I THINK IF WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE WE W AH0, AH0N AH0 L T ER1 N AH0 T IH0 V AY1 D OW1 N N OW1 W AH1 N sil N OW1 AY1 AH0 G R IY1 W IH0 TH Y UW1 DH AE1 T sil AA1 R IH0 N V EH1 N T AO2 R IY0 L EH1 V AH0 L Z AH0 N D sil Y UW1 N OW1 sil T EH1 N D T AH0 B IY1 sil S M AO1 L sil AH0 N D DH EH1 R IH0 Z DH AH0 T ER1 N OW2 V ER0 IH0 Z IH0 Z sil F AE1 S T sil I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today.

COSTS DELIVER ON MARGIN EXPANSION AND POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOW DESPITE THE DROP IN GLOBAL CONSTRUCTION I WANT TO THANK OUR EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE GLOBE FOR THEIR DEDICATION DURING THESE EVER-CHANGING TIMES DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS WE IMPLEMENTED CHANGES IN OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT TO ENSURE OUR EMPLOYEES REMAIN SAFE AND HEALTHY OUR MULTIFACETED RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSED AND VOLUNTARY FACTOR SHUTDOWNS RESULTED IN MINIMAL DISRUPTIONS TO OUR BUSINESS I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF OUR EMPLOYEES AS THEY CAME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR VENDORS IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT ENSURING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES WILL ALWAYS BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AS DISCUSSED DURING OUR FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS CALL WE WERE SEEING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER VOLUMES IN APRIL AND MAY IMPEDED BY LOCKDOWNS ACROSS THE GLOBE DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS IN JUNE AS THE REGIONS BEGAN TO REOPEN REVENUE STARTED TO TREND UP FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH IN MANY OF OUR MARKETS OUR EXPERIENCE IS IN LINE WITH INDUSTRY TRENDS AND OUR CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON US DURING THE QUARTERS TO SUPPORT THEIR NEEDS JULY REVENUES HAVE CONTINUED IN LINE WITH JUNE AND OUR POSITION IN OUR MARKETS IS STRONG LET'S BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT OUR FCC BUSINESS FCC REVENUES WHICH REBOUNDED IN JUNE WERE ABOUT FLAT WITH JUNE 2019 AFTER EXPERIENCING THE 30% DECLINE IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE QUARTER IN NORTH AMERICA OR LARGEST REGION FCC HAD 6% GROWTH IN THE MONTH OF JUNE VERSUS PRIOR YEAR JUNE SEVERAL LARGE NORTH AMERICAN PROJECTS STARTED DURING THE QUARTER WHICH WILL CONTINUE INTO 202 EUROPEAN VOLUMES REBOUNDED IN JUNE EXCEEDING JUNE 2019 VOLUMES BY 2% AS THE REGION REOPENED AFTER BEING LOCKED DOWN IN APRIL AND MAY FCC IN LATIN AMERICA WAS IMPACTED BY A REDUCTION IN DEMAND DUE TO LOCKDOWNS IN MOST OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH CONTINUED THROUGH TO JUNE IN THE ASIA REGION CHINA BEGAN TO RECOVER DURING THE QUARTER ALTHOUGH SOUTHEAST ASIA AND AUSTRALIA REMAINED IN LOCKDOWN DURING JUNE OUR VERIFIED BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW ALTHOUGH AT A SLOWER PACE VERSUS PRE COVID-19 DUE TO THE DOWNTURN IN THE GLOBAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY NOW TURNING TO SBM WE SAW A SLOW DOWN IN PROJECT ACTIVITY AND DISTRIBUTOR DEMAND DURING APRIL AND MAY WITH VOLUMES DOWN 37% DURING THIS TWO MONTH PERIOD PARTICULARLY WHEN MARKETS EXPERIENCED CONSTRUCTION RESTRICTIONS <INAUDIBLE> PLACE ORDERS SALES VOLUMES IMPROVED IN JUNE WITH NORTH AMERICA WHICH IS OUR LARGEST REGION ENDING THE MONTH 1.50% BEHIND JUNE OF 201 WE CONTINUE TO WIN AND PROGRESS ON LARGE PROJECT ACTIVITY INCLUDING AIRPORTS BRIDGES AND OFFICE BUILDING PROJECTS WE SECURED A NUMBER OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN NORTH AMERICA WHICH WILL SUPPORT US IN THE SECOND HALF ADDITIONALLY SOME PROJECTS THAT BEGAN PRE PANDEMIC CONTINUED TO PROGRESS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER GCP'S PRODUCTS APPLIED IN OTHER OUTDOOR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS OUR FIREPROOFING PRODUCT LINE EXPERIENCED LESS OF A NEGATIVE IMPACT THE POSSIBLE MOMENTUM DURING THE MONTH OF JUNE CONTINUED THROUGH JULY WE SEE A STRONGER THIRD QUARTER COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER WHILE WE ARE MINDFUL OF LOCAL HOTSPOTS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR CUSTOMERS DUE TO THE COVID-19 VIRUS OUR STRATEGIC GOAL FOR SBM IS FOR SUSTAINABLE ORGANIC GROWTH PARTICULARLY IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN BUILDING ENVELOPE AND RESIDENTIAL PRODUCT LINES AND BY INCREASING OUR PRESENCE IN UNDERSERVED SEGMENTS AND MARKET GEOGRAPHIES THAT ARE PROFITABLE AND GROWING IN THE LONG TERM OUR PLAN ALSO INCLUDES EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AWARENESS TO ADJACENT MARKET SEGMENTS AND ACCELERATING THE LAUNCH OF NEW AND ACCESSORY PRODUCTS FOR THE PREMIUM AND MID TIER SEGMENTS THIS PROGRAM IS STARTING TO GAIN TRACTION AND IS EVIDENT IN OUR YEAR OVER YEAR JUNE REVENUES IN NORTH AMERICA I'M ALSO PLEASED TO REPORT THE LAUNCH OF TWO NEW PRODUCTS FOR WEATHER BARRIERS AND SURFACE COATINGS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL GAIN TRACTION IN THE COMING QUARTERS THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT GCP'S GROSS MARGIN IMPROVED 130 BASIS POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO 39.1% FCC'S GROSS MARGIN IMPROVED FOR THE SIXTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER THIS IS A RESULT OF OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON OUR MANUFACTURING AND FREIGHT PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES THAT WE STARTED IN 201 WE ALSO SAW THE BENEFIT OF RAW MATERIAL DEFLATION THROUGHOUT THE QUARTER SECOND QUARTER SELLING GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 8% MAINLY DUE TO LOWER EMPLOYEE AND RELATED COSTS DURING THE QUARTER AS A RESULT OF OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS AND LOWER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING COST-CONTAINMENT ACTIONS INCLUDING REDUCED TRAVEL WERE PUT IN PLACE DURING THE QUARTER IN RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS GCP'S CASH POSITION REMAINS VERY STRONG WITH $318.20 MILLION OF CASH ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THE END OF JUNE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 20 JUNE OF 2020 TOTALED $17.60 MILLION AS WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF GCP'S CAMBRIDGE HEADQUARTERS ON JULY 31ST 202 PLANNING IS UNDERWAY TO LOCATE A FITTING LOCATION FOR OUR HEADQUARTERS THE $125 MILLION TRANSACTION UNLOCKS VALUE FOR GCP SHAREHOLDERS AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S COMMITMENT TO INVIGORATING ITS FOCUS ON PROFITABLE GROWTH VALUE CREATION AND APPROPRIATE CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGIES IN ADDITION TODAY WE ANNOUNCED THE APPROVAL BY GCP GCP'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE $100 MILLION STOCK BUYBACK PROGRAM WITH THE AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE MANAGEMENT WILL WORK WITH THE BOARD TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO EXECUTE ON THIS PROGRAM I'D NOW LIKE TO TURN THE CALL OVER TO CRAIG WHO WILL REVIEW THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN MORE DETAIL ALONG WITH SEGMENT RESULTS AND OR COMMENTS ON THE THIRD QUARTER CRAIG THANK YOU RANDY AND GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY JUST A REMINDER ALL REVENUE AND ASSOCIATED GROWTH RATES IN MY COMMENTS ARE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS BEFORE WE SUMMARIZE OUR SECOND QUARTER LET ME FIRST JUST SAY THAT WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH OUR RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR TO DATE CONSIDERING THE CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OUR TEAMS REMAIN FOCUSED ON THEIR OBJECTIVES AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE AND COMMITMENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS ALBEIT MORE CHALLENGING WITH THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT FIRST I WILL FOCUS ON THE REVENUES FOR THE QUARTER GCP SALES OF 200 MILLION WERE 23.70% LOWER THAN PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS ON CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND MANUFACTURING AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 IMPACTS DUE TO COVID-19 VARIED BY PRODUCT LINE AND GEOGRAPHY DURING THE QUARTER BUT GENERALLY REMAINED WITHIN THE 25 TO 35% ON FAVORABLE IMPACT EXPECTED AS WE ENTERED THE SECOND QUARTER ALTHOUGH THE DEMAND IN APRIL AND MAY WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY OUR JUNE REVENUES DID REBOUND FOR GCP OVERALL AND SPECIFICALLY IN NORTH AMERICA AS THE ECONOMY OPENED UP ALTHOUGH UM UH NORTH AMERICA REVENUES FINISHED 2% UP FOR JUNE VERSUS PRIOR YEAR AND WE SEE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN NORTH AMERICA IN JULY EUROPE ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA ALSO FINISHED JUNE MUCH STRONGER THAN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE QUARTER HOWEVER THE REBOUND WAS NOT AS GENEROUS AND IT WAS IN NORTH AMERICA UH DUE TO A SLOWER OVERALL RETURN TO NORMAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES UK VOLUME HAS BEEN STEADILY IMPROVING BUT AT A LITTLE SLOWER RATE THAN CONTINENTAL EUROPE CHINA VOLUMES HAVE COME BACK SINCE THE COUNTRY REOPENED AND THE REST OF ASIA INCLUDING AUSTRALIA CONTINUE TO IMPROVE BUT ARE STILL IMPACTED BY COVID-19 GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS LATIN AMERICA VOLUME STEADILY IMPROVED DURING THE QUARTER HOWEVER SOME COUNTRIES REMAIN UNDER LOCKDOWN WHERE LOCKDOWNS ARE NOT PRESENT WE ARE SEEING GOOD CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND VOLUMES GLOBALLY WITH RESPECT TO PRICE GCP WAS CLOSE TO FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR AT A 0.10% PRICE DECLINE FCC CAPTURED PRICE MOST NOTABLY IN LATIN AMERICA WHERE IN COUNTRY INFLATION DUE TO CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS OCCURRED AND WE INCREASED PRICE APPROPRIATELY SBMS NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA REGIONS EXPERIENCED SOME PRICE PRESSURE AND WHICH WAS EXPECTED IN THE CURRENT DEFLATIONARY PERIOD WHEN OIL PRICES ARE AT HISTORICAL LOW THE TEAMS ACTED QUICKLY THOUGH TO CON- CONTINUE TO SECURE APPROPRIATE VOLUMES AND MARGINS DURING THE QUARTER ON CURRENT AND FUTURE PROJECT BIDS GCP'S GROSS MARGIN INCREASED 130 BASIS POINTS TO 39.1% PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL LABOR AND FREIGHT COSTS DRIVEN BY OPERATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY WHICH WERE PAR- PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF REDUCED OPERATING LEVERAGE DURING THE PERIOD TO LOWER SALES AND PRODUCTION VOLUMES SELLING GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS OF 65.7 MILLION IMPROVED BY 5.7 MILLION OR APPROXIMATELY 8% DURING THE QUARTER BENEFITING FROM LOWER EMPLOYEE AND RELATED COSTS DUE TO RESTRUCTURING MANAGEMENT OF OTHER DISCRETIONARY COSTS INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND FAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE COVID 19 RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL ENTERTAINMENT AND OTHER OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES SOME SECOND QUARTER RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES DID MOVE TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR DUE TO THE LIMITED ACCESS TO OFFICES AND TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE IN SOME COUNTRIES DUE TO COVID-19 WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXECUTE ON OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS AND ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING OUR SGNA POSITION RELATIVE TO OVERALL SALES VOLUMES IN THE ENVIRONMENT MANAGING THESE COSTS IS A HIGH PRIORITY AS WE MONITOR OUR PERFORMANCE METRICS AND EXPECTED VOLUMES OVER THE NEXT THREE TO SIX MONTHS GCPS LOST FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTED TO GCP SHAREHOLDERS WAS 1.3 MILLION COMPARED TO INCOME FROM <INAUDIBLE> THE OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTED TO GCP SHAREHOLDERS OF 3.1 MILLION PER SECOND QUARTER 201 THE CHANGE

ALTHOUGH IT CONTINUES TO BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON OUR BUSINESS OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS AND BEYOND AS EVENTS UNFOLD THE NEAR TERM VIEW IS AS FOLLOWS AS DISCUSSED JUNE'S POSITIVE VOLUME TRENDS HAVE CONTINUED INTO JULY AND WE EXPECT THE THIRD QUARTER TO BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE SECOND QUARTER PLANNED AND FUNDED CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS HAVE RESUMED OR ARE COMING ONLINE WITH CONSTRUCTION SITES HAVING IMPLEMENTED ADDITIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS ALONG WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING THESE EFFORTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR CONSTRUCTION TO REMAIN ACTIVE WHILE HOTSPOTS MAY ARISE WHILE WE EXPECT THE DEMAND TO IMPROVE AND SLOWLY RETURN TO CLOSE TO NORMAL LEVELS AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES SOME PROJECTS HAVE MOVED INTO 2021 WHICH MAY DAMPEN SOME DEMAND IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE YEAR AND WE ARE MONITORING THIS CLOSELY AS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF WHICH WE HAVE THE BEST VIEW WE EXPECT THE IMPACT OF COVID 19 PANDEMIC TO REDUCE OVERALL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS BY APPROXIMATELY 5% VERSUS PRIOR YEAR IN CONSTANT CURRENCY WE ALSO EXPECT RAW MATERIAL DEFLATION TO PROVIDE A MODEST OFFSET TO THE FORECASTED VOLUME DECLINES HOWEVER WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER PRODUCTIVITY TO SUPPORT OUR MARGINS WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON OUR OPERATING EXPENSES WHICH WE HAVE CONTINUED TO IMPROVE SEQUENTIALLY DURING THE YEAR AND IN ADDITION TO OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS WHICH WILL CONTINUE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES AND HAVE LEARNED A LOT DURING THE COVID-19 PERIOD ON HOW TO PERFORM AT A LOWER COST BASE WHILE WE SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS VERY WELL WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THESE LEARNINGS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE YEAR WE REMAIN ON TRACK TO THE PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REDUCTION OF 25 MILLION IN 2020 OR A REDUCTION OF 35 TO 45% FROM OUR ORIGINAL PLANNED CAPITAL SPENDING AND WE EXPECT OUR CASH POSITION WILL GROW THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BASED ON THE WORKING CAPITAL PROGRAMS WE HAVE INITIATED THAT REDUCE CAPEX TARGET VERSUS ORIGINAL PLAN AND OF COURSE THE SALE OF OUR CAMBRIDGE SITE THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED WILL BE FUNDED WITH OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCE LOOKING BEYOND THE PANDEMIC WE ARE CONFIDENT IN LONG-TERM FUNDAMENTALS OF GCP AND THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR CURRENT PLANS WILL ALLOW US TO NAVIGATE THE PANDEMIC AND WE'LL BE WELL POSITIONED AS THE OVERALL CONSTRUCTION DEMAND STABILIZES SOMEWHAT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WHILE WE FOCUS ON OUR OVERALL COST POSITION AS A COMPANY I'LL TURN IT NOW BACK OVER TO RANDY THANK YOU THANKS CRAIG UH JUST A FEW CLOSING REMARKS LET ME JUST SAY

THEY'RE YOU FEEL LIKE THEY'RE MAKING BETTER PROGRESS TOWARD NORMAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY FOR SOME AREAS WHERE YOU YOU HAVE MORE CONCERN OR OR MORE UNCERTAINTY ON ON THE PACE OF THAT PROGRESS TOWARD NORMAL NO IT'S A GOOD QUESTION MIKE AND UM YOU KNOW JUST LIKE WE SEE HERE IN NORTH AMERICA AND WE HEAR ABOUT EVERY DAY ON THE NEWS YOU KNOW SOME STATES ARE REOPENING FASTER THAN OTHERS AND ARE GETTING BACK TO SOME SOME TYPE OF NORMALCY WELL THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF AROUND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AS WELL AS CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION SOME HAVE JUST BEEN MUCH SLOWER DUE TO RESTRICTIONS AND AND ALSO DUE TO SOME HOTSPOTS THAT HAVE RESURFACED AND GETTING BACK TO TO NORMAL ACTIVITY SO UH WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THAT THROUGH THE NEXT QUARTER TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS UM WE DO BELIEVE THAT UM THE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY IN THAT THOSE TWO REGIONS EUROPE AND AND THE APAC REGION WILL INDEED START COMING BACK IN THE THIRD QUARTER UM WE JUST DON'T KNOW THE PACE BY WHICH THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN DUE MOSTLY TO THESE RESTRICTIONS ALL RIGHT AND THEN IN IN TERMS OF THE RESTRUCTURING UM YOU MENTIONED SOME ADDITIONAL COST AREAS UH THAT THAT YOU UM HAVE HAVE LEARNED TO OPERATE ON A LOWER COST SPACE UM I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO APPLY YOUR YOUR GUIDANCE OF A A 5% IMPACT OF COVID ON THE TOP LINE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT LOOKS ON THE BOTTOM LINE AS YOU MAYBE HANG ON TO SOME OF THESE ADDITIONAL COST ACTIONS UH THAT YOU'VE DELIVERED AND CONTINUE TO SEE IMPROVEMENT IN UH IN IN THE RAW MATERIAL ENVIRONMENT NO IT'S ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION MIKE WE'VE OBVIOUSLY GONE THROUGH AN EXPERIMENT HERE OVER THE PAST YOU KNOW FOUR MONTHS OR SO ON A GLOBAL BASIS TO SEE HOW CAN WE RUN OUR COMPANY DIFFERENTLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO WORK DIFFERENTLY IN THIS PANDEMIC AND THERE'S A LOT OF LESSONS THAT THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THAT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WORKING AT HOME STRATEGIES HOW WE SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS DIFFERENTLY HOW WE DO VIRTUAL UM GO LIVES AND VIRTUAL UH TEST TRIALS YOU KNOW WITH OUR CUSTOMERS SO A LOT OF THOSE LEARNINGS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE GOING FORWARD AS MOST COMPANIES ARE AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO UM LOWER COST OF HOW WE RUN OUR OPERATIONS WE'VE ALSO LEARNED A LOT IN OUR PLANTS IN TERMS OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AGAIN DRIVEN BY THIS CRISIS IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND DIFFERENT UM PROCESSES THAT WE'VE BUILT IN TO BE ABLE TO TO BETTER MANAGE OUR INVENTORY AND BETTER MANAGE HOW WE SERVICE THE CUSTOMERS GLOBALLY SO A LOT OF LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED AND AND THE GOAL WOULD BE GOING FORWARD THAT THESE LESSONS ARE GOING TO FIND THEIR WAY TO THE BOTTOM LINE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD CRAIG UH YEAH UH MIKE IT'S A GOOD QUESTION UH WE'VE DONE A LOT OF UH JUST UH PRIORITY IS OUR OUR EMPLOYEE SAFETY OF COURSE DURING THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DOING A LOT OF VIRTUAL TRAINING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS WE'RE DOING UM MIXED DESIGN UH TRAINING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS VIRTUALLY WE'RE STARTING TO LEARN THAT UH SOMETIMES AND OUR CUSTOMER'S BEHAVIOR IS STARTING TO COME AROUND A LITTLE BIT THAT THAT'S ACCEPTABLE UM WE ALSO UM IMPLEMENTED A GC PLUS UH PROGRAM UH OF ORDERING ONLINE THAT UH RANDY AND AND UH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE GROUP AND THE IT GROUP IMPLEMENTED ABOUT UH SIX MONTHS AGO WE'RE SEEING TRACTION ON THAT NOW JUST ORDERS COMING THROUGH ONLINE VERSUS A SALES REP OR SOMEONE HAVING TO TAKE THESE ORDERS WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS COSTLY WHEN IT HAS TO BE HANDED OFF TO EIGHT DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO TAKE ORDERS UM YOU KNOW MORE BACK IN THE 1960S INDUSTRIAL KIND OF PROCESS SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF PROGRESS ON KIND OF THE NEW WAY OF OF HOW YOU DO BUSINESS UM AND UH WE'RE WE'RE GETTING ADVANTAGE OF THAT IN THE IN THE COST BASE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK AND INVEST THE MONEY BACK IN THERE UH NOW THAT WE SEE THE ADVANTAGE SO WE EXPECT UH SAVINGS TO CONTINUE IN Q3 AND FOUR RELATIVE TO THOSE AND WE'RE HAVING GOOD DISCUSSIONS UH WITH THE WHOLE TEAM UH ABOUT HOW WE CONTINUE THAT INTO 2021 EVEN IF THINGS UH COME BACK TO NORMAL AND AND COVID-19 KIND OF RELAXES A LITTLE BIT SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY UH UH UH QUITE A BIT OF MONEY THERE IF IF WE CAN KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING UM I CAN'T SAY EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'LL BE IN 2021 BUT WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER IDEA AS WE GO THROUGH Q3 AND AND AN ADDITIONAL POINT TO MAKE MIKE THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO ADD WE'RE IN THE ENVIABLE POSITION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR NEW HEADQUARTERS GOING FORWARD AS WE'VE MENTIONED AND UM HAVING THIS LEARNING OF THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN SHOULD PLAY INTO OUR DECISION SO IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY UM YOU KNOW THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION LOOKING FORWARD ALL RIGHT AND THEN IN IN TERMS OF YOU MENTIONED SOME LARGER PROJECTS THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GETTING PUSHED INTO 202 UM ARE YOU PRETTY CONFIDENT AT THIS POINT THAT THESE ARE DELAYS AND NOT CANCELLATIONS MAYBE JUST UH TALK ABOUT KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE BACKLOG ON ON SOME OF THOSE LARGER PROJECTS YEAH SO UM ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION I I MEAN I WISH I COULD ANSWER YOU YOU KNOW 100% THAT THEY'RE DELAYS NOT CANCELLATIONS BUT FOR RIGHT NOW THEY'RE DELAYED UM THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME PROJECTS THAT WOULD HAVE GOT STARTED ALREADY IN Q2 UM THEY'RE NOT STARTED UM THERE IS SOME PROBABLY CONCERN ON FUNDING AND SOCIAL DISTANCING AS YOU KNOW THESE BIG PROJECTS WHEN THEY START THEM UH THE TIMELINE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM SO I I JUST THINK FOR NOW AS LONG AS THE ECONOMY STAYS ABOUT WHERE IT'S AT AND UM UH THERE'S NOT INCREMENTAL HOTSPOTS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT I THINK THEY'RE PUSHED OUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE CANCELED THERE'S FUNDING FOR THE PROJECTS UH THERE'S STILL A LOT OF MONEY AROUND UM THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE UM PEOPLE JUST ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE APPREHENSIVE UM TO TO START A PROJECT ESPECIALLY A BIG ONE RIGHT NOW WITH THE SOCIAL DISTANCING YOU KNOW SPECIFIC HOTSPOTS EVEN ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN SIDE WE'VE ACTUALLY UM GIVEN OUR CUSTOMERS A LITTLE MORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN OUR INVENTORY IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN WHEN THEY WANT TO BE WE WANT THEM TO BE BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD SOME BACKUP INVENTORY JUST IN CASE ONE OF OUR PLANTS GOES DOWN AND I THINK ONCE OTHER COMPANIES START TO DO THIS UM FOLKS WILL HAVE MORE COMFORT TO SPEND THE MONEY ON THESE BIG PROJECTS SO THEY CAN GET FULL SUPPLY CHAIN SUPPORT FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS ALL RIGHT AND THEN UH LAST QUESTION FOR ME IS IS THIS MAYBE ON THE DECISION TO AUTHORIZE THE $100 MILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASE CAN CAN YOU TALK ABOUT UH YOUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES UH GOING FORWARD AND MAYBE ANY GUIDANCE ON ON THE TIMING OF THIS REPURCHASE ACTIVITY THANKS YEAH NO MIKE WE UM OBVIOUSLY HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND RETURNING UH OUR MONIES TO SHAREHOLDERS NOW WITH THE NEW BOARD IN PLACE AND WE'RE EXCITED AGAIN TO HAVE THEIR INPUT AND THEIR GUIDANCE INTO SPECIFICALLY THE STRATEGY OPERATING AT RISK COMMITTEE UH WE'LL BE WORKING WITH MANAGEMENT AND GOING THROUGH THE THE VARIOUS OPTIONS WE HAVE UH WHAT MAKES THE BEST SENSE FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS AND IT'S GOING TO CREATE THE MOST VALUE FOR SHAREHOLDERS OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS THE FIRST DECISION THAT WAS MADE REGARDING CAPITAL ALLOCATION THE $100 MILLION AUTHORIZATION FOR THE BUYBACK UM BUT THE OVERALL UH BOARD ONCE IN THE STRATEGY OPERATING COMMITTEE ONCE THEY GET UP AND AND AND FUNCTIONING FULLY UH THIS WILL BE A DISCUSSION POINT UM GOING FORWARD MIKE YEAH <INAUDIBLE> THANKS VERY MUCH YEAH <INAUDIBLE> YEAH I'LL JUST ADD MIKE MAYBE OUT TO ONE OF YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS I MEAN THESE BIG PROJECTS ARE IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE CATEGORY THEY'RE NOT IN COMMERCIAL OR RETAIL PROJECTS THAT THAT TYPE OF THING SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE MORE CONFIDENT THEY'RE PUSHED OUT THAN THAN CANCELED JUST JUST THE CATEGORY THEY'RE IN IS IS MORE COMFORTING FOR US THE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM ROSEMARY <INAUDIBLE> RESEARCH PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYONE GOOD MORNING ROSEMARY GOOD MORNING ROSEMARY UH YOU TALKED ABOUT UH THE BOARD UH THE BOARD'S INPUT ON YOUR STRATEGY GOING FORWARD UH SO BETWEEN THE NEW BOARD AND WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED DURING THE COVID WELL WE ARE STILL IN IT BUT UH DURING COVID COULD YOU TOUCH ON WHAT CHANGES YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT IN YOU KNOW FOR YOUR STRATEGY GOING FORWARD IS THERE ANYTHING UH VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU WERE PLANNING DOING AHEAD OF THOSE TWO EVENTS NO WHAT I WOULD SAY ROSEMARY WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE NEW BOARD WE'VE HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND WE'RE STILL IN THE PHASE OF OF SHARING OUR CURRENT STRATEGIES AND AND GETTING THEIR INPUT ON AREAS THAT WE COULD FOCUS ON DIFFERENTLY AND AREAS THAT IDEAS THAT THEY HAVE THAT WE CAN INVESTIGATE SO IT'S STILL IN THAT PHASE OF UH GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND PUTTING FORTH THE BEST STRATEGY FOR GCP GOING FORWARD I'M REALLY EXCITED WITH WHAT I'VE HEARD UM AGAIN MENTIONING THIS UH THE STRATEGY OPERATING RISK COMMITTEE UM A LOT OF EXPERIENCE A LOT OF IDEAS AND UH WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM CLOSELY IN THE COMING MONTHS AND WE'RE TO COME ON THAT BUT UM BUT WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE THIS DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON ON HOW THE COMPANY COULD BE DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU LEARNED DURING COVID SO YOU HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU CAN OPERATE AT A LOWER COST <INAUDIBLE> A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISCRETIONARY COSTS UM CAN YOU QUANTIFY HOW MUCH OF THOSE YOU THINK YOU WILL GENERATE IN 2020 AND UH WHILE YOU MAY NOT HAVE A HARD NUMBER FOR 2021 HOW MUCH IS COMING BACK UM WITH VOLUME YEAH SO ROSEMARY IN IN Q2 MAYBE THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOME GUIDANCE AND I KNOW SOME OTHERS MIGHT WANT IT UM IN Q2 UH OF ABOUT THE SIX OR UH I GUESS ABOUT $6 MILLION OF OPERATING SAVINGS WE HAD YOU KNOW MOSTLY SGNA UM IT'S ABOUT A THIRD A THIRD A THIRD IT'S ABOUT THIRD RESTRUCTURING ABOUT THIRD ACTUAL IMPLEMENTED COST UH SAVINGS AND ABOUT A THIRD DUE TO KIND OF LOWER ACTIVITY DUE TO COVID-19 SO UM OUR OUR CHALLENGE TO OURSELVES IS UH YOU KNOW CAN WE KEEP THAT THIRD UM YOU KNOW SAVINGS UH DUE TO THE COVID-19 LOWER ACTIVITY UH SO THAT'S A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS A QUARTER SO WE'RE CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO DETERMINE HOW WE CONTINUE TO GET OUR VOLUMES OUR PRIOR YEAR VOLUMES AND STILL UH STILL EXECUTE ON THAT SO THAT THAT'LL GET THAT'S ABOUT ALL THE GUIDANCE I CAN GIVE RIGHT NOW UM BUT WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT AND AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN KEEP THAT THROUGH THE YEAR OR NOT AND IN TERMS OF RESTRUCTURING ROSEMARY UM WE WE'RE FOCUSED ON CONTINUING THE INITIATIVES THAT WE SET FORTH YOU KNOW SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES AND OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT UM ASSET MANAGEMENT BETTER UM BUT WITH THE INPUT WITH THE NEW BOARD WE'RE EXCITED THAT UH THERE'LL BE SOME NEW IDEAS TO COME INTO THAT SO RESTRUCTURING IS NOT GOING TO STOP RESTRUCTURING WILL CONTINUE AND THAT'LL BE UH BE AN INPUT INTO UM OUR SAVINGS GOING FORWARD ALL RIGHT THANKS AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE US A FEEL AS TO HOW VERIFI UM <INAUDIBLE> DURING THE THIS DOWNTURN I ASSUME THAT UH IF A CEMENT TRUCK DOES NOT GO OUT THEN THERE IS NO USE OF VERIFI BUT YOU ARE ALSO DOING SOME VIRTUAL UH TRIALS UH CAN YOU GIVE US A FEEL FOR THE MOMENTUM IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA UH YEAH UM WE WE WERE ACTUALLY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED ON THE REVENUES WITH VERIFI DURING THE QUARTER THEY WERE UP 50% UH YEAR OVER YEAR UM IN Q2 UH THAT'S MAINLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE HAD MORE MORE EQUIPMENT OUT THERE IN Q2 THIS YEAR THAN WE DID LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE INSTALLS UH IN THE LATTER HALF OF 201 UM THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT THAT BUSINESS IS THAT THEY THEY TEND TO USE THE TRUCKS ON ANY JOB THAT HAVE VERIFI SO UM OUR OUR TRUCKS GO OUT FIRST WITH THE VERIFI UNITS ON THEM UH BECAUSE THEY NEED TO KEEP THEIR OPERATIONS KIND OF SOLIDIFIED BECAUSE THAT'S THE NEW OPERATING MODEL THEY'RE ON SO WE DIDN'T REALLY SEE A LOT OF DECLINE UM OF USAGE OF THE VERIFI UNITS UH DURING THE QUARTER UH AND CERTAINLY NOT AS MUCH AS UH MAYBE WE SAW THE MARKET AND IN NORTH AMERICA THE MARKET WAS PRETTY STRONG AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE GOT MOST OF OUR UNITS UM SO THAT'S WHY WE HAD THE 50% POP IN REVENUE WE HAVE SEEN SLIGHTLY SLOW DOWN ON INSTALLS OF NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING AND YOU KNOW MANAGING THE BEHAVIOR OF THEIR THEIR ORGANIZATION UM YOU KNOW AT THIS TIME DURING COVID-19 THEY DO HAVE TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE ORGANIZATION TO GET THE VALUE SO WE'VE SEEN A LITTLE BIT OF SLOW DOWN BUT WE DID SEE UM YOU KNOW UM IN AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND UM AND ASIA UH SOME NEW CONTRACTS SIGNED UH DURING Q2 AND EVEN INTO Q3 HERE UM SO WE'RE PRETTY PLEASED AT THE PROGRESS BUT CERTAINLY IT WILL BE SLIGHTLY SLOWER ON THE INSTALLS IN THE SECOND HALF HERE UM BUT RA- RANDY DO HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS NO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT AS WELL I MEAN IT'S UNFORTUNATE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS THAT WE HAD HOPED TO HAVE INSTALLS THAT THEY'RE JUST DISTRACTED WITH THE VIRUS AND UM IT'S DIFFICULT TO INSTALL UNITS WHEN YOU NEED THEIR HELP THEN YOU HAVE THE SOCIAL DISTANCING RESTRICTION SO THAT'S KIND OF SLOWED DOWN TO CRAIG'S POINT SURE THAT MAKES SENSE I WAS WONDERING LASTLY IF YOU COULD GIVE US UH UH THE LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE FOR YOUR BUSINESS BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING SO WE CAN AND IF YOU CAN TALK OF THE ABOUT THE TRENDS IN EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES WHAT ARE YOU SEEING YEAH SO UM UH NORTH AMERICA IS WHERE WE GOT THE BEST VISIBILITY ON THE MARKET DATA BUT OBVIOUSLY GLOBALLY THERE'S UH IHS AND OTHERS THAT COME UP WITH THE DATA UM WERE TEND TO BE IF YOU WANNA THINK ABOUT IT ABOUT A THIRD A THIRD A THIRD I MEAN ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR REVENUES TIED TO INFRASTRUCTURE A THIRD TO COMMERCIAL AND UH ABOUT A THIRD TO RESIDENTIAL AND PEOPLE COULD BE SUR- UH SURPRISED ON THE RESIDENTIAL PIECE BUT UH THE NORTH AMERICA CONCRETE AND CEMENT UH YOU KNOW BASICALLY GOES INTO RESIDENTIAL ALSO AND THAT'S A BIG PART OF OUR BUSINESS UM WE'RE PRETTY UM CONFIDENT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE UH GOVERNMENTS UH YOU KNOW YOU KNOW MAY UP THE SPEND ON INFRASTRUCTURE GOING FORWARD UH JUST TO TO PUMP THE ECONOMY SO WE'RE PRETTY PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN GLOBALLY AND THEY'RE GOING TO THERE MIGHT BE SOME DELAYS HERE JUST ON GETTING THINGS GOING BUT WE THINK WE'RE WE'RE GOOD AT GOOD THERE ON THE RESIDENTIAL UH THE MARKET SEEMS STRONG I I THINK YOU'VE SEEN THE STATISTICS TOO BOTH IN NORTH AMERICA AND AROUND THE WORLD UH CHINA ASIA UH RESIDENTIAL STILL KEEPS GOING STRONG SO I THINK WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE THERE UM COMMERCIAL COULD BE SLIGHTLY SLOWER UH JUST YOU KNOW YOU'VE SEEN THE RETAIL NEWS UH YOU KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY UM UH SOME RECONSIDERATION ON OFFICE SPACE ON WHAT YOU REALLY NEED FOR OFFICE SPACE MOVING FORWARD SO I WOULD SAY COMMERCIAL IS PROBABLY THE PLACE WHERE WE MIGHT SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWER UH UPTAKE BUT I THINK THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE RESIDENTIAL WILL OFFSET THAT AND IN FACT WE GET VERY GOOD MARGIN ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE'LL PROBABLY GET A MARGIN MIX THAT WILL OFFSET ANY DECLINE ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE IF THERE IS ONE MOVING FORWARD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN ONE THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME THIS CONCLUDES OUR QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION I'LL TURN IT BACK TO BACK TO BETSY COWELL FOR CLOSING REMARKS THANK YOU KAY UH WE APPRECIATE YOUR HELP TODAY AND UH THANK YOU ALL FOR ATTENDING THE CONFERENCE IS NOW

We appreciate the engagement as they continue to work actively alongside our business leaders to drive the business forward. The newly formed strategy operating and risk committee has been advising management on a variety of topics including strategy, operations, go to market, product innovation, and operating expenses. Progress on all fronts has been made. MADE, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING MORE IN THE COMING QUARTERS I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CONGRATULATE CRAIG MERRILL ON BEING APPOINTED OUR PERMANENT C E O F O WE HAVE WORKED WITH CRAIG CLOSELY SINCE WE JOINED JC P I P AND FIND HIM TO BE A VALUABLE PARTNER FOR ME MY EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND THE BOARD SO AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS CRAIG TURNING TO THE SECOND QUARTER PLEASE REFER TO THE SLIDES FOUR FIVE AND SIX IN OUR PRESENTATION OUR ORG In the face of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage costs, deliver on margin expansion, and positive operating cash flow, despite the drop in global construction. I want to thank our employees across the globe for their dedication during these ever-changing times due to the coronavirus. We implemented changes in our operating environment to ensure our employees remain safe and healthy. Our multifaceted response to the government-imposed and voluntary restrictions. Voluntary factory shutdowns resulted in minimal disruptions to our business. I could not be more proud of our employees as they came together to support one another, our customers, and our vendors. It goes without saying that ensuring the health and safety of our employees will always be our number one priority. As discussed during our first quarter earnings call, we were seeing significantly lower volumes in April and May impeded by lockdowns across the globe due to the coronavirus in June. As regions began to reopen, revenues started to trend up for the first time since March in many of our markets. Our experience is in line with industry trends, and our customers continue to depend on us during the quarters to support their needs. July revenues have continued in line with June, and our position in our markets is strong. Let's begin by talking about our FCS business. FCS revenues, which rebounded in June, were about flat with June 2019 after experiencing a decline. The SCC had a 30% decline in the first two months of the quarter in North America, our largest region. Several large North American projects started during the quarter, which will continue into 2022. European volumes rebounded in June, exceeding June 2019 volumes by 2%. The region reopened after being locked down in April and May. Acted by a reduction in demand due to lockdowns in most of the countries which continued through to June in the Asia region China began to recover during the quarter although southeast Asia and Australia remained in lockdown during June our verified business continues to grow although at a slower pace versus pre-covid nineteen due to the downturn in the global construction industry now turning to sbm we saw a slowdown in project activity and distributor demand during April may with volumes downs During this two-month period, sales volumes improved in June with North America, which is our largest region, ending the month one point five percent behind June of two thousand and nineteen. We continue to win and progress on large project activity including airports, bridges, and office building projects. We secured a number of infrastructure projects in North America which will support us in the second half. Additionally, some projects that began pre-pandemic continued to progress during the second quarter. JCP's products applied in other outdoor applications, such as our fireproofing product line, experienced less of a negative impact. The positive momentum during the month of June continued through July, and we see a stronger third quarter compared to the second quarter. While we are mindful of local hotspots that may impact our customers due to the COVID-19 virus, our strategic goals are... Sbm is for sustainable organic growth particularly in our north american building envelope and residential product lines and by increasing our presence in underserved segments and market geographies that are profitable and growing in the long term our plan also includes expanding our product portfolio awareness to adjacent market segments and accelerating the launch of new and accessory products for the premium and mid-tier segments this program is starting to gain momentum FRACTION AND IS EVIDENT IN OUR YEAR OVER YEAR JUNE REVENUES IN NORTH AMERICA I'M ALSO PLEASED TO REPORT THE LAUNCH OF TWO NEW PRODUCTS FOR WEATHER BARRIERS AND SURFACE COATINGS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL GAIN TRACTION IN THE COMING QUARTERS THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT GCP'S GROSS MARGIN IMPROVED A HUNDRED THIRTY BASIS POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO THIRTY NINE POINT ON This is the result of our continued focus on our manufacturing and freight productivity initiatives that we started in two thousand and nineteen. We also saw the benefit of raw material depletion throughout the quarter. Second quarter selling general and administrative costs decreased by approximately eight percent mainly due to lower employe and related costs during the quarter as a result of our restructuring programs and lower discretionary spending cost containment actions including. REDUCED TRAVEL WERE PUT IN PLACE DURING THE QUARTER IN RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS G C P'S CASH CASH POSITION REMAINS VERY STRONG WITH THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF CASH ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THE END OF JUNE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE TWENTY JUNE TWENTY TWO TOTALED SEVENTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUED TO EXECUTE ON OUR WORKING CAPITAL The sale of GCP's Cambridge headquarters on July 31, 2020, planning is underway to locate a fitting location for our headquarters. The hundred and twenty-five million dollar transaction unlocks value for GCP shareholders and is consistent with the company's commitment to vigorate its focus on profitable growth, value creation, and appropriate capital allocation strategies. In addition, today we announce the approval by GCP GCP's board of directors of the hundred and twenty-five million dollar transaction. ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS STOCK BUY BACK PROGRAM WITH THE AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE MANAGEMENT WILL WORK WITH THE BOARD TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO EXECUTE ON THIS PROGRAM I NOW LIKE TO CALL THE CALL OVER TO CRAIG WHO WILL REVIEW THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN MORE DETAIL ALONG WITH SEGMENT RESULTS AND OUR COMMENTS ON THE THIRD QUARTER CRAIG THANK YOU RANDI AND GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY JUST A REMINDER ALL REVENUE AND ASSOCIATED GROWTH RAT SECOND QUARTER: LET ME FIRST JUST SAY THAT WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH OUR RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER AND YEAR TO DATE, CONSIDERING THE CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT DURING THE SECOND QUARTER. OUR TEAMS REMAIN FOCUSED ON THEIR OBJECTIVES AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE AND COMMITMENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS ALBEIT MUCH CHALLENGED BY THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. FIRST, I WILL FOCUS ON THE REVENUES FOR THE QUARTER: GCP SALES OF TWO H The government imposed restrictions on construction activities and manufacturing as a result of COVID-19. Impacts due to COVID-19 varied by product line and geography during the quarter, but generally remained within the twenty-five to thirty-five percent unfavorable impact expected as we entered the second quarter. Although the demand in April and May was down significantly, our June revenues did rebound for GCP overall and specifically in North America. As the economy opened up, North America revenue finished two percent up for June versus prior year and we see continued strength in North America in July. Europe, Asia, and Latin America also finished June much stronger than the first two months of the quarter. However, the rebound was not as generous and it was in North America due to a slower overall return to normal construction activities. U.K. volume has been the best. STEADILY IMPROVING BUT AT A LITTLE SLOWER RATE THAN CONTINENTAL EUROPE CHINA VOLUMES HAVE COME BACK SINCE THE COUNTRY REOPENED AND THE REST OF ASIA INCLUDING AUSTRALIA CONTINUE TO IMPROVE BUT ARE STILL IMPACTED BY COVID NINETEEN GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS LATIN AMERICA VOLUMES STEADILY IMPROVED DURING THE QUARTER HOWEVER SOME COUNTRIES REMAIN UNDER LOCK DOWN WHERE LOCK DOWNS ARE NOT PRESENT WE ARE SEEING GOOD CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY G C P WAS CLOSE TO FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR AT A ZERO POINT ONE PERCENT PRICE DECLINE S C C CAPTURED PRICE MOST NOTABLY IN LATIN AMERICA WHERE IN COUNTRY INFLATION DUE TO CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS OCCURRED AND WE INCREASED PRICE APPROPRIATELY S B M S NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA REGIONS EXPERIENCED SOME PRICE PRESSURE AND WHICH WAS EXPECTED IN THE CURRENT DEFLATIONARY PERIOD WHEN OIL PRICES ARE AT HISTORIC LOWS Teams acted quickly, though, to continue to secure appropriate volumes and margins during the quarter on current and future project bids. GCP's gross margin increased a hundred and thirty basis points to thirty-nine point one percent, primarily due to lower raw material, labor, and freight costs driven by operational productivity which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reduced operating leverage during the period to lower sales and production volumes. Selling general and administration costs of sixty five point seven million improved by five point seven million or approximately eight percent during the quarter benefiting from lower employee and related costs due to restructuring management of other discretionary costs including advertising and favorable impact of the covid nineteen restrictions on travel entertainment and other operational activities some second quarter restructuring activities did. We will move to the second half of the year due to limited access to offices and travel restrictions which made it difficult to execute in some countries due to COVID-19. We will continue to execute on our restructuring plans and are currently assessing our SGNA position relative to overall sales volumes in the environment. Managing these costs is a high priority as we monitor our performance metrics and expected volumes over the next three to six months. GCP's loss from continuing operations. Attributed to GCP shareholders was one point three million compared to income from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders of three point one million for the second quarter of two thousand and nineteen. The change was primarily due to lower gross profit due to lower sales volumes partially offset by reduced restructuring and repositioning costs, lower selling and general administration costs and slightly lower tax expense. GCP's adjusted EBITDA was even. The margin ended the quarter at six point eight percent versus nine point six percent in the prior year quarter primarily due to lower gross profit as a result of volume declines partially offset by lower selling general and administrative costs. Adjusted ebitda margin was twelve point eight percent for the second quarter or a hundred basis points lower than the same period two thousand and nineteen looking at the specific performance of our two segments you can refer to pages ten and eleven. Fcc sales were down to twenty point five percent to one hundred nineteen point five million north america's revenues declined ten point seven percent in the quarter as construction in most states was deemed essential and our customer network in north america continued to service their customers although at a slower pace versus prior year during the quarter however reorder rates in june were well ahead of prior year other regional sales declined In other regions, twenty seven to thirty percent versus prior year during the quarter with the sales declines all mostly attributable to covid nineteen impacts in asia, europe, and latin america due to covid nineteen have been slightly more prolonged and deeper versus north america revenue in june versus the same period for two thousand and nineteen in north america and europe both increased five point seven percent and one point six percent respectively. Compared with June two thousand and nineteen, price gains also occurred in Latin America and in Europe on a nominal basis with slightly offset volume declines during the quarter. S&P's gross margin improved by three hundred and fifty basis points during the second quarter. Six consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement, as Randi mentioned, real material deflation, operation and logistics productivity, and favorable regional mix all contributed to margin expansion. The SCC segment income was nine point nine million with an operating margin of eight point five percent which decreased ninety basis points compared with the prior year quarter primarily due to lower sales volume unfavorably impacted by operating leverage partially offset by higher gross margin. SBC sales totaled eighty point five million during the second quarter, a twenty eight percent decline versus the second quarter of two thousand and nineteen. DUE TO CHALLENGING CONSTRUCTION MARKETS AS A RESULT OF COVID NINETEEN SALES VOLUMES IN APRIL AND MAY WERE BELOW TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN VOLUMES DUE TO REDUCED CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTORS IN APRIL AND MAY DID NOT RESTOCK AT A NORMAL PACE DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE IMPACTS OF COVID NINETEEN ON FUTURE PRODUCT DEMAND NORTH AMERICA VOLUMES DID HOWEVER REBOUND IN JUNE AS CONSTRUCTION RESUMED IN MANY NORTH AM Distributors reordering and larger projects restarting once customer COVID-19 safety procedures were instituted in line with government and state recommendations. In June North America SBM sales were down one point five percent versus prior year June. However, positive year over year reorder patterns were evident in July. Business in France, Germany, Italy, and the UK for SBM also improved during June. Once overall restrictions were lifted, SBM's gross margin declined to 140 basis points to 39.7% compared to the second quarter of 2019 due to the unfavorable impact of lower sales resulting in reduced operating leverage and increased inventory write-offs year over year, partially offset by raw material deflation and productivity. SBM's segment operating income was eleven million with operating margins at thirteen point eight percent. This point decline versus prior year was due mainly to lower sales volume unfavorably impacting operating leverage and lower gross profit partially offset by the benefits of reduced discretionary costs and employee-related costs during the quarter. Now turning back specifically to GCP, GCP's effective tax rate for the quarter was one hundred thirty-six point four percent for the quarter that included the reversal of the first quarter CARES Act tax benefit resulting from changes in our forecasted income. For the year, the company no longer expects to have a net operating loss carryback for 2020 of which it did expect in Q1 forecast. GCI's net cash provided by operating activities was 17.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, versus a usage of cash of 13.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Adjusted free cash flow totaled 18 million. 180 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS COMPARED WITH A USAGE IN TOTAL OF 12 POINT THREE MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MANAGEMENT IMPROVED TWENTY POINT EIGHT MILLION VENDOR PAYABLES DELIVERED A FOUR POINT ONE MILLION DOLLAR IMPROVEMENT AND INVENTORIES GENERATED A ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR SIX MONTHS WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE TRANSP COUNTRY OPERATIONS AND WE ARE SEEING THE RESULTS OF THESE EFFORTS WHICH WILL CONTINUE. PLEASE REFER TO SLIDES 12 AND 13 FOR OUR DISCUSSION ON GCP's FIRST HALF PERFORMANCE. GCP'S NET SALES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS TOTALED FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DECREASING FOURTEEN PERCENT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR MAINLY DUE TO THE SECOND QUARTER IMPACT OF COVID NINETEEN ON VOLUMES. GROWS MARGIN FOR THE SIX MONTH The net loss attributable to J.C.P. shareholders in the first six months totaled point two million compared with net income attributable to shareholders of twenty four million for the first half of June two thousand and nineteen. The change resulted mainly from the reduced sales volume to Covid nineteen in the second quarter, partially offset by reduced operating expenses. Adjusted EBIT was twenty seven point eight million for the first six months. ONE PERCENT UNFAVORABLE FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AGAIN MAINLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF COVID NINETEEN TURNING TO OUR OUTLOOK FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ALTHOUGH IT CONTINUES TO BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON OUR BUSINESS OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS AND BEYOND AS EVENTS UNFOLD THE NEAR-TERM VIEW IS AS FOLLOWS AS DISCUSSED JUNE'S POSITIVE VOLUME TRENDS H We expect the third quarter to be a significant improvement over the second quarter. Planned and funded construction projects have resumed or are coming online with construction sites having implemented additional health and safety protocols along with social distancing. These efforts are important for construction to remain active while hot spots may arise. While we expect demand to improve and slowly return to close to normal levels as the year progresses, some projects have moved into 2021. WHICH MAY DAMPEN SOME DEMAND IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE YEAR AND WE ARE MONITORING THIS CLOSELY AS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF WHICH WE HAVE THE BEST VIEW WE EXPECT THE IMPACT OF COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC TO REDUCE OVERALL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS BY APPROXIMATELY FIVE PERCENT VERSUS PRIOR YEAR IN CONSTANT CURRENCY WE ALSO EXPECT RAW MATERIAL DEFLATION TO PROVIDE A MODEST OFFSET TO THE FORECASTED VOLUME DECLINES HOWEVER WE WILL CON WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON OUR OPERATING EXPENSES WHICH WE HAVE CONTINUED TO IMPROVE SEQUENTIALLY DURING THE YEAR AND IN ADDITION TO OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS WHICH WILL CONTINUE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES AND HAVE LEARNED A LOT DURING THE COVID NINETEEN PERIOD ON HOW TO PERFORM AT A LOWER COST BASE WHILE WE SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS VERY WELL. WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THESE LEARNINGS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE YEAR 25 MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY OR A REDUCTION OF THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO FORTY FIVE PERCENT FROM OUR ORIGINAL PLAN CAPITAL SPENDING AND WE EXPECT OUR CASH POSITION WILL GROW THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BASED ON THE WORKING CAPITAL PROGRAMS WE HAVE INITIATED THE REDUCED CAPEX TARGET VERSUS ORIGINAL PLAN AND OF COURSE THE SALE OF OUR CAMBRIDGE SITE THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ANNOUNCE WILL BE FUNDED WITH OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCE LO INDUSTRY WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR CURRENT PLANS WILL ALLOW US TO NAVIGATE THE PANDEMIC AND WILL BE WELL POSITIONED AS THE OVERALL CONSTRUCTION DEMAND STABILIZES SOMEWHAT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WHILE WE FOCUS ON OUR OVERALL COST POSITION AS A COMPANY I'LL TURN IT NOW BACK OVER TO RANDI THANK YOU THANKS CRAIG JUST A FEW CLOSING REMARKS LET ME JUST SAY AGAIN THAT WE HAVE WELCOMED YOUR NEW BOARD MEMBERS AND THEIR ENTHUS WORKING RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN VERY ENGAGING AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO JOINTLY CONTINUING TO CREATE VALUE FOR OUR GCSP SHAREHOLDERS DESPITE THE CHALLENGES THE COVID NINETEEN VIRUS PRESENTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OUR TEAMS AROUND THE GLOBE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE JUNE REBOUND AS IT DID WE WILL CONTINUE THIS FOCUS GOING FORWARD AND OUR STRONG BALANCE SHEET WHICH FEATURES SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY AND NO NEAR REMARKS AS WELL TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THROUGH THE ONGOING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AND UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC WITH THE SALE OF THE CAMBRIDGE FACILITY AND THE STOCK BUYBACK PROGRAM WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A FLEXIBLE LIQUIDITY BASE AND ALONG WITH THE BOARD WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ALL ALTERNATIVES FOR THE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT USE OF CASH I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR EMPLOYEES PERSONALLY AND ON BEHALF OF EXTREMELY CHALLENGING CONDITIONS I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU TODAY FOR JOINING OUR CALL AND WE NOW LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS WE WILL NOW BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION TO ASK A QUESTION YOU MAY PRESS STAR THAN ONE ON YOUR TOUCH TONED PHONE IF YOU ARE USING A SPEAKER PHONE PLEASE PICK UP YOUR HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE KEY TO WITHDRAW FROM THE QUESTION TWO PLEASE PRESS STAR THAN TWO THE FIRST QUESTION IS FROM MIKE HARRISON SPEECH AH000 BH EH1 D sil HIY1 sil G UH1 D M AO1 R N IH0 NG sil HIY1 sil G UH1 D M AO1 R N IH0 NG sil M AO1 R N IH0 NG M AY1 K sil AH0 N D K AH0 N G R AE2 CH AH0 L EY1 SH AH0 N Z T AH0 K R EY1 G AA1 N DH IY0 sil P ER1 M AH0 N AH0 N T B OW1 L Z sil AE1 Z S IY1 OW0 Z sil TH AE1 NG K Y UW1 sil W AO1 N T AH0 D T AH0 AE SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE THERE YOU FEEL LIKE THEY'RE MAKING BETTER PROGRESS TOWARD NORMAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY OR SOME AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE MORE CONCERN OR MORE UNCERTAINTY ON THE PACE OF THAT PROGRESS TOWARD NORMAL THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION MIKE AND JUST LIKE WE SEE HERE IN NORTH AMERICA WE HEAR ABOUT EVERY DAY ON THE NEWS SOME STATES ARE REOPENING FASTER THAN OTHERS AND ARE GETTING BACK TO SOME TYPE OF NORMALCY THE SAME TH In the Asia-Pacific region, some have just been much slower due to restrictions and also due to some hot spots that have resurfaced in getting back to normal activity. So, we're going to follow that through the next quarter to see what happens. We do believe that the construction activity in those two regions, Europe and the APEC region, will indeed start coming back in the third quarter. We just don't know the pace by which that's going to happen. Again, due mostly to these restrictions. Okay, and then in terms of the restructuring, you mentioned some additional cost areas that that you have learned to operate on a lower cost base. I guess I'm just trying to apply your guidance of a five percent impact of COVID on the top line, trying to think about how that looks on the bottom line as you may be hanging on to some of these additional cost actions that you've delivered. AND CONTINUE TO SEE IMPROVEMENT IN IN IN THE RAW MATERIAL ENVIRONMENT IT'S ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION MIKE. WE'VE ABSOLUTELY GONE THROUGH AN EXPERIMENT HERE OVER THE PAST FOUR MONTHS OR SO ON A GLOBAL BASIS TO SEE HOW CAN WE RUN OUR COMPANY DIFFERENTLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO WORK DIFFERENTLY IN THIS PANDEMIC AND THERE'S A LOT OF LESSONS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THAT IN TERMS OF WORKING FROM HOME STRATEGIES HOW WE SERVICE OUR C With our customers, so a lot of those learnings we're going to take going forward as most companies are and we do believe that's going to lead to lower costs of how we run our operations. We've also learned a lot at our plants in terms of inventory management, again driven by this crisis in terms of different techniques and different processes that we've built in to be able to better manage our inventory and better manage how we serve our customers globally. So a lot of lessons that we've learned and the goal would be going forward that these lessons are going to find their way to the bottom line. Anything you want to add? HEY YEAH MIKE IT'S A GOOD QUESTION WE'VE DONE A LOT OF JUST A PRIORITY IS OUR EMPLOYEES SAFETY OF COURSE DURING THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING A LOT OF VIRTUAL TRAINING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS WE'RE DOING MIXED DESIGN TRAINING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS VIRTUALLY WE'RE STARTING TO LEARN THAT SOMETIMES AND OUR CUSTOMERS BEHAVIORS ARE STARTING TO COME AROUND A LITTLE BIT THAT THAT'S ACCEPTABLE WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED Of ordering online that randi and the customer service group and the it group implemented about six months ago we're seeing traction on that now just orders coming through online versus a sales rep or someone having to take these orders which obviously is costly when it has to be handed off to eight different people to take orders you know more back in the nineteen sixty s industrial kind of process so we're seeing a lot of progress on kind of the new wave of how you do business so we're seeing a lot of progress on kind of the new wave of how you do business so we're seeing a lot of progress on kind of the new wave of how you do business so we're seeing a lot of progress on kind of the new wave of how you do business so we're seeing a lot of progress on kind of the new wave of how you do business so we're seeing a AND WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT IN THE IN THE COST BASE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK AND INVEST THE MONEY BACK IN THERE NOW THAT WE SEE THE ADVANTAGE. SO WE EXPECT SAVINGS TO CONTINUE IN Q3 AND 4 RELATIVE TO THOSE. AND WE'RE HAVING GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE WHOLE TEAM ABOUT HOW WE CONTINUE THAT INTO TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE EVEN IF THINGS COME BACK TO NORMAL AND COVID NINETEEN KINDA RELAXES A LITTLE BIT. SO THAT' IF WE CAN KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING I CAN'T SAY EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'LL BE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE BUT WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER IDEA AS WE GO THROUGH CUE THREE AND AN ADDITIONAL POINT TO MAKE MIKE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD WE'RE IN THE ENVIABLE POSITION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR NEW HEADQUARTERS GOING FORWARD AS WE'VE MENTIONED AND HAVING THIS LEARNING OF THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN SHOULD P ALL RIGHT. AND THEN IN TERMS OF YOU MENTIONED SOME LARGER PROJECTS THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GETTING PUSHED INTO TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE. ARE YOU PRETTY CONVINCED AT THIS POINT THAT THESE ARE DELAYS AND NOT CANCELLATIONS? MAYBE JUST TALK ABOUT KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE BACKLOG ON SOME OF THOSE LARGER PROJECTS YEAH SO ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION. I WISH I COULD ANSWER YOU YOU KNOW ONE HUNDRED PERCENT THAT THERE RELATIONSHIPS BUT FOR RIGHT NOW THEY'RE DELAYED THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME PROJECTS THAT WOULD HAVE GOT STARTED ALREADY IN Q2 THEY'RE NOT STARTED THERE IS SOME PROBABLY CONCERN ON FUNDING AND SOCIAL DISTANCING AS YOU KNOW THESE BIG PROJECTS WHEN THEY START THEM THE TIMELINE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM SO I JUST THINK FOR NOW AS LONG AS THE ECONOMY STAYS ABOUT WHERE IT'S AT AND THERE'S NOT INCREMENTAL HOT SPOTS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT I TH They're cancelled. There's funding for the projects. There's still a lot of money around. That's not the issue. People just are a little more apprehensive to start a project, especially a big one right now with the social distancing. You know, specific hot spots, even on the supply chain side. We've actually given our customers a little more confidence in our supply chain. Our inventories are slightly higher than they want to be. We want them to be. But we've actually had some backup inventory just in case one of our plants goes down. And I think once, Other companies start to do this. Folks will have more comfort to spend the money on these big projects so they can get full supply chain support from their customers. Alright, and then a last question for me is just maybe on the decision to authorize the hundred million dollars of share repurchases. Can you talk about your capital allocation priorities going forward and maybe any guidance on the timing of this repurchase activity? Yeah, no, Mike, we obviously have always had a pretty comprehensive view of capital allocation and returning our monies to shareholders. Now with the new board in place and we're excited again to have their input and their guidance, and specifically the strategy operating at risk committee will be working with management and going through the various options we have what makes the best sense for the shareholders and it's going to create the most value for shareholders. Obviously, this was the first decision that was made regarding capital allocation, the hundred million dollar authorization for the buyback. The overall board, once in the strategy and operations committee, once they get up in and in functioning fully, this would be a discussion point going forward. PROJECTS THAT THAT TYPE OF THINGS. SO YOU KNOW WE'RE MORE CONFIDENT THAT THEY'RE PUSHED OUT THAN THAN CANCELLED JUST JUST THE CATEGORY THEY'RE IN IS IS MORE COMFORTING FOR US BETWEEN THE NEW BOARD AND WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED DURING THE COVID WELL WE ARE STILL IN IT BUT DURING COVID COULD YOU TOUCH ON WHAT CHANGES YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT IN YOU KNOW FOR YOUR STRATEGY GOING FORWARD IS THERE ANYTHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU WERE PLANNING IN DOING AHEAD OF THOSE TWO EVENTS? A couple of months and we're still in the phase of sharing our current strategies and getting their input on areas that we can focus on differently and areas that the ideas that they have that we can investigate so it's still in that phase of getting to know each other and putting forth the best strategy for gcp going forward i'm really excited with what i've heard again mentioning this strategy operating a risk committee a lot of experience and a lot of ideas and we're going to continue to work with them closely in the coming months and to come on that but but but we're still in that phase of getting to know each other and putting forth the best strategy for gcp going forward i'm really excited with what i've heard again mentioning this strategy operating a risk committee a lot of experience and a lot of ideas and we're going to continue to work with them closely in EXCITED TO HAVE THIS DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THE COMPANY COULD BE DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU LEARNED DURING COVID SO YOU HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU CAN OPERATE AT A LOWER COST THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISCRETIONARY COSTS CAN YOU QUANTIFY HOW MUCH OF THOSE YOU THINK YOU WILL GENERATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WHILE YOU MAY NOT HAVE A HARD NUMBER FOR PERFORMANCE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE HOW MUCH OF THOSE RETURNING BACK WITH VOLUMES YEAH SO ROSEMARY IN QUE TWO MAYBE THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOME GUIDANCE AND I KNOW SOME OTHERS MIGHT WANT IT IN QUE TWO OF ABOUT THE SIX OR ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF OPERATING SAVINGS WE HAD YOU KNOW MOSTLY S G N A IT'S ABOUT A THIRD THIRD THIRD THIRD IT'S ABOUT THIRD ACTUAL IMPLEMENTED COSTS SAVINGS AND ABOUT A THIRD DUE TO KIND OF LOWER ACTIVITY DUE TO COVID NINETEEN SO OUR CHALLENGE TO OURSELVES IS CAN WE KEEP THAT THIRD YOU KNOW SAVINGS DUE TO THE COVID NINETEEN LOWER ACTIVITY THAT'S SO THAT'S A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS A QUARTER SO WE'RE CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO DETERMINE HOW WE CONTINUE TO GET OUR VOLUMES AT PRIOR YEAR VOLUMES AND STILL STILL EXECUTE ON THAT SO THAT'LL GET THAT'S ABOUT ALL THE GUIDANCE I CAN GIVE RIGHT NOW BUT THAT THROUGH THE YEAR OR NOT IN TERMS OF RESTRUCTURING ROSEMARY WE WERE FOCUSED ON CONTINUING THE INITIATIVES THAT WE SET FORTH YOU KNOW SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES AND OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT ASSET MANAGEMENT BETTER BUT WITH THE INPUT WITH THE NEW BOARD WE'RE EXCITED THAT THERE'LL BE SOME NEW IDEAS TO COME INTO THAT RESTRUCTURING IS NOT GOING TO STOP RESTRUCTURING WILL CONTINUE AND THAT WILL BE A BIAN INPUT INTO OUR SAVINGS GOING FORWARD Verify operated during this downturn. I assume that if a cement track does not go out, then there is no use of verify, but you are also doing some virtual trials. Can you give us a feel for the momentum in that particular area? Yeah, we were actually pleasantly surprised on the revenues with verify during the quarter. They were up fifty percent year over year. QUESTION TWO: THAT'S MAINLY DUE TO THE FACT WE HAD MORE MORE EQUIPMENT OUT THERE IN QUEST TWO THAN WE DID LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE INSTALLS IN THE LATTER HALF OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN UM THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT THAT BUSINESS IS THAT THEY TEND TO USE THE TRUCKS ON ANY JOB THAT HAS VERIFIED SO OUR TRUCKS GO OUT FIRST WITH THE VERIFIED UNITS ON THEM BECAUSE THEY NEED TO KEEP THEIR OPERATIONS KINDA SOLIDIFIED BECAUSE Really see a lot of decline of usage of the verify units during the quarter and certainly not as much as maybe we saw the market. And in North America, the market was pretty strong, and that's where we've got most of our units. So that's why we had the fifty percent pop in revenue. We have seen slightly slow down on installs of new customers only because it's difficult for them in social distancing and you know managing the behavior of their their organization. Speaker 1: You know, at this time during COVID 19, they do have to change the behavior of their organization to get the value so we've seen a little bit of a slowdown. But we did see in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia some new contracts signed during Q2 and even into Q3 here. So we're pretty pleased at the progress, but certainly, it'll be slightly slower on the installs in the second half. It's with our customers that we had hoped to have installs that they're just distracted with the virus. And it's difficult to install units when you need their help. Then you have the social distancing restrictions. So that's kind of slowed down Craig's point. Sure, that makes sense. I was wondering lastly, if you could give us a level of importance for your business between presidential construction, commercial construction, and infrastructure spending. So we can About the twins in each of those categories. What are you seeing? Yeah, so North America is where we get the best visibility on market data, but obviously globally, there's iHS and others that come out with the data. We tend to be, if you want to think about it, about a third of our revenues tied to infrastructure, a third to commercial, and about a third to residential. And people could be surprised on the residential. BUT THE NORTH AMERICA CONCRETE AND CEMENT YOU KNOW BASICALLY GOES INTO RESIDENTIAL ALSO AND THAT'S A BIG PART OF OUR BUSINESS WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW MAY UP THE SPEND ON INFRASTRUCTURE GOING FORWARD JUST TO PUMP THE ECONOMY SO WE'RE PRETTY PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN GLOBALLY AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME DELAYS HERE JUST ON GETTING THINGS GOING BUT WE THINK WE'RE GOOD TH I THINK YOU'VE SEEN THE STATISTICS TOO BOTH IN NORTH AMERICA AND AROUND THE WORLD CHINA ASIA RESIDENTIAL STILL KEEPS GROWING STRONG SO I THINK WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE THERE COMMERCIAL COULD BE SLIGHTLY SLOWER JUST YOU KNOW YOU'VE SEEN THE RETAIL NEWS YOU KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME RECONSIDERATION ON OFFICE SPACE ON WHAT YOU REALLY NEED FOR OFFICE SPACE MOVING FORWARD SO I WOULD SAY COMMERCIAL IS PROBABLY THE PLACE WHERE WE MIGHT AND THE RESIDENTIAL WILL OFFSET THAT AND IN FACT WE GET VERY GOOD MARGIN ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE'LL PROBABLY GET A MARGIN MIX THAT'LL OFFSET ANY CLIMATE ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE IF THERE IS ONE MOVING FORWARD ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR THAN ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME THIS CONCLUDES OUR QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION THANK YOU NOW TURN IT BACK TO BETSY POWELL FOR CLOSING REMARKS THANK YOU KATIE WE APPRECIATE YOUR HELP TODAY AND THANK YOU ALL FOR ATTENDING THE CONFERENCE HAS NOW CONCLUDED THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING TODAY'S PRESENTATION YOU MAY NOW DISCONNECT"

OPERATIONS ACHIEVING OUR STRONG SECOND QUARTER RESULTS IN THE FACE OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED OIL PRICE COLLAPSE AND DIFFICULT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IS EVIDENCE OF THE RESILIENCY OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND THE SOLID COMMITMENT OF OUR PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THESE TRYING TIMES WE HAVE WORKED TO QUICKLY ADJUST TO THE RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS AND ALIGN OUR COSTS WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY AS WELL AS PRESERVE OUR STRENGTHS AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED LAST QUARTER AND IN UPDATES ALONG THE WAY STATING WE WOULD BE FREE CASHFLOW POSITIVE FROM THE SECOND QUARTER ON FOR 2020 WE HAD SIGNIFICANT FREE CASHFLOW OF $35 MILLION IN THIS QUARTER THIS WAS DRIVEN BY SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING LIMITED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE QUARTER AS WE COMPLETED OUR DRILLING AND COMPLETION PROGRAM FOR THE YEAR STRONG HEDGE POSITIONS THAT DELIVERED OVER $29 MILLION OF REALIZATION AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OPERATING COSTS PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF OUR MAY SHUT-IN AND CURTAILMENT PROGRAM BUT ALSO SUSTAINABLE REDUCTIONS INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF OUR SHUT-IN PROGRAM OUR AVERAGE DAILY SALES VOLUME IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS 13,555 BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT OR BOE PER DAY EVEN WITH REDUCED VOLUMES AND A 44% DROP IN AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE PER BOE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OUR COST MANAGEMENT EFFORTS COMBINED WITH THE STRONG HEDGE POSITION ALLOWED US TO GENERATE HIGHER QUARTER OVER QUARTER ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED EBITAX I SUSPECT WE ARE ONE OF A VERY SMALL GROUP OF OUR PEERS WHO CAN SAY THAT WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL FREE CASHFLOW THROUGHOUT THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN A DECREASING DEBT BALANCE AND HELP US ACHIEVE OUR TARGET OF BEING BELOW ONE TIMES DEBT TO EBITAX FOR THE YEAR AS WE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IN RESPONSE TO THE SHARP DECLINE IN OIL PRICES IN APRIL AND VERY LOW FORECASTED MAY OIL PRICES WE MADE THE DECISION IN LATE APRIL TO SHUT IN A LARGE MAJORITY OF OUR OPERATED PRODUCTION FOR THE MONTH OF MAY WHICH RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY 60% OF OUR TOTAL NET PRODUCTION BEING SHUT IN DURING MAY WITH A FORECAST OF SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED JUNE OIL PRICES WHICH ULTIMATELY WERE MORE THAN DOUBLE OUR APRIL AND MAY OIL PRICE REALIZATIONS WE RETURNED TO FULL PRODUCTION IN JUNE WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL QUARTER IN FOCUSING ON COST REDUCTIONS WHICH SAW US REDUCE TOTAL LEAS OPERATING EXPENSE OR LOE IN THE SECOND QUARTER BY 40% FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER DESPITE REDUCED PRODUCTION VOLUMES DUE TO OUR SHUT-IN PROGRAM IN MAY OUR TEAM'S CONTINUED FOCUS ON COST REDUCTION RESULTED IN A 30% DECREASE IN LOE PER BOE IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO $4.53 VERSUS $6.51 IN THE FIRST QUARTER THIS WAS THE MAJOR DRIVER OF THE OVERALL 33% REDUCTION IN ALL-IN CASH COST DURING THE QUARTER ON A PER UNIT BASIS OUR ALL-IN CASH COST WENT FROM NEAR $13 PER BOE IN THE FIRST QUARTER TO NEAR $10 PER BOE IN THE SECOND QUARTER FOR A TOTAL OF 22 22% REDUCTION THIS IS ALL-IN CASH COST FOLKS WHICH INCLUDES OPERATING COSTS CORPORATE G&A COSTS AND ALL OF OUR INTEREST COSTS ON OUR DEBT TO DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO HOW WE ACHIEVED THE 40% DECREASE IN LOE LET MET OUTLINE SOME OF THE KEY FACTORS FIRST AS MUCH OF OUR UH PEERS HAVE DONE WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN NEGOTIATING PRICE REDUCTIONS WITH VENDORS ACROSS THE BROAD RANGE OF OUR LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES FROM CHEMICALS TO MAINTENANCE RIGS SALTWATER DISPOSAL CONTRACTS AND COMPRESSION COSTS SECOND WE ARE BENEFITING FROM OUR LONGTERM PRACTICE OF SPENDING A LITTLE MORE MONEY AS WE GO REPAIRING WELLS FACILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT TO REDUCE FREQUENCY OF MAINTENANCE WHICH IS RESULTING IN A CONTINUED DECREASE IN NON-ROUTINE LOE REPAIR NEEDS THIRD WORKOVER REPAIRS HAVE TRENDED DOWN RESULTING FROM OUR OPTIMIZATION OF LIFT METHODS CHEMICAL PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS AND GENERAL APPROACH OF FIXING THINGS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME THE LIMITED OFFSET FRACK ACTIVITY ALSO REDUCED FRACK HIT RELATED WORKOVER EXPENSES FOURTH WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE UTILITY COMPANIES TO PERFORM ELECTRICAL UPGRADES SOONER THAN SCHEDULED WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO ELIMINATE GENER- GENERATOR USAGE ON SOME OF OUR NEWER LOCATIONS LASTLY WITH LIMITED DRILLING AND COMPLETION ACTIVITY WE HAVE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO REFOCUS OUR FIELD EMPLOYEES TOWARDS LEASE MAINTENANCE WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO REDUCE CONTRACTOR LABOR ALL OF THESE ITEMS AND MANY OTHER SUBTLETIES OF OPERATING WERE IN PROGRESS AS OUR TEAM HAS A HISTORY OF CONTINUALLY DRIVING DOWN COSTS WE WILL REMAIN FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO REDUCE COSTS ACROSS THE BOARD AS WE EXPECT THE OIL PRICE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE OBSERVED SINCE LATE 2014 INCLUDING INCREASED VOLATILITY TO PERSIST WHICH ONLY STRESSES THE NEED TO STRUCTURE OUR BUSINESS TO BE PROFITABLE ACROSS A MUCH LOWER OIL PRICE RANGE I'D REALLY LIKE TO COMMEND OUR OPERATIONS TEAM WHICH DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF BOTH SHUTTING IN PRODUCTION IN MAY AND BRINGING PRODUCTION BACK FULLY ONLINE IN JUNE WHILE ALSO ACHIEVING THESE COST REDUCTIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER AND OUR TEAM'S HISTORY WE HAD TO TELL OUR GUYS TO PRODUCE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE EVERY SINGLE DAY WE EXECUTED THIS SHUT-IN OPERATION AND OUR FIELD PERSONNEL DID A GREAT JOB OF EFFICIENTLY RETURNING WELLS TO PRODUCTION WITH LITTLE TO NO INCREMENTAL EXPENSE AND NO ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR PRODUCERS OUR WELLS HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR PREVIOUS VOLUMES WITH SOME WELLS PRODUCING AT INCREASED RATES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME PLUS THE THREE WELLS IN SOUTHEAST REAGAN COUNTY THAT WERE BROUGHT ONLINE IN APRIL PRIOR TO THE CURTAILMENT AND WERE SHUT IN DURING MAY ARE NOW BACK ONLINE AND HAVE FULLY CLEANED UP AND ARE PERFERM- PERFORMING WELL VERSUS THE TIDE CURVE I MENTIONED WE CONCLUDED OUR 2020 DRILLING PROGRAM IN LATE MAY AND RELEASED OUR UH CONTRACTED RIG OPERATING IN THE MID- MIDLAND BASIN SO OUR PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE MINIMAL FOR THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR GIVEN THAT OUR PROGRAM ENDED WITH 11 WELLS DRILLED BUT NOT COMPLETED AND WITH OUR AMPLE LIQUIDITY WE HAVE OPTIONALITY ON COMPLETION TIMING DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS WITH PRODUCTION RETURNED TO FULL CAPACITY WE HAVE ENTERED THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR WITH EXPECTATIONS UH FOR NO FURTHER DRILLING OR COMPLETION ACTIVITIES THIS YEAR WE CAN MAINTAIN APPROXIMATELY FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR PRODUCTION IN 2020 COMPARED TO 2019 AS A REMINDER WE RECENTLY UPDATED OUR 2020 FULL YEAR PRODUCTION GUIDANCE RANGING FROM 13,000 TO 14,000 BOE PER DAY WHICH COMPARES TO 2019'S FULL YEAR AVERAGE OF 13,429 BOE PER DAY FURTHER WITH OUR 11 DRILLED BUT UNCOMPLETED WELLS IN UPTON COUNTY WE INTEND TO CAREFULLY MONITOR COMMODITY PRICING APPROPRIATE SERVICE AVAILABILITY AND SERVICE COST CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE IF IT MAKES SENSE TO BRING IN A COMPLETION CREW LATER THIS YEAR OR WAIT UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR DEPENDING ON THE TIMING WE ANTICIPATE THE COMPLETION OF THOSE 11 WELLS WOULD ENABLE US TO MAINTAIN SIMILAR YEAR OVER YEAR PRODUCTION FOR 2021 WITH ONLY A MODEST CAPITAL PROGRAM FOR THE COMPLETION WHICH WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE AT AROUND $30 MILLION WITH THAT OVERVIEW I'LL NOW TURN THE CALL OVER TO MARK TO REVIEW THE FINANCIALS HAVE AT IT MARK THANK YOU ROBERT AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST TWO CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS I'D LIKE TO FIRST DISCUSS OUR CASH POSITION AND OUR BALANCE SHEET AS ROBERT MENTIONED WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE ACHIEVED OUR GOAL OF GENERATING SUBSTANTIAL FREE CASHFLOW IN THE QUARTER WITH A TOTAL OF 35.1 MILLION OF FREE CASHFLOW AS WE REFERENCED IN OUR FIRST QUARTER CALL OUR PLAN WAS FIRST TO REDUCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT WHICH WE CALCULATE EXCLUDING DERIVATIVES UH AND WE'RE ABLE TO DO THIS BY WELL OVER $50 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND THEN TO BEGIN TO PAY DOWN OUR REVOLVER DEBT THE <INAUDIBLE> UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURE REVOLVING FACILITY WHICH WAS SET IN LATE MARCH REMAINS UNCHANGED AT $275 MILLION AND SHOULD REMAIN THERE UNTIL OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED FALL REDETERMINATION PROCESS OUR OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON THE CREDIT FACILITY AT QUARTER END TOTALS 168.6 MILLION AND WE HAD 1.8 MILLION IN CASH WITH 106.4 MILLION OF UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY THAT GAVE US APPROXIMATELY 108 MILLION OF LIQUIDITY AT QUARTER END I WOULD NOTE THAT AS OF JULY 31ST WE HAVE PAID DOWN OUR REVOLVER BY $14.3 MILLION COMPARED TO QUARTER END REDUCING OUR DEBT BALANCE NOW TO ABOUT 153 154.3 MILLION AND WE DO EXPECT TO APPLY FREE CASHFLOW THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR PRIMARILY TO PAY DOWN THE REVOLVER DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $3.2 MILLION AND YEAR TO DATE WE HAVE SPENT $45 MILLION OF OUR ANNUAL 2020 CAPITAL BUDGET OF 50 TO $60 MILLION AS ROBERT MENTIONED WE CONCLUDED OUR 2020 DRILLING PROGRAM IN MAY SO WE ANTICIPATE MINIMAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR AND WILL LIKELY END UP TOWARDS THE LOW END OF OUR GUIDANCE RANGE NOW LOOKING AT OUR SECOND QUARTER INCOME STATEMENT STARTING WITH THE TOP LINE REVENUES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 WERE $21.7 MILLION COMPARED TO $45.1 MILLION THE FIRST QUARTER THE DECLINE WAS DRIVEN BY A 54% DECREASE IN OIL REVENUES TO $18.9 MILLION WHICH MADE UP ABOUT 87% OF TOTAL REVENUES AND <UNK> REVENUES FELL BY 44% WHILE NATURAL GAS REVENUES ROSE SLIGHTLY OUR AVERAGE PRICE IN THE SECOND QUARTER FOR ALL THREE COMMODITIES WAS $17.56 PER BARREL OF OIL EQUIVALENT WHICH WAS DOWN BY NEARLY HALF OF OUR AVERAGE PRICE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER BY COMMODITY OUR AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE FOR CRUDE OIL IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS $23.56 PER BARREL NATURAL GAS A- AVERAGED 83 CENTS PER MCF AND NGLS AVERAGED $8.10 BER BARREL OF OIL EQUIVALENT FROM A PRODUCTION STANDPOINT OUR SECOND QUARTER SALES VOLUMES AVERAGED 13,555 BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT PER DAY WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF 65% OIL 18% NATURAL GAS AND 17% NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AS HIGHLIGHTED THIS DOES INCLUDE HAVING CURTAILED ABOUT 60% OF TOTAL PRODUCTION IN MAY ON THE EXPENSE SIDE AS ROBERT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED WE DID DRIVE DOWN OUR ALL-IN CA- COSTS FROM 12.92 PER BOE IN THE FIRST QUARTER TO $10.11 PER BOE IN THE SECOND QUARTER WE ACHIEVED THIS THROUGH NEARLY $2 PER BOE REDUCTION IN OUR LEASE OPERATING EXPENSE TO $4.52 PER BOE FOR THE QUARTER ON THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE WE REDUCED OUR ABSOLUTE CASH G&A- G&A EXPENSE BY ABOUT 7% VERSUS THE FIRST QUARTER WHICH RESULTED IN PER UNIT CASH G&A EXPENSE OF $3.34 PER BOE AS YOU KNOW WE REDUCED OUR CASH G&A GUIDANCE IN MAY TO 15.5 TO $16.5 MILLION FOR THE FULL YEAR AND EXPECT TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE WHICH AT THE BOTTOM END IS A 25% REDUCTION VERSUS OUR INITIAL FULL YEAR PLAN IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE SAVINGS WE ARTICULATED LAST QUARTER WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AND HAVE HAD SUCCESS IN REDUCING EXPENSES REALLY ANY AND EVERYWHERE INCLUDING REDUCED USAGE OF THIRD PAR UH THIRD PARTY CONSULTANTS REDUCING VENDOR RATES AND MANAGING OUR COSTS TIGHTLY FROM AN INCOME STANDPOINT WE RECOR- WE REPORTED GAAP NET LOSS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF $35.9 MILLION OR 55 CENTS PER SHARE WHICH INCLUDED A PRE TAX UNREALIZED LOSS OF $50 MILLION ON OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS OUR ADJUSTED NET INCOME WAS $4.8 MILLION OR 20 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE ADJUSTABLE DILUTED SHARE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WE REPORTED ADJUSTED EBITAX OF 39.8 MILLION THE SECOND QUARTER WHICH AS ROBERT MENTIONED IS ACTUALLY AN INCREASE QUARTER OVER QUARTER NOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TAKE A MINUTE TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR COMMODITY HEDGE RESULTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AS HIGHLIGHTED WE REALIZED $29.4 MILLION GAIN ON OUR COMMODITY HEDGES FOR THE QUARTER THIS WAS LARGELY REFLECTIVE OF OUR HEDGE POSITION ENTERING THE QUARTER AND OUR LOCKING IN SOME REALLY NICE GAINS ON HEDGES WHEN WE MADE THE DECISION TO CURTAIL PRODUCTION AND UH DID THAT WHEN SECOND QUARTER NIMAX PRICES WERE ABOUT AT THEIR LOWEST POINT THE HEDGE REALIZATIONS ALSO INCLUDE A GAIN OF ABOUT $5.7 MILLION FROM AN UNWIND OF 1,000 BARRELS OF OIL A DAY FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2020 WE REMAIN REALLY WELL HEDGED FOR THE BALANCE TO THE YEAR WITH AN AVERAGE OF 6,500 BARRELS PER DAY OF OIL SWAPPED AT A NIMEX PRICE OF $58.35 STEPPING DOWN TO 4,000 BARRELS A DAY FOR FULL YEAR 2021 AT A NIMEX PRICE OF $55.16 PER BARREL WITH BASIC HEDGES IN PLACE ON SIMILAR VOLUMES ON THE NATURAL GAS SIDE WE HAVE 7,000 NMBTU PER DAY UH SWAPPED AT A HENRY HUB PRICE OF $2.85 FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR STEPPING UP TO 8,000 NMBTUS PER DAY AT A PRICE OF $2.71 FOR FULL YEAR 2021 WITH BASIC HEDGES IN PLACE ON THE SAME VOLUMES HEDGING REMAINS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STRATEGY AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE LAYERING ON HEDGES AS WE GET MORE VISIBILITY AROUND THE AZUMP- A- RESUMPTION OF OUR DRILLING AND COMPLETION ACTIVITY GOING FORWARD STEPPING BACK AND LOOKING AT OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR FULL YEAR 2020 WE REINSTATED OUR PRODUCTION GUIDANCE IN JULY AND WE'VE REINSTATED LOE IN PRODUCTION AND <INAUDIBLE> LOWER IMPACT GUIDANCE WITH OUR EARNINGS RELEASED YESTERDAY OUR REINSTATED PRODUCTION <INAUDIBLE> LOWER IMPACT GUIDANCE OF 6R- OF 6.25% TO 7.25% IS IDENTICAL TO WHAT IT WAS AT THE ONSET OF OUR 2020 GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN JANUARY AS IS THE CASE FOR OUR REINSTATED LOE GUIDANCE OF 5.15 TO $6 PER BOE ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HAD RECENT SUSTAINABLE LOE REDUCTIONS AND CAME IN WELL BELOW THIS RANGE IN THE SECOND QUARTER WITHOUT THE ADVANTAGE OF BRINGING ON NEW WELLS WE HAVE KEPT OUR GUIDANCE RANGE WHERE IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WHEN WE ANTICIPATED BRINGING 16 NEW WELLS ONLINE WITH THAT I'LL TURN BACK OVER THE ROBERT UH THANK YOU MARK WE ARE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS AND CONFIDENT IN A BRIGHT FUTURE UH FOR EARTHSTONE WHILE WE ARE SORRY TO SEE OUR INDUSTRY IN SUCH DISTRESS IT IS CREATING MORE M&A OPPORTUNITIES THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN QUITE SOME TIME WE'RE ACTIVELY EVALUATING A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS AND EXPECT TO HAVE MORE TO CONSIDER THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE YEAR AS PRICES REMAIN LOW AND STRESS SITUATIONS CONTINUE TO INCREASE WE BELIEVE THAT OUR STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND TRACK RECORD AS A SUCCESSFUL CONSOLIDATOR POSITIONS US WELL TO INCREASE THE SCALE

JUST MEANT TO BE INSTRUCTIVE OR IS THAT ACTUALLY HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE 2021 PLAN UM AS WE SAID HERE TODAY UH YES <LAUGH> A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH BRAD UM YOU KNOW IT DOES DEPEND ON WHERE COMMODITY PRICES HEAD TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR WHETHER WE WANNA PICK UP A RIG OR NOT UM I THINK WE'VE BEEN PRETTY VOCAL OR CONSISTENT ABOUT OUR MESSAGE THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED WE MEED MID 45 TO $50 OIL TO WANNA GO BACK TO SPENDING LARGE CAPITAL DOLLARS UM BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT UH AT SOME POINT END OF THIS YEAR EARLY NEXT YEAR COMPLETING THOSE WELLS WILL UM ALLOW US TO MAIN PRODUCTION FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR OKAY GOT IT UM AND THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU MADE THE COMMENT ON M&A UH CAN YOU GO INTO A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT SORT OF WHAT OPPORTUNITIES YOU'RE SEEING AND A- ALSO ANY THOUGHTS YOU HAVE ABOUT AN ABILITY TO FUND THEM UM THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE INCREASING UM AND SIZE IS VARIABLE FROM SMALL TO QUITE LARGE AS YOU'VE SEEN YOU KNOW DISTRESSED AND BANKRUPT COMPANIES I THINK ALL OF THIS WILL RESULT IN FURTHER UM OPPORTUNITIES IN TERMS OF LARGER COMPANIES SELLING ASSETS UM IT- IT IS DIFFICULT WITH NO PUBLIC EQUITY AND FOR THAT MATTER DEBT MARKETS OPEN OR OPEN ONLY TO A VERY FEW MAYBE WE'RE ONE OF THOSE FEW

LINE OF NEAL DINGMANN WITH TRUIST SECURITIES PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION MORNING ALL ROBERT UM FIRST QUESTION ON THE ALSO ON THAT SAME LINE ON ' 21 EXPECTATIONS AND I'M JUST WONDERING YOU KNOW WHILE I REALIZE THIS PLAN REALLY I THINK YOU KNOW AT LEAST THE ONES YOU'VE JUST INITIAL LAID OUT ASSUMES NO NEW WELLS REALLY WHAT'S- WHAT I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT'S DRIVING THIS LOW COST OR ANOTHER WAY MAYBE TO ASK IS HOW YOU THINK ABOUT MAINTENANCE CAPEX YOU KNOW GIVEN JUST SO LOW BECAUSE UM YOU KNOW IF I RECALL I THOUGHT FRANK ALREADY HAD YOU ALL CANCEL ALL THOSE COUNTRY CLUB AND OTHER MEMBERSHIPS I JUST KNOW WHAT ELSE IS THERE <LAUGH> UH YES THERE'S NO COUNTRY CLUB MEMBERSHIPS UH UP HERE UM YOU KNOW E- E- THE- THE- THE 11 WELLS WE HAVE ARE IN REALLY GOOD AREAS AND THEY UH THEY WILL HELP US KEEP PRODUCTION RELATIVELY FLAT AT $30 MILLION NOW IS THAT SUSTAINABLE ABSOLUTELY NOT UM YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE A RELATIVELY HIGH DECLINE RATE UH AND IT DOES DEPEND ON WHEN WE BROUGHT THOSE WELLS ONLINE IF WE WAITED TILL THE VERY END OF ' 21 UM WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING PRODUCTION RELATIVELY FLAT UM I- IF WE BROUGHT THEM ON TODAY YOU KNOW WE MIGHT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'D GET ALL THIS FLUSH PRODUCTION FROM THESE NEW WELLS SO UM YOU KNOW MAINTENANCE UH EH TO MAINTAIN YOU KNOW 13,000 BOE A DAY KINDA LEVEL LONGER TERM WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A RIG RUNNING AND A ONE RIG PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD EXACTLY COST US TODAY BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING IS 120 MILLION TO MAYBE 140 MILLION DEPENDING ON LATERAL LENGTH AND WORKING INTEREST AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST A VERY PRELIMINARY IF THE WORLD STAYS THE SAME AND WE'RE AT 40-ISH LOW $40 ENVIRONMENT AND WE'RE NOT SPENDING ANY DRILLING CAPITAL UM THESE 11 DUCTS WILL HELP US KEEP PRODUCTION FLAT OKAY AND THEN YOU KINDA HIT ON MY LAST ONE JUST ON HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT SORT OF PDP DECLINE YOU KNOW ON A ON- ON- ON A <INAUDIBLE> NOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN SLOWING A BIT IS THAT- THAT TOO YOU KNOW GONNA-

ON HOW YOU KNOW KIND OF YOUR THINKING ABOUT THAT IN ' 21 ON BROADER TERMS UH YEAH I THINK WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENT IN TELLING EVERYONE THAT OUR SORT OF BASE DECLINE STARTING TODAY WE'LL CALL IT YOU KNOW IS ABOUT 30% IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN GETS INTO THE MID UH MAYBE 26 OR 27% THE NEXT YEAR AND THEN LOW 20S OR HIGH TEENS AFTER THAT AND SO UH YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT'S CHANGED ANY UH AND IF WE DIDN'T SPEND ANY CAPITAL THEN YOU CAN KIND OF FORECAST WHAT OUR BLOWDOWN UM PRODUCTION WOULD LOOK LIKE UH EVEN IF WE DIDN'T DO THOSE 11 WELLS BUT AGAIN WITH THOSE 11 WELLS IT'LL HELP KEEP ' 21 FLAT AND THEN GOING FORWARD IN ' 22 AND BEYOND IT'S ALL GONNA DEPEND ON PRICE VERY GOOD THANKS GUYS THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF JEFF GRAMPP WITH NORTHLAND CAPITAL MARKETS PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION HI GUYS UM I WAS WONDERING UH ROBERT OR- OR MAYBE MARK HOW IMPORTANT TO YOU GUYS ARE YOU STAYING FREE CASHFLOW POSITIVE IN THE CONTEXT OF EVALUATING UM YOU KNOW WHETHER TO GO AFTER THE- THE DUCTS AND- AND POTENTIALLY DRILLING RIG AT SOME POINT IN TIME WOULD YOU VIEW THAT AS- AS KIND OF A UM YOU KNOW A- A MUST IF YOU WILL OR WOULD YOU GUYS HAVE ANY LEVEL OF COMFORT WITH ANY YOU KNOW NEAR MEDIUM TERM OUTSPEND UH IF IT HELPS YOU KNOW IF THE RETURNS ARE GOOD AND IF IT HELPS KINDA YOU KNOW JUMPSTART A RETURN TO GROWTH SURE M- MAYBE I'LL- I'LL TRY TO ANSWER THAT ONE THEN ROBERT CAN ADD ON IF HE WANTS TO Y- YOU KNOW WE KEEP THINGS PRETTY SIMPLE AT THE END THE DAY WE FEEL LIKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MAKE GOOD INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS AT THE WELL HEAD UM A- AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE QUICK TO- TO PUT THE RIG DOWN AND STOP COMPLETING IN MARCH AND APRIL IS BECAUSE THE ECONOMICS DIDN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE THEN DO THE DUCTS MAKE SENSE RIGHT NOW I MEAN ECONOMICALLY YOU DEFINITELY COULD GO COMPLETE THE DUCTS RIGHT NOW AND UH HAVE PRETTY NICE UH RRS FOR THE INCREMENTAL COST TO COMPLETE THEM UM I- I- IN TERMS OF ARE WE SO FOCUSED ON QUARTER TO QUARTER YEAR TO YEAR FREE CA- FREE CASHFLOW THAT WE WON'T OUTSPEND NO WE'RE NOT AND- AND FROM A PRACTICAL MATTER AND WE'RE JUST GONNA BE FREE CASHFLOW POSITIVE THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR KIND OF IRRESPECTIVE OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS WITH THE PRICES IF ALL WE'RE DOING IS COMPLETING THE DUCTS UM A- AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW WE- WE DO ANTICIPATE PICKING THE RIG BACK UP AND UH YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIT OF A- A OBVIOUSLY A LAG THERE BETWEEN THE COST YOU EXPEND TO DRILLING THE COMPLETE WELLS VERSUS THE CASHFLOW YOU KNOW DOES THAT MEAN OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR WE'RE NOT FREE CASHFLOW POSITIVE NO NOT NECESSARILY UM BUT WE'RE NOT SO FIXATED ON CHECKING THAT BOX EVERY QUARTER WE WANNA MAKE SMART ECONOMIC DECISIONS AT THE WELL HEAD THAT WILL FLOW INTO THE BIGGER PICTURE UH AND HAVING SOME OUTSPEND FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME UM YEAH

TRYING TO- TO BE AS GOOD A STEWARDS AS WE CAN OF- OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING UM AT THE WELL HEADS YEAH THE ONLY I'LL ADD JEFF IS I THINK WE CAN RUN A ONE RIG PROGRAM WITH THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION AND CASHFLOW WE HAVE TODAY AND BE CASHFLOW NEUTRAL ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A JUMP STARTING THE PROGRAM WE'RE GONNA BE CASHFLOW NEGATIVE FOR A- A PERIOD OF TIME BUT I THINK LONGER TERM OVER A YEAR TIMEFRAME UH A- AGAIN DEPENDING ON WHAT THE PRICE IS SURE UNDERSTOOD APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS MY FOLLOW-UP UM I THINK I STILL HAVE UM YOU KNOW A- A DECENT AMOUNT OF- OF NON-OP EXPOSURE UH IN THE PERMIAN ARE YOU GUYS SEEING ANY ACTIVITY LEVELS THERE AND MORE ON THE LAND SIDE UM IS THERE ANY TRACTION OR CONVERSATIONS UH ON SWAPPING ANY OF THAT OUT TO INCREASE THE OPERATION

YEAR AND THE CALL WE HAD UH YOU KNOW RELATED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS AND FULL YEAR UM WE HAD A ONE RIG PROGRAM WE WERE GONNA AVERAGE FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR A TINY BIT OF FREE CASHFLOW UM AND THOSE 11 WELLS WOULD'VE BEEN COMPLETED UH I DON'T KNOW BY KNOW I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT PRETTY DARN CLOSE SO UM I'D SAY IT'S A FALLOUT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE UH AND JUST BEING VERY CONSERVATIVE WITH OUR

WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS- IS MORE IMPORTANT THEN FOR US TO USE AS WE UM YOU KNOW JUST- JUST TRY TO MODEL THAT WE ALWAYS USE THE CRUDE CASH FROM A CALCULATION STANDPOINT 'CAUSE NOT ALL THE BILLS NECESSARILY HAVE HIT BUT WE KNOW WHAT GENERALLY THEY ARE OH OKAY IT'S IN THE PRESENTATION ON THE LAST PAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OKAY SO- SO REAL OH AND UM ONE OTHER THING I UM AND I- I JUST DON'T

ADJUSTED EBITAX IS THE- THE BEST PROXY FOR YOUR REALLY SORT OF CASHFLOW FOR THE PERIOD UH WE BACK OUT INTEREST EXPENSE AND THEN WE BACK OUT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ACTIVITY DURING THAT PERIOD NOW WHEN YOU'RE STOPPING OR STARTING THERE IS GONNA BE A BIGGER DELTA BETWEEN- RIGHT CALCULATING FREE CASHFLOW THE WAY WE DO VERSUS IF YOU'RE USING A CASH CAPEX NUMBER UM YOU KNOW THE- THE SECOND QUARTER WAS VERY ATYPICAL FROM THE STANDPOINT OF H- HERE WE'RE REPORTING 35 MILLION OF- OF FREE CASHFLOW YEAH OUR DEBT BALANCE WENT UP UM AND THE- THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE AND OF COURSE THIS IS TIED TO THE CASH CAPEX IT'S JUST THE TIME OF THE PAYMENTS YOU KNOW WE REDUCED THE- THE NEGATIVE WORKING CA- THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT BY ABOUT 50 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER UH NOW WE'RE TO A POINT WHERE THAT WORKING DEFICIT WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT IS PRETTY LOW AND PROBABLY WON'T FLUCTUATE A WHOLE BUNCH ONE WAY OR THE OTHER UNTIL WE PICK ACTIVITY BACK UP UH AT WHICH POINT YOU'D EXPECT UH YOU KNOW IF YOU START COMPLETIONS AND DRILLING AGAIN YOU START GETTING BILLED BUT THERE'S SOME LAG BETWEEN THE ACTIVITY AND WHEN YOU GET THE BILLS AND WHEN YOU PAY THEM UM SO VERY ATYPICAL QUARTER YEAH A- AS WE MENTIONED IN THE PRESS RELEASE YOU KNOW WE HAD ABOUT 169 MILLION IN DEBT AT QUARTER END AND THE MONTH OF JULY WE- WE PAID DOWN A LITTLE MORE THAN 14 UM THAT'S NOT THE- THE RUN RIGHT BY THE WAY IT'S NOT 14 <INAUDIBLE> QUARTER THAT WAS HIGH BECAUSE OF TIMING BUT WE DO EXPECT UM I MEAN REALLY EVERY MONTH THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE PAYING DOWN SOME DEBT UM WITHOUT ANY BIG CHANGES IN THE WORKING CAPITAL

SOLID COMMITMENT OF OUR PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THESE TRYING TIMES WE HAVE WORKED TO QUICKLY ADJUST TO THE RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS AND ALLIGN OUR COSTS WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY AS WELL AS PRESERVE OUR STRENGTHS AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED LAST QUARTER AND IN UPDATES ALONG THE WAY STATING WE WOULD BE FREE CASH FLOW POSITIVE FROM THE SECOND QUARTER ON FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WE HAD SIGNIFICANT FREE CASH FLOW OF THIR LIMITED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE QUARTER AS WE COMPLETED OUR DRILLING AND COMPLETION PROGRAM FOR THE YEAR STRONG HEDGED POSITION THAT DELIVERED OVER TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF REALIZATIONS AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OPERATING COSTS PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF OUR MAY SHUT IN AND CONTAINMENT PROGRAM BUT ALSO SUSTAINABLE REDUCTIONS INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF OUR SHUT IN PROGRAM OUR AVERAGE DAILY SALES VOLUME IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS TH We expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the year, even with reduced volumes and a 44% drop in average realized price per BOE in the second quarter. Our cost management efforts, combined with our strong hedge position, allowed us to generate higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA. I suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that. WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN A DECREASING DEBT BALANCE AND HELP US ACHIEVE OUR TARGET OF BEING BELOW ONE TIMES DEBT TO EBITDA FOR THE YEAR AS WE PREVIOUSLY PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IN RESPONSE TO THE SHARP DROP IN OIL PRICES IN APRIL AND VERY LOW FORECASTED MAY OIL PRICES WE NEED WE MADE THE DECISION IN LATE APRIL TO SHUT DOWN THE LARGE MAJORITY OF OUR OPERATED PRODUCTION FOR THE MONTH OF MAY WHICH RESULTED IN APPROXIMATE We have significantly improved June oil prices which ultimately were more than double our April and May oil price realizations. We return to full production in June. We had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions which saw us reduce total lease operating expense or LOE in the second quarter by forty percent from the prior quarter. Despite reduced production volumes due to our shut-in program in May, our teams continued to focus on cost reduction. The reduction resulted in a 30% decrease in LOE per BOE in the second quarter to $4.53 compared to $6.51 in the first quarter. This was the major driver of the overall 30% reduction in all-in cash costs during the quarter. On a per unit basis, our all-in cash costs went from near $11 per BOE in the first quarter to near $10 per BOE in the second quarter. Twenty two twenty two percent reduction this is all in cash costs folks which includes operating costs corporate g and a costs and all of our interest costs on our debt to dive a little deeper into how we achieved the forty percent decrease in l o e let me outline some of the key factors first as much of our peers have done we were successful in negotiating price reductions with vendors across the broad range of our lease operating expenses from chemicals To maintenance rigs, saltwater disposal contracts, and compression costs. Second, we are benefiting from our long-term practice of spending a little more money as we go repairing wells, facilities, and associated equipment to reduce frequency of maintenance which is resulting in a continued decrease in non-routine l o e repair needs. Third, workover repairs have trended down, resulting from our optimization of lift methods and chemicals. Program improvements and general approach of fixing things right the first time. The limited offset frack activity also reduced frack hit related workover expenses. Fourth, we have been successful in getting utility companies to perform electrical upgrades sooner than scheduled which has allowed us to eliminate generator generator usage on some of our newer locations. Lastly, with limited drilling and completion activity we have also been able to refocus. Focus our field employees towards least maintenance which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor. All of these items and many other subtleties of operating were in progress as our team has a history of continuously driving down costs. We will remain focused on continuing to reduce costs across the board as we expect the oil price environment that we have observed since late 2014 including increased volatility to persist which only stresses the need to structure our business to be. PROFITABLE ACROSS A MUCH LOWER OIL PRICE RANGE I'D REALLY LIKE TO COMMEND OUR OPERATIONS TEAM WHICH DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF BOTH SHUTTING IN PRODUCTION IN MAY AND BRINGING PRODUCTION BACK FULLY ONLINE IN JUNE WHILE ALSO ACHIEVING THESE COST REDUCTIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER AND OUR TEAM'S HISTORY WE HAD TO TELL OUR GUYS TO PRODUCE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE EVERY SINGLE DAY WE EXECUTED THIS SHUT IN OPERATIONS AND OUR FIELD P With little to no incremental expense and no adverse effects on our producers, our wells have returned to their previous volumes with some wells producing at increased rates for a period of time. Plus, the three wells in Southeast Regan County that were brought online in April prior to the curtailments and were shut in during May are now back online and have fully cleaned up and are performing well versus the type curve. I mentioned we completed our twenty twenty drilling program. In late May and released our contracted rig operating in the midland basin so our planned capital expenditures are minimal for the balance of the year given that our program ended with eleven wells drilled but not completed and with our ample liquidity we have optionality on completion timing depending on market conditions with production return to full capacity we have entered the second half of this year with expectations for no further drilling or COMPLETION ACTIVITY THIS YEAR WE CAN MAINTAIN APPROXIMATELY FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR PRODUCTION IN TWENTY TWENTY COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN AS A REMINDER WE RECENTLY UPDATED OUR TWENTY TWENTY FULL YEAR PRODUCTION GUIDANCE RANGING FROM THIRTEEN THOUSAND TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND B O E P ER DAY WHICH COMPARES TO TWENTY NINETEEN FULL YEAR AVERAGE OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY NINE B O E P ER DAY FURTHER WITH OUR PRICING, APPROPRIATE SERVICE AVAILABILITY, AND SERVICE COST CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE IF IT MAKES SENSE TO BRING IN A COMPLETION CREW LATER THIS YEAR OR WAIT UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR. DEPENDING ON THE TIMING, WE ANTICIPATE THE COMPLETION OF THOSE ELEVEN WELLS WOULD ENABLE US TO MAINTAIN SIMILAR YEAR-OVER-YEAR PRODUCTION FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE WITH ONLY A MODEST CAPITAL PROGRAM FOR THE COMPLETIONS WHICH WE CURRENTLY E REVIEW THE FINANCIALS HAVE AT IT MARK THANK YOU ROBERT AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST TWO CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS I'D LIKE TO FIRST DISCUSS OUR CASH POSITION AND OUR BALANCE SHEET AS ROBERT MENTIONED WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE ACHIEVED OUR GOAL OF GENERATING SUBSTANTIAL FREE CASH FLOW IN THE QUARTER WITH A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION OF FREE CASH FLOW AS WE REFERENCED IN OUR FIRST QUARTER CALL OUR PLAN WAS F AND THEN TO BEGIN TO PAY DOWN OUR REVOLVER DEBT THE BARRING BASED UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING FACILITY WHICH WAS SET IN LATE MARCH REMAINS UNCHANGED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND SHOULD REMAIN THERE UNTIL OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED FALL REDETERMINATION PROCESS OUR EXISTING BORROWINGS ON THE CREDIT FACILITY AT QUARTER ENDS HOLD A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION AND WE HAD ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN I would note that as of July 31st we had paid down our revolver by fourteen point four million dollars compared to quarter end reducing our debt balance now to about a hundred and fifty three a hundred and fifty four point three million and we do expect to apply free cash flow the remainder of the year primarily to pay down the revolver during the second quarter our capital expenditures totaled three point two million dollars and to date we have spent forty five million dollars of our annual twenty twenty capital budget of fifty to sixty million. $100 MILLION DOLLARS AS ROBERT MENTIONED WE CONCLUDED OUR TWENTY TWENTY DRILLING PROGRAM IN MAY SO WE ANTICIPATE MINIMAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR AND WILL LIKELY END UP TOWARD THE LOW END OF OUR GUIDED RANGE NOW LOOKING AT OUR SECOND QUARTER INCOME STATEMENT STARTING WITH THE TOP LINE REVENUE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY WERE TWENTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO FORTY FIVE P REVENUES AND N G L REVENUES FELL BY FORTY PERCENT WHILE NATURAL GAS REVENUES ROSE SLIGHTLY OUR AVERAGE PRICE IN THE SECOND QUARTER FOR ALL THREE COMMODITIES WAS SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY SIX CENTS PER BARREL OF OIL EQUIVALENT WHICH WAS DOWN BY NEARLY HALF OF OUR AVERAGE PRICE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER BY COMMODITY OUR AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE FOR CRUDE OIL IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS TWENTY THREE DOLLARS AND F From a production standpoint, our second quarter sales volumes averaged thirteen thousand five hundred fifty-five barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was comprised of sixty-five percent oil, eighteen percent natural gas, and seventeen percent natural gas liquids. As highlighted, this does include having curtailed about sixty percent of total production in May on the expense side, as Robert also highlighted we did drive down our all-in costs from twelve ninety-two per barrel in the first quarter. To ten dollars and eleven cents per boe in the second quarter. We achieved this by nearly two dollars per boe reduction in our lease operating expense to four dollars and fifty cents per boe for the quarter. On the general administrative side, we reduced our absolute cash g&a expense by about seven percent versus the first quarter, which resulted in per unit cash g&a expense of three dollars and thirty-four cents per boe. As you know, we reduced our cash g&a guidance in may to fifteen point five to sixty cents per boe. $2.5 million dollars for the full year and expect to be somewhere in that range which at the bottom end is a twenty five percent reduction versus our initial full year plan. In addition to some of the savings we articulated last quarter, we continue to focus on and have had success in reducing expenses, really any and everywhere, including reduced use of third party consultants, reducing vendor rates, and managing our costs tightly. From an income statement standpoint, we report a net loss of $35.9 million in the second quarter. DOLLARS OR FIFTY FIVE CENTS PER SHARE WHICH INCLUDED A PRETAX UNREALIZED LOSS OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS OUR ADJUSTED NET INCOME WAS TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OR TWENTY CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE ADJUSTED DILUTED SHARE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WE REPORTED ADJUSTED EBITDA OF THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER WHICH IS ACTUALLY AN INCREASED QUARTER HEDGES FOR THE QUARTER THIS IS LARGELY REFLECTIVE OF OUR HEDGE POSITION ENTERING THE QUARTER AND ARE LOCKING IN SOME REALLY NICE GAINS ON HEDGES WHEN WE MADE THE DECISION TO GARCIA PRODUCTIONS AND DID THAT WHEN SECOND QUARTER NIAX PRICES WERE ABOUT AT THE LOWEST POINT THE HEDGE REDUCTIONS ALSO INCLUDE A GAIN OF ABOUT FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM AN UNDERWRITE OF ONE THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL A DAY FOR THE SECOND HALF Imax price of fifty eight dollars and thirty five cents stepping down to four thousand barrels a day for four year twenty twenty one at an imax price of fifty five dollars and sixteen cents per barrel with basis hedges in place on similar volumes on the natural gas side we have seven thousand m btu per day of swaps at a henry hub price of two dollars and eighty five cents for the second half of this year stepping up to eight thousand m btu per day at a price of two dollars and seventy one cents for full year twenty twenty one with basis hedges in place on similar volumes on the natural gas side we have seven thousand m btu per day of swaps at a henry hub price of two dollars and eighty five cents for the second half of this year stepping up to eight thousand m b ONE WITH BASIC HEDGES IN PLACE ON THE SAME VOLUMES HEDGING REMAINS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STRATEGY AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE LAYERING OWNERSHIP HEDGES AS WE GET MORE VISIBILITY AROUND THE ASSUMPTION RESUMMPTION OF OUR DRILLING AND COMPLETION ACTIVITY GOING FORWARD STEPPING BACK AND LOOKING AT OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR FULL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY WE REESTABLISHED OUR PRODUCTION GUIDANCE IN JULY AND WE'VE SIX DOLLARS, SIX POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT IS IDENTICAL TO WHAT IT WAS AT THE ONSET OF OUR TWENTY TWO TWENTY GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN JANUARY AS IS THE CASE FOR OUR REINSTATED L O E GUIDANCE OF FIVE FIFTY TO SIX DOLLARS FOR B O E. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE RECENT SUSTAINABLE L O E GUIDANCE REDUCTIONS AND CAME IN WELL BELOW THIS RANGE IN THE SECOND QUARTER WITHOUT THE ADVANTAGE OF BRINGING ON NEW WE We are really pleased with the results and confident in a bright future for Erstone. While we are sorry to see our industry in such distress, it is creating more M&A opportunities than we have seen in quite some time. We are actively evaluating a number of situations and expect to have more to consider throughout the rest of the year as prices remain low and distressed situations continue to increase. We believe that our strong balance sheet and track record as a successful consolidator positions us well. Increase the scale of our company and add value to our shareholders. With that operator, we'll now open the floor for questions. Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Recognize the verbal communication and transcribe it into text. Speech:\n\nUm, you know, it does depend on where commodity prices head towards the end of the year, whether we want to pick up a rig or not. I think we've been pretty vocal or consistent about our message that, you know, we need we need mid forty five to fifty dollar oil to want to go back to spending large capital dollars but outside of that at some point, end of this year, early next year, completing those wells will allow us to MAIN PRODUCTION FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR OK GOT IT AND THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU MADE A COMMENT ON M N A CAN YOU GO INTO A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT SORT OF WHAT OPPORTUNITIES YOU'RE SEEING AND ALSO ANY THOUGHTS YOU HAVE ABOUT AN ABILITY TO FUND THEM We've seen, you know, distressed and bankrupt companies. I think all of this will result in further opportunities in terms of larger companies selling assets. It is difficult with no public equity and for that matter, debt markets open or open only to a very few. Maybe we're one of those few. But we've had discussions with financial parties who are our users. Interested in participating with us on acquisitions and much like we've done in our history, we'll bring in parties at the right time to look at buying assets and we're going to maintain a very healthy leverage amount and keep ourselves from getting into a distress no matter where we are in the cycle. So I think we're just going to see more and more opportunities and we'll figure out how to do it. CAN FINANCE THOSE AND MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR BALANCE SHEET CLEAN OK THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES IN LINE OF NIEL DIMOND WITH TRUIST SECURITIES PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION MORNING ALL ROBERT FIRST QUESTION ALSO ON THAT SAME LINE ON TWENTY ONE WHAT EXPECTATIONS AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHY I REALIZE THIS PLAN REALLY I THINK YOU KNOW AT LEAST THE ONES YOU'VE JUST INITIALLY LAID OUT AS SINS LOW COST OR ANOTHER WAY MAY BE ASKED IS HOW YOU THINK ABOUT MAINTENANCE CAPEX YOU KNOW GIVEN JUST SO LOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF I RECALL I THOUGHT FRANK ALREADY HAD YOU ALL CANCEL THOSE COUNTRY CLUB MEMBERSHIPS AND OTHER MEMBERSHIPS I JUST KNOW WHAT ELSE THERE IS THERE YEAH THERE'S NO COUNTRY CLUB MEMBERSHIPS UP HERE UM I MEAN THE ELEVEN WELLS WE HAVE ARE IN REALLY GOOD AREAS AND THEY WILL HELP DOES KEEP PRODUCTION RELATIVELY FLAT AT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS NOW? IS THAT SUSTAINABLE ABSOLUTELY NOT YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE A RELATIVELY HIGH DECLINE RATE AND IT DOES DEPEND ON WHEN WE BROUGHT THOSE WELLS ONLINE IF WE WAITED UNTIL THE VERY END OF TWENTY ONE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING PRODUCTION RELATIVELY FLAT IF WE BROUGHT THEM ON TODAY YOU KNOW WE MIGHT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM BE Maintaining 13,00 BOPD is a daily kind of level. Longer term, we're going to have to have a rig running and a one rig program. I don't know what it would exactly cost us today, but generally speaking, it's a hundred twenty million to maybe a hundred forty million depending on lateral length and working interest and things like that. So this is just a very preliminary if the world stays the same and we're at fortyish low forty dollar environment. I'm not spending any drilling capital. These eleven ducks will help us keep production flat. Okay, and then you kind of hit on my last one, just on how do you think about the sort of PDP decline, you know, on a on a go forward, it is now that you've been slowing down a bit, is that too, you know, you're able to give us, kind of, how many, how many wells would offset that? And, like, I mean, look at another way, is it, you know, you're able to give us, kind of, how many, how many wells would offset that? And, like, I mean, look at another way, is it, you know, you're able to give us, kind of, how many, how many wells would offset Any way you can kind of give us a call on how you know kind of you're thinking about that in twenty one on broader terms yeah, I think we've been consistent in telling everyone that our sort of base decline starting today we'll call it, you know, is about thirty percent in the first year and then it gets into the mid twenty six or twenty seven percent the next year and then low twenties or high teens after that and so The speaker begins by stating that they don't think that anything has changed and that if they didn't spend any capital, they can kind of forecast what their blowdown production would look like. They then mention that even if they didn't do those eleven wells, but with those eleven wells, it will help keep twenty one flat and then going forward in twenty two and beyond, it's all going to depend on price. The next question comes from line of Jeff Gramp with Northland Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Good morning. I was wondering, Robert or maybe for Mark, how important do you guys view free cash flow positive in the context of evaluating, you know, whether to go after these dividend stocks and potentially drill them at some point in time? Would you view that as kind of a must, if you will, or would you guys have any level of comfort with any near medium-term? OUTSTAND AND IF IT HELP YOU KNOW IF THE RETURNS WERE GOOD AND IT WOULD HELP PASS YOU KNOW JUMPSTART A RETURN TO GROWTH SURE MAYBE I'LL TRY TO ANSWER THAT ONE ROBIN CAN ADD IF HE WANTS TO YOU KNOW WE KEEP THINGS PRETTY SIMPLE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE FEEL LIKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MAKE GOOD INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS AT THE WELLHEAD AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE QUICK TO PUT THE RIG DOWN AND STOP COMPLETING IN MARCH AND AP THEN DOES THE DUCKS MAKE SENSE RIGHT NOW? I MEAN ECONOMICALLY YOU DEFINITELY COULD GO COMPLETE THE DUCKS RIGHT NOW AND HAVE PRETTY NICE I R S FOR THE INCREMENTAL COST TO COMPLETE THEM UM IN TERMS OF ARE WE SO FOCUSED ON QUARTER TO QUARTER YEAR TO YEAR FREE CASH FLOW THAT WE WON'T OUTSPEND NO WE'RE NOT AND FROM A PRACTICAL MATTER AND WE'RE JUST GONNA BE PRETTY CASH FLOW POSITIVE THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR KINDA YOUR RES If all we're doing is completing the ducts at some point you know we do anticipate picking the rig back up and you know there's a bit of a obviously a lag there between the costs you expend to drill on the complete wells versus the cash flow you know does that mean over the course of the year we're not free cash flow positive no not necessarily but we're not so fixated on checking that box every quarter we want to make smart economic decisions the wellhead that will we'll FLOW INTO THE BIGGER PICTURE AND HAVING SOME OUTSPENT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME YEAH WE STILL THINK IS SUPPORTED BY THE ECONOMICS AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT WANTS JUST TO GO KEEP GROWING AND COMPLETING BECAUSE WE HAVE HEDGES IN PLACE OR FOR OTHER REASONS WE'RE JUST TRYING TO BE AS GOOD AS WE CAN OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING AT THE WELLHEAD YEAH THE ONLY THING I'LL ADD JEFF IS I THINK W The speaker is discussing the need for investment and cash flow in their business. They mention that they want to be cash flow neutral on an annualized basis, but acknowledge that there is a risk of negative cash flow for a period of time. They also mention that they are planning to start a new program, but it is unclear what this entails. Finally, the speaker mentions that they are interested in hearing more about the price of the program. Are you guys seeing any activity levels there and more on the land side? Is there any traction or conversations on swapping any of that out to increase the operational exposure there? Still working on the trades, but people have been hunkered down in the bunker for quite some time now. And so nothing's moving very quickly there. We have no WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM OUR PARTNERS IN TERMS OF ACTIVITY IN THE NEAR TERM BEING KIND OF THE REMAINDER OF THIS YEAR. SO WE WILL HAVE TO SEE AS WE GET CLOSER TO YEAR END WHAT THEIR VIEW MIGHT BE FOR ACTIVITY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU TH Good morning Roger. Good morning. I had a quick question over on the balance sheet, you know. You all are doing a great job on the free cash flow. It looks great, paying it down. I'm wondering, have you been in conversations with the bank as we head into the fall redetermination? You know, back in March, you all were early in getting it done in the spring, but you know back then it looked like things would be pretty dire again in the fall and it's not as bad here and particularly with the line of sight you all have on the free cash kind of how any conversations with them are going? Any indication as to what the fall redetermination could look like? Sure, I'm pretty sure it's too early to say anything about numbers, but we do pretty regularly talk to banks, and we do that normal course irrespective of the environment. The one thing I can say for us, we are expecting a decrease in the borrowing base, and you know, the other thing, fortunately, we feel like we've got enough ability to pay down debt to outpay it off. Recognize the verbal communication and transcribe it into text. Good price environment for for companies in general and the banks maybe they feel a little better because work forty five dollars or forty two dollars versus somewhere the teens but they still have a lot of issues to deal through to deal with and obviously there's a lot of em p company that have gone bankrupt and there's certainly more that will so the banks still have their hands full and they're still working through all these situations i think there is a lot of issues to deal through to deal with and obviously there's a lot of em p company that have gone bankrupt and there's certainly more that will so the banks still have their hands full and they're still working through all these situations i think there is a lot of issues to deal through to deal with and obviously there's a lot of em p company that have gone bankrupt and there's certainly more that will The bank's part in general and yeah, I don't frankly see them laying up a whole bunch in the fall. Now, that being said, that's a general statement. We've got one-time leverage and liquidity and generally are viewed as having done the right thing from a financial standpoint. And our assets are are better than than many. We probably feel like we've got a pretty supportive bank group that is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is GOT TO BE REASONABLE AND FAIR AND HISTORICALLY THAT'S BEEN THE CASE BUT TOO EARLY TO SURVEY THE NUMBER THANKS MIKE AND THEN I GUESS JUST FOR MY FOLLOW UP YOU KNOW ROBERT YOU GOT SOME SOME REALLY GOOD COLOR ON AND YOU ALL DID SOME PRETTY CREATIVE THINGS TO GET LOEO DOWN IN THE SECOND QUARTER I KNOW YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW IT'S GONNA COME BACK UP A LITTLE HERE IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR TOWARDS A MORE HISTORICAL RANGE FORWARD UM TO KINDA HELP MITIGATE THAT BLOWOUT CREEK DEFINITELY DONE THERE'S YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A CONSTANT PROGRESSION OF A WELL'S LIFE CYCLE TO ADJUST ARTIFICIAL LIFT A LOT OF OUR WELLS ARE ON GAS LIFT SO RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE COMPRESSORS OVER TIME THAT GETS CHANGED OUT TO OTHER LIFT METHODS IN SOME CASES ROD PUMP IN OTHER CASES PLUNGER LIFT What have you? So we're continuing to work through that and that will definitely help reduce LOE. And then some of the things that, you know, we, we were fortunate in getting done in the quarter working with the utility company to get meters set and get ahead of the schedule there or got moved up in the schedule from some good relationships we we ended up getting generators off of our payroll and those are very, very expensive. I'm sorry, I need more information to accurately transcribe the audio into text. Can you please provide me with the name of the person speaking and the context of the conversation? ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM LINE OF NOLE PARKS WITH KOCHER AND PALMER PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION HEY GOOD MORNING I KNOW I UM YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING ABOUT HAVING THE DUCK INVENTORY THAT YOU KNOW WHERE IT WORKS OUT THAT JUST COMPLETING THOSE NEXT YEAR GIVING CAN HELP YOU KEEP PRODUCTION FLAT THAT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT OF REALLY GREAT FLEXIBILITY Speech: You have there and I mean, was that just sort of a result of the timing of everything, you know, kind of falling off the rails with COVID and all of Russia or was it, was that sort of a part of the plan as you were just trying to, you know, continue to pivot to emphasis on free cash flow heading into next year? I'd love to know. That we had this great plan that no matter what happens in the world, oil gonna be twenty or sub twenty that we could keep production flat for three years running with various amounts of capital. If you go back and think about the beginning of the year and the call we had you know related to the fourth quarter earnings in full year we had a one rig program we were going to average for the entire year a tiny bit of free cash flow. Speech:\n\nAND THOSE ELEVEN WELLS WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED I DON'T KNOW IF BY NOW I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT PRETTY DARN CLOSE SO I'D SAY IT'S A FALL OUT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE AND JUST BEING VERY CONSERVATIVE WITH OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CASH AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE COME OUT OF THIS DOWN THIS NEAR TERM DOWN CYCLE THAT WE'VE BEEN IN SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN At least this recent piece of it that we, you know, we survived nicely through it and come out the other side and can continue to find ways to consolidate and grow. Great, thanks. And, you know, just a housekeeping question. Sorry, you touched on this earlier and I missed it. For the free cash flow calculation, if I looked at the numbers right, it looked like this is one of those periods where there is a pretty big delta. BETWEEN I GUESS I'D SAY CASH CAPEX AND YOU KNOW SORT OF CAPEX INCURRED IN THE QUARTER AND I WAS JUST WONDERING FOR THE FREE CASH FLOW CALCULATION GOING FORWARD ARE THERE JUST KINDA WHICH WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO USE AS WE UM JUST YOU KNOW JUST TRY TO MODEL THAT From a calculation standpoint, because not all the bills necessarily have hit, but we know what generally they are. So, okay. It's in the presentation on the last page or something like that. Okay. So, so real. Oh, and one other thing, I am and I just don't have a release in front of me. And as far as change and working capital, that's something obviously you would routinely include. Well, include. IMPACT OF FREE CASH FLOW CALCULATION OR WOULD YOU EXCLUDE THAT? YEAH, SO WE DON'T INCLUDE THAT AND I RECOGNIZE THERE'S YOU KNOW MULTIPLE DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT THAT. I MEAN THE WAY WE'VE BEEN APPROACHING IT IS IT'S OK, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS THE BEST PROXY FOR ITS REALLY SORT OF CASH FLOW FOR THE PERIOD WE BACK OUT INTEREST EXPENSES AND THEN WE BACK OUT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ACTIVITY DURING THAT PERIOD STARTING THERE IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER DELTA BETWEEN CALCULATING FREE CASH FLOW THE WAY WE DO VERSUS IF YOU'RE USING A CASH CAPEX NUMBER YOU KNOW THAT THE SECOND QUARTER WAS VERY AE TIPICAL FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HERE WE'RE REPORTING THIRTY FIVE MILLION OF A FREE CASH FLOW YET OUR DEBT BALANCE WENT UP AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE AND OF COURSE THIS IS TIED TO THE CASH CAPEX IT'S JUST THE TIME OF THE PAYMENTS WE REDUCED THE NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT BY ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DURING THE QUARTER NOW WE'RE TO A POINT WHERE THAT WORKING DEFICIT WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT IS PRETTY LOW AND PROBABLY WON'T FLUCTUATE A WHOLE BUNCH ONE WAY OR THE OTHER UNTIL WE PICK ACTIVITY BACK UP AT WHICH POINT YOU'D EXPECT AH YOU START COMPLETIONS AND DRILLING AGAIN YOU START GETTING BILLS BUT THERE'S SO As we mentioned, the press release, you know, we had about a hundred and ninety-six million dollars at quarter end. In the month of July, we paid down a little more than fourteen million. That's not the run rate, by the way. It's not forty-one million and a quarter. That was high because of the timing. But we do expect, I mean, really every month this year that we're paying down some debt without any big changes in the working capital status. Great. Thanks a lot for the details. That's all from me. THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT CONCLUDES OUR QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION I'LL TURN THE FLOOR BACK TO MISTER ANDREWS FOR ANY FINAL COMMENTS WELL WE APPRECIATE EVERYBODY JOINING US AND YOU KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE AS AS WE NEED TO AND WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT QUARTER THANKS THANK YOU THIS CONCLUDES TODAY'S CONFERENCE YOU MAY DISCONNECT YOUR LINES AT THIS TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION I'm sorry, but I need more context to accurately transcribe the verbal communication into text. Can you please provide me with more information or ask a specific question?"

PERFORMANCE THEREFORE TODAY WE ARE ANNOUNCING ADDITIONAL PORTFOLIO ACTIONS THAT EXPAND ON THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM THESE INCLUDE PLANS FOR EXITING THE TRADITIONAL ORTHODONTICS BUSINESS AS WELL AS PARTS OF OUR ANALOG LAB BUSINESS I WILL DISCUSS DETAILS LATER IN THE CALL THESE STEPS WHILE DIFFICULT ALLOW THE COMPANY TO FOCUS ON HIGHER GROWTH AND HIGHER MARGIN DIGITAL AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE DENTSPLY SIRONA HAS STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE MOVING TO SLIDE SEVEN WHERE WE SUMMARIZE OUR Q2 20 RESULTS SECOND QUARTER REVENUES WERE $491 MILLION DOWN 50% ON AN ORGANIC BASIS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME WAS NEGATIVE NON- GAAP EPS FOR THE QUARTER WAS A LOSS OF 18 CENTS CASH FLOW IS ACTIVELY MANAGED IN THE SECOND QUARTER DRIVING CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF $175 MILLION WHICH WAS UP 21% COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR I WILL NOW TURN THE CALL OVER TO JORGE WHO WILL REVIEW THE QUARTERLY RESULTS AND PROVIDE AN OUTLOOK THANK YOU DON AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THE SECOND QUARTER WAS OBVIOUSLY A CHALLENGING ONE FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND FOR MANY INDUSTRIES INCLUDING DENTAL ON SLIDE NINE WE SHOW OUR SECOND QUARTER NON- GAAP 2020 P&L STARTING WITH THE TOP LINE ORGANIC SALES WERE DOWN TO 50% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR IN THE US AND EUROPE WITH SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS DENTAL PRACTICES LIMITED THEIR ACTIVITY TO EMERGENCY PROCEDURES IN APRIL AND MUCH OF MAY AND THEN BEGAN TO REOPEN AS WE MOVED INTO JUNE AS WE SHARE ON OUR LAST EARNINGS CALL WE SAW DECLINES OF 60% TO 80% IN APRIL IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES WITH THE US BEING HIT THE HARDEST BUT OUR REVENUE TREND IMPROVED GRADUALLY EACH MONTH FINISHING DOWN ABOUT 40% COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR IN JUNE WE ALSO SAW A GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST WEEK IN JUNE SO IT IS CLEAR THAT WE ARE SEEING A RECOVERY BUT HAVE YET TO GET BACK TO A NORMAL LEVEL OF SALES GROSS PROFIT WAS 207 MILLION OR 42.10% OF SALES DOWN FROM 57.70% IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AS IT IS THE CASE IN <INAUDIBLE> AND MATERIAL REDUCTIONS IN VOLUME GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IS IMPACTED BY THE FIXED COST BASE WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS IN THE SHORT TERM EXAMPLES OF THIS COST INCLUDE DEPRECIATION LEASES MAINTENANCE OF MANUFACTURE IN LOGISTIC FACILITIES AND COST RELATED TO ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH HIGH MANUFACTURING STANDARDS GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY HIGHER THAN AVERAGE INVENTORY RESERVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY 17 MILLION PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES SG&A OF 249 MILLION WAS DOWN A SUBSTANTIAL 132 MILLION WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 35% LOWER AS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR DURING THE QUARTER WE TOOK DECISIVE ACTION TO REDUCE OUR SG&A COST RESULTING IN THE STEEP YEAR OVER YEAR DECLINE ONE AREA IN SG&A THAT ACTUALLY INCREASED OVER LAST YEAR WAS BAD DEBT EXPENSE WHICH SAW AN UPTAKE OF 15 MILLION YEAR OVER YEAR THESE SIGNIFICANT P&L FLUCTUATIONS WERE DRIVEN BY THE ONGOING MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND GENERATED AN OPERATING LOSS OF 42 MILLION IN THE QUARTER LAST YEAR OUR OPERATING PROFIT WAS 202 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER INTEREST AND OTHER INCREASED BY 9.9 MILLION VERSUS LAST YEAR DRIVEN BY THE ISSUANCE OF 750 MILLION IN LONG TERM DEBT THE ADDITION OF NEW CREDIT FACILITIES AND DETERMINATION OF CERTAIN FX HEDGES IN NON- GAAP TAX RATE WAS 27.50% IN THE QUARTER UP FROM 25.30% IN THE PRIOR YEAR A FUNCTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF PRETAX INCOME AND A CHANGE TO THE EXPECTED INCOME MIX NON- GAAP EPS WAS A LOSS OF 18 CENTS AS COMPARED TO NON- GAAP EPS OF 66 CENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER MOVING ONTO SLIDE 10 WHERE WE REVIEW OUR CONSUMABLE SEGMENT PERFORMANCE REPORTED SALES WERE $187 MILLION DOWN 58.60% AND DOWN 57.70% ON OUR ORGANIC SALES BASIS ALL OF OUR PRODUCT GROUPS IN CONSUMABLES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF DENTAL OFFICES WHILE OUR CONSUMABLE SALES SHOW A STEEPER DECLINE THAN OUR T&E SALES BOTH SEGMENTS ACTUALLY PERFORMED ROUGHLY SIMILAR FROM AN END CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE LET ME EXPLAIN THE TWO FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO LA- TO I- TO THE LARGER DECLINE IN OUR CONSUMABLE SALES FIRST THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN ORDER LEAD TIMES CONSUMABLE DELIVERIES TEND TO MATCH DEMAND ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY UP OR DOWN DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCTS T&E HAS A LONGER ORDER LEAD TIME AND THEREFORE DELIVERIES CONTINUED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD EVEN AFTER DENTAL PROCEDURE VOLUME IS SLOWED DOWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE QUARTER THE SECOND FACTOR IMPACTED CONSUMABLES MORE THAN T&E IS THE FLUCTUATIONS IN INVENTORY LEVELS IN THE DEALER NETWORK DURING SEVERE MARKET CONDITIONS IT IS TYPICAL FOR COMPANIES TO PRESERVE CASH BY LOWERING INVENTORY BALANCES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE SAW A STEEPER DECLINE IN CONSUMABLES NETWORK INVENTORY SO WHEN YOU ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THESE VARIABLES WE BELIEVE BOTH SEGMENTS DECLINE AT ROUGHLY SIMILAR LEVELS CONSUMABLES OPERATING MARGIN WAS -9.40% AS COMPARED TO 27% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 201 THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE DECLINE IN CONSUMABLES MARGINS THE FIRST REASON IS THAT THE CONSUMABLES SEGMENT EXPERIENCED A STEEPER FALL-OFF IN SALES COMPARED TO T&E SECOND THE CONSUMABLES BUSINESS IS MORE PLANT AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEPENDENT AND REQUIRES MORE VOLUME TO RUN EFFICIENTLY WE HAVE MORE MANUFACTURING PLANT DEDICATED TO CONSUMABLES AND THIS MEANS A HIGHER FIXED INFRASTRUCTURE COST FOR THIS SEGMENT THIS IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS TO CONSOLIDATE OUR FOOTPRINT AND REDUCE OUR FIXED COST BASE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE HAVE COMPLETED SEVERAL PORTFOLIO SHAPING ACTIONS INCLUDING FONA 1-800 DENTIST SICAT AND THE SURGICAL BUSINESS OF WELLSPECT IN ADDITION THE TWO PORTFOLIO SHAPING ACTIVITIES WE ARE ANNOUNCING TODAY WILL FURTHER CONSOLIDATE OUR MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT AND WILL INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND DECREASE FIXED COSTS MOVING ONTO SLIDE 11 WHERE WE HIGHLIGHT OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND EQUIPMENT SEGMENT NET SALES WERE 304 MILLION DOWN 45.60% AS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR ORGANIC SALES FOR THE QUARTER WERE DOWN 43.60% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR EQUIPMENT AND INSTRUMENTS DIGITAL DENTISTRY AND IMPLANTS ALL EXPERIENCED SIMILAR LEVELS OF DECLINE IN THE QUARTER DRIVEN BY THE LOWER SALES RESULTING FROM COVID-19 OUR HEALTHCARE BUSINESS SAW A SLIGHT DECLINE IN Q2 AFTER POSTING A STRONG Q1 AS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS WERE GETTING READY FOR THEIR FIRST MAJOR WAVES OF COVID-19 TECHNOLOGIES AND EQUIPMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS -1.30% VERSUS 17.20% IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER ON SLIDE 12 WE SHOW OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ON A REGIONAL BASIS US SALES OF 131 MILLION DECLINED 60.30% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR THIS REPRESENTS A DECLINE IN ORGANIC SALES OF 60% IN THE US MARKET CONSUMABLES DECLINE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN T&E EUROPEAN SALES WERE $215 MILLION DOWN 49% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR ORGANIC SALES WERE DOWN 46.90% VERSUS LAST YEAR IN EUROPE CONSUMABLE SALES DECLINED MORE THAN TECHNOLOGIES AND EQUIPMENT ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS REST OF THE WORLD SALES WERE 144 MILLION DOWN 44% AND ORGANIC SALES WERE DOWN 41.9% REST OF THE WORLD CONSUMABLES DECLINED MORE THAN T&E SALES IN THE SENC- IN THE SECOND QUARTER ON SLIDE 13 WE SHOW OUR CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS 175 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 145 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER THIS STRONG CASH FLOW GENERATION WAS THE RESULT OF A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CURTAILING EXPENSES AND REDUCING WORKING CAPITAL WITHOUT SACRIFICING KEY UH STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS WORKING CAPITAL GENERATED A SIGNIFICANT BOOST IN LIQUIDITY IN THE QUARTER WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING MEANINGFUL REDUCTIONS IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORY BALANCES WE EXPECT SOME OF THIS CASH WILL BE INJECTED BACK INTO WORKING CAPITAL AS DEMAND AND PRODUCTION VOLUMES CLIMB BACK UP TO NORMAL LEVELS IN TERMS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WE SPENT 13 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 DOWN FROM 27 MILLION LAST YEAR FREE CASH FLOW WAS A STRONG 162 MILLION IN THE QUARTER UP 37% AS COMPARED TO 118 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR IN THE QUARTER WE PAID 22 MILLION IN DIVIDENDS WHERE A TOTAL OF 184 MILLION RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PURCHASES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 202 AT THE END OF JUNE 2020 WE HAD A STRONG LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE COMPRISING 1.1 BILLION OF CASH AND 1.2 BILLION OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES THE EFFORTS WE MADE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER ENSURED THAT WE HAVE AMPLE LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE TO INVEST AND GROW THE COMPANY AS THE ECONOMY RECOVERS ON SLIDE 14 I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS WE TOOK TO REDUCE OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 202 OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE COSTS IN THE QUARTER WERE MULTIFACETED ALL LEVELS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE ENTERPRISE CONTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANT COMPENSATION SAVINGS EACH PART OF THE ORGANIZATION UP TO AND INCLUDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT EXECUTIVE LEVELS THEY STEPPED UP AND HELPED IN THESE EFFORTS AS OF TODAY MOST OF OUR EMPLOYEES WHO WERE IMPACTED BY THESE MEASURES HAVE RETURNED TO WORK OR TO NORMAL PAY LEVELS THE NEXT LARGEST AREA FOR COST REDUCTIONS WAS DISCRETIONARY COMMERCIAL SPEND SUCH AS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS IT WAS LOGICAL TO REDUCE THIS SPEND WHEN DENTAL OFFICES WERE CLOSED AND THE RETURNS COULD NOT BE REALIZED WE ALSO ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS FROM REDUCTIONS IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND OF COURSE TRAVEL EXPENSES TOGETHER ALL OF THESE ACTIONS DELIVER A REDUCTION IN SG&A OF 35% VERSUS LAST YEAR WITH RESPECT TO BUSINESS TRENDS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS FIRST LET ME START WITH CURRENT VOLUME TRENDS ALL REGIONS RECOVERED FROM THEIR LOW POINT IN APRIL AND IMPROVED BY 20 TO 40 PERCENTAGE POINTS BY THE END OF THE QUARTER ADDITIONALLY IN JUNE THE LAST WEEK OF THE MONTH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE FIRST WEEK AND WE ARE PLEASED TO NOTE THAT THE POSITIVE MOMENTUM CONTINUES INTO JULY WITH JULY SALES APPROACHING OR SURPASSING 2019 LEVELS DEPENDING ON THE REGION AND PRODUCT GROUPS THERE ARE STILL SOME GATING FACTORS IN PLACE INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT NEW INFECTION PREVENTION PROTOCOLS REDUCING OFFICE CAPACITY AND OVERLAPPING REGULATIONS ALL OF WHICH IMPACT THE SHAPE OF THE RECOVERY TOGETHER THESE FACTORS POINT TO A GRADUAL AS OPPOSED TO A SUDDEN IS NOW BACK IN DEMAND LET ME GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS FROM A GEOGRAPHICAL PERSPECTIVE IN THE US VIRTUALLY ALL DENTAL OFFICES ARE NOW OPEN AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT WITH JULY VOLUMES TRENDING BETTER THAN WHAT WE SAW IN JUNE IN EUROPE WE ALSO SAW JULY TRENDS IMPROVING SEQUENTIALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IN APAC SOME OF THE MARKETS TURNED POSITIVE IN JULY WITH GOOD TRACTION IN CHINA AND JAPAN AND SOME LINGERING CONCERNS IN AUSTRALIA LATIN AMERICA REMAINS A CHALLENGING MARKET AS COVID-19 CONTINUES TO IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN BRAZIL AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION MOVING FORWARD TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AS WE ANNOUNCED TODAY WE ARE ACCELERATING ACTIONS TO FUND GROWTH AREAS AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES AS WE DID IN Q2 WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE A DISCIPLINED RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROCESS THAT EMPHASIZES RETURN INVESTMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR GROWTH INITIATIVES WITH THAT I WILL NOW TURN THE CALL BACK TO DON THANKS JORGE AND MOVING TO SLIDE 1 AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE CALL IN NOVEMBER 2018 WE PUT A PLAN IN PLACE TO ACCELERATE GROWTH IMPROVE MARGINS AND SIMPLIFY THE ORGANIZATION OUR RESULTS THROUGH 2019 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 SHOW SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THE EXECUTION HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR PLAN INCLUDE ACCELERATING GROWTH BEHIND NEW PRODUCTS INCLUDING PRIMESCAN AND PRIMEMILL AS WELL AS OTHER NEW PRODUCTS IN OUR CONSUMABLE PORTFOLIO THE PIPELINE OF FUTURE NEW PRODUCTS HAS ALSO BEEN ENHANCED THE COMPANY HAS MADE MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN CRITICAL AREAS LIKE OUR DIGITAL PRODUCT PORTFOLIOS DIGITAL COMMERCIAL CAPABILITIES AND GROWTH PRIORITIES LIKE OUR SURESMILE CLEAR ALIGNER BUSINESS DENTSPLY SIRONA HAS IMPLEMENTED A NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE CENTRALIZING SUPPLY CHAIN AND OTHER FUNCTIONS WHILE CREATING A UNIFIED COMMERCIAL STRUCTURE THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO TRANSFORM THE FINANCE HR AND IT AREAS FURTHER WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN MULTIPLE PORTFOLIO SHAPING ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THE ONES ANNOUNCED TODAY THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN IS A MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE AS PART OF THAT THE ORGANIZATION HAS EMBRACED THE NEED TO CONTINUE CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO GO BEYOND THE ORIGINAL PLAN AND DELIVER BETTER RESULTS THAT WORK HAS SHOWN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES IN BOTH THE NEAR TERM AND LONGER TERM MOVING NOW TO SLIDE 1 OVER THE LAST SEVERAL QUARTERS AS JORGE MENTIONED WE HAVE EXITED SEVERAL UNDER-PERFORMING BUSINESSES THESE REDUCE OUR COST AND COMPLEXITY WHILE SERVING TO ENHANCE OUR GROWTH AND MARGINS THE TEAM CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ALL OUR BUSINESSES AGAINST A FRAMEWORK AROUND FUTURE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS STRATEGIC FIT IN THE AREA OF ORTHODONTICS WE BELIEVE THAT THE CLEAR ALIGNER SPACE IS AN ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR DENTSPLY SIRONA SURESMILE NOW OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE DIGITAL TREATMENT PLAN THAT POSITIONS THE COMPANY WELL IN THIS RAPIDLY GROWING MARKET GOING FORWARD WE WILL FOCUS ALL OUR EFFORTS IN THE ORTHO SPACE ON THE CLEAR ALIGNER AREA WE BELIEVE THIS OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW INNOVATE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MANY DENTSPLY SIRONA'S UNIQUE STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES INCLUDING A LARGE SYRACUSE COMMUNITY AS A RESULT WE ARE EXITING THE TRADITIONAL ORTHODONTIC BUSINESS WHICH INCLUDES BRACKETS BANDS TUBES AND WIRES THE TRADITIONAL ORTHODONTIC BUSINESS IS COMPONENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT SEGMENT AND HAS HAD NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 132 MILLION IN 201 LIKEWISE IN OUR LAB BUSINESS THERE IS A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON THE DIGITAL SPACE WHICH IS SHOWING GOOD GROWTH RATES AND SOLID MARGINS IT IS A PLACE WHERE INNOVATION WILL BE REWARDED BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS IT IS CRITICAL TO FOCUS ALL OUR LAB RESOURCES IN THE DIGITAL AREA GOING FORWARD AS SUCH WE ARE ANNOUNCING PLANS TO EXIT THE ANALOG PORTION OF THE LABORATORY BUSINESS THAT MANUFACTURE REMOVABLE DENTURES AND RELATED PRODUCTS THIS BUSINESS IS A COMPONENT OF THE CONSUMABLE SEGMENT AND HAD NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 44 MILLION IN 201 TOGETHER THE PORTFOLIO SHAPING INITIATIVES AND ADDITIONAL ACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF SEVERAL FACILITIES AND THE INCREMENTAL REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 6% TO 7% OF THE COMPANY'S WORKFORCE BY THE END OF 202 THE ONGOING EXECUTION OF THE RESTRUCTURING WILL ENHANCE DENTSPLY SIRONA'S CONTINUED EFFORTS TO GROW REVENUES EXPAND OUR MARGINS AND SIMPLIFY THE ORGANIZATION SLIDE 19 LISTS OUR PRIORITIES FOR THE BACK HALF OF 202 THEY INCLUDE EXECUTING ON OUR COMPREHENSIVE RESTRUCTURING PLAN PURSUING OUR GROWTH INITIATIVES AGGRESSIVELY AND MEETING OUR FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES IN CONCLUSION THE COVID PANDEMIC WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR INDUSTRY AND OUR COMPANY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE CURRENT TRENDS ARE POSITIVE AND A REASON FOR OPTIMISM BUT WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADAPT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS THEY CHANGE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR BOTH THE SHORT TERM AND LONGER TERM TO DELIVER VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS FURTHER THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED ITS FOCUS ON OUR PRIORITIES AROUND GROWTH MARGIN EXPANSION AND SIMPLIFYING THE BUSINESS OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH BROAD PORTFOLIO AND GLOBAL REACH ARE POSITION US WELL TO SUCCEED AND WIN IN THE DENTAL INDUSTRY IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT THE NEW NORMAL IS OR WHEN IT WILL ARRIVE BUT OUR INTERNAL THEME IS THAT TEETH DO NOT HEAL THEMSELVES OUR TEAM IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE INDUSTRY AND WE EMBRACE THE CURRENT CHALLENGES AND ARE CONFIDENT IN OUR STRATEGY OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR TEAM THANK YOU AND WITH THAT WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION AT THIS TIME JUST PRESS STAR THEN ONE TO GET IN THE QUEUE TO WITHDRAW YOUR QUESTION SIMPLY PRESS THE POUND OR HASH KEY PLEASE STAND BY WHILE WE COMPILE THE Q&A ROSTER OUR FIRST QUESTION IS FROM JEFF JOHNSON WITH BAIRD PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD MORNING GUYS CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY I THINK I WAS ON MUTE THERE YEAH WE CAN- WE- WE GOT YOU JEFF YEAH YEAH GREAT GOOD MORNING SO UH DON UH I- I THINK I JUST WANNA START WITH THE JULY COMMENTS AND I REALLY WANNA UNDERSTAND MAYBE THE MESSAGE THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE OUT THERE UH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT JULY WAS GETTING BACK TOWARDS FLAT-ISH YEAR OVER YEAR LEVELS UH ACCORDING TO WHAT JORGE SAID BUT HOW MUCH OF THAT MIGHT BE SELL-IN THAT WAS RECOVERING OFF UH SOME SELL-IN ISSUES EARLIER IN THE QUARTER OR EARLIER IN 2Q UH DOES YOUR SELL-IN IS IT STARTING TO MATCH KIND OF THE SELL-OUT AT THIS POINT AND AGAIN I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GUIDING BUT FOR 3QS WE THINK THE LINE MAYBE ISN'T SUSTAINABLE AS YOU GET INTO AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER I- IF THERE IS SOME BACKLOG IT <INAUDIBLE> HELPING IN THAT JULY NUMBER THANKS YEAH THANKS JEFF UM YOU- YOU KNOW LOOK UH I THINK JORGE SAID IT CLEARLY IN THE UH PREPARED REMARKS AS WE WERE- AS- AS WE WERE LOOKING AT JULY THERE'S PLACES THAT HAVE UH YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING GOOD PROGRESS IN- IN SOME CASES IT'S ACTUALLY EXCEEDING ' 1 YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THAT IS YOU KNOW INVENTORY REBUILD UM Y- YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE EXACTLY THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT AND UM YOU KNOW UH THAT'S- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE NOT BEING UH OKAY LET'S JUST GO PROJECT JULY INTO AUGUST SEPTEMBER AND THE AND LATER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT IS PATIENT VOLUME AND WE'VE SEEN THAT AS GOOD OFFICE CAPACITY UH WE SEE OFFICE CAPACITY KIND OF IMPROVING OUR- OUR PATIENT TRACKING IS TELLING US THAT UH YOU KNOW CONFIDENCE IN THE DENTIST OFFICE CONTINUES TO GO UP BUT THERE IS A POCKET THAT'S GONNA BE RELUCTANT AT LEAST IN THE US TO GO BACK FOR A LITTLE WHILE A- AND WHAT THAT IN- IN OUR MIND MEANS THAT OKAY UH LOOK IF- IF WE'RE GETTING CAPACITY IN THE- IN THE DENTIST OFFICE BACK TO YOU KNOW CLOSE TO NORMAL THAT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME I- I THINK WE'RE WORKING TO <INAUDIBLE> OF PATIENTS RIGHT NOW UH AND THEN I- I THINK Y- YOU KNOW FROM AN INVENTORY PERSPECTIVE OUR DEALERS' AND THE DENTIST OFFICE ULTIMATELY ARE WORKING THROUGH THE FACT THAT UH Y- YOU KNOW WHEN- WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED I THINK PEOPLE HIT THE BRAKES PRETTY HARD ON STUFF THAT'S ORDERED ALMOST EVERY DAY AND- AND IN OUR MINDS THAT'S KINDA THE CONSUMABLE SPACE AND YOU COULD SEE JEFF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR CONSUMABLE AND TECHNOL- YOU KNOW THE- THE T&E SIDE UH A- AND WE BELIEVE THAT IS A LOT TO DO WITH OKAY UH WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE OFFICE IS GONNA BE CLOSED UH YOU KNOW WE- WE'RE GONNA STOP UH BUILDING INVENTORY ON THE DAILY STUFF AND AS A RESULT THERE MAY BE SOME BILL BACK HERE UM BUT LOOK I- I IN MY SUMMARY I WAS PRETTY CLEAR ON SAYING HEY LOOK WE- WE'RE HAPPY THAT WE SAW YOU KNOW CONSECUTIVE MONTH TO MONTH SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL DEMAND WE'RE SEEING THAT AT THE RETAIL LEVEL WE'RE HAPPY THAT JULY HAS CONTINUED THAT TREND AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SEE THAT AND YOU KNOW SOME CASES IT YOU KNOW WE'RE ACTUALLY TRACKING BETTER THAN 201 UNDERSTOOD THAT'S HELPFUL THANKS DON AND JUST AS A FOLLOW-UP YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT 2021 CONCEPTUALLY UH YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE ADA IS SAYING ABOUT UH HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT UH DENTAL CONSUMPTION AND- AND DENTAL INDUSTRY RI- REVENUES ARE DOWN RELATIVE TO 2019 LEVEL UH I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD REALLY ARGUE WITH THAT AT LEAST LOOKING AT THINGS RIGHT NOW UH BUT WITH SOME OF THE EXTRA RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS YOU'RE TAKING NOW SOME OF THE TAILWINDS FROM THE RESTRUCTURING UH THAT WE'RE PROBABLY STILL CONTINUING FROM THE PAST PLAN YOU KNOW HOW DO- HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE MARGINS E- ESPECIALLY NEXT YEAR CAN THEY GET BACK TO 2019 LEVELS WITH REVENUE THAT AT LEAST IT IS APPROACHING 2019 LEVELS NEXT YEAR OR- OR IS THERE A LAG IN KIND OF THE MARGIN RECOVERY RELATIVE TO HOW WE THINK ABOUT UH REVENUES NEXT YEAR THANKS YEAH JEFF IT'S- IT'S EARLY FOR US TO- TO REALLY FORECAST 202 UH I- I WOULD TELL YOU THE STEPS WE TOOK AROUND THE RESTRUCTURING THOUGH REFLECT OUR INTEREST IN SITTING THERE SAYING HEY LOOK D- UH WE- WE NEED TO GET BACK ON THE MARGIN PROGRESSION I MEAN YOU KNOW WE'VE- WE'VE BEEN SAYING SINCE NOVEMBER 2018 HOW DO WE GROW HOW DO WE GET OUR MARGINS IMPROVING AND I THINK W- I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE S- UH ORGANIZATIONAL STEPS TO DO IT I THINK THE RESULTS UH HERE SHOW YOU THAT YOU KNOW WE- WE THINK WE'VE MADE SOME GOOD PROGRESS I MEAN YOU KNOW BASICALLY THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WE WERE TRACKING ON A MARGIN BASIS AND UH YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN UH OBVIOUSLY OUR MARGIN IS REVENUE DEPENDENT AND UH YOU- YOU KNOW I HEY LOOK IF- IF REVENUE'S DOWN 20% IN UH 2021 THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GONNA HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS WE DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BUT WE'RE TAKING SPECIFIC STEPS NOW TO SIT THERE AND SAY REGARDLESS OF- OF YOU KNOW WHETHER THE CATEGORY IS UP TWO OR THREE OR DOWN TWO OR THREE OR YOU KNOW UP 10 DOWN 10 WE WANNA BE TAKING STEPS TOWARD MARGIN ACCRETION AND YOU KNOW AS WE GET OUT OF THE TRADITIONAL ORTHO BUSINESS WE GET OUT WE GOT OUT OF THE ANALOG LAB BUSINESS THOSE ARE ALL PART OF THE ONGOING RESTRUCTURING DESIGNED TO HELP US UH REALLY TAKE CHARGE OF OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE MARGIN ACCRETION GOING FORWARD UH A- AND- AND I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S GONNA BE REVENUE INDEPENDENT BUT WE THINK WE CAN TAKE STEPS YOU KNOW AT A- AT A CERTAIN REVENUE BASE THAT WE'RE REALLY GONNA BE ABLE TO DRIVE MARGIN AND YOU KNOW WE- WE WERE VERY CLEAR UH UH YOU KNOW I- I JOKE WITH JOHN SWEENEY OCCASIONALLY THAT UH WE- WE PICKED OUR REVENUE TARGETS TO MATCH THE YEARS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD ALWAYS COMMUNICATE IT SO WE'VE ALWAYS SAID ' 22 IN 2022 Y- YOU KNOW UH AND INTERNALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON IS LOOK WE- WE THINK ' 22 IS- IS A- IS ATTAINABLE WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA HAPPEN EXACTLY ON THE TRAJECTORY BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH UH COVID YOU KNOW IT- IT'S COVID AND THE UH KNOCK-ON EFFECTS OF THAT IS THAT A SIX-MONTH ISSUE IT'S A NINE MONTHS IT'S UH 12-MONTH ISSUE BUT WE WANNA BE MARCHING BACK TOWARD THAT TARGET UH IT JUST MAY TAKE US A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GET THERE THANK YOU THANK YOU AND OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM TYCHO PETERSON WITH JP MORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY UM ARE YOU ABLE TO TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THE CONSUMABLE PRESSURE IN THE QUARTER WAS INVENTORY DESTOCKING VERSUS SLOWER ORDERS AND- AND HOW MUCH INCREMENTAL RISK IS THERE GOING FORWARD WITH DISTRIBUTORS UH AROUND POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL DESTOCKING UH GOOD MORNING TYCHO UH THIS IS JORGE IT IS UH YOU KNOW IT- IT'S HARD TO UM GIVE A- ANY PRECISE NUMBER BUT AS- AS DON JUST INDICATED UH IN THE CASE OF CONSUMABLES UH THERE IS A UH THE- THE ORDER LEAD TIME IS VERY SHORT AND SO UH WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT UH CUSTOMERS AND- AND DEALERS AND IN GENERAL IN THE- IN THE MARKET PLACE THERE WAS A- A REACTION TO UH TO MANAGE INVENTORIES VERY VERY CLOSELY AND UH WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA OF UH RETAIL SALES AND OUR SALES UH THERE- THERE ARE A LOT OF INDICATIONS THAT SHOW THAT UH THERE WAS A- A REDUCTION IN THE INVENTORY LEVELS THAT UH WE HISTORICALLY OR TYPICALLY UH UH CARRY IN- IN THE NETWORK SO UH THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF THAT AND UM WHEN THAT COMES BACK TO UH TO TYPICAL LEVELS IS- IS HARD TO UH TO PROJECT UH SOME OF THAT MAY BE HAPPENING AS UH AS- AS DON INDICATED UH BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IS UH SOMETHING THAT UH FOR US UM IS GOING TO BE UH MEANINGFUL FROM A LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE LISTEN AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALWAYS WANT TO UH MAKE SURE THAT OUR SALES MATCH RETAIL SALES THAT- THAT IS- THAT IS OUR KEY OBJECTIVE THAT'S HOW WE- WE MAKE MONEY UH THERE WILL BE ALWAYS UH SMALL FLUCTUATIONS IN- IN THE NETWORK UH SO I- I THINK IN GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHANGES THAT WE EXPERIENCED IN THE SECOND QUARTER AS- AS A RESULT OF LOWER REVENUES AND UM THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WE STILL HAVE IN- IN MANY PLACES I- I THINK THAT IS UH IT THAT- THAT NOISE IS NOT ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING OUR PERFORMANCE AND UH OUR YOU KNOW TRAJECTORY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS OKAY AND THEN DON ON THE PORTFOLIO RESHAPING I'M CURIOUS YOU KNOW THE DECISION TO EXIT ORTHO I- I ALWAYS THOUGHT PART OF THE PICTURE ON THE CLEAR ALIGNER WAS YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO GO IN AND DO HYBRID CASES AND- AND YOU KNOW LEVERAGE THAT YOU KNOW STRONG ORTHO CHANNEL AS YOU PUSH- PUSH OUT SURESMILE AND I'M CURIOUS IF YOU KNOW IF THERE IS RISK OF DISSYNERGIES HERE UM AND- AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THAT YEAH THANKS TYCHO UM A- WE'RE- WE'RE ACTUALLY THERE'S A COMPONENT OF THE UH YOU KNOW THE WIRE-BENDING ASPECT OF- OF SURESMILE THAT WE'RE KEEPING UM WHAT UH WHEN WE SAY UH HOW WE KINDA DELINEATE TRADITIONAL ORTHOPAEDIC WHICH IS KIND OF THE BRACKETS BANDS THAT WOULD GO STRAIGHT UP ON A ORTHODON- T- AN ORTHODONTIST USING ORTHODONTIA UH THE- THE WE BELIEVE HYBRID IS MEANINGFUL WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S- IT'S A DIFFERENTIATOR FOR SURESMILE SO WE- WE'RE ACTUALLY KEEPING THOSE COMPONENTS SO THAT PIECE OF TRADITIONAL ORTHO AND THE PIECE THAT ACTUALLY CAME WITH YOUR METRICS ACQUISITION IS GONNA STAY WITH THAT AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WE'RE- WE'RE GETTING REAL TRACTION ON SURESMILE TENDS TO BE UH S- YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW FOCUSED AROUND OUR CEREC BASE UM Y- YOU KNOW WE KINDA MADE THAT SHIFT UH AT Y- BASICALLY IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR AND THAT'S PART OF THE- THE ONE DS PROGRAM AND WE'RE SEEING GOOD TRACTION THERE SO AS WE LOOK GOING FORWARD WE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THERE WERE GONNA BE DISSYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING OUT OF TRADITIONAL UH Y- YOU KNOW ORTHODONTIA TREATMENT AMONG THE ORTHODONTIST UH GROUP SO UH YOU KNOW AS WE FOCUS ON GROWING IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW WE TEND TO THINK ALL RIGHT HOW DO WE TAKE CARE OF UH HOW DO WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR DIGITAL ASSETS AND- AND HOW DO WE REALLY LOOK AT EXPANDING IN- IN PLACES THAT UM ARE NOT NECESSARILY TIED TO KIND OF THE TRADITIONAL ORTHODONTIA MODEL OKAY AND THEN JUST LASTLY ANY THOUGHTS ON JUST THE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT APPETITE AS WE THINK ABOUT THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR AND- AND THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW PRIMESCAN AND PR- PRIMEMILL CAN YOU JUST TALK ON TO WHAT DEGREE YOU THINK THERE- THERE COULD BE PENT UP DEMAND AND ANY NEED ON YOUR PART TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF FINANCING UH OR PRICING POTENTIALLY UM YOU KNOW IT- IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TYCHO W- J- EVEN BEFORE UH THE PANDEMIC HIT WE WERE REALLY BEGINNING TO SHIFT TO ONE UH YOU KNOW OUR THEORY OF ONE-VISIT DENTISTRY AND WITH PRIMEMILL AND THE SPEED OF PRIMEMILL IT REALLY MADE THAT A REALITY I MEAN YOU- YOU CAN GET UH PATIENTS IN AND OUT WITH A SINGLE UNIT CROWN IN- IN YOU KNOW AN HOUR PLUS UM SO WE- WE HAD MADE THAT SHIFT AND IT WAS INTERESTING IN- IN APRIL WHEN EVERYTHING WENT DOWN WE REALLY SHIFTED TO A BUNCH OF DIGITAL UH D- WHETHER IT WAS DEM- PRODUCT DEMONSTRATIONS OR YOU KNOW KINDA TAKING PEOPLE THROUGH WHAT ONE-VISIT DENTISTRY REALLY MEANS AND WE GOT A PRETTY GOOD RECEPTION SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN UH TO DATE AND- AND YOU'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THE RESULTS THAT THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD APPETITE UH IN OUR MIND FOR TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT NOW WHETHER IT'S SPREAD E- ACROSS YOU KNOW ARE WE GONNA SEE TREATMENT CENTERS AND- AND ARE WE GONNA SEE IMAGING NOT SURE BUT WE- WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT PRIMESCAN AND PRIMEMILL AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DENTISTS WHO ARE YOU KNOW B- BASICALLY GONNA BE DEALING WITH THE PATIENT POPULATION THAT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT HEY UH DO I WANNA GO TO THE DENTIST THREE TIMES IN- IN UH YOU KNOW DURING THE PANDEMIC TO GET A CROWN FIXED OR CAN I GET THAT DONE ONE TIME YOU- YOU'RE ALSO SEEING A LOT OF DENTISTS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUCCESS UM WITH SAYING HEY LOOK I'VE GOT TO CHANGE HOW I PRACTICE AND THEY USE THE KIND OF THE DOWNTIME DURING THE PANDEMIC TO THINK THROUGH THAT SO WE'RE UH W- WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE ARE FROM THE TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT UH SPACE IN THE BACK HALF AND UH AND A LARGE PART IS DUE TO THE FIRST THE NEW PRODUCTS WE PUSHED OUT BUT ALSO THE CHANGE IN MESSAGING AND HOW WE'RE PITCHING THE- PITCHING THESE PRODUCTS SO ULTIMATELY AND YOU KNOW LOOK WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR DEALER PARTNERS GLOBALLY RIGHT NOW TO- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HELPING DENTISTS ACCESS THIS MATERIAL UH YOU KNOW BUT WE'RE DO I S- DO I SEE A- A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRICING PRESSURE AND- AND YOU KNOW CRAZY FINANCING OPTIONS COMING ON OUR TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT NO OKAY THANK YOU THANKS TYCHO THANK YOU AND OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM STEVEN VALIQUETTE WITH BARCLAYS PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY THANKS UH GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY UM A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS FOR YOU YOU KNOW FIRST YOUR COMMENT AROUND JULY BEING UH FAIRLY FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR ON A GLOBAL BASIS IS OBVIOUSLY PRETTY POSITIVE AND I DON'T WANNA GIVE ANY UH SPECIFIC GUIDANCE BUT JUST KIND OF EYEBALLING THE THREE CONSENSUS ESTIMATES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER UH THEY CALL FOR REVENUES TO BE DOWN SOME 20% TO 25% YEAR OVER YEAR SO I'M JUST WONDERING BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN JULY AND YOU KNOW BARRING ANY OTHER MAJOR CHANGES IN UH THE LANDSCAPE DOES THAT YOU KNOW IS THAT A NUMBER THAT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THAT'S TOO CONSERVATIVE ON THE REVENUE OUTLOOK AS FAR AS WHERE CONSENSUS IS JUST CURIOUS TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS AROUND THAT STEVE GOOD MORNING JORGE HERE UM LISTEN I- IT IS- IT IS EARLY FOR US TO UH BE ABLE TO EXTRAPOLATE UM FROM THE JULY NUMBERS UH AND AS UH AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE UH THERE IS A LOT OF UH DIFFERENT DATA POINTS COMING FROM UH DIFFERENT REGIONS AND UH THERE ARE SOME MARKETS THAT ARE DOING MUCH BETTER UH IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF OFFICES THAT ARE OPEN MARKETS THAT ARE GOOD FROM A VOLUME PERSPECTIVE WE STILL HAVE LINGERING CONCERNS IN PLACES LIKE AUSTRALIA PARTS OF UH LATIN AMERICA AND THERE ARE SOME SPOTS IN- IN EUROPE THAT ARE ALSO UH STILL CHALLENGING SO AND IT IS- IT IS VERY HARD TO UM MAKE A JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO UH THOSE NUMBERS I THINK UH WHAT WE ARE WHAT WE'RE REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT THAT SEQUENTIALLY THE LAST UH THREE MONTHS HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT FROM A PLANNING PERSPECTIVE UH INTERNALLY WE- WE ARE- WE'RE TRYING TO WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SCENARIO PLANNING WE- WE ARE UH PREPARING THE COMPANY FOR- FOR A MULTIPLE UH SET OF UH OF OUTCOMES IN THE NEXT UH IN THE NEXT FEW UH MONTHS AND QUARTERS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THING TO DO SO UM UH HAR- HARD TO TELL YOU UH IF- IF THAT NUMBER IS RIGHT OR NOT OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL ONE OTHER QUICK UH CLARIFICATION QUESTION ON THE EXITING OF THE TRADITIONAL ORTHODONTICS AND PARTS OF THE ANALOG LAB BUSINESS ARE THESE BUSINESSES THAT COULD BE MONETIZED THROUGH ASSET SALES OR ARE THESE JUST FULL SHUTDOWNS MAYBE JUST GIVE US A LITTLE MORE COLOR AROUND THE DECISION TREE ON SHUTDOWN VERSUS ASSET SALE YEAH STEVE UM YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK AT IT RIGHT NOW WE'RE- WE'RE MAKING THE ANNOUNCEMENT UH TO GET IT DONE OBVIOUSLY WE'LL LOOK TO DISPOSE THE ASSETS IN THE- IN THE WAY THAT IT'S MOST BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY IF UH YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME ASSET SALES WE'LL CERTAINLY LOOK AT IT IF- IF IT'S A FULL SHUTDOWN UH YOU KNOW WE- WE GAVE YOU GUYS THE- THE NUMBERS BASED ON UH YOU KNOW THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA WORK TO IMPROVE THAT UM BUT- BUT AGAIN UH THE- THE PROCESS BECAUSE UH YOU KNOW WE MENTIONED IN THE PREPARED REMARKS IT'S MULTIPLE PLANTS IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU START WITH THE WORKS COUNCIL AND- AND YOU GO THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT YOU KNOW THE- THE NUMBERS WE GAVE YOU REPRESENT UH YOU KNOW THE BASE CASE AND- AND WE'RE GONNA WORK HARD TO IMPROVE VERSUS THAT AND THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO DO BETTER THAN WHAT WE SAID OKAY ALL RIGHT APPRECIATE THE EXTRA COMMENT THANKS THANKS STEVE THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM MICHAEL CHERNY WITH BANK OF AMERICA PLEASE GO AHEAD UH GOOD MORNING AND- AND THANKS FOR THE QUESTIONS I- I WANNA JUST DIVE BACK INTO THE JULY UM COMMENTARY SPECIFICALLY I APOLOGIZE TO KEEP HARPING ON THIS BUT JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THIS IS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE Y- UH JORGE ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU S- HAVE SEEN SO FAR IN JULY ON A TOTAL DOLLAR BASIS UH ACROSS THE BOOK IS SIMILAR TO 2019 IS THERE ANY WAY SPECIFICALLY TO TH- TO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT'S FACTORING INTO THE US IN PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF THE M- THE- THE QUANTITY OF DOLLAR BASIS VERSUS SOME OF THE OTHER GROWTH RATES WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SOME COUNTRIES THAT DID NOT HAVE ANY MEANINGFUL COVID SPIKES THAT COULD BE GROWING CLEARLY AT A FASTER <INAUDIBLE> YEAH UH MICHAEL THANKS FOR THE QUESTION WE- WE ARE STILL TRYING TO DIGEST ALL THE JULY NUMBERS UH THERE IS A LOT OF UH A LOT OF DATA TO LOOK AT FROM A PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE FROM A GEOGRAPHY PERSPECTIVE UH A- AS I- AS I INDICATED BEFORE UM JULY DEFINITELY TRENDED BETTER THAN JUNE UM SO UH THAT- THAT- THAT IS VERY GOOD UH BUT IT IS UH IT- IT DEPENDS ON THE REGION IT DEPENDS ON THE- ON THE GEOGRAPHY AND AT THIS O- ON- A- AND ON THE PRODUCTS AT THIS POINT I CAN'T GIVE YOU A BREAKDOWN UM BECAUSE UH THERE IS SOME- SOME ANALYTICS THAT WE NEED WE STILL NEED TO DO OVERALL UM THE UM THE- THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO UH IS- IS GETTING CLOSER TO UH ' 19 NUMBERS AND IN SOME INSTANCES UH I- IT DID BETTER THAN UH THAN 201 AND UH AND- AND THAT IS UH DEFINITELY A SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT UH VERSUS- VERSUS JUNE YEAH AND THEN JUST ONE MORE QUESTION O- ON ALIGNERS HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY THAT YOU'RE GONNA GO FORWARD WITH I KNOW A LOT OF IT WAS TIED HISTORICALLY TO THE INTEGRATION YOU HAD UM WITH OMNICAM AND- AND WITH- AND WITH CEREC AND- AND EVERYTHING AND A- AS YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU COMPETE Y- YOU KNOW EVERY ALIGNER SEEMS TO HAVE ITS OWN SPECIFIC ANGLE ON WHAT MAKES IT BETTER WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT SURESMILE WILL SHAKE OUT AS WHAT MAKES IT BETTER THE BEST OR WHAT X-RAY <INAUDIBLE> OFFICE DIFFERENTIATES THE NAME WITH EVERYONE ELSE YEAH THANKS MICHAEL I- I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S OUR SYSTEM UM LOOK BETWEEN OMNI AND PRIMESCAN UH YOU KNOW WE THINK WE'VE GOT A PRETTY INSTALLED BASE UH WE- WE HAVE A VERY LOYAL USER GROUP THERE THAT IS LOOKING TO PRACTICE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THEIR LICENSE SO WHEN WE CAN ADD SOMETHING THAT'S INTEGRATED AND SEAMLESS LIKE SURESMILE INTO- INTO THE PACKAGE AND PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAME OUT WITH UH SURESMILE 7.6 UH IT AND IT- IT'S REALLY SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED UH INTO Y- YOU KNOW OUR BASE UH DIGITAL ASSETS IT- IT BECOMES REALLY EASY TO USE AND YOU KNOW WE FEEL WITH 7.6 YOU KNOW WE'RE NOW ABLE TO COMPETE ACROSS THE BROAD- BROAD PORTFOLIO INTO CLASS ONE CLASS TWO CLASS THREE UH WE- WE THINK THAT OUR TREATMENT PLANNING UH SOFTWARE IS SECOND TO NONE I MEAN WE- WE FEEL IT'S UH UH REALLY REALLY COMPETITIVE AND UM YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE CLINICAL RESULTS WE'RE SEEING AND AS WE GO INTO UH Y- YOU KNOW KIND OF OUR INSTALLED BASE WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW UM A- AND LOOK EVERY SINGLE DAY UH WE GET BETTER AND BETTER AT BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT DENTSPLY SIRONA NOT AS- AS INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT COMPANIES WHERE WE'RE SITTING THERE SAYING HEY WE'RE GONNA GO SELL YOU AN OMNI WE'RE GONNA GO SELL YOU A PRIME AND THEN OH BY THE WAY MAYBE NEXT WEEK SOMEBODY WILL COME IN WITH SURESMILE NO IT'S- IT'S REALLY W- R- WE'VE BEGUN TO FOCUS MUCH MORE ON HOW DO WE UH FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER AS- AS ONE COMPANY AND- AND AS PART OF THAT ONE COMPANY APPROACH STUFF LIKE UH DS1 UH YOU KNOW 1DS EXCUSE ME UH WE REALLY ARE GOING IN AND SAYING HEY LOOK HOW- HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT USING THESE DIGITAL ASSETS TO YOU KNOW W- MAKE LIFE EASIER AROUND DOING ORTHODONTICS WITH CLEAR ALIGNERS HOW DO YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IMPLANTS DIFFERENTLY AND- AND AGAIN WE'RE- WE'RE WORKING HARD TO ACTUALLY BRING THIS IDEA THAT- THAT WE'RE THE DENTAL SOLUTIONS COMPANY TO REALITY DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SIR YES <CROSSTALK> MICHAEL WE LOST YOU NO STILL HERE THANKS THANKS FOR THE COMMENT THANK YOU AND OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM JASON UM BEDNAR WITH PIPER SANDLER PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING UH THANKS FOR TAKING THE QUESTIONS HERE UH DON AND JORGE UH THANKS FOR ALL THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN COVER UH WONDERING IN THE ORTHODONTIC BUSINESS I MEAN YOU- YOU'VE MENTIONED HERE A FEW TIMES LEVERAGING THE CEREC INSTALLED BASE WITH CLEAR ALIGNERS UH I THINK IT MAKES A TON OF SENSE BUT I MEAN SHOULD WE INTERPRET YOUR CEREC COMMENTS TO BE THAT YOU'RE- YOU'RE GONNA BE EMPHASIZING SURESMILE PRINCIPALLY IN THE GP CHANNEL OR DO YOU HAVE A STRATEGY TO CONTINUE TO TARGET THE ORTHODONTIST CHANNEL THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAME CEREC OWNER BASE YEAH UM LOOK WE- W- WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE SURESMILE INTO THE ORTHODONTIST OFFICE AND- AND THE GP OFFICE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A- AGAIN WE WANNA PLAY TO OUR STRENGTHS AND WE- WE DO HAVE A LARGE INSTALLED BASE AND WHEN WE DO PROGRAMS LIKE 1DS UH WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE- WE'RE OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO PACKAGE UH YOU KNOW WORKFLOWS TOGETHER IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE'RE THAT THERE'S REAL BENEFIT TO THE DENTIST WE'RE SEEING MORE SUCCESS THERE SO LOOK WE WILL CONTINUE TO PITCH UH SURESMILE ACROSS BOTH THE ORTHODONTICS- ORTHODONTIC AS WELL AS THE GP CHANNEL UM WE THINK WE'VE GOT MORE INNATE ADVANTAGES IN THE- IN THE GP CHANNEL RIGHT NOW THAT'S HELPFUL OKAY AND THEN I UH WANTED TO ASK ACTUALLY A NEW PRODUCT QUESTION HERE ACTUALLY PARTIALLY RELATED TO THE PRIOR QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE THE POLICY HERE NOT TO DISCUSS NEW PRODUCTS BEFORE THEY'RE OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED UM BUT INSTEAD OF TALKING SPECIFICALLY TO THE RECENTLY APPROVED LARGE FIELD OF VIEW IMAGING SYSTEM OR UH MAYBE ANY 3D PRINTING PLANS YOU MIGHT HAVE WITH PRIMEPRINT UH MAYBE YOU COULD TALK TO WHAT YOU SEE IN THE- IN THE MARKET FROM AN OPPORTUNITY OR A DEMAND PERSPECTIVE FOR EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES UM EACH OF LARGE FIELD OF VIEW AND ALSO IN OFFICE 3D PRINTING THANKS UH ON YOU KNOW WIDE FIELD OF VIEW I- I WE'RE FILLING A GAP IN OUR PORTFOLIO UM THAT YOU- YOU KNOW WE- W- IT TOOK US A LITTLE WHILE TO GET THERE BUT WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH YOU KNOW OUR ORTHOPHOS SL AND OUR <UNK> UH AND NOW WIDE FIELD OF VIEW WE- WE FEEL THAT WE'RE VERY COMPETITIVE IN THE IMAGING SPACE AND UH YOU KNOW UH NOW IN TERMS OF WHERE DO WE THINK ABOUT THE MACRO DEMAND UH FOR IMAGING EQUIPMENT AGAIN UH S- YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND- AND AGAIN THE PANDEMIC REALLY STARTED YOU KNOW AT THE END OF UH THE FIRST QUARTER AND WE'VE SEEN REGIONS BEGIN TO RECOVER UH YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN GOOD SOLID DEMAND A- ACROSS THE BOARD IN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT AND UH YOU KNOW IT'S WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE WIDE FIELD OF VIEW IT- IT'S REALLY NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT Y- YOU KNOW I'M JUST REPLACING MY X-RAY MACHINERY IT'S- IT'S WHAT PROCEDURES DO I WANNA DO AND YOU KNOW WIDE FIELD OF VIEW AND- AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT 2D AND 3D UH KIND OF IMAGING PRODUCTS IT LETS YOU DO MORE PROCEDURES IT LETS YOU DO BETTER IMPLANTS IT LETS YOU DO BETTER ENDO IT LETS YOU DO BETTER ORTHODONTIA SO UM YOU KNOW WE- WE THINK THE DEMAND YOU KNOW IS IT GONNA GYRATE A LITTLE BIT AS WE RECOVER FROM THE PI- PANDEMIC IT- IT COULD BUT UH YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN DEMAND REMAIN PRETTY SOLID ON THERE AND IN- IN TERMS OF- OF PRINTING YOU KNOW WE- WE HAVEN'T REALLY DISCUSSED THAT AND YOU KNOW LOOK OUR- OUR ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN- IN UM IN THIS SPACE UH YOU KNOW VERSUS OTHER MED DEVICE SPACES WHERE YOU CAN REALLY PUT YOUR PIPELINE OUT UH YOU KNOW WE- WE TEND TO PLAY THINGS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE VEST UH WHAT- WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU IS THAT OUR NEW PRODUCT PORTFOLIO WORK HAS BEEN ONE OF YOU KNOW WE KEPT SAYING IN THE PREPARED REMARKS YOU KNOW WE STAYED FOCUSED ON OUR KEY STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WELL ONE OF THOSE IS NEW PRODUCTS AND UH YOU KNOW TH- WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON INTERNALLY IS HOW DO WE TAKE THE- THE FIVE TO 10 MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCTS WHETHER THAT'S IN THE ENDO OR IMPLANT OR IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT SPACE AND KEEP MAKING PROGRESS ON IT AND- AND WE YOU KNOW ARE WE'RE NOT BACKING OFF ON WHAT WE THINK OUR LAUNCH SCHEDULE IS ON SOME OF THOSE MAJOR LAUNCH- LAUNCHES AND- AND YOU KNOW AGAIN WE THINK IT POSITIONED US WELL AS- AS PEOPLE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH GUYS THANKS JASON THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM ELIZABETH ANDERSON WITH EVERCORE PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING GUYS UM I JUST WAS WONDERING IF WE IF YOU COULD HELP US PUT SOME NUMBERS AROUND UH THE NEW ORTHO STRATEGY UM CAN YOU TALK ABOUT UM THE VOL- Y- YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT HOW YOU SAW VOLUMES TREND WITHIN ORTHODONTICS AND THEN ALSO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE REVENUE BASE AND G- OR AND/OR GROWTH RATES WOULD BE HELPFUL JUST IN TERMS OF FRAMING THAT OPPORTUNITY ON A GO FORWARD BASIS THANK YOU YEAH THANKS ELIZABETH UM YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY WE- WE- WE HAVEN'T BROKEN OUT UH YOU KNOW THE TOTAL ORTHODONTIA BUSINESS AND WE DON'T GIVE UH THE CLEAR ALIGNER NUMBERS SPECIFICALLY WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU IS THAT UH WHAT WE'VE SEEN UH OVER THE LAST YEAR IS ACCELERATING GROWTH BEHIND SURESMILE UH AND- AND WE'VE SEEN ACTUALLY VERY POSITIVE TRENDS EVEN COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE ABOUT THAT DECISION UM UH LOOK WE- WE FEEL THAT UH DENTSPLY SIRONA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A SOLID NUMBER TWO IN THE SPACE AND WE'RE GONNA WORK TOWARD THAT UM SO YOU- YOU KNOW CAN DO SOME MATH AROUND THAT UH LOOK ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW WE- WE'VE BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT SAYING WE WANNA GROW AND WE WANNA DO MARGIN ACCRETIONS SO THE STEPS WE'RE TAKING AROUND GETTING OUT OF THE TRADITIONAL ORTHO BUSINESS AND REALLY FOCUSING ON CLEAR ALIGNERS HELPS US DO THAT SO Y- YOU KNOW W- OUR- OUR BET AND BELIEF IS THAT THE CLEAR ALIGNER SPACE IS- IS GONNA BE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR AGGREGATE GROWTH RATE OVER TIME OKAY PERFECT THAT'S HELPFUL AND THEN YOU KNOW GIVEN OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS HAVE A PRETTY UM SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY POSITION RIGHT NOW HOW DO YOU SEE THAT PLAYING OUT IF YOU SORT OF ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WE'RE THROUGH THE WORST OF COVID AND THINGS CONTINUE TO UH IMPROVE FROM HERE UH YEAH GOOD MORNING LISTEN OUR- OUR CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT PHILOSOPHIES UM A- ARE NOT CHANGING HAVE NOT CHANGED I THINK UH IT WAS UH ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING TO UH RAISE MORE LIQUIDITY TO UH BE IN A POSITION OF A STRENGTH FROM A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT UH WE WERE ENCOURAGED ACTUALLY BY UH A NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDERS TO- TO BE IN THAT POSITION WHICH WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH AT THIS POINT WE WANT TO UM KEEP UH DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING BEING VERY FLUENT WITH OUR BALANCE SHEET BEING UH VERY DILIGENT WITH OUR CASH FLOW UH YOU PROBABLY NOTICED IN THE- IN THE SECOND QUARTER WE HAD A VERY STRONG OPERATING CASH FLOW GOT VERY GOOD FREE CASH FLOW AND UM ALL OUR PARTS OF OUR DEPLOYMENT UH WILL YOU KNOW ARE- ARE NOT CHANGING FOR NOW WE PAID- PAID OUR DIVIDENDS UM AND WE HAVE NO PLANS TO CHANGE OUR DIVIDEND AT THIS TIME ONCE UH THINGS GO BACK TO UH TO A MORE UH NORMAL LEVEL UH WE'LL REASSESS WHERE WE ARE AT THAT POINT WE WILL LOOK AT ALL OF THE UH DEMANDS FOR CAPITAL UH OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE AT THAT TIME AND UH WE'LL MAKE UH WHATEVER DECISIONS WE THINK ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS AS WE DEPLOY THAT CAPITAL UH BUT FOR NOW I THINK THE- THE FOCUS IS ON- O- ON THE RECOVERY IS HOW UH TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY STABLE FINANCIAL POSITION UH HOW WE ARE ABLE TO UH FUND UH STRATEGIC INITIATIVES SOME OF UH WHICH UH DON HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT UH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN IN A LOW REVENUE ENVIRONMENT UH AND LOW PROFITABILITY ENVIRONMENT WE- WE- WE KEEP FUNDING THOSE INITIATIVES AND- AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE UH WE HAVE THAT- THAT- THAT CAPITAL WE- WE WANT TO KEEP INVESTING IN THE ORGANIC GROWTH OF THE COMPANY UH FOR THE TIME BEING OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S HELPFUL THANKS ELIZABETH THANKS ELIZABETH THANK YOU AND OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM STEVE <UNK> WITH <UNK> RESEARCH PLEASE GO AHEAD UH HI GOOD MORNING AND- AND THANKS FOR THE TIME HERE UH I WANTED TO ASK ONE VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION AND THEN ONE KINDA BIG PICTURE QUESTION UH THE SPECIFIC ONE IS ACTUALLY ABOUT GERMANY UH I WONDER YOU KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT YOU'D BE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT GROWTH IN GERMANY OPERATING CONDITIONS THERE UH AND- AND TO WHAT EXTENT YOU THINK THAT UH A GOOD BAROMETER FOR YOU KNOW WHAT THE BUSINESS MIGHT LOOK LIKE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS IN THE EVENT THAT WE YOU KNOW WE GET THE VIRUS UNDER- UNDER CONTROL AND THEN I HAVE A- A- A FOLLOW-UP ON STRATEGY AFTER THAT YEAH THANKS STEVE UM YOU KNOW CONDITIONS IN GERMANY ARE- ARE UH IF- IF YOU WERE GONNA GO AROUND THE WORLD ARE PRETTY GOOD UM Y- YOU KNOW A- AND AGAIN I THINK JORGE SAID IT WELL THAT IT DE- IT DEPENDS ON THE BUSINESS AND Y- Y- YOU KNOW UH UH TH- THERE'S BEEN DIFFERENT REACTIONS TO DIFFERENT UH DIFFERENT BUSINESSES AND- AND WE KINDA LOOK AT <INAUDIBLE> TOGETHER WHICH IS YOU KNOW GERMANY UH SWITZERLAND AND- AND AUSTRIA UH BUT- BUT CONDITIONS THERE IF IT IF THAT'S A HARBINGER OF THE FUTURE UH WOULD- WOULD TELL YOU THAT UH YOU KNOW THINGS DO GET CLOSER TO NORMAL I MEAN THERE'S OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW AGAIN THE SAME THINGS WE SEE OVER HERE UH THAT WE KEEP TRACKING IS WHAT'S OFFICE CAPACITY YOU KNOW AROUND THE NEW INFECTION PROTOCOLS AND AGAIN THAT KEEPS GETTING BETTER UH Y- YOU KNOW THINGS ARE BETTER IN JULY THAN THEY WERE IN JUNE JUST AS- AS THE UH DENTIST AND THEIR STAFF GET MORE USED TO THAT AND THEN PATIENT ATTITUDES UH IT'S INTERESTING THE- THE UH THE PATIENT TRACKING THAT WE DID IN GERMANY SHOWED UH THAT YOU KNOW TH- THE FROM A PATIENT PERSPECTIVE THERE WAS LESS CHANGE IN UH GERMANY THAN THERE WAS IN THE US AROUND UH THE PANDEMIC SO THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A UH STABLE ATTITUDE TOWARD VISITING THE DENTIST'S OFFICE SO YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY IF- IF THINGS LOOK LIKE GERMANY IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT UH THINGS DO GET BACK TO NORMAL OKAY MUCH APPRECIATED AND THEN DON I- I WANTED TO- TO BORROW FROM- FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE A LITTLE BIT IF I COULD YOU- YOU'RE A- YOU'RE A MED TECH GUY AND YOU CAME INTO DENTAL WITH UH A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE INDUSTRY COULD BE AND YOU KNOW HOW BUSINESSES COULD RUN AND COVID HAS CERTAINLY IT CHANGED YOU KNOW SOME OF THAT THINKING I- I WONDER AS YOU- Y- YOU KEEP YOUR MED TECH HAT ON AND- AND YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT THE BUSINESS TO LOOK LIKE AND YOU KNOW HOW PRACTICE EVOLVES YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT YOU KNOW HOWEVER MANY QUARTERS OR UH OR MONTHS AND WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A NEW POST- COVID NORMAL HOW IS YOUR THINKING UH HOW HAS YOUR THINKING EVOLVED IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT THE BUSINESS TO BE WHAT YOU THINK THE PRACTICE LOOKS LIKE UH I KNOW YOU HAVE A- A FOCUS ON DIGITAL YOU KNOW THAT WAS THERE BEFORE UH CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A SENSE FOR MAYBE WHAT YOU MIGHT'VE LEARNED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND HOW YOUR THINKING HAS EVOLVED ON THAT FUTURE STRATEGIC UH VISION THANK YOU THANKS STEVE UM Y- YOU KNOW I- I- I THINK WHAT COVID HAS DONE HAS B- HAS BROUGHT INTO SHARPER FOCUS WHAT I THINK UH THE INDUSTRY IS GONNA NEED TO BE AND UH YOU KNOW WHETHER IT GETS THERE IN TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS UM I- I THINK IT'S GONNA ACCELERATE A- A COUPLE OF TRENDS I MEAN THE FIRST IS THAT YOU KNOW I- I THINK DSOS UH ARE- ARE GOING TO PICK UP UH YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN THE- IN THE- IN THE IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM BUT I- I THINK UH IF- IF YOU LOOK AT IN EUROPE UH AND THE US AND- AND EVEN IN PLACES IN ASIA PACIFIC WHERE THE PANDEMIC EXPOSED YOU KNOW SOMETIMES UH SOME OF THE OFFICES ARE- ARE KIND OF RIGHT ON THE MARGIN AND THE DENTIST MAY FEEL IT'S BETTER TO PRACTICE IN A LARGER GROUP SO I THINK THERE- THERE YOU- YOU MAY SEE A SHIFT THAT WAY I THINK THE SECOND BIG THING IS Y- YOU KNOW THE- THE IDEA OF UH WHEN YOU SAY DIGITAL I- I PUSH DIGITAL PRETTY HARD UH IN- IN MY MIND WHAT- WHAT I THINK WHETHER IT'S THE DSO'S OR THE INDIVIDUAL DENTISTS ARE GONNA BE DOING IS THEY'RE REALLY GONNA BE EVALUATING THEIR PRACTICE MORE CRITICALLY AND I THINK COVID UH BROUGHT THAT INTO SHARP FOCUS THAT HEY LOOK I'VE GOT 40 HOURS TO SEE PATIENTS HOW AM I UH ALLOCATING TIME AGAINST PROCEDURES UH AND- AND- AND HOW AM I THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT PROCEDURES CAN I DO AND WHAT PROCEDURES DO I REALLY WANNA DEVELOP WITHIN THE PRACTICE AND I'M GONNA AD- UH I'M GONNA ADDRESS THAT ACCORDINGLY FROM THE EQUIPMENT AND WHERE I EMPHASIZE UM YOU KNOW OUR TRAINING AND- AND WHATNOT SO YOU KNOW UH I- I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH CLEAR ALIGNERS IS- IS SOMETHING UH THAT'S GONNA GO INTO THE REST OF DENTISTRY UH Y- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IMPLANTS UH WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EVEN UH BASIC ENDO WORK I- I THINK THE INCREASED DIGITIZATION OF DIAGNOSTICS AND- AND HOW THAT CAN HELP UH DENTISTS PRACTICE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THEIR LICENSES IS- IS- IS- IT'S- IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE SO I WOULD- I WOULD SAY STEVE UH I DON'T THINK ANYTHING'S DRAMATICALLY CHANGED UH STRATEGICALLY WHAT I THINK IT- IT'S- IT- Y- YOU KNOW AND- AND YOU READ ALL THE BOOKS AND YOU KNOW AFTER MAJOR DISRUPTIONS AND DISLOCATIONS YOU TEND TO SEE NEW TRENDS GO I- I THINK WHAT MIGHT'VE TAKEN A DECADE BECAUSE DENTAL TENDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT SLOWER THAN WHAT- WHAT WE SAW IN MED TECH UH I THINK IS GONNA ACCELERATE PRETTY DRAMATICALLY I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THANKS FOR ALL THE UH THE HELP HERE ALL RIGHT THANKS STEVE STAY SAFE THANK YOU AND OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM JOHN KREGER WITH WILLIAM BLAIR PLEASE GO AHEAD HI THANKS VERY MUCH UH DON CURIOUS COULD YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE UH YOUR INTEGRATION EFFORTS AND UH I- I'M SURE COVID HAS IMPACTED THEM A LITTLE BIT BUT YOU HAD A PRETTY LONG LIST ACROSS COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING AND R&D JUST KIND OF GIVE US A SENSE ABOUT WHERE THAT STANDS AND TO WHAT DEGREE THE PANDEMIC HAS KIND OF ALTERED THE- THE THINKING AROUND THEM UM Y- Y- YOU KNOW JOHN UH FIRST THANKS FOR THE QUESTION Y- YOU KNOW WHEN I- I WOULD SAY WHEN WE OUTLINED THINGS IN NOVEMBER OF UH ' 18 YOU KNOW WE KINDA SAID IT WAS A THREE-YEAR PROGRAM UM I- I WOULD SAY THAT UH AND PARTICULARLY WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WE MADE THIS MORNING A- AROUND TRADITIONAL ORTHO AND ANALOG LAB UH I- IT KIND OF POINTS TO THE FACT THAT WE'RE PUSHING A LITTLE BIT FASTER AND WE'RE PUSHING HARDER I THINK THE UH PANDEMIC HAS ACCELERATED OUR- OUR THINKING AND UM Y- YOU KNOW UH LOOK WHEN YOU- WHEN YOU SEE THE REVENUE UH CHALLENGES IN THE SECOND QUARTER IT- IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO GET AFTER EVEN FASTER SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU UM UH I- I W- IT- IT'S REALLY INTERESTING INTERNALLY UH WE KEEP TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE HEY LOOK IT'S NOT AS IF WE'RE GONNA GET THE RESTRUCTURING DONE AND THEN THAT'S IT UH YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT CHANGING EVER AGAIN SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONDITION THE ORGANIZATION TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A MARATHON AND- AND UH YOU KNOW THE RESTRUCTURING MIGHT HAVE- HAVE BEEN ONLY THE FIRST 10K OF THAT UH SO UH LOOK I- I- I WOULD TELL YOU IN TERMS OF THE PLAN WE LAID OUT WE'RE- WE'RE UH MORE THAN HALFWAY DONE UM BUT I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU UH B- UH YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT AS I BROUGHT IN A NEW TEAM WITH PEOPLE LIKE JORGE WE'VE GOT A TERRIFIC SUPPLY CHAIN LEADER WE'VE ACTUALLY NOW GOT ALL THE UH COMMERCIAL PEOPLE REPORTING INTO ONE PE- ONE PERSON WALTER PETERSON UH WE'RE FINDING MORE AND MORE STUFF THAT WE THINK THAT WE CAN UH IMPROVE ON THAT SHOULD HAVE Y- YOU KNOW R- R- REALLY DELIVER THE PROMISE OF WHAT DENTSPLY SIRONA SHOULD BE SO Y- YOU KNOW LOOK SPECIFICALLY HEY UH YOU KNOW IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A THREE-YEAR RESTRUCTURING W- YOU KNOW WE'RE- WE'RE SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF WHERE WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT WE'RE COMMIT OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS COMMITTED TO AS SOON AS WE GET DONE THAT RESTRUCTURING WE'RE- WE'RE NOT STOPPING WE'RE HOW DO WE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE UH THAT'S GREAT THANKS AND- AND THEN ONE LAST QUESTION HOW WAS YOUR IMPLANT PORTFOLIO PERFORMING HOW DID IT DO IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND UH ARE Y- ARE YOU RETHINKING THAT LINE UP AT ALL UH IMPLANTS IS UH YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN HAPPY WITH OUR IMPLANT BUSINESS UM I- I WOULD TELL YOU UH Y- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAY THE SECOND QUARTER JOHN IT- IT'S- IT'S AN INTERESTING CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF WHAT LANGUAGE DO YOU USE YOU KNOW IMPLANTS DID WELL RELATIVE BUT YOU KNOW VERSUS PRIOR YEAR UH Y- YOU KNOW ACROSS THE WHOLE PORTFOLIO WAS CHALLENGING UM W- AS WE TALK AND THINK RETHINK ABOUT OUR PORTFOLIO YOU KNOW LOOK WE- WE THINK WE- WE'VE STARTED TO ACTUALLY GET OUR NEW PRODUCTS WHERE WE NEED TO GET THEM UM YOU KNOW OB- OBVIOUSLY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR IMMEDIATE LOAD ASTRA EV PRODUCT AND- AND I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST OF WHAT YOU'LL SEE A- A PRETTY UH REGULAR SET OF INTRODUCTIONS OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS IN OUR- IN OUR IMPLANT SPACE THAT ARE GONNA REALLY LET US BE COMPETITIVE THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING UH WITH IMPLANTS THAT YOU KNOW DOESN'T GET A LOT OF HIGHLIGHT IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A- A- A BUSINESS MIS THAT WE HAD BOUGHT A COUPLE YEARS BACK WHICH LETS US PLAY A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVELY IN THE VALUE SEGMENT AND UH AS- AS WE'VE BEEN RETHINKING HOW WE APPROACH COMMER- OUR COMMERCIAL GO-TO MARKET STRATEGY ACROSS ALL DENTSPLY SIRONA INCLUDING UM IMPLANTS BEING ABLE TO INTEGRATE THAT AND EXPAND THAT BEYOND THE BASE OF- OF WHAT THEY USED TO OPERATE IN WHEN WE BOUGHT THEM IS HAS BEEN BENEFICIAL THERE SO YOU KNOW WE FEEL THAT IMPLANTS REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITY FOR US I WOULD SAY THAT UM YOU KNOW WE'RE STARTING TO GET THE PORTFOLIO WHERE WE NEED TO GET IT UH I'M EXTREMELY UH EXCITED ABOUT WHAT I THINK THE- THE NEW PRODUCTS UH IN THAT SPACE ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO UH DELIVER FOR US YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT YOU KNOW COUPLE YEARS SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM JON BLOCK WITH STIFEL PLEASE GO AHEAD UH THIS IS TREVOR ON FOR JON THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS UM SO YOU I THINK YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT YOUR PATIENT TRACKING IS SAYING THAT Y- CON- UH PATIENT CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN CONTINUING TO GO UP RECENTLY I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY DETAIL YOU CAN GIVE THERE ON JUST LIKE HOW THAT'S SHAKEN OUT GEOGRAPHICALLY AND IF THERE'S A READ-THROUGH TO YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY SOME OF YOUR JULY COMMENTS UM YOU KNOW THROUGH THAT CONFIDENCE LEVEL YEAH SURE THANKS TREVOR UM A COUPLE THINGS I- I MEAN FIRST WE'RE- WE'RE DOING PATIENT TRACKING A- ACROSS THE ENTIRE GLOBE UH AND- AND AGAIN WE- WE'VE SEEN CONSISTENT IMPROVEMENT A- AROUND YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKELY TO VISIT THE DENTIST AND- AND WE MEASURE LIKELY TO VISIT IN THE- IN THE YOU KNOW THE NEXT 30 DAYS THE NEXT QUARTER AND WHATNOT SO WE'VE BEEN SEEING CONSISTENT IMPROVEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD THERE INTERESTINGLY THERE'S A KIND OF A SUBGROUP PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO THE DENTIST HAVE HAD REALLY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AROUND HOW PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW ADJUSTING WAITING ROOM OR UH YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE ADDRESSING INFECTION PROTOCOLS SO WE SEE THAT GROUP AS PRETTY POSITIVE UM ONE- ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE TRYING TO WATCH AS THEY WERE KINDA THE FLARE-UPS IN THE US IN- IN PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIES WHETHER THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DROP-OFF IN- IN PATIENT CONFIDENCE AND WE DIDN'T SEE THAT SO Y- YOU KNOW LOOK I- I AND- AND BY THE WAY UH WHILE MOST OF THE PATIENT DATA IS GOOD THERE IS SOME RELUCTANCE ON YOU KNOW KIND OF A- A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION TO SAY YOU KNOW AM I GONNA GO BACK IN THE NEXT MONTH VERSUS DO I INTEND TO GO BACK TO THE DENTIST IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A LAG THERE UM THAT- THAT WE SEE UH PARTICULARLY IN THE US BUT WE DON'T SEE IT UH ELSE- ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD SO PATIENT- PATIENT TRACKING HAS BEEN ACTUALLY A GOOD LEAD INDICATOR AND- AND A- AGAIN WE'RE- WE'RE SEEING UM WE'RE SEEING SOME GOOD POSITIVE THINGS THERE YEAH THANK YOU AND THEN JUST ONE MORE ON DSOS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN HEARING THAT DSOS IN LARGE PRACTICES ARE TENDING TO PERFORM BETTER IN THIS ENVIRONMENT I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN SEEING AND IF YOU THINK THAT UM YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SMALLER UH MORE FRAGMENTED PRACTITIONERS COULD START TO PLAY CATCH-UP THERE AS WELL UM WE TO- TO BE HONEST TREVOR WE HAVEN'T SEEN A- A- A- A HUGE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE UH THE DSOS AND- AND THE INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT- THAT WE LOVE ABOUT THIS MARKET IS THAT YOU KNOW THE WHETHER THE YOU KNOW THERE'S 600,000 DENTISTS AR- AROUND THE WORLD UM AND UH AND THEY'RE INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEY'RE A LOT OF THEM ARE VERY VERY INVENTIVE AND CREATIVE ABOUT HOW THEY YOU KNOW GO AFTER AND- AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE REACHING OUT TO THEIR PATIENTS AND WHATNOT SO I- I UH LOOK DO I THINK ON THE MARGIN IF- IF SOMEBODY WAS CONSIDERING RETIRING IN A YEAR OR TWO AND- AND COVID HIT YOU KNOW DO THEY SIT THERE AND SAY MAY- NOW MAYBE IS THE TIME THAT I ACCELERATE THAT YEAH UH YOU- YOU MIGHT SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN A UH A SHARP CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF DENTAL PRACTICES THAT WE'RE DOING BUSINESS WITH AND Y- YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT UH WE- WE HAVEN'T SEEN A DROP-OFF IN THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF DENTAL PRACTICES IN KEY REGIONS POST- COVID SO WHEN WE- WHEN WE'RE WATCHING YOU KNOW WHEN WE SAY THINGS ARE 80% OPEN 90% OPEN 99 WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE UM THE NUMBER OF PRACTICES THAT WE'RE MEASURING THAT AGAINST CHANGE GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS TREVOR THANK YOU AND WITH- AND WITH THAT WE

during today's call, we make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results. we base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. our most recent form ten k lists some of those most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. and with that, i'd like to turn the program over to dan casey, chief Expensive executive officer dennis spirola thank you, john, and thank all of you for joining us today we hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy to start the call, i would like to acknowledge two groups that deserve both our gratitude and recognition the first is our customers throughout this pandemic, dennis and their staff have shown tremendous resilience where they're dealing with changing local regulations, adjusting to new safety protocols OR FINDING NEW WAYS TO HELP PATIENTS DENNIS ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE ADOPTED AND INNOVATED THEIR COMMITMENT TO THEIR PATIENTS IS INSPIRING THE SECOND GROUP IS THE EMPLOYEES OF DENNIS PLYMOUTH SARONA OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS THEY HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED IN TRULY UNPRECEDENTED WAYS THROUGHOUT THEY HAVE REMAINED FOCUSED ON SERVING OUR CUSTOMERS CREATIVELY ADDRESSING NEW CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONTINUING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON OUR CR Dentsu sarona and the culture we are building are truly our most important assets i would like to thank all of them around the world for their extraordinary efforts it is a privilege to lead such a committed and passionate group our call today will focus on four key areas the first is to outline our second quarter results the second is to provide some details on how our business has been performing as dennis offices reopen the third area provides the steps that dentsu sarona is taking the fourth area provides the steps that dentsu sarona is taking the fourth area provides the steps that dentsu sarona is taking the fourth area provides the steps that dentsu sarona is taking the fourth area provides the steps that dentsu sarona is taking the fourth area provides the steps that dentsu sarona is taking the fourth area provides the steps that dentsu sarona is taking the fourth area Taking to position the company for the future and finally, i will review the company's near-term priorities as we navigate the current environment. as expected, our second quarter results reflect the major changes in the market. the quarter began with significant governmental actions resulting in the shutdown of dental practices and restrictions on patient traffic. the situation improved across the quarter with month-to-month improvements in terms of dental office openings and patients beginning to come back our revenue followed this trend our team continues to track patient attitudes around returning to the dental office as well as the ongoing impact of additional infection control requirements on office capacity based on what we are seeing we are optimistic that the recovery is well underway globally our results in the quarter also reflect significant actions the company took to address the difficult operating environment these plans were built around employee safety meeting the needs of the customer, enhancing the financial strength of the company and making continued progress on our key strategic initiatives to date we have seen good results around employee safety and have not seen any major disruptions across the organization despite challenges presented by the pandemic, the company has been able to reliably meet customer demand our commercial team showed excellent creativity in adapting to new circumstances, providing an extensive array of digital clinical education and online Marketing events these programs have been extremely well received a comprehensive cost control program was executed during the second quarter involving furloughs short work weeks salary reductions and spending controls these efforts contributed to the drop in sga expenses in the quarter while the business has begun to restart this program will remain in place until the trajectory of the recovery is better understood our supply chain has been disciplined around inventory and there has been a real emphasis on protecting our cash flow. finally, the company undertook a series of actions to bolster its liquidity and financial position. while there is a pressing need to manage the disruptions caused by the pandemic, our team is focused on positioning the company for the future. since announcing a restructuring in late twenty eighteen, dentsu plc has made significant progress against the goals we had laid out. our work on continuously challenging ourselves has shown there is still further to go. Other opportunities to improve our performance therefore today we are announcing additional portfolio actions that expand on the original program these include plans for exiting the traditional orthodontics business as well as parts of our analog lab business i will discuss details later in the call these steps while difficult allow the company to focus on higher growth and higher margin digital areas where we believe densply ceramic has strategic advantage Moving to slide seven where we summarize our two q twenty results. second quarter revenues were four hundred and ninety one million dollars down fifty percent on an organic basis due to the impact of the coronavirus. adjusted operating income was negative non-gaap eps for the quarter was a loss of eighteen cents. cash flow was actively managed in the second quarter driving cash flow from operations of a hundred and seventy five million dollars which was up twenty one percent compared to prior year. Year, i will now turn the call over to jorge who will review the quarterly results and provide an outlook thank you, dan. and good morning, everyone. the second quarter was obviously a challenging one for the global economy and for many industries, including dental. on a slide nine, we show our second quarter non-gaap twenty twenty p and l starting with the top line organic sales were down fifty percent. percent as compared to the prior year in the u. s. and europe with some minor exceptions dental practices limited their activity to emergency procedures in april and much of may and then began to reopen as we moved into june as we share on our last earnings call we saw declines of sixty to eighty percent in april in certain geographies with the u. s. being hit the hardest but our revenue trends improved gradually each month finishing down about twenty percent forty percent compared to prior year in june we also saw a gradual improvement from the first to the last week in june so it is clear that we are seeing a recovery but have yet to get back to a normal level of sales gross profit was two hundred and seven million or forty two point one percent of sales down from fifty seven point seven percent in the prior year quarter as it is the case in sullen and material reductions in volume gross profit margin is impacted by the fixed cost base which is difficult to address in the short term examples of this cost include depreciation, leases, maintenance of manufacturing and logistic facilities and costs related to ensuring compliance with high manufacturing standards gross profit margin was also impacted by higher than average inventory reserve expenses of approximately seventeen million primarily as a result of the pandemic gross profit margin was also impacted by higher than average inventory reserve expenses of approximately seventeen million primarily as a result of the pandemic gross profit margin was also impacted by higher than average inventory reserve expenses of approximately seventeen million primarily as a result of the pandemic gross profit margin was also impacted by higher than average inventory reserve expenses of approximately seventeen million primarily as a result of the pandemic gross profit margin was also impacted by higher than average inventory reserve expenses Result of lower sales s. g. n. a. of two hundred forty nine million was down a substantial hundred thirty two million which is approximately thirty five percent lower as compared to prior year during the quarter we took decisive action to reduce our s. g. n. a. costs resulting in the steep year over year decline one area in s. g. n. a. that actually increased over last year was bad debt expense which saw an up take of fifteen million year over year this significant p and l fluctuations were driven by the ongoing market disruptions and generated an operating loss of forty two million in the quarter last year our operating profit was two hundred and twenty million in the second quarter interest and other increased by nine point nine million versus last year driven by the issuance of seven hundred and fifty million in long-term debt the addition of new credit facilities notice and determination of certain fx hedges the non-gap tax rate was twenty seven point five percent in the quarter up from twenty five point three percent in the prior year a function of the change in the estimated amount of pre-tax income and a change to the expected income mix non-gap eps was a loss of eighteen cents as compared to non-gap eps of sixty six cents in the prior year quarter. Moving on to slide ten, where we review our consumer segment performance. Reported sales were a hundred and eighty seven million, down fifty eight point six percent and down fifty seven point seven percent on an organic sales basis. All of our product groups in consumer were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices. While our consumer sales show, all of our product groups in consumer were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices. While our consumer sales show, all of our product groups in consumer were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices. While our consumer sales show, all of our product groups in consumer were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices. While our consumer sales show, all of our product groups in consumer were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices. While our consumer sales show, all of our A steeper decline than our t and e sales both segments actually perform relatively similar from an end customer perspective let me explain the two factors that contributed to the larger decline in our consumer sales first there's a difference in order lead times consumerables tend to match demand almost simultaneously up or down due to the nature of the products t and e has a longer order lead time and therefore deliveries continued over an extended period even after dental procedure volume was slowed down at the beginning of the quarter the second factor impacting consumables more than t and e is the fluctuations in inventory levels in the distributor network during severe market conditions it is typical for companies to preserve cash by lowering inventory balances as much as possible we so steeper decline in consumer goods network inventory so when you account for all of these variables, we believe both segments declined at relatively similar levels consumer goods operating margin was negative nine point four percent as compared to twenty seven percent in the second quarter of nineteen nineteen there are two primary reasons for the decline in consumer goods margins the first reason is that the consumer goods segment experienced a steeper fall off in sales compared to t and e second the consumables business is more plant and infrastructure dependent and requires more volume to run efficiently we have more manufacturing plants dedicated to consumables and this means a higher fixed infrastructure cost for this segment this is why we have been taking steps to consolidate our footprint and reduce our fixed cost base in the past couple of years we have completed several portfolio shaping actions including phona one eight hundred dentists, seacat and the surgical business of wellspeck in addition the two portfolio shaping activities we are announcing today will further consolidate our manufacturing footprint and will increase productivity and decrease fixed costs moving on to slide eleven where we highlight our technologies and equipment segment net sales were three hundred and four million down forty five point nine percent as compared to prior year organic sales for the quarter were down forty three point six percent versus the prior year equipment and instruments digital dentistry and implants all experienced similar levels of decline in the quarter driven by the lower sales resulting from covid nineteen our healthcare business saw a slight decline in q two after posting a strong q one as healthcare systems were getting ready for the first major major Average of covid nineteen technologies and equipment operating income margin was negative one point three percent versus seventeen point two percent in the prior year quarter on slide twelve we show our business performance for the second quarter on a regional basis u s. sales of hundred and thirty one million declined sixty point three percent compared to the prior year this represents a decline in organic sales of sixty point three percent compared to the prior year Sixty percent in the u. s. market, consumables declined slightly more than t and e european sales were two hundred and fifteen million down forty nine percent compared to the prior year organic sales were down forty six point nine percent versus last year in europe, consumable sales declined more than technologies and equipment on a percentage basis rest of the world sales were one hundred and forty four million down forty four percent and organic sales were down forty one point nine percent the rest of the world consumables declined more than ten percent in the same in the second quarter on slide thirteen we show our cash flow performance in the second quarter of twenty twenty cash flow from operations was one hundred seventy five million as compared to one hundred forty five million in the prior year quarter this is a strong cash flow from operations in the second quarter of twenty twenty cash flow from operations was one hundred seventy five million as compared to one hundred forty five million in the prior year quarter this is a strong cash flow from operations in the second quarter of twenty twenty cash flow from operations was one hundred seventy five million as compared to one hundred forty five million in the prior year quarter this is a strong cash flow from operations in the second quarter of twenty twenty cash flow from operations was one hundred The generation was the result of a disciplined approach to curtailing expenses and reducing working capital without sacrificing key strategic investments. Working capital generated a significant boost in liquidity in the quarter. We were successful in achieving meaningful reductions in accounts receivables and inventory balances. We expect some of this cash will be injected back into working capital as demand and production volumes climb. Back up to normal levels in terms of capital expenditures we spent thirteen million in the second quarter of twenty twenty down from twenty seven million last year free cash flow was a strong hundred sixty two million in the quarter up thirty seven percent as compared to hundred eighteen million in the prior year in the quarter we paid twenty two million in dividends for a total of one hundred eighty four million returned to shareholders To shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the first six months of twenty twenty at the end of june twenty twenty we had a strong liquidity available comprising one point one billion of cash and one point two billion of committed credit facilities the efforts we made during the second quarter ensure that we have ample liquidity available to invest and grow the company as the economy recovers on slide fourteen i'd like to talk about the significant actions we took to reduce operating expenses in the second quarter of twenty twenty our efforts to reduce costs in the quarter were multifaceted all levels and functions of the enterprise contributed to significant compensation savings each part of the organization up to and including the board of directors and executive levels stepped up and helped in these efforts as of today most of our employees who Were impacted by these measures have returned to work or to normal pay levels the next largest area for cost reductions was discretionary commercial spending such as advertising and promotions it was logical to reduce this spending when dental offices were closed and the returns could not be realized we also achieved significant savings from reductions in professional services and of course travel expenses together Further, all of these actions deliver a reduction in sgna of thirty five percent versus last year with respect to business transfers for the remainder of the year. i like to make a few comments. first, let me start with current volume trends. all regions recover from their low point in april and improve by twenty to forty percentage points by the end of the quarter. additionally, in june, the last week of the month was significant. significantly better than the first week and we are pleased to note that the positive momentum continues into july with july sales approaching or surpassing twenty nineteen levels depending on the region and product groups there are still some gaining factors in place including the availability of personal protection equipment new infection prevention protocols reducing office capacity and overlapping regulations all of which impact the shape of the recovery together, these factors point to a gradual as opposed to a sudden snap back in demand let me give you more details from a geographical perspective in the us, virtually all dental offices are now open and we continue to see signs of improvement with july volume trending better than what we saw in june in europe, we also saw july trends improving sequentially with regards to the rest of the world in apac, some of the markets turn positive in july with good traction in china and japan and some lingering concerns in australia latin america remains a challenging market as covid nineteen continues to impact our business in brazil and other countries in the region moving forward to the second half of the year, as we announced today, we are accelerating actions to fund growth areas and improve our business. Efficiencies as we did in q two, we will continue to drive a disciplined resource allocation process that emphasizes return on investment and sustainability of our growth initiatives. with that, i will now turn the call back to john. thanks, jorge, and moving to slide seventeen as i mentioned earlier in the call, in november twenty eighteen, we put a plan in place to accelerate growth, improve margins, and simplify the organization. our results through twenty nineteen, The first quarter of twenty twenty shows significant progress the execution highlights of our plan include accelerating growth behind new products including prime scan and prime mill as well as other new products in our consumable portfolio the pipeline of future new products has also been enhanced the company has made major investments in critical areas like our digital product portfolios digital commercial capabilities and growth priorities like our shure smile clear aligner business denspire serrano has implemented a new organizational structure centralizing supply chain and other functions while creating a unified commercial structure there have been major initiatives designed to transform the finance hr and it areas further we've undertaken multiple portfolio shaping activities including the ones announced today the restructuring plan is a multiyear initiative as part of that the organization has embraced the need Continue challenging ourselves to go beyond the original plan and deliver better results that work has shown there are significant opportunities in both the near term and longer term moving now to slide eighteen over the last several quarters as jorge mentioned we have exited several underperforming businesses these reduce our costs and complexity while serving to enhance our growth and margins the team continually reviews all our businesses against a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework of a framework Around future growth opportunities as well as strategic fit in the area of orthodontics, we believe that the clear aligner space is an attractive opportunity for dense plasma serum. shire's smile now offers a comprehensive digital treatment plan that positions the company well in this rapidly growing market. going forward, we will focus all our efforts in the ortho space on the clear aligner area. we believe this offers the opportunity to grow, innovate, and take advantage of many. Dense ply sarona's unique strategic advantages including our large syracuse community as a result we are exiting the traditional orthodontic business which includes brackets bands tubes and wires the traditional orthodontic business is a component of the technology and equipment segment and has had net sales of approximately a hundred and thirty two million in twenty nineteen likewise in our lab business there is a clear opportunity to focus on the digital This space which is showing good growth rates and solid margins is a place where innovation will be rewarded based on our analysis it is critical to focus all our lab resources in the digital area going forward as such we are announcing plans to exit the analog portion of the laboratory business that manufactures removable dentures and related products this business is a component of the consumables segment and had net sales of approximately forty four million in twenty. Nineteen nineteen together the portfolio-shaping initiatives and additional actions are expected to result in the closure of several facilities and an incremental reduction of approximately six to seven percent of the company's workforce by the end of twenty twenty one the ongoing execution of the restructuring will enhance denspree's serrano's continued efforts to grow revenues, expand our margins, and simplify the organization. Include executing on our comprehensive restructuring plan pursuing our growth initiatives aggressively and meeting our financial objectives in conclusion the covid pandemic will continue to impact our industry and our company for the foreseeable future current trends are positive and a reason for optimism but we will need to continue to adapt to the circumstances as they change we believe we have a comprehensive plan for both the short term and longer term to deliver value for our customers And our shareholders. further, the company has maintained its focus on our priorities around growth, margin expansion, and simplifying the business. our financial strength, broad portfolio, and global reach position us well to succeed and win in the dental industry. it's hard to know what the new normal is or when it will arrive, but our internal theme is that teeth do not heal themselves. our team is optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry. And we embrace the current challenges and are confident in our strategy, our customers and our team. thank you. and with that, we'll take questions. thank you. and ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, just press star then one to get in the queue to withdraw your question. simply press the pound or hash key. please stand by while we compile the q and a roster. our first question is from jeff johnson with bird. go ahead. Thank you, good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay? I think it was on mute there. Yeah, we we we got you, jeff. Great, good morning. So, dan, i think i just want to start with the july comments. i really want to understand maybe the message that you want to have out there. it sounds like you could make the argument that july was getting back towards flattish year over your levels, according to what jorge said. but how much of that might be sell in that was recovering? have some sell-in issues earlier in the quarter or earlier in two q does your sell-in is it starting to match kind of the sell-out at this point and again, i know you're not guiding, but for three q, should we think july maybe isn't sustainable as you get into august and september is if there is some backlog in it helping in that july number thanks yeah, thanks geoff i think correa said it clearly in the prepared remarks as we were as we're looking at july, there's places that that that's true Have, you know, we're seeing good progress in, in some cases, it's actually exceeding nineteen. your specific question about how much of that is, you know, inventory rebuild um, it's hard to see exactly. there's a couple of things we're looking at and um, you know, that's, that's one of the reasons we're not being, ok, let's just go project july into august, september, and then later in the fourth quarter. the things we're looking at is patient volume and we've seen that as good, office capacity. we see office capacity. Capacity kind of improving our patient tracking is telling us that confidence in the dentist's office continues to go up. but there is a pocket that's going to be reluctant at least in the u. s. to go back for a little while and what that in our mind means that ok look if if we're getting capacity in the in the dentist's office back to you know close to normal that's going to take a little bit of time i i think we're working through a bolus of patients right now and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and I THINK YOU KNOW FROM AN INVENTORY PERSPECTIVE OUR DEALERS AND THE DENNIS OFFICE ULTIMATELY ARE WORKING THROUGH THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED I THINK PEOPLE HIT THE BRAKES PRETTY HARD ON STUFF THAT'S ORDERED ALMOST EVERY DAY AND IN OUR MIND THAT'S KIND OF THE CONSUMABLE SPACE AND YOU CAN SEE JEFF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR CONSUMABLE AND TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW THAT THE T AND E SIDE AND WE BELIEVE THAT IS CLOSED YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO STOP BUILDING INVENTORY ON DAILY STUFF AND AS A RESULT THERE MAY BE SOME BUILD BACK HERE BUT LOOK I IN MY SUMMARY I WAS PRETTY CLEAR ON SAYING HEY LOOK WE WE'RE HAPPY THAT WE SAW YOU KNOW CONSECUTIVE MONTH TO MONTH SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL DEMAND WE'RE SEEING THAT AT THE RETAIL LEVEL WE'RE HAPPY THAT JULY HAS CONTINUED THAT TREND AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SEE THAT IN SOME CASES Actually tracking better than twenty nineteen. Understood, that's helpful. Thanks, Dan. And just as a follow-up, you know, thinking about twenty twenty one conceptually, you know, we all know what the ada's saying about high likelihood that dental consumption and dental industry-wide revenues are down relative to twenty nineteen levels. I don't think anybody would really argue at that, at least looking at things right now. But with some of the extra restructuring efforts you're taking now, some of the tailwinds from the restructuring that would probably be... Still continuing from the past plan you know how how do you think about margins especially next year can they get back to twenty nineteen levels with revenue that at least is approaching twenty nineteen levels next year or is there a lag in kind of the margin recovery relative to how we think about revenues next year thanks yeah jeff it's early for us to really forecast twenty twenty one i would tell you the steps we took around the restructuring though reflect that Select our interests and sitting there saying, hey, look, we need to get back on the margin progression. i mean, you know, we've we've been saying since november twenty eighteen how do we grow? how do we get our margins improving? and the thing, i think we have to take organizational steps to do it. i think the results here show that, you know, we, we think we've made some good progress. i mean, basically, through the first quarter of twenty twenty we were tracking on a margin basis. and, you know, what we've seen obviously are our interests are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are obviously are MARGIN IS REVENUE DEPENDENT AND YOU KNOW I HEY LOOK IF IF REVENUE'S DOWN TWENTY PERCENT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GONNA HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS WE DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BUT WE ARE TAKING SPECIFIC STEPS NOW TO SIT THERE AND SAY IRREGARDLESS OF OF YOU KNOW WHETHER THE CATEGORY IS UP TWO OR THREE OR DOWN TWO OR THREE OR YOU KNOW UP TEN DOWN TEN WE WANT TO BE TAK Those are all part of the ongoing restructuring designed to help us really take charge of our ability to drive margin increase going forward and i'm not gonna say it's gonna be revenue independent but we think we can take steps you know at a certain revenue base that we're really gonna be able to drive margin and and you know we we were very clear a you know i joke with john swan occasionally that we we picked our revenue targets to match the years just to make sure that we could always communicate it. We've always said twenty two in twenty twenty two you know are and internally what we're trying to focus on is look we think twenty two is is as attainable we don't know if it's going to happen exactly on the trajectory based on what we're seeing with covid you know is covid and the knock on effects of that is that a six month issue it's a nine months it's a twelve month issue but we want to be marching back toward that target it just may take us a little bit longer to get there Thank you. thank you. thank you. and our next question comes from tyco petersen with d p morgan. please go ahead. hey, um, are you able to talk about how much of the consumable pressure in the quarter was inventory destocking versus slower orders and and how much incremental risk is there going forward with distributors around potential additional destocking? good morning, tyco petersen with d p morgan. this is jorge. it is. it is. good morning, tyco petersen with d p morgan. this is jorge. it is. it is. good morning, tyco petersen with d p morgan. this is jorge. it is. it is. good morning, tyco petersen with d p morgan. this is jorge. it is. it is. good morning, ty It's hard to give any precise number. but as adam just indicated in the case of consumables there is a the the order lead time is very short and so when the pandemic hit customers and and dealers and in general in the marketplace there was a a reaction to to manage inventories very very closely and and when we look at the data of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of Retail sales and our sales uh there are a lot of indications that show that there was a reduction in the inventory levels that we historically or typically carry in the network. so there was an element of that and when that comes back to typical levels, it is hard to project some of that may be happening as as don't indicated but i don't think that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is something That for us is going to be meaningful from a long-term perspective. listen, at the end of the day, we always want to make sure that our sales match retail sales. that, that is, that is our key objective. that's how we we make money there will be always small fluctuations in the network up so i think in given the magnitude of the changes that we experience in the second quarter as a result of lower revenues and in the network up so i think in given the magnitude of the changes that we experience in the second quarter as a result of lower revenues and in the network up so i think in given the magnitude of the changes that we experience in the second quarter as a result of lower revenues and in the network up so i think in given the magnitude of the changes that we experience in the second quarter as a result of lower revenues and in the the uncertainty that we still have in many places i think that is that noise is not actually meaningful in terms of explaining our performance and our trajectory over the next several months ok and then down on the portfolio reshaping, i'm curious, you know, the decision to exit ortho, i always thought part of the pitch on the clearliner was, you know, the ability to go in and do hybrid cases and and you know, leverage that strong ortho channel as you push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push, So i'm curious if you know if there is risk of disinherities here and and how you think about that yeah, thanks tico um we're actually there's a component of the you know, the wire bending aspect of sure smile that we're keeping on what when we say how we kind of delineate traditional ortho which is kind of the brackets bands that would go straight up on a orthodontist an orthodontist using orthodontia the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the We believe hybrid is meaningful. we believe that it's it's a differentiator for shure. so we're actually keeping those components. so that piece of traditional orpheus and the piece that actually came with the uremetrics acquisition is going to stay with that and then you know what we're seeing is where we're getting real traction on shure smile tends to be our you know right now focused around our serac base you know we kind of made that shift basically in october of last year and that's part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the The one d s program and we're seeing good traction there. so as we look going forward, we didn't feel that there were going to be disincentives associated with getting out of traditional you know, orthodontia treatment among the orthodontist group. so you know, as we focus on growing in the future, you know, we tend to think all right, how do we take care of how do we take advantage of our digital assets and how do we really look at expanding in places that are not necessarily tied to kind of the traditional orthodontist group. launch and model. and then, just lastly, any thoughts on just the capital equipment appetite as we think about the back half of the year and think about, you know, prime scan and prime nail? can you just talk on to what degree you think there, there could be pent-up demand and any need on your part to be a little bit more flexible in terms of financing or pricing potentially? um, you know, it's been interesting, tigo, just even before the pandemic hit, we were really beginning to shift to one, you know, our theory of one visit dentistry and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and PRIME MILL AND THE SPEED OF PRIME MILL IT REALLY MADE THAT A REALITY. I MEAN YOU CAN GET PATIENTS IN AND OUT WITH A SINGLE UNITARY CROWN IN AN HOUR PLUS SO WE WE HAD MADE THAT SHIFT AND IT WAS INTERESTING. IN APRIL WHEN EVERYTHING WENT DOWN WE REALLY SHIFTED TO A BUNCH OF DIGITAL WHETHER IT WAS DATA PRODUCTIONS OR YOU KNOW KIND OF TAKING PEOPLE THROUGH WHAT ONE VISIT DENTISTRY REALLY MEANS AND WE GOT A PRETTY GOOD RECEPTION A good appetite in our mind for technology and equipment. now, whether it's spread across, you know, are we going to see treatment centers and are we going to see imaging, not sure, but we, we feel very good about prime scan and prime mill and the opportunity for dentists who are basically going to be dealing with a patient population that may be a little bit, hey, i do i want to go to the dentist three times in, in you know, during the pandemic to get a crown fixed or can i get that done one time? Also seeing a lot of dentists that we've been talking to, and we've been seeing a fair amount of success with saying, hey, look, i got to change how i practice, and they used the kind of the downtime during the pandemic to think through that. so we're we feel good about where we are from a technology and equipment space in the back half, and in a large part, it's due to first the new products we've pushed out, but also the change in messaging and how we're pitching them. so ultimately, and look, we're working with our dealers. Partners globally right now to make sure that we're helping dennis access this material. yeah. but we're do i do i see a whole bunch of pricing pressure and and you know crazy financing options coming on our technology and equipment no ok thank you thanks tyco thank you and our next question comes from stephen ballic with barclays please go ahead Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, a couple of quick questions for you. You know, first, your comment around july being a fairly flat year every year on a global basis is obviously pretty positive. and now you don't want to give any specific guidance, but just kind of eye ball the street consensus estimates for the third quarter. they call for revenues to be down some twenty to twenty five percent year over year. so i'm just wondering based on what you're seeing in july and barring any other major changes, on the landscape, is that and is there a number that seems like maybe that's too conservative on the revenue elicit as far as where we're consensus, it's just curious to get your thoughts around that. good morning, jorge here. listen, it is it is early for us to be able to extrapolate from the july numbers and as you can appreciate there is a lot of different data points coming from different regions and there are some markets that are doing well and some that are not. Much better in terms of the number of offices that are open markets that are good from a volume perspective we still have lingering concerns in places like australia, parts of latin america and there are some spots in in europe that are also still challenging so it is it is very hard to make a judgment with respect to those numbers. i think what we are what we're really encouraged by the fact that sequentially the last three months have been Moving in the right direction but from a planning perspective internally we are we are trying to we continue to work with scenario planning we we are preparing the company for for a multiple set of of outcomes in the next in the next few months and quarters i think it's a prudent thing to do so hard to tell you if that number is right or not okay that's helpful one other quick clarification question on the exiting of the traditional orthodontics in parts of the world Analog lab business are these businesses that could be monetized through asset sales or are they just full shutdowns? Maybe just give us a little more color around the decision tree on shutdown versus asset sale yeah steve um as you know, we look at it right now, we're making the announcement to get it done obviously we'll look to dispose the assets in the way that's most beneficial to the company if you know there's some asset sales we'll certainly look at it if it's a full shutdown we'll certainly look at it You know, we we gave you guys the the numbers based on you know the worst case scenario and obviously we're going to work to improve that but but again the process because you know we mentioned in the prepared remarks it's multiple plants in multiple locations obviously you start with the works council and and you go through a lot of different things but the numbers we gave you represent you know the base case and and we're going to work hard to improve versus that and there is the opportunity to to Better than what we said okay, i appreciate the extra color. thanks. thanks, dee. thank you. our next question is from michael cherny with bank of america. please go ahead. ah, good morning, and thanks for the questions. i want to just dive back into the july commentary specifically. i apologize to keep harping on this, but just want to make sure that this is as clear as possible. jorge, are you saying that what you have said So far in july on a total dollar basis across the book is similar to two nineteen and is there any way specifically to think about how that's factoring into the us in particular in terms of the the the quantity of dollar basis versus some of the other growth rates where there might be some countries that did not have any meaningful covid spikes that could be growing clearly a faster clip yeah michael thanks for the question we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are we are I think trying to digest all the july numbers there's a lot of a lot of data to look at from a product perspective, from a geography perspective as i as i indicated before july definitely trended better than june so that that that is very good but it is it depends on the region it depends on the on the geography and at this point i can't give you a breakdown Because there's some some analytics that we need we still need to do overall the the total portfolio is is getting closer to nineteen numbers and in some instances it did better than than twenty nineteen and and that is definitely a substantial improvement versus versus june and and then just one more question. A question on aligners, how do you think about the differentiation and strategy that you're going to go forward with? i know a lot of it was tied historically to the integration you had with omnicam and with and with serac and everything. and as you think about where you compete, you know, every aligner seems to have its own specific angle on what makes it better, where do you think that cheersmile will shake out as what makes it better, or the best, or what extras in office differentiate it from everyone else? Yeah, thanks, michael. i would say that it's our system. look, between omni and prime scan, you know, we think we've got a pretty good installed base. we, we have a very loyal user group there that is looking to practice at the highest level of their license so when we can add something that's integrated and seamless like shore smile into the package, and particularly when we came out with shore smile seven dot six, It's it's really seamlessly integrated into you know our base digital assets it becomes really easy to use and you know we feel with seven dot six you know we're now able to compete across the broad broad portfolio class one class two class three we we think that our treatment planning software is second to none i mean we feel it's it's really really competitive and and you know we're very comfortable with the clinical results we're seeing and as we go into To our installed base, we feel very good about that right now and look, every single day we get better and better at beginning to think about densify serrano not as as individual product companies where we're sitting there saying, hey, we're gonna go sell you an omni, we're gonna go sell you a prime and then, oh, by the way, maybe next week somebody'll come in with shure smile, no, it's really where we've begun to focus much more on how do we focus on the customer as, as one company and as part of that one company. Company approach stuff like d s one one d s excuse me we really are going in and saying hey look how do you think about using these digital assets to you know make life easier around doing orthodontics with clear liners how do you really think about implants differently and again we're working hard to actually bring this idea that that were the dental solutions company to reality Sorry, could that answer your question, sir? yes, michael, we've got it. no, still here. thanks. thanks for taking the questions. thank you. and our next question is from jason and bennett with piper sandler. please go ahead. good morning. thanks for taking the questions here. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don't know. don' construction plan color i wonder in the orthodontic business. i mean, you've mentioned here a few times, leveraging the serac install base with clear liners. i think this makes a ton of sense. but, should we interpret your serac comments to be that you're, you're going to be emphasizing shure smile principally in that gp channel? or do you have a strategy to continue to target the orthodontist channel that doesn't have that same serac owner base? yeah, look, we we're happy to take shure smile into the orthodontist office and the gp office. you know, we're happy to take shure smile into the orthodontist office and the gp office. you know, we're happy to take shure smile into the orthodontist office and the gp office What we're seeing is again we want to play to our strengths and we do have a large installed base and when we do programs like one d s where you know we're we're obviously trying to package you know work flows together in such a way that we're there's real benefit to the dentist we're seeing more success there so look we will continue to pitch sure smile across both the orthodontic orthodontic as well as the gp channel we think we've got more innate advantages in the gp channel right now So that's helpful okay and then i want to ask actually a new product question here i'm actually partially related to the prior question so i appreciate its policy here not to discuss new products before they're officially launched but instead of talking specifically to the recently approved large field of view imaging system or maybe any three d printing plans you might have prime print maybe you could talk to what you see in the in the market from an opportunity or a demand perspective for each of these categories each of large field of view and also in office Erin thanks on wide field of view it we're filling a gap in our portfolio that you know we it took us a little while to get there but we feel very good about that right now and if you look at what we've done with our orthos lens and our l line and now wide field of view we we feel that we're very competitive in the imaging space and you know now in terms of what do we think about the macro demand for imaging equipment Again i know if you look over the last six months and again the pandemic really started you know at the end of the first quarter and we've seen regions begin to recover you know we've seen good solid demand across the board in technology and equipment and you know it's when you start looking at things like wide field of view it's it's really not necessarily about i'm just replacing my x ray machinery it's what procedures do i want to do and wide field of view and particularly when And start looking at two d and three d kind of imaging products it lets you do more procedures, it lets you do better implants, it lets you do better endo, it lets you do better orthognathics. so um, you know, we think that demand, you know, is it gonna gyre a little bit as we recover from the pandemic? it could but you know, we've seen demand remain pretty solid on there. and in terms of, of printing, you know, we we haven't really discussed that. and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, In in in this space versus other med device spaces where you can really put your pipeline out you know we we tend to play things pretty close to the vest what what i would tell you is that our new product portfolio work has been one of you know we kept saying in the prepared remarks we've stayed focused on our key strategic initiatives well one of those is new products and and you know what we've been working on internally is how do we take the five to ten most important products whether that's in the endo implant or in the technology and equipment space And keep making progress on it and and we you know are we're not backing off on what we think our launch schedule is on some of those major launch launches and and you know again we think a position as well as as people come out of the pandemic thanks very much guys thanks jason thank you our next question is from elizabeth anderson with evercore please go ahead hi good morning guys i was just wondering if we'd keep making progress on it and and we you know are we're not backing off on what we think our launch schedule is on some of those major launch launches and and you know again we think a position as well as as people come out of the pandemic thanks very much guys thanks jason our next question is from elizabeth anderson with evercore please go ahead hi good morning guys i was just wondering if we'd keep making progress on it and If you could help us put some numbers around the the new ortho strategy can you talk about the volume you know, maybe some comments about how you sell volumes within orthodontics and then also of anything you can talk about in terms of the size of the revenue base and or our growth rates would be helpful just in terms of framing that opportunity on a go-forward basis. thank you yeah, thanks elizabeth you know, it's funny we we haven't broken out Total orthodontic business and we don't give the clear liner number specifically. what i would tell you is that what we've seen over the last year is accelerating growth behind your smile and and we've seen actually very positive trends even coming out of the pandemic. so that's one of the reasons we feel very comfortable about that decision. look, we we feel that densply ceramic has an opportunity to become a solid number two in the space and we're going to work towards that. So you can do some math around that look ultimately we know we've been pretty consistent in saying we want to grow and we want to do margin accretions so the steps we're taking around getting out of the traditional ortho business and really focusing on clear liners helps us do that so you know our our bet and belief is that the clear liner space is going to be a significant contributor to our aggregate growth rate over time okay perfect that's helpful and then you know obviously you guys have A pretty substantial liquidity position right now. how do you see that playing out if you sort of assume that, you know, hopefully we're through the worst of covid and things continue to improve from here? yeah, good morning. listen, our capital deployment philosophies are not changing and have not changed. i think it was absolutely the right thing to do to raise more liquidity to be in a position of strength from a financial standpoint. We were encouraged, actually, by a number of shareholders to be in that position, which we totally agree with. at this point, we want to keep doing what we're doing, being very prudent with our balance sheet, being very diligent with our cash flow. you probably notice in the, in the second quarter, we had a very strong operating cash flow, a very good free cash flow. and as our deployment will, will are not changing for now. we paid our dividends. And we have no plans to change the dividend at this time. once things go back to a more normal level, we will reassess where we are at that point. we will look at all of the demands for capital opportunities that we have at that time and we will make whatever decisions we think are in the best interest of our shareholders as we deploy that capital. but for now, i think the focus is on on the recovery. Merger is how to ensure that we have a very stable financial position how we are able to fund strategic initiatives some of which don has talked about that we want to make sure that even in a low revenue environment and low profitability environment we we keep funding those initiatives and and that is one of the reasons we have we have that that capital we we want to keep investing in the organic growth of the company for the time being okay thank you very much The table. thanks, elizabeth. thank you. and our next question is from steve bashaw with wolf research. please go ahead. hi, good morning, and thanks for the time here. i wanted to ask one very specific question, and the one kind of big picture question that the specific one is actually about germany. i wonder to what extent you'd be willing to talk about growth in germany, operating conditions there and to what extent you think that's a good Meter for you know what the business might look like over the next several months in the event that we you know we get the virus under under control. and then i have a a follow-up on strategy after that thanks deeve um you know conditions in germany are if if you were going to go around the world are pretty good you know and again i think correa said it well it it depends on the business and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and There's been different reactions to different different businesses and we kind of look at doc together which is you know germany switzerland and austria but but conditions there if if that's a harbinger of the future would would tell you that you know things do get closer to normal i mean there's obviously you know again the same things we see over here that we keep tracking is what's office capacity you know around the new infection protocols and again that keeps getting better you know things do get closer to normal i mean there's obviously you know again the same things we see over here that we keep tracking is what's office capacity you know around the new infection protocols and again that keeps getting better you know things do get closer to normal i mean there's obviously you know again the same things we see over here that we keep tracking is what's office capacity you Better in july than they were in june just as as the dentist and their staff get more used to that and then patient attitudes it's interesting the the patient tracking that we did in germany showed that you know the the patient tracking that we did in germany showed that there was less change in germany than there was in the u s around the pandemic so there seems to be a little bit more of a stable attitude towards visiting the dentist's office so ultimately if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, if things look like germany, It points to the fact that things do get back to normal okay, much appreciated and then don i wanted to to borrow from from your experience a little bit if i could you're a you're a med tech guy and you came into dental with a different perspective on you know what the industry could be and you know how businesses could run and covid has certainly changed some of that thinking i wonder as you you keep your med tech hat on and you think about what you want the business needs the To look like, and how practice evolves, you know, over the next, you know, however many quarters or months, and we get to the point where you know, we're in a news post-covid normal. how is your thinking how has your thinking evolved in terms of what you want the business to be, what you think the practice looks like? i know you have a focus on digital, that was there before. can you just give us a sense for maybe what you might have learned in the last few months and how your thinking has evolved? Involved in that future strategic vision. thank you. thanks, deeve. um, you know, i think what covid has done is, is brought into sharper focus what i think the industry is going to need to be. and, you know, whether it gets there in two years, three years, five years, i think it's going to accelerate a couple of trends. i mean, the first is that, you know, i, i think dso's are, are going to pick up. no, i don't know. what dso's are, are going to pick up. i think it's going to accelerate a couple of trends. i mean, the first is that, you know, i, i think dso's are, are going to pick up. no, i don't know. what It's gonna happen in in the in the immediate short term but i think if you if you look at in europe in the u s and even in places in asia pacific where the pandemic exposed you know sometimes some of the offices are are kind of right on the margin and the dentists may feel it's better to practice in a larger group so i think there there you may see a shift that way i think the second big thing is you know the idea of when you say digital i push digital pretty hard BARD IN MY MIND WHAT I THINK WHETHER IT'S THE DHS OR THE INDIVIDUAL DENTISTS ARE GOING TO BE DOING IS THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO BE EVALUATING THEIR PRACTICE MORE CRITICALLY AND I THINK COVID BROUGHT THAT INTO SHARP FOCUS THAT HEY LOOK I'VE GOT FORTY HOURS TO SEE PATIENTS HOW AM I ALLOCATING TIME AGAINST PROCEDURES AND AND HOW AM I THINKING ABOUT WHAT PROCEDURES CAN I DO AND WHAT PROCEDURES DO I REALLY WANT TO DEVELOP WITHIN THE PRACTICE AND I' Accordingly from the equipment and where i emphasize our training and whatnot. so you know, i think what we've seen with clear aligners is something that's going to go into the rest of dentistry. you know, when you think about implants when you think about even basic endo work, i think the increased digitization of diagnostics and and how that can help dental practice at the highest level of their licenses is is it's going to accelerate. So i would i would say steve i would say steve i don't think anything's dramatically changed strategically what i think it's it you know and you read all the books and you know after major disruptions and dislocations you tend to see new trends go i think what might have taken a decade because dental tends to be a little bit slower than what we saw in med tech i think is going to accelerate pretty dramatically i couldn't agree more thanks for all the help here All right, thanks, steve. Keep safe. thank you. and our next question is from john craig with william blare. please go ahead. hi, thanks very much. don, curious. could you give us an update on the year integration efforts? i'm sure covid has impacted them a little bit, but you had a pretty long list across commercial manufacturing and r and d. just kind of give us a sense about where that stands and to what degree the pandemic has impacted them. Have altered the thinking around them um you know john first, thanks for the question you know when i would say when we outline things in november of eighteen, you know, we kind of said it was a three year program on i would say that and particularly with the announcements we made this morning around traditional ortho and analog lab it kind of points to the fact that we're pushing a little bit faster and we're pushing harder i think the pah The pandemic has accelerated our thinking and you know when you when you see the revenue challenges in the second quarter it also highlights you know some of the things that we need to get after even faster so that's kind of what i would tell you um i it's really interesting internally we keep trying to tell people hey look it's not as if we're going to get the restructuring done and then that's it you know we're not changing ever again so i've been trying to Condition the organization to understand that this is a marathon and and you know the restructuring might have have been only the first ten k of that so look i i would tell you in terms of the plan we laid out we're more than halfway done but i would also tell you it's great as i brought in a new team with people like jorge we've got a terrific supply chain leader we've actually now got all the commercial people reporting into one one person walter peterson we're finding more and more stuff That we think that we can improve on, that should have, you know, really deliver the promise of what dentsu x cerona should be. so, you know, look specifically, hey, you know, if you thought it was a three year restructuring, you know, we're, we're slightly ahead of where we thought we would be. i would just tell you that we're committed, our management team is committed to as soon as we get done with that restructuring, we're not stopping, we're, we're continuously improving. that's great, thanks. and then one last one, how is your implant portfolio? PORTFOLIO PERFORMING HOW DID IT DO IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND ARE YOU RE THINKING THAT LINE UP AT ALL IMPLANTS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN HAPPY WITH OUR IMPLANT BUSINESS UM I WOULD TELL YOU YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAY THE SECOND QUARTER JOHN IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF WHAT LANGUAGE DO YOU USE YOU KNOW IMPLANTS DID WELL RELATIVE BUT YOU KNOW VERSUS PRIOR YEAR YOU KNOW ACROSS THE WHOLE PORTFOLI Think about our portfolio look we look we think we've started to actually get our new products where we need to get them you know obviously we've talked about our immediate load astra v product and and i think that's the first of what you'll see a a pretty regular set of introductions over the next eighteen months in our in our implant space that are going to really let us be competitive the other thing that we've been doing with implants that doesn't get a lot of highlights Is that we have a business m i s that we've bought a couple of years back which lets us play a little bit more aggressively in the value segment. and as as we've been rethinking how we approach our commercial go-to-market strategy across all of denspree's products and including on implants being able to integrate that and expand that beyond the base of of what they used to operate in when we bought them is has been beneficial there. so we feel that implants remains a significant growth opportunity for us. i would. I say that you know, we're starting to get the portfolio where we need to get it. i'm extremely excited about what i think that the new products in that space are going to be able to deliver for us, you know, over the next you know, a couple of years. sounds good. thank you. thank you. our next question is from john block with stephens. please go ahead. My questions so i think you mentioned earlier that your patient tracking is saying that patient confidence has been continuing to go up recently i'm wondering if there's any detail you can give there on just like how that's shaken out geographically and if there's a read through to you know potentially some of your july comments through that confidence level yeah sure thanks travis a couple of things i mean first we're we're doing patient tracking across the entire globe And, and again, we've, we've seen consistent improvement around you know, people likely to visit the dentist and, and we measure it likely to visit in, in the, the next thirty days, the next quarter and whatnot. so we've been seeing consistent improvement across the board there. interestingly, there's a kind of a sub group people have been to the dentist have had really positive experiences around how people, you know, whether it's adjusting waiting room or, or how they're addressing infection protocols. so we see that group is pretty positive. One of the things we were trying to watch as there were kind of the flare ups in the u. s. and in particular geographies whether there was going to be a drop off in patient confidence and we didn't see that so you know look i and and by the way while most of the patient data is good there is some reluctance on you know kind of a a segment of the population to say you know am i going to go back in the next month versus do i intend to go back to the dentist in the next six months so A little bit of a lag there that that we see particularly in the u s but we don't see it elsewhere around the world. so patient, patient tracking has been actually a good lead indicator and again, we're seeing we're seeing some good positive things there. yeah, thank you. and then just one more on d s o's. we've been hearing that d s o's in larger practice groups are tending to perform better in this environment. and i'm wondering if that's what you've been seeing and if you think that's what you've been seeing and if you think that's what you've been seeing and if you think that's what you've been seeing and if you think that's what you've been seeing and if you think that's what you've been seeing and if you think that' Um, some of the smaller, more fragmented practitioners could start to catch up to it as well. um, to be honest, steve, we haven't seen a huge differentiation between the dso's and and the individual practices you know, the thing that that we love about this market is that you know, whether it's you know, there's six hundred thousand dentists around the world and and they're independent business owners and they're a Very inventive and creative about how they you know go after and and make sure that they're reaching out to their patients and whatnot. so i i look do i think on the margin if if somebody was considering retiring in a year or two and and covid hit you know do they sit there and say may now maybe the time that i accelerate that yeah you might see a little bit of that but we haven't seen a a sharp change in the number of dental practices that we're doing business with And, you know, we think that we haven't seen a drop-off in the aggregate number of dental practices in key regions post-covid. so when we, when we're watching, you know, when we say things are eighty percent open, ninety percent open, ninety nine percent open, we haven't seen the number of practices that were measuring that against change great, thank you so much thanks, kevin and with that, we conclude our discussion. Q and a session for today, i would like to turn the call back to john swiney for his final remarks thank you very much, everybody. we look forward to updating you as we move through the rest of the year. have a good day thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today's program and you may now disconnect and have a great day"

QUARTER WE ARE PRESENTING A 102% INCREASE AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR NAMELY AS A RESULT OVER 75% IMPROVEMENT IN OUR SALES PACE WHICH CAME IN AT 3.5 HOMES PER COMMUNITY PER MONTH ORDER ACTIVITY IMPROVED AS THE QUARTER PROGRESSED AND WE HAVE SEEN DEMAND TRENDS STAY ABOVE NORMAL SEASONAL LEVEL SINCE THE QUARTER ENDED THE NEW HOME MARKET IS BENEFITING FROM SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS INCLUDING RECORD LOW INTEREST RATES THE SCARCITY OF EXISTING HOMES INVENTORY AND A NOTICEABLE SHIFT IN ATTITUDES TOWARDS HOME OWNERSHIP SOME OF THE SHIFT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ONGOING PANDEMIC WHICH HAS MADE MANY AMERICANS RETHINK HOW AND WHERE THEY LIVE GIVEN ALL THE WAYS THE VIRUS IS IMPACTING OUR LIVES BUT AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT FACTOR DRIVING THE MOVE TO HOME OWNERSHIP HAS BEEN THE EMERGENCE OF THE MILLENNIAL AGE COHORT AS A BUYER DEMOGRAPHIC THIS SIZEABLE AGE GROUP WAS SLOW TO ENTER THE HOUSING MARKET RELATIVE TO EARLIER GENERATIONS DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS BUT WE ARE NOW SEEING MILLENNIALS MAKE UP AN INCREASINGLY LARGE SHARE OF THE BUYER POPULATION THIS DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT WAS OCCURRING WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STARTED AND WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE A DRIVING FORCE FOR OUR INDUSTRY WELL AFTER THE PANDEMIC ENDS WHILE THE POSITIVE FUNDAMENTAL BACKDROP FOR OUR INDUSTRY HAS BEEN A NICE TAILWIND FOR OUR BUSINESS WE BELIEVE OUR STRONG ORDER ACTIVITY THIS QUARTER WAS ALSO THE RESULT OF OUR EXPANSION TO MORE AFFORDABLE PRICE POINTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TRANSITIONING MUCH OF OUR PORTFOLIO AWAY FROM HIGH ASP COMMUNITIES AND INTO THE MORE AFFORDABLE SEGMENTS TO THE MARKET

AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES HAS OUTPACED OUR LEGACY HIGHER PRICE COMMUNITIES BY A WIDE MARGIN AND WE ARE SEEING BETTER PRICES AND MARGIN TRENDS AT THESE LOWER PRICED COMMUNITIES AS WELL THIS PRICING POWER HAS BEEN A KEY INGREDIENT IN MAKING HEADWAY WITH ONE OF OUR MAIN INITIATIVES FOR THE YEAR GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL QUARTERS OUR MARGINS HAVE BEEN DEPRESSED DUE TO OUR FOCUS ON GENERATING CASH CURING UP THE BALANCE SHEET AND TURNING THROUGH HIGHER PRICE LEGACY COMMUNITIES NOW THAT WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION FROM BOTH THE FINANCIAL AND PRODUCTS STANDPOINT WE HAVE AN

IS IN A GREAT POSITION TO END THE YEAR ON A STRONG NOTE AND CARRY THAT MOMENTUM INTO THE NEW YEAR WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN THE CALL OVER TO LEONARD WHO WILL PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON OUR OPERATIONS THANKS LARRY AND GOOD MORNING TO EVERYONE JOINING US ON THE CALL TODAY WE EXPERIENCED THE WIDE SPREAD ACCELERATION DEMAND IN THE THIRD QUARTER DRIVEN BY LOW MORTGAGE RATES LIMITED EXISTING HOME SUPPLY A DESIRE FROM BUYERS TO MOVE TO LESS DENSELY POPULATED AREAS AND THE SURGE IN MILLENNIAL BUYERS THAT LARRY MENTIONED THE DEMAND WAS BROAD BASED BOTH FROM A PRICE POINT AND GEOGRAPHIC STANDPOINT WHICH ALLOWED US TO PUSH PRICING AT NEARLY ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES DURING THE QUARTER TRAFFIC CONVERSION RATES ARE AT ALL TIME HIGHS AS BUYERS FEEL A SENSE OF URGENCY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A PURCHASE DECISION GIVEN THE LACK OF AVAILABLE SUPPLY AND LOW INTEREST RATES AS A RESULT OUR HOMES IN BACKLOGGING INCREASED AT 329 WHICH REPRESENTED A 59% YEAR OVER YEAR IMPROVEMENT TO END THE QUARTER LOOKING AHEAD WE

SUB TRADE AVAILABILITY AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT LENGTHENING OF OUR CYCLE TIMES BY A FEW WEEKS AS A RESULT WE ARE WORKING HARD TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES AND BELIEVE ARIZONA WILL BE A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR COMPANY'S SUCCESS MOVING FORWARD THE MARKET DYNAMICS IN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE FEEL THE BEST THAT THEY'VE BEEN DURING THE CURRENT HOUSING CYCLE ORDER PACES CONTINUE TO RUN AT HIGH LEVELS AND WE ARE SEEING CYCLE TIMES STAY RELATIVELY CONSISTENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR COMMUNITIES AVERAGED A SALES PACE OF 3.1 PER MONTH DURING THE QUARTER DEMAND WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG IN THE CORE AREAS OF THE INLAND EMPIRE WHERE WE CAN OFFER OUR PREMIUM BRAND EXPERIENCE AT LOWER PRICE POINTS WE'VE TARGETED THIS REGION AS A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR EXPANSION TO DO MORE AFFORDABLE PRODUCTS AND WE ANTICIPATE OPENING FIVE AFFORDABLY PRICED COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE INLAND EMPIRE OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR COMMUNITIES AVERAGE 3.6 SALES PER MONTH FOR THE QUARTER WITH STRENGTH ACROSS THE BOARD AFFORDABILITY REMAINS AN ISSUE FOR MOST BUYERS IN THE COURT BAY AREA AND WE'VE LIMITED OUR EXPOSURE TO THIS MARKET AS WE HAVE NEARLY CLOSED OUT OUR REMAINING COMMUNITY IN MILPITAS WE CONTINUE TO SEE A MIGRATION FROM THE BAY AREA INTO THE MORE AFFORDABLE AREAS IN AND AROUND SACRAMENTO OUR FOUR COMMUNITIES IN VACAVILLE CALIFORNIA HAVE BENEFITED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THIS MIGRATION AS OUR MONTHLY SALES ABSORPTION PACE WAS 4.4 HOMES PER COMMUNITY DURING THIS 2020 THIRD QUARTER AS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES TO IMPROVE OUR PROFITABILITY WE BELIEVE THERE IS POTENTIAL IN OUR FEE BUILDING BUSINESS AND ARE CURRENTLY SOURCING NEW OPPORTUNITIES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION ON A MODEL COMPLEX AT ATLAS OUR FEE BUILDING COMMUNITY FOR FIVE POINT AT THE GREAT PARK IN IRVINE AND EXPECT TO OPEN FOR SALES IN EARLY 2021 THIS ARRANGEMENT IS DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF THE TRADITIONAL FEE BUILDING ARRANGEMENTS WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST AS THE NEW HOME COMPANY WILL ALSO BRAND MARKET AND SELL THESE HOMES WE ARE CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER LAND OWNERS TO BUILD FOUR CELL HOUSING AND SINGLE FAMILY RENTAL HOUSING ON A FEE BASES THESE FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES WILL HELP PARTIALLY OFFSET A NEAR TERM REDUCTION IN FEE BUILDING REVENUES RESULTING FROM IRVINE PACIFIC'S DECISION TO MANAGE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEIR HOME BUILDING OPERATIONS ON THEIR OWN AND FACE OUT OUR FEE BUILDING ARRANGEMENT WITH THEM AS A RESULT WE EXPECT OUR FEE BUILDING REVENUES TO DECLINE OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND THEN INCREASE IN 2022 AS NEWER OPPORTUNITIES START GENERATING FEE REVENUE AND PROFITS WE ARE EXCITED FOR THESE NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND BELIEVE THEY CAN GENERATE MEANINGFUL INCOME IN THE FUTURE USING NOMINAL CAPITAL IN SUMMARY WE CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM EXTREMELY STRONG HOUSING FUNDAMENTALS IN ALL OF OUR MARKETS AND OUR RECENTLY OPENED COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN WELL RECEIVED WE ARE WORKING HARD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DEMAND STRENGTH WE ARE SEEING WITH TARGETED PRICING INCREASES IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR PROFITABILITY WE DID GOOD STRIDES ON THIS FRONT IN THIRD QUARTER AND EXPECT TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS IN THE FUTURE NOW I'D LIKE TO IT OVER TO JOHN FOR MORE DETAIL ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS THIS QUARTER THANK YOU LEONARD AND GOOD MORNING FOR THE 2020 THIRD QUARTER WE GENERATED PRETAX INCOME OF $1.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $4.8 MILLION PRETAX LOSS IN THE YEAR AGO PERIOD THE 2019 THIRD

CENTS PER DILUTED SHARES COMPARED TO A NET LOSS 4.6 MILLION FOR 23 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD OUR HOME SALES REVENUE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS 117.4 MILLION COMPARED TO 118.8 IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD THE SLIGHT DECREASE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A 22% DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE TO $748 000 RESULTING FROM OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION INTO LOWER PRICE POINTS WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 27% INCREASE IN DELIVERIES WE ESTIMATE 2020 FOURTH QUARTER HOME SALES REVENUE TO BE BETWEEN 115 AND $125 MILLION AND OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER TO BE APPROXIMATELY $720 000 OUR GROSS MARGIN FOR THE 2020 THIRD QUARTER WAS 14.2% VERSUS 9.5% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND EXCEEDED THE TOP END OF OUR PREVIOUSLY ISSUED GUIDANCE THE 2019 THIRD QUARTER GROSS MARGIN EXCLUDING IMPAIRMENTS OF $1.7 MILLION WAS 11% THE 320 BASES POINT IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS MARGIN EXCLUDING THE PRIOR YEAR IMPAIRMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A PRODUCT MIX SHIFT TO A MORE AFFORDABLE PRODUCT WHICH GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT FEWER DELIVERIES FROM LOWER MARGIN MOVE UP CONDOMINIUM COMMUNITIES COMPARED TO THE 2019 THIRD QUARTER THESE POSITIVE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 60 BASES POINT INCREASE IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES DUE TO THE MIX OF HOMES DELIVERED DURING THE QUARTER EXCLUDING INTEREST IN COST OF SALES AND IMPAIRMENTS OUR ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN FROM HOME SALES WAS 20% AS COMPARED TO 16.2% IN THE YEAR AGO PERIOD FOR THE 2020 FOURTH QUARTER WE ESTIMATED OUR GROSS MARGIN TO BE BETWEEN 13.8 AND 14.2% PRICE SG&A RATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOME SALES REVENUE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS 12.3% VERSUS 11.1% IN THE YEAR AGO PERIOD THE HIGHER SG&A RATE IN 2020 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER COMMISSIONS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND PROFESSIONAL FEES HENCE TO A LESSER EXTENT A $300 REDUCTION IN G&A EXPENSES ALLOCATED TO FEE BUILDING COST OF SALES FOR THE 2020 FOURTH QUARTER WE ESTIMATE OUR SG&A RATE TO BE BETWEEN 12.4 AND 12.8% THE HIGHER PROJECTED SG&A RATE RELATIVE TO Q-3 IS PARTIALLY THE RESULT OF A LOWER ANTICIPATED ALLOCATION OF G&A EXPENSES TO THE FEE BUSINESS DUE TO LOWER ANTICIPATED FEE REVENUE IN Q-4 DUE TO THE IRVINE PACIFIC GOING DOWN WE OPENED FOUR NEW COMMUNITIES IN ARIZONA DURING THE QUARTER AND ENDED THE QUARTER WITH 25 ACTIVE COMMUNITIES WHICH WAS A 14% INCREASE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR THIRD QUARTER WE HAVE ONE NEW COMMUNITY THAT OPENED IN OCTOBER AND EXPECT TO SELLOUT OF APPROXIMATELY THREE COMMUNITIES BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR FEE BUILDING

QUESTION HEY GUYS GOOD MORNING UH CONGRATS ON ALL THE PROGRESS DURING THE QUARTER AND THE STRONG RESULTS UM FIRST QUESTION UM MAYBE YOU'D START OFF ON THE PRICING SIDE UM LARRY OR LEONARD SO UM SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESS PUSHING PRICE IN IN THE QUARTER AND OBVIOUSLY THE UH LONGER TERM MARGIN GOAL IS IS UH IS CERTAINLY I THINK LOOKING A LOT STRONGER NOW GIVEN THE PRICING ENVIRONMENT BUT I'M CURIOUS UH IF YOU COULD MAYBE JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT AND QUANTIFY MAYBE THE A LEVEL OF PICE INCREASES YOU GUYS HAVE PUSHED THROUGH IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND AND UH I'M CURIOUS IF UH YOU'VE SEEN ANY PUSH BACK TO ANY OF THOSE PRICE INCREASES UH AT THIS POINT UH I GUESS HERE EARLY NOVEMBER UM ASSUMING SOME OF THOSE PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN MORE RECENT LEONARD WHY DON'T YOU- THANKS ALAN WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT LEONARD THANKS LARRY UM THANKS ALAN AND GOOD MORNING YEAH I WOULD SAY ACROSS THE QUARTER YOU KNOW WE CONTINUED TO PUSH PRICING AT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES WE LITERALLY RAISED PRICES AT 100% OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND ON AVERAGE UM THE AVERAGE PRICE INCREASE WAS A LITTLE OVER 4% UM YOU KNOW THERE'S KINDA <INAUDIBLE> COMMUNITIES SECOND HOME COMMUNITIES AT THE LOWER END AND THEN AT THE HIGHER END ARE REALLY SOME OF OUR SUBURBAN UH COMMUNITIES WE'VE CONTINUED TO PRICE IT UH OUR PURCHASE PRICES ALL THROUGH THE QUARTER AND REALLY WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE RESISTANCE YET AS OF TODAY UM AND CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR EVERY OPPORTUNITY WE CAN TO GROW MARGINS THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR UM SECOND QUESTION UH YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED AND THIS IS A SIMILAR MESSAGE WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER BUILDERS JUST ABOUT THE NEED TO YOU KNOW KINDA SLOW THINGS DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND NOT GET BACKLOGS TOO FAR EXTENDED AND I THINK THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE ALTHOUGH FOR YOU GUYS YOU'RE IN A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT SITUATION IN THAT YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE GROWING OFF OF AN ADMITTEDLY FAIRLY YOU KNOW SMALL LEVEL OF ACTIVITY SO I WAS A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED THAT YOU KNOW YOU WOULDN'T BE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN KIND OF LET THINGS RUN A BIT HOTTER HERE AND I'M CURIOUS IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MAYBE RANK ORDER THE CONSTRAINTS THAT YOU'RE SEEING THAT WOULD PREVENT YOU FROM LETTING THAT GO HOTTER FOR A LONGER PERIOD IN TIME IN TERMS OF YOUR ABSORPTION RATE IS IT IS IT A LAND ISSUE I KNOW YOUR LOT COUNT HAS BEEN TRENDING YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT LOWER IN THE MORE RECENT QUARTERS OR IS IT MORE DIFFICULTY SOURCING LABOR YOU KNOW PERHAPS UM YOU KNOW THE SCALE BENEFITS THAT SOME OF THE LARGER BUILDERS HAVE IS THAT WORKING AS A DISADVANTAGE TO YOU GUYS IN TRYNA GET LABOR IN THIS TIGHT ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW YEAH IT'S LEONARD AGAIN TRY THE LATTER OF THE TWO IS DRIVING IT MORE OR LESS ALAN LIKE IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU'D SELL ONE HOME PER WEEK AND SELL FOUR HOMES PER MONTH AND REALLY THAT WHAT OUR TRADE PARTNERS ARE SET UP FOR AND WE'VE KIND OF PREPARED THEM FOR THAT THEY'VE MADE THE COMMITMENT TO DELIVER THAT SO YOU KNOW WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE AGAIN OUR SOLD AND UNSTARTED BACKLOG DOESN'T GET TOO FAR OUT FOR US ESPECIALLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF RISING PRICES WE KNOW THAT FUTURE LAND PRICES LAND'S GONNA COST MORE IN THE FUTURE AND SO REALLY ITS THE CAPACITY OF OUR TRADE PARTNERS SO WE CONTINUE TO MEASURE THAT UH WE'VE GONE A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER ON SALES RELEASES FOR THAT REASON AND UH WE THINK THAT'S THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION AND LEONARD IF I COULD ADD I REALLY JUST THINK IT'S VARIES BY MARKET AND ALSO BY NEWER HOUSING PROGRAM OR OLDER HOUSING PROGRAM SO IT ISN'T JUST A A ONE SIZE FITS ALL LEONARD AND JOHN HAVE WORKED PRETTY CAREFULLY AT TRYING TO ANALYZE WHERE WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES UH AND WHERE UM AND WHERE THERE'S MORE CHALLENGES AND IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD OUT OF OLDER PROJECTS AND GET THROUGH IT BUT IN OTHER CASES IF WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO START A HOUSE FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS UH IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THAT WE PUT IT UP FOR SALE IN A MARKET THAT CONTINUES TO BE STRONG IS AND YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE BEING VERY LOGICAL AND WE'RE ATTEMPTING UH TO MAXIMIZE THE PROFITS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMUNITIES WE'VE OPENED IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS YOU'D SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BOTH ABSORPTION AND MARGIN UH AND AND THIS WE'RE HOPING THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO KEEP THAT THE ABSORPTION STEADY AND UH THE MARGINS IMPROVING THERE'S NON REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GREAT MAN UH I APPRECIATE THAT EXTRA COLLAR THERE LARRY AND IF I COULD JUST SNEAK IN ONE MORE HERE UM YOU KIND OF BROUGHT UP THE LAND MARKET A LITTLE BIT UM YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW NOW THE DEBT REFINANCING IS BEHIND YOU GUYS YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE RUNWAY AND DISABILITY FROM THE BALANCE SHEET PERSPECTIVE SO I WOULD IMAGINE YOU KNOW YOU'RE KIND OF STEPPING ON THE GAS A LITTLE BIT HERE ON THE LAND SIDE OF THINGS AND AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD IMAGINE YOU KNOW YOUR COMPETITORS ARE AS WELL GIVEN HOW STRONG THE SELLING ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN SO WHAT WHAT'S THE VIABILITY OF YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE QUICK RETURN DEALS THAT YOU COULD KINDA PUT YOUR PEN AND PAPER TO AND POTENTIALLY GET ON THE GROUND HERE OVER THE NEXT 12 OR 18 MONTHS WELL IT'S IT IS- OKAY LARRY LET ME JUST START LEONARD AND THEN YOU JUMP THROUGH UM YOU KNOW LAND IN THE MARKETS WE'RE IN HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHALLENGING ALWAYS AND ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF OUR ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN THAT WE HAVE LAND RELATIONSHIPS THAT GO BACK OVER 30 YEARS UH WHETHER WITH MASTER DEVELOPERS OR WITH INDIVIDUALS UM AND IT IS TOUGHER NOW BUT WE'RE WE ARE CONTINUING TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES AND UH UH THERE IS NO REASON WHY UM WE WON'T BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW GROW THE BUSINESS OVER THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS BUT UH ONE THING YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF AND OUR INVESTORS I HOPE THEY ALL UNDERSTAND IS THAT WHEN CALIFORNIA IS YOUR STRONGEST MARKET PLACE UH IT TAKES A COUPLE YEARS TO FROM WHEN YOU BUY A PIECE OF GROUND TO WHEN YOU'RE CLOSING HOUSES AND WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THAT AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S THE SITUATION WE'RE IN BUT UH DON'T LOSE TRACK AT IF ANYTHING WHEN THE MARKET IS PARTICULARLY TOUGH OR DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF UH A LOT OF COMPETITION RELATIONSHIPS MATTER MORE THAN EVER AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE HAVE AND WE ALWAYS HAD AND WE ALWAYS WILL HAVE UM AND WITH THAT LEONARD PLEASE UM KEEP GOING YEAH I THINK YOU HIT MOST OF THE POINTS LARRY I WOULD SAY ALAN WE'RE CERTAINLY BACK IN THE MARKET AND WE ARE KINDA BOOK HANDING THIS WE'RE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN BASICALLY GET CONTROL OF THAT WE CAN OPEN OUR MODEL HOMES IN 12-18 MONTHS AND BECAUSE OF SOMEWHAT LIMITED CAPITAL WE'RE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO FILL OUR 23 / 24 PIPELINE AND THOSE TO PROFILE THOSE DEALS WOULD LOOK QUITE DIFFERENTLY THE LAND COME MARKET IS COMPLETELY IS REALLY COMPETITIVE RIGHT NOW AS YOU WOULD EXPECT WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS TYING UP SOME INTERESTING OPPORTUNITIES AND I WOULD SAY ARIZONA IS THE MOST COMPETITIVE LAND ENVIRONMENT TODAY AND SO THAT'S PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS TO IDENTIFY ASSES THAT MAKES SENSE THERE'S POSITIONS AVAILABLE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY MAKE SENSE AND THAT WE CAN DELIVER ON THOSE RETURNS I'D ADD ONE OTHER THING TO YOUR PRIOR QUESTION REAL QUICK UM WHEN YOU KIND OF TALKED ABOUT SALES PACE AND RUNNING IT A LITTLE BIT HARDER I WOULD SAY EVEN WITH THE STEPS THAT WE'VE TAKEN AND YOU KNOW WE JUST CLOSED THE MONTH OF UH OCTOBER OCTOBER WAS A REALLY STRONG MONTH EVEN WITH THOSE MEASURES IT'S THE THIRD STRONGEST SALES MONTH IN THE COMPANY'S HISTORY WHERE YOUR SALES WERE UP 65% UM AND WE AVERAGED AVERAGE ABSORPTION OF 3.5 AND THAT'S EVEN COUNTING CLOSED OUT COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE 2 / 3 / 4 HOMES LEFT TO SELL THAT KIND OF WEIGHS THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT SO AGAIN IT'S STILL AN EXTREMELY STRONG MARKET AND WE'RE KIND OF REALLY EXCITED ABOUT FUTURE AND WHAT IT CAN MEAN FOR THE COMPANY GREAT THANKS A LOT GUYS AND THAT SOUNDS PROMISING AND GOOD LUCK THANKS THANKS ALAN THANK YOU THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AS A REMINDER IF YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN THE QUESTION QUEUE PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM ALEX <INAUDIBLE> WITH HOUSING RESEARCH CENTER PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION MORNING GUYS GREAT JOB THANKS ALEX THANKS ALEX THANKS ALEX UM I WAS CURIOUS UM YOU'VE MENTIONED HERE STARTING TO DO SOME FEE WORK FOR FIVE POINT DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF TIMING YOU CAN SHARE WITH US WHEN THOSE FIRST UH DELIVERIES OF REVENUES WELL I GUESS IT'S MORE UH YOU BOOK EARNING RIGHT WHEN CONSTRUCTION HAPPENS SO CAN YOU KIND OF HELP GIVE US AN IDEA ON HOW TO MODEL THAT SURE THIS IS GOOD MORNING ALEX THIS IS LEONARD YEAH SO I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE IT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FEE STRUCTURE THAN SAY WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE IRVINE COMPANY IN THE PAST AND SO IN THIS CASE WE TAKE ON ALL OF THE NORMAL BUILDER RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WILL BE BRANDED UNDER THE NEW HOME NAME WE SELL AND MARKET THE HOMES CONSTRUCT THEM AND THEN TAKE THE BACKEND SERVICE AS WELL SO THE COMMUNITY WILL OPEN DURING THE FIRST QUARTER AN OPEN FOR SALE SO THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW WE WILL GO TO SELL AND THEN WITHIN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE MONTHS WE SHOULD SEE FIRST CLOSINGS SO THE WAY THE FEE STRUCTURE WORKS IS WE GET A PORTION OF THE FEE THROUGH THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT AND THEN WE GET A BACKEND UM PORTION OF THE FEE AT THE CLOSE TO THE HOME SO YOU KNOW EVEN TODAY WE'D BE RECOGNIZED YOU KNOW A SMALL AMOUNT OF FEE BUT UH THE SIGNIFICANT FEE WOULD START COMING IN PROBABLY THE END OF Q-1 OR LATE Q-2 WE'RE ALSO REALLY EXCITED I THINK IT WAS NOTED IN THE RELEASE THAT OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS WE'VE BEEN APPROACHED ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT FRONTS FROM FOR SOME PRETTY EXCITING FEE OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING SINGLE-FAMILY RENTAL BUSINESS WHERE WE'RE TALKING TO FOLKS IN ARIZONA AND WE HAVE A REALLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO BUILD UP TO 13 / 1400 HOMES SO WE THINK IT CAN DRIVE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS HELP US GROW EARNINGS WHILE NOT HAVING TO PUT ANY FORM OF SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL IN THE BUSINESS OKAY GREAT AND THEN ON THE JOINT VENTURE SIDE UM ANOTHER SINCE THERE IS VERY FEW LOTS LEFT IS THAT BASICALLY WINDING DOWN OR WILL YOU WILL THAT STAY ALIVE I GUESS IN FUTURE YEARS HEY ALEX THIS IS JOHN STEVENS UH YEAH WE ARE SORT OF WINDING DOWN THE JOINT VENTURE BUSINESS

REALLY THE REMAINING LOTS ARE AT UH OR FOLSOM RANCH DEAL UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CALLED RUSSELL RANCH AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF EXISTING THAT PARTNERSHIP RIGHT NOW AND I WOULD SAY IN THE NEAR TERM WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS TO ENTER INTO ANY NEW JOINT VENTURES AT THIS TIME BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE IF THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY CAME ALONG THAT WOULD ENTERTAIN THAT BUT FOR NOW UH THAT PART OF THE BUSINESS IS REALLY WINDING DOWN OKAY GREAT AND THEN UM IF I COULD JUST ASK ONE MORE ON THE NEW DEBT YOU GUYS JUST RAISED UM IS THE PLAN TO PAY OFF THE 2022 SHORT-TERM OR BOTH ARE ALREADY <INAUDIBLE> YEAH IT'S ALREADY DONE <INAUDIBLE> YEAH WE EFFECTUATED THAT UH LAST WEEK WE CLOSED ON THE NEW BONDS I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THE 28TH OF OCTOBER AND ALL THE THE PREVIOUS 22 NOTES HAVE BEEN EXTINGUISHED UM AND UH SO THAT'S DONE AND THEN WE USED SOME OF OUR CASH ON HAND UM TO PAY OFF THE BALANCE BECAUSE WE RAISED 250 MILLION IN NEW NOTES AND WE HAD ABOUT ROUGHLY 292 MILLION OF PRINCIPLE ON THE OLD NOTES SO OKAY GREAT I'LL GET BACK IN THE QUEUE GOOD JOB SURE THANKS ALEX THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM LINE OF JASON <INAUDIBLE> WITH A PRIVATE INVESTOR PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION GUYS AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THE STRONG QUARTER UH MY QUESTION WILL ONLY JUST KIND OF PERTAIN TO THE PRIORITIES FOR CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT GOING FORWARD UH YOU MENTIONED HOW YOU SUCCESSFULLY LEVERAGED THE BALANCE SHEET AND EXTENDED ALL MATURITIES UM AND THE OUTLOOK FOR THE BUSINESS SEEMS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG UH WHEN YOU GUYS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY GENERATING CASH FLOW UH BUT WITH JUST STOCK TRADING AT HALF OF BOOK-VALUE WELL BASICALLY HALF A TANGIBLE BOOK-VALUE IT'S HARD TO REALLY IMAGINE THERE'S A BETTER USE THE CASH RIGHT NOW OR THE PART WHERE YOU USE THE CASH RIGHT NOW THEN PLOUGHING BACK INTO THE STOCK SO REALLY WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AROUND POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASING AND REALLY HOW CAN WE FOCUS AND THINK ABOUT PRIORITIES WITH CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT GOING FORWARD THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION JASON THANK YOU UM YEAH YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT ALL ASPECTS OF USE OF OUR CAPITAL AND WE'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED AS YOU'VE MENTIONED ON REALLY DELEVERAGING THE BUSINESS AND REFINANCING OUR BONDS AND PUSHING OUT THE REVOLVER EXTENSION WHICH WAS A WAS A BIG IMPORTANT THING THAT WE WE'D COMPLETED ON FRIDAY UM SO IT REALLY PUTS US IN A POSITION NOW WHERE WE CAN REINVEST IN THE BUSINESS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE DID BUY QUITE A FEW SHARES IN THE FRONT HALF OF THE YEAR WHEN WE SAW THE STOCK PRICE DEPRESS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT TRADING AT HALF HALF OF MULTIPLE BOOK-VALUE ISN'T UH WHERE WE'D LIKE TO BE UM BUT ON THE ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO NEED TO UH REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESS A LITTLE BIT AND WE WILL EVALUATE REALLY ALL ASPECTS AND WHERE TO ALLOCATE THE CAPITAL GOING FORWARD WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT LEFT ON OUR AUTHORIZATION FROM OUR BOARD I THINK THERE'S ABOUT 1.7 MILLION LEFT AUTHORIZED CURRENTLY UM BUT AGAIN WE'VE BEEN ON PAUSE ON THE LAND ACT SIDE FOR FOR A LITTLE BIT NOW AND UM WE WILL SORT OF LAYER SOME OF THAT IN GOING FORWARD UM AGAIN WE DO NEED TO SORT OF BALANCE OUR CAPITAL LOCATION AND IT'S A FAIR QUESTION BUT WE WE DO NEED TO

THAT'S YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT WE HAVE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON BUT THAT'S PRIMARILY UH THE ONE THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT TODAY YEAH AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE WE'RE WE'RE AT EIGHT COMMUNITIES NOW IN THE Q-3 I THINK ONE OF THEM PROBABLY DROPS OFF IN Q-4 AND THEN WE'LL PROBABLY RUN LIKE SEVEN COMMUNITY RANGE PLUS OR MINUS FOR THE YEAR RIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY UH WE SELL

GREAT UM AND THEN AS FAR AS GROSS MARGINS I THINK YOU GAVE US A RANGE FOR NEXT YEAR I MEAN FOR NEXT QUARTER WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DOWNWARDS FROM THIS QUARTER IS THAT MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF LUMBER OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THERE IT IT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH SOME OF THE CLOSE UP COMMUNITIES WE HAVE ON THE LUXURY CONDOMINIUM SIDE THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE SELLING THREE OF THOSE THE DOWN SIDE IS THAT THE MARGINS ARE A LITTLE BIT WEAKER IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH ON OUR HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICE ALEX SO I THINK ONCE THOSE ALL GET DISPOSED OF AND DELIVERED IN Q-4 I THINK OUR MARGINS UH

Good morning, welcome to the new home company's earnings conference call. earlier today, the company released its financial results for the third quarter of twenty twenty. documents detailing these results are available on the investor relations section of the company's website at n w h m dot com. before the call begins, i would like to remind everyone that statements made in the course of this call which are not historical facts or forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. a discussion of such risks and uncertainties and other important factors could be found in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission. Cause actual operating results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings made with the sec, including its most recent annual report on form 10 k and its quarterly reports on form 10 q the company undertakes no duty to update these forward-looking statements that are made during the course of this call. additionally, non-gaap financial measures may be discussed on this conference call. reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures can be found in the company's filings with the sec. Measures prepared in accordance with gaps can be accessed through the new york company's website and in its filings with the sec hosting the call today is larry webb, executive chairman, leonard miller, president and chief executive officer, and john stevens, chief financial officer. with that, i will now turn the call over to larry thanks, drew, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today as we go over our results for the third quarter of two thousand and twenty, providing an update on gaps. Our state of our strategic outlook and give some additional color on our operations the new home company made significant progress on a series of strategic initiatives and generated a profit in the third quarter of two thousand and twenty we experienced healthy expansion to our home building gross margin while continuing to emphasize overhead cost containment thanks to several operational improvements and a very strong housing rebound we Generated two hundred and fifty one net new orders in the quarter representing a hundred and two percent increase as compared to last year mainly as a result of a seventy five percent improvement in our sales pace which came in at three point five homes per community per month order activity improved as the quarter progressed and we have seen demand trends stay above normal seasonal levels since the quarter ended. the new home market is benefiting from several positive factors including record low interest rates, a scarcity of existing home inventory and a noticeable shift in attitudes towards homeownership. some of this shift can be attributed to the ongoing pandemic which has made many americans rethink how and where they live given all the ways the virus is impacting our lives but an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important factor is an equally important Ownership has been the emergence of the millennial aged cohort as a buyer demographic this sizable age group was slower to enter the housing market relative to earlier generations due to a number of factors but we are now seeing millennials make up an increasingly large share of the buyer population this demographic shift was occurring well before the pandemic started and we believe it will be a driving force for our industry. Well after the pandemic ends while the positive fundamental backdrop for our industry has been a nice tailwind for our business we believe our strong order activity this quarter was also the result of our expansion to more affordable price points over the last few years we have been transitioning much of our portfolio away from high asp communities and into the more affordable segments of the market. the goal was to take our premium brand experience that is centered around industry-leading customer service, best-in-class quality, and innovative design and make it more accessible through efficient floor plans and higher-density projects. this focus has served us well in recent quarters and dovetails nicely with the millennial demographic trends i just mentioned. order activity at our newly-opened properties has been strong, and we expect this trend to continue. Affordable communities have outpaced our legacy higher-price communities by a wide margin and we are seeing better prices and margin trends at these lower-price communities as well this pricing power has been a key ingredient in making headway with one of our main initiatives for the year gross margin expansion over the past several quarters our margins have been depressed due to our focus on generating cash Shoring up the balance sheet and turning through higher price legacy communities now that we are in a much better position from both a financial and product standpoint we have an opportunity to show real improvement on the gross margin front we posted a three hundred and twenty basis point year over year increase to our home building gross margin in the third quarter excluding impairments in the prior year and we feel we can push margins Hire over time through steady price increases, better product mix, and cost containment. while this margin progression will fluctuate, depending on the mix of closes, we believe the long-term trajectory is headed in the right direction with a healthy demand outlook, a great product profile, rising margins, and a much improved balance sheet. the new home company is in a great position to end the year on a strong note. And carry that momentum into the new year. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to leonard, who will provide more detail on our operations. thanks, larry. and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. we experienced a widespread acceleration in demand in the third quarter, driven by low mortgage rates, limited existing home supply, and a desire from buyers to move to less densely populated areas. Populated areas and the surge of millennial buyers that larry mentions the demand was broad-based both from a price point and geographic standpoint which allowed us to push pricing at nearly all of our communities during the quarter traffic conversion rates are at all-time highs as buyers feel a sense of urgency to move forward with a purchase decision given the lack of available supply and low interest rates As a result, our homes and backlog increased to three hundred twenty nine which represented a fifty nine percent year over year improvement to end the quarter. looking ahead, we expect order activity to remain above normal seasonal trends in the near term but our focus has shifted slightly given the size of our backlog and our desire to increase margins. we want to make sure our sales don't get too far out of control. In front of our starts while also maximizing the profit from each new home sale to that end we have delayed some sales releases in an effort to align our sales with construction starts and implement additional price increases while this may moderate our sales pace from the levels we have experienced recently we believe this is a prudent way to manage our backlog and improve our margins in terms of cost lumber Recently hit an all-time high driven by diminished capacities tariffs uncertainty of covid on workers in the mills and a rapid increase in sales and starts fortunately we have started to see lumber pricing come down from its highs and hope this trend continues outside of lumber our material costs have remained relatively flat with respect to our markets arizona continues to be the standout performer for us Averaging four point one sales per community per month this strong absorption was driven by seven new communities we've recently opened over the past five months which have also generated gross margins meaningfully higher than the company average our mariposa mini master plan consisting of three product segments opened the last week of september and sold eighteen homes during the quarter while our mosaic mini master plan consisting of three product segments opened the last week of september and sold eighteen homes during the quarter Continues to experience solid sales as well. we will deliver our first homes from our affordably priced communities in arizona in the fourth quarter and we expect these communities to contribute significantly to the company's profit in two thousand and twenty one arizona still remains our most challenged market when it comes to labor and sub trade availability and we have seen a lengthening of our cycle times by a few weeks as a result. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES AND BELIEVE ARIZONA WILL BE A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR COMPANY'S SUCCESS MOVING FORWARD THE MARKET DYNAMICS IN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE FEEL THE BEST THAT THEY'VE BEEN DURING THE CURRENT HOUSING CYCLE ORDER PACES CONTINUE TO RUN AT HIGH LEVELS AND WE ARE SEEING CYCLE TIMES STAY RELATIVELY CONSISTENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR COMMUNITIES AVERAGED A SALES PACE OF THREE P One per month during the quarter. demand was particularly strong in the core areas of the inland empire where we can offer our premium brand experience at lower price points. we've targeted this region as a key component of our expansion into more affordable products and we anticipate opening five affordably priced communities within the inland empire over the next eighteen months in northern california our communities average three per month. Point six sales per month for the quarter with strength across the board affordability remains an issue for most buyers in the core bay area and we've limited our exposure to this market as we have nearly closed out at our remaining community in milpitas we continue to see a migration from the bay area into the more affordable areas in and around sacramento our four communities in back in california have benefited significantly from this migration As our monthly sales absorption pace was four point four homes per community during the two thousand twenty third quarter as we continue to make changes to improve our profitability we believe there is potential in our fee building business and are currently sourcing new opportunities during the third quarter we started construction on the model complex at atlas our fee building community for five point at the great park lark in ervine and expect to open for sales in early two thousand and twenty one this arrangement is different than most of the traditional fee building arrangements we've had in the past as the new home company will also brand market and sell these homes we are currently in discussions with other land owners to build for sale housing and single family rental housing on a fee basis these future opportunities will help partially offset A near-term reduction in fee-building revenues resulting from ivy pacific's decision to manage the construction of their home building operations on their own and phase out our fee-building arrangement with them. as a result, we expect our fee-building revenues to decline over the next year and then increase in two thousand twenty two as new opportunities start generating fee revenue and profits. we are excited for these new opportunities. opportunities and believe they can generate meaningful income in the future using nominal capital. in summary, we continue to benefit from extremely strong housing fundamentals in all of our markets and our recently open communities have been well received. we are working hard to take advantage of the demand strength we are seeing with targeted price increases in an effort to improve our profitability. we made good strides on this front in the first and third quarters. To make further progress in the future. now i'd like to turn it over to john for more detail on our financial results this quarter. thank you, lloyd, and good morning. for the two thousand twenty third quarter, we generated pre-tax income of one point five million dollars, compared to four point eight million pre-tax loss in the year ago period. the two thousand nineteen third quarter included a total of three point six million of inventory and impairment charges. A one point five million dollar loss on land sales in the prior year's third quarter net income for the quarter was one point two million dollars or six cents per diluted shares compared to a net loss of four point six million or twenty three cents per diluted share in the prior year period our home sales revenue for the third quarter was a hundred and seventeen point four million compared to a hundred and eighteen point eight million in the prior year period. Decrease compared to the prior was attributable to a twenty two percent decrease in average selling price to seven hundred forty eight thousand dollars resulting from our continued expansion into lower price points which was partially offset by a twenty seven percent increase in deliveries we estimate two thousand twenty fourth quarter home sales revenue to be between one hundred fifteen and one hundred twenty five million dollars and our average selling price for the fourth quarter to be Approximately seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars our gross margin for the two thousand twenty third quarter was fourteen point two percent versus nine point five percent in the prior year period and exceeded the top end of our previously issued guidance the two thousand nineteen third quarter gross margin excluding impairments of one point seven million dollars was eleven percent the three hundred and twenty basis point improvement in gross margin excluding the prior year impairments was primarily driven by Due to a product mix shift to more affordable products which generally have higher gross margins and to a lesser extent fewer deliveries from lower margin move up condoominium communities compared to the two thousand and nineteen third quarter these positive factors were partially offset by a sixty basis point increase in capitalized interest included in cost of sales due to the mix of homes delivered during the quarter excluding interest and cost of sales Health and impairments or adjusted gross margin from home sales was twenty percent as compared to sixteen point two percent in the year ago period for the two thousand twenty fourth quarter we estimate our gross margin to be between thirteen point eight and fourteen point two percent our sgna rate as a percentage of home sales revenue for the third quarter was twelve point three percent versus eleven point one percent in the year ago period the higher sgna rate in the third quarter Twenty nineteen was primarily the result of higher commissions, incentive compensation, and professional fees and to a lesser extent a three hundred thousand dollar reduction in g and e expenses allocated to fee building costs of sales for the two thousand twenty fourth quarter we estimate our s and g rate to be between twelve point four and twelve point eight percent the higher projected s and g rate relative to q three is partially the result of a lower anticipated allocation. A cation of g and a expenses to the fee business due to lower anticipated fee revenue in q four due to the irvine pacific wind down we opened four new communities in arizona during the quarter and ended the quarter with twenty five active communities which was a fourteen percent increase compared to the prior year third quarter we have one new community that opened in october and expect to sell out of approximately three communities before the end of the year fee building revenue for the twenty twenty third quarter was thirteen point four million compared to twenty two point three million in the prior year period fee building gross margin for the two thousand twenty third quarter was two hundred sixty eight thousand compared to six hundred forty seven thousand in the prior year period the reduction in fee building gross margin was primarily due to lower fee building activity in irvine, california for the twenty twenty fourth quarter we estimate our fee building gross margin will be To be between five and eight million dollars we continue to wind down our joint ventures during the quarter we finalized the sale of our interest in the bedford land development joint venture and delivered the final homes at our mckinley village home building joint venture in sacramento, california of the company's three remaining active joint ventures we have seven homes remaining to deliver at the mountain shadows home building joint venture in arizona three home sites to sell at our davis village home building joint venture in arizona land development joint venture in northern california and we continue to actively pursue an exit from the russell ranch land development joint venture in folsom, california during the third quarter, we generated forty million dollars in operating cash flow and reduced our net debt to capital ratio to forty point one percent a nine hundred and eighty basis point improvement compared to the year ago period and the lowest level since december, two thousand and seventeen we ended the quarter with a hundred and eighty basis point improvement compared to the year ago period and the lowest level since december, two thousand and seventeen we ended the quarter with a hundred and eighty basis point improvement compared to the year ago period and the lowest level since december, two thousand and seventeen we ended the quarter with a hundred and eighty basis point improvement compared to the year ago period and the lowest level since december, two thousand and Twenty six million dollars in cash and cash equivalents and had no borrowings outstanding under our sixty million dollar revolving credit facility we also repurchased five point two million dollars in principal of our senior notes due two thousand twenty at a discount we further strengthened our balance sheet by extending our debt maturity profile subsequent to the quarter end in october we issued two hundred and fifty million dollars of new seven and a quarter percent senior notes due october two thousand and two Twenty five to refinance our existing senior notes due april two thousand and twenty two in connection with this refinance, we estimate a one time pre-tax charge of approximately eight million dollars to be recorded in the fourth quarter we also entered into a new sixty million dollar senior unsecured revolving credit facility on october thirtieth that has a maturity date of april thirtieth two thousand and twenty three a one and a half year period Extension from the previous bank credit facility the extension of these debt maturities will allow us to make long-term investments as we replenish our land portfolio and position the company for long-term success lastly, we spent fourteen million dollars on land and land deposits during the quarter we plan on increasing our land spend in the near future but remain focused on maintaining a proper balance between building liquidity managing leverage and rebuilding our land pipeline I'll now turn the call back to larry for his concluding remarks thanks, john we've been working hard as a company to make progress on a number of fronts this year and our results for the third quarter demonstrate that we have made significant headway we improved our profitability by expanding our gross margins and further diversified our operations by continuing to close out legacy high-price communities and open more affordable ones faster-selling communities we also strengthened our balance sheet by generating strong cash flow from operations, reducing our net leverage and extending our debt maturity profile these achievements have put us on more stable footing and give us a clear path to better results in the future i want to thank all of our team members for how they've performed during these difficult times handling these A significant increase in business-related experience would be challenging enough during normal times let alone in the middle of a pandemic and i'm really appreciative of your efforts that concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be happy to take your questions thank you at this time we'll be conducting a question and answer session if you'd like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate when it's your turn to speak Your line is in the question queue. you may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key. our first question comes from the line of allan rattner with zellman and associates. please proceed with your question. hey, guys, good morning. congratulations on all the progress during the quarter and the strong results. first question, maybe, start off on the pricing side. larry, Leonard so it sounds like you guys have had some success pushing price in a quarter and obviously the longer term margin goal is is a certainly i think looking a lot stronger now given the pricing environment. but i'm curious if you could maybe just talk a little bit and quantify maybe the level of price increases you guys have pushed through in the last couple of months and and i'm curious if you've seen any pushback to any of those price increases at this point i guess here in early november assuming some of those price increases at this point i guess here in early november assuming some of those price increases at this point i guess here in early november assuming some of those price increases at this point i guess here in early november assuming some of those price increases at this point i guess here in early november assuming some of those price increases at this point i guess here in early november assuming some of those price increases at Have been more recent. have been more recent. have been more recent. have been more recent. have been more recent. have been more recent. have been more recent. have

recent. have been more recent. have been more recent. have been more recent. have been more recent. Expanded communities, second home communities at the lower end, and then at the higher end are really some of our suburban communities. we've continued to price it, push those prices all through the quarter. and really, we haven't seen the resistance yet, as of today. and we continue to look for every opportunity we can to grow margins. that's great to hear. second question, you know, you mentioned, and this is a similar message we've heard from other builders, just about the need to You know, kind of slow things down a little bit, not get backlogs too far extended, and i think that makes a lot of sense. although, you know, for you guys, you're in a little bit of a different situation in that, you know, you're growing off of an admittedly fairly small level of activity. so i was a little bit surprised that you wouldn't be in a position where you could kind of let things run a bit hotter here and i'm curious if you could talk a little bit, maybe rank order, the constraints that you're seeing that would prevent you from, from leaving that go, go hotter for a longer period of time. In terms of your absorption rate, is it a land issue? i know your lot count has been trending quite a bit lower in the more recent quarters. or is it more difficulty sourcing labor? you know, perhaps the scale benefits that some of the larger builders have, is that working as a disadvantage to you guys in trying to get labor in this tight environment? yeah, it's a bit of a challenge. again, what i'd like to do is i'd like to dive a little bit deeper into that. so, let's go with the latter. so, the latter of the two is driving it more or less, alan. it's like in a perfect world, you'd sell one home per quarter. yeah, it's a bit of a challenge. again, what i'd like to do is i'd Week and start four homes per month and really that's what our trade partners are set up for and we've kind of prepared them for that. they've made the commitment to deliver that. so you know we just want to make sure again that our sold and unstarted backlog doesn't get too far out front. especially in an environment of rising prices. we know that future land prices land's gonna cost more in the future and so really it's the capacity of our trade partners. so we continue to measure that. We've gone a little bit lighter on sales releases for that reason and we think that's the best course of action and and when i say if i could add i really do think it it varies by market and also by a newer housing program or older housing program so it isn't just a one size fits all lennar and john have worked pretty carefully at trying to analyze where we have opportunities and where we don't have opportunities Um, and where there's more challenges, and in some cases, you know, our goal is to build out older projects and get through it, but in other cases, if we're not going to be able to start a house for two or three months, it doesn't make any sense to put it up for sale in a market that continues to be strong, and so, you know, i actually think we're being very logical and we're attempting to do what makes the most sense. Aiming to maximize the profits. And if you look at the communities we've opened in the last twelve months, you'd see a significant increase in both absorption and margin. And in this, we're hoping that we're going to be able to keep that the absorption steady and the margins improving. There's no reason why we shouldn't be able to. Great, I appreciate that extra color there, Larry. And if I can, This sneak in one more here you kind of brought up the land market a little bit um you know what you're seeing right now because you know now that the debt refinancing's behind you guys you obviously have a little bit more runway and visibility from the balance sheet perspective so i would imagine you know you're kind of stepping on the gas a little bit here on the land side of things and at the same time i would imagine your competitors are as well given how strong the selling environment has been so what what's the availability of some of those quicker turn deals that you could kind of put pen to paper on? Paper, too, and potentially get on the ground here over the next twelve or eighteen months well, it's it is it is well, let me just start, land in the markets we're in has always been challenging. always and one of the strengths of our organization has been that we have land relationships that go back over thirty years whether with master developers or our well, let me just start, land in the markets we're in has always been challenging. always and one of the strengths of our organization has been that we have land relationships that go back over thirty years whether with master developers or With individuals and it is tougher now, but where we are continuing to find opportunities and there is no reason why we won't be able to, you know, grow the business over the next two to three years but one thing you have to be aware of, and our investors, i hope they all understand, is that when california is your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, Strongest marketplace it takes a couple of years to from when you buy a piece of ground to when you're closing houses. and we've been planning that and we understand that that's a situation we're in. but don't lose sight of the fact that if anything, when the market is particularly tough or difficult because of a lot of competition relationships matter more than ever and that's one thing that We have and we always have and we always will have and with that, larry, please keep going. yeah, i think you hit most of the points, larry. i would say, alan, we're certainly back in the market. and we are kind of bookending this. we're looking for opportunities that we can basically get control of, that we can open a mall within twelve to eighteen months and then we're because of somewhat limited capital, we're looking for opportunities that we can basically get control of, that we can open a mall within twelve to eighteen months and then we're looking for opportunities that we can basically get control of, that we can open a mall within twelve to eighteen months and then we're looking for opportunities that we can basically get control of, that we can open a mall within twelve to FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO FILL OUR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR PIPELINE AND THOSE THE PROFILE THOSE DEALS WOULD LOOK QUITE DIFFERENTLY THAT LAND COMPETITIVE MARKET IS COMPLETELY HAS REALLY COMPETITIVE RIGHT NOW AS YOU WOULD EXPECT WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS TYING UP SOME INTERESTING OPPORTUNITIES AND I WOULD SAY ARIZONA IS THE MOST COMPETITIVE LAND ENVIRONMENT TODAY AND SO THAT'S PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS TO IDENTIFY ASSETS THAT MAKE SENSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY MAKE SENSE AND THAT WE CAN DELIVER ON THOSE RETURNS I'D ADD ONE OTHER THING TO YOUR PRIOR QUESTION REAL QUICK UM WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT KIND OF SALES PACE AND RUNNING IT A LITTLE BIT HOTTER I WILL SAY EVEN WITH THE STEPS THAT WE'VE TAKEN AND YOU KNOW WE DISCLOSED THE MONTH OF OCTOBER OCTOBER WAS A REALLY STRONG MONTH EVEN WITH THOSE MEASURES IT'S THE THIRD STRONGEST SALES MONTH IN THE COMPAN And we averaged average absorption of three point five, and that's even counting close-out communities where we have two, three, four homes left to sell, that kind of weighs that down a little bit. so again, it's still an extremely strong market, and we're kind of really excited about the future and what it can be for the company. great, thanks a lot, alan. thank you. thank you, ladies and gentlemen. as a reminder, if you'd like to join the call, Question cue, please press star one on your telephone keypad. our next question comes from the line of alex barrett with housing research center. please proceed with your question. morning, guys. great job. thanks, alex. thanks, alex. thanks, alex. i was curious you'd mentioned here you're starting to do some fee work for five point. do you have any sense of timing you can share with us? when those first deliver their revenue? This is more of probably you get you book earnings right when construction happens. so, can you kind of help give us an idea how to model that? sure, this is good morning, alex, this is leonard. yeah, so i'm sure you're aware it's a slightly different fee structure than say what we've done with the urban company in the past. and so in this case, we take on all of the normal builder responsibilities and the community will be branded under the new home name. we we Sell a market to the homes, construct them, and then take the back-in service as well. so the community will open during the first quarter and open for sales. so that's when, you know, we will go to sell, and then within the next two to three months, we should see first closings. so the way the fee structure works is we get a portion of the fee through the life of the project, and then we get a back-in portion of the fee at the close of the home. so even today, we'd be recognized very, you know, a small amount of money. Fee, but the significant fee would start coming in probably the end of q one, early q two. we're also really excited. i think it was noted in the release that over the last six months we've been approached on several different fronts from it for some pretty exciting fee opportunities, including the single family rental business where we're talking to folks in arizona and we have a really exciting opportunity here in california to build up to thirteen, fourteen hundred homes. so We think it can drive a significant part of our business, help us grow earnings while not having to put any form of significant capital into the business. okay, great. and then on the joint venture side, i noticed there's very few lots left. is that basically winding down or will you will that stay alive, i guess, in future years? alexis, john stevens. yeah, we are sort of winding down. Down the joint venture business we've got like i said on the call only a few lots left in our davis canyon project in northern california we have about i think seven homes left to deliver out at our mountain shadows community and then really the remaining lots are at our fullsome ranch deal up in northern california called russell ranch and we're in the process of exiting that partnership right now and i would say in the near term we really don't have any plans to enter Any new joint ventures at this time. but you know it's possible if the right opportunity came along that we would entertain that. but for now that part of the business is really winding down. okay, great. and then on the effective date, one more on the amended debt that you guys just raised is the plan to pay off the twenty twenty two short term or closer, you know, it's already done. yeah, we effectuated that last week. we closed on the debt. New bonds i believe it was on the twenty eighth of october and all the the previous twenty two notes have been extinguished and so that's done and then we used some of the cash some of our cash on hand to pay off the balance because we raised two hundred and fifty million in new notes and we had about roughly two hundred and ninety million of principal in the old notes so ok great i'll get back to the committee sure thanks Thank you. our next question comes in line. a jason finch with a private investor. please proceed with your question. thanks for taking my question, guys. and congratulations on the strong quarter. my question really just kind of pertains to the priorities for capital deployment going forward. you mentioned how you successfully beleaguered the balance sheet and extended maturities. and the outlook for the business seems exceptionally strong. and you guys are significantly Generating cash flow. but with your stock trading at half a book value or basically half a tangible book of value, it's hard to really imagine there's a better use of cash right now than buying back your own stock. so really what are your thoughts around potential share repurchases and really how can we focus and think about priorities for the capital deployment going forward? that's a great question, jason. thank you. yeah, you know, we've we've looked at all aspects of use of our capital and we've we've looked at all aspects of use of our capital and we've we've looked at all aspects of use of our capital and we've we've looked at all aspects of use of our capital and we've we've looked at all aspects of use of our capital and we've we Been very focused as you mentioned on really deleveraging the business and refinancing our bonds and pushing out the revolver extension which was a was a big important thing that we we completed on friday so it really pushes us in a position now where we can reinvest in the business you know obviously we we did buy quite a few shares in the front half of the year when we saw the stock price depressed very significantly and and i agree with you at trading at a half of multiple of book value isn't Where we'd like to be but on the other hand, we do need to reinvest in our business a little bit and we will evaluate really all aspects of where to allocate the capital going forward. We do have a little bit left on our authorization from our board, it's about one point seven million left authorized currently but again, we've been on pause on the land act side for a little bit now and we will sort of layer some of that in going forward. AGAIN WE DO NEED TO SORT OF BALANCE OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND IT'S A FAIR QUESTION BUT WE WE DO NEED TO REINVEST IN THE BUSINESS TOO SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ON ALL FRONTS MOVING FORWARD JOHN DO YOU ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THE IDEA OF WHERE WE ARE WITH LEVERAGE WHERE WE CAME FROM AND WHERE YOU SEE US MOVING TO IN THE FUTURE Point one percent at the end of the quarter um you know it's down almost a thousand basis points from where we were a year ago we will as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we will have a charge from the refinancing of the of the old bonds which will come through in q four but moving forward we're probably running the company with the idea of between forty five and fifty percent on a net debt cap basis moving forward Any other questions? not from me, thank you. and congratulations again, good luck. thank you. thanks, jason. thank you. our next question is a follow-up from the line of alex barron with housing research center. please proceed with your question. yeah, thanks for taking my follow-up. so i noticed in arizona, you guys managed to open several communities this quarter. just wondering, is there any more in the pipeline going into next year, or is this as good as it gets? Roughly gonna be the community count through next year. yeah, alex, this is lennard. you're right. you know, over the last five months, we've opened seven communities in three different locations. and obviously, we're very excited about the early results where we're seeing strong absorption and strong margins. so again, we're really excited about our team there on the ground. we have one community count through next year. Community slated to open in the first half of next year and that's, you know, at this point we have other things that we're currently working on, but that's primarily the one that we can talk about today. yeah, and it looks like we'll we're at eight communities now at the end of q3 i think one of them probably drops off in q4 and then we'll probably run that seven community range plus or minus for the year right. depending on how quickly we sell through some of these communities. That's what we're expecting for the for the bulk of next year, but it may taper a little bit in q four of next year until we re-load on a few communities we're working on now okay, great and then as far as gross margins i think you gave us a range for for next year i mean for next quarter which is a little bit down versus this quarter is that mainly because of the impact of lumber or is there something else there? It really has to do with some of the close-out communities we have on the luxury condominium side. where the good news is we're selling through those the downside is that the margins are a little bit weaker in those communities and with on a higher average selling price. Alex, so i think once those all get disposed of and delivered in q four, i think our margins look positive moving forward. and again, i think thirteen eight to fourteen two, we feel pretty good about that. but again, part of it's going to be what we're doing. of those higher-priced lower-margin communities sort of deliver and close out in queue four is primarily the impact for for the margin. okay, awesome. thanks. best of luck for next year. thanks. thanks, alex. thanks, alex. thank you. ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. i'll turn the floor back to mister webb for any final comments. thanks very much. as as all of you can see, we have really made significant progress. as as all of you can see, we have really made significant progress. as as all of you can see, we have really made significant progress. as as all of you can see, we have really made significant progress. as as all of you can see, we have really made significant progress. as as all of you can see, we have really made significant progress. as as all of you Progress over the last three months and when and and of course, part of it is because of the improved housing market. but a part of it has been in the works for a long time based on our strategic planning. and i wanted to commend leonard and john because they've really done a terrific job. we really believe the future is bright for the new home company and we're extremely excited. About the next two years as we move forward. so with that, i want to thank all of you and stay tuned because again, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. thank you. thank you. this concludes today's conference. you may disconnect your lines at this time. thank you for your participation.

I am both proud and grateful for their efforts. The investments we've put toward leveraging data analytics to inform our strategies around product, e-commerce, and marketing continue to pay dividends in driving growth and new customers and strong retention rates. We have also made great strides in driving improved profitability to that end, in addition to once again generating double-digit growth on our global e-commerce. Business, we delivered 52 percent adjusted ebitda growth in the third quarter. This performance underscores the momentum behind the land's end brand and the progress we are making in delivering long-term profitable growth. Additionally, the launch of land's end into coal's dot com and a hundred and fifty coal stores at the end of september is off to a strong start. Based on the early success, we plan to expand the land's end assortment and increase the number of points of distribution from one hundred and fifty coal stores to three.

Our strongest performers were sleepwear, loungewear, and knits. Fleece also performed well, reflecting demand for transitional outerwear for the fall season. Home furnishings, particularly bed and bath, remains an area of strength as people spend more time at home. We will maintain our emphasis on comfort and value as consumers continue to work from home and spend more hours indoors during the cold weather months. Turning now to marketing, we remain focused. We utilize data analytics and search engine optimization programs to attract new customers while simultaneously leveraging data to drive greater personalization with existing customers. We also continue to successfully leverage AI to analyze customer behavior and further refine our promotions to optimize sales and achieve higher margins. Our let's get comfy messaging continues to resonate with consumers and will remain front and center through the holiday season. Our strong product offerings will continue to drive our success.

I will speak more to these longer-term strategies following Jim's remarks. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim. Thank you, Jerry. Man, and good morning. Our globally commerce business once again delivered strong performance in the third quarter while, as expected, our outfitter business remained challenged as a result of the pandemic. We continue to make great progress on the strategies we have outlined while leveraging our strong foundation to advance our growth initiatives. Total revenue increased five point nine percent to three hundred sixty million compared to three hundred forty million last year. Momentum. Continued in our global e-commerce business which increased twenty percent with strong results in our U.S. e-commerce business which grew approximately fourteen percent and our international e-commerce business with a fifty one percent increase for the quarter. During the quarter we saw strength in a number of our categories including fleece sleepwear loungewear and nits as well as in our home business with many consumers still working from home. These categories delivered double digit growth in the quarter. Our marketing strategies emphasize comfort and value in our product assortments. Partially offsetting the strong global e-commerce growth, sales in our outfitter business were down 26 percent due to ongoing pressure as a result of COVID-19. The outfitter's results reflect overall sequential improvement versus last quarter, although our travel-related national accounts and our small and mid-size businesses remain challenged. The most significant improvement came in our school uniform business, where sales were up. Approximately flat to last year for the quarter. Overall, we expect performance in this business to remain copy with the recent spike in the pandemic. Moving to our retail business, sales decreased approximately forty four percent in the third quarter to eight million dollars. This decrease was driven by lower traffic due to the pandemic, partially offset by improved conversion in our stores. Gross margin in the third quarter increased approximately ten basis points to forty five point four percent as compared. Last year gross margin benefited from our improved promotional strategies and continued use of analytics. This was partially offset by higher shipping costs and surcharges as well as sales mix from our growing third-party business. As a percentage of sales, SG&A improved by approximately two hundred and thirty basis points to thirty-seven point nine percent compared to thirty-nine point eight percent in the third quarter of last year. This improvement was a result of increased sales combined with the use of analytics. CONTINUED DISCIPLINE EXPENSE MANAGEMENT ACROSS OUR ENTIRE BUSINESS INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION COMPARED TO AN EXPENSE OF ONE POINT THREE MILLION LAST YEAR NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER WAS SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION OR TWENTY TWO CENTS PER SHARE COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF THREE POINT SIX MILLION OR ELEVEN CENTS PER SHARE LAST YEAR IN ADDITION TO THESE GAP MEASURES, WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR PROFIT BUILDING At the end of the quarter, Jocasta was at twenty eight point six million, which is approximately a fifty two percent increase versus last year's Jocasta of eighteen point eight million. Turning to the balance sheet, inventories at the end of the quarter were four hundred ninety nine point eight million, roughly flat to a year ago. The strong sell-through of our globally commerce business has positioned us with healthy and lean inventories as we head into the holiday season. Inventory levels related to our apparel business. We expect to work through this merchandise as the business environment improves. During the third quarter, we secured a new term loan of two hundred seventy-five million. The loan proceeds combined with borrowings under the company's ABL facility were used to refinance our prior term loan, which was due in April of twenty twenty one. Upon the closing of the refinancing, the maximum availability under the ABL facility would be available. The Pbl facility was expanded by seventy five million to two hundred and seventy five million the new term loan extends our debt maturation and further enhances our strong liquidity position with a more flexible balance sheet turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter we now expect net revenue to be between five hundred and five hundred and twenty million driven by our global e commerce business as a reminder last year's results included approximately forty million from our american airlines AIRLINES LAUNCH AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE AMERICAN AIRLINES LAUNCH, EXPECTED NET REVENUE FOR THE QUARTER WOULD BE BETWEEN A TWO PERCENT DECREASE AND A TWO PERCENT INCREASE VERSUS PRIOR YEAR. WE EXPECT NET INCOME OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE TO SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO BE BETWEEN FORTY ONE AND FIFTY THREE CENTS. Turn the call back over to Jerome to discuss the progress on our core growth strategies. Thanks, Jim. Despite the continued uncertainty related to COVID-19, we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage our business effectively and deliver meaningful ebitda growth during a very difficult environment. We remain focused on driving market share gains through continuously enhancing our engagement with existing customers and gaining market share through our own channel as well as through new partnerships and collaborations. OUR FOUR CORE GROWTH STRATEGIES REMAIN: GETTING THE PRODUCT RIGHT, BEING A DIGITALLY DRIVEN COMPANY, IMPLEMENTING A UNIT CHANNEL DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY, AND ENHANCING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESSES. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESPONSE TO OUR PRODUCT OFFERING IN THE QUARTER. AS WE HEAD INTO THE HOLIDAY SEASON IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TIME FOR GIFT GIVING. OUR KEY ITEM STRATEGY WILL FOCUS ON SLEEPWEAR To emphasize whole house family messaging specifically with regards to patterns, our let's get comfy theme, highly relevant in today's environment, will remain the focus of our messaging within digital. We continue to see incredible opportunity to drive traffic and market share as we refine our search engine optimization techniques. Our holiday promotional and markdown strategy will continue to leverage data analytics and machine learning to effectively determine optimal prices for our customers as a result. MARKDOWNS AND HIGHER PRODUCT MARGIN RATES THAN PREVIOUS YEARS DESPITE THE HIGHLY PROMOTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND INCREMENTAL SHIPPING EXPENSES AS WE ADVANCE OUR DATA ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER WE WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN FURTHER KNOWLEDGE OF CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR TRENDS TURNING TO OUR RETAIL BUSINESS WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR RETAIL TRENDS TO EVALUATE A POST PANDEMIC STORE STRATEGY HOWEVER WITH THE CURRENT RISING Customers turning to our more recent growth initiatives beyond our own channels are very pleased to see the strong response to Lands' End brand on both Kohls.com and in the hundred and fifty launched stores. The product is resonating with customers and we will be expanding our assortment within these doors and Kohls.com. In addition, we plan to double our door count with Kohls to three hundred in twenty twenty one. We remain confident that this is a great opportunity to expand our reach given the Kohls customer profile shares the same demographic. Features as the land's end customer in our outfitter's business, our long-term strategy is to focus on our personalization capabilities which we believe will attract new customers as well as serve the needs of existing customers. We plan to implement enhancements to our business outfitter site to leverage some of the improvements we have implemented on our consumer website. While we are in the early stages, we believe this will support longer-term growth in our outfitter's business. With regard to the land's end marketplace, we now have thirteen. THIRD PARTY VENDORS SELLING PRODUCT ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE ARE SEEING INITIAL RESULTS IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS OUR GOAL IS TO REACH TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE THIRD PARTY VENDORS SELLING PRODUCT BY YEAR END BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO Q A I'D LIKE TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR INITIATIVES AROUND DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION AS THIS REMAINS OF SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE TO US AS AN ORGANIZATION FIRST WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR DIVERSITY AND INCL AND WILL WORK TO CREATE PROGRAMMING AND GOALS FOR OUR COMPANY TO WORK TOWARDS. TO THAT END, THE COUNCIL HAS ESTABLISHED BOTH TRAINING MODULES AND SPEAKER SERIES THAT ARE RESPECTIVELY REQUIRED OF AND OPEN TO ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES. WE HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED BUSINESS RESOURCE GROUPS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR OUR EMPLOYEES WITH SHARED EXPERIENCES. WE WANT ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES TO FEEL THEY HAVE A VOICE AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED In conclusion, we are incredibly energized by the strong momentum in our business. We recognize the uncertainty in the environment and it may extend for a period of time creating both challenges and opportunities. And we will manage our business accordingly. The strong foundation we put in place and the progress we continue to make on our strategic initiatives give us great confidence in our ability to navigate the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities as we drive growth in our business. We look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters. And with that, I'll open it up to questions. Thank you. As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone to withdraw your question. Please press the pound key. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Fermin with Craig Hallum. Your line is now open. Great, thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. You know, I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN SEEING SO FAR. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE THE UNSEASONABLY WARM WEATHER HAS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF AN IMPACT ON YOUR OUTERWEAR BUSINESS ANYTHING TO CALL OUT YOU KNOW NOW THAT WE'RE JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THANKSGIVING WEEKEND ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW HOW YOUR BRANDS PERFORMED DURING DURING BLACK FRIDAY AND THROUGH CYBER MONDAY ANYTHING NOTABLE TO CALL OUT THERE I THINK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WE' Season with obviously an emphasis on online shopping black friday itself was a positive day for us both domestically and internationally we saw solid growth in our business year over year and we're pretty encouraged by the continued resilience and performance of our global e-commerce business but the fourth quarter got off to a slower start in the us particularly due to our heavy auto category i don't like to bring up weather i always think weather is kind of a cheap excuse but i think as everybody knows cold weather REALLY STARTED YET AND IF YOU COUPLE THAT WITH PEOPLE STAYING HOME AND INDOORS AND NOT COMMUTING BECAUSE OF COVID THE DEMAND FOR HEAVY OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES JUST ISN'T THERE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR OTHER CATEGORIES AS YOU WOULD EXPECT OUR OTHER CATEGORIES ARE PERFORMING WELL SAME CATEGORIES IN THIRD QUARTER GOING INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD GOOD DEMAND FOR IT GREAT THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL THANKS AND NOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GU Have there been any, you know, particular marketing channel that's that's been effective or or new products that have been bringing new customers in or has that just kind of been a continuation of the effort that you've been putting in place for a while now? It's a bit of a mix. I mean, obviously search has always been, you know, the lion's share where we have new customers coming in from a marketing standpoint. But what we've seen is that a couple of other areas are performing super well for us even though we put smaller dollars into social media. It's doing really well. We've got some video out on connected TV which seems to be doing a pretty good job for us. Couple that with, you know, big increases in knitwear, loungewear, activewear, which is bringing in a lot of newer customers for us. And those customers tend to be on the younger side, from where our adjusting customer base is, so that looks pretty good for us. You know, closely impacted by, by the pandemic. just curious, me, you work with a lot of the biggest companies out there in, in retail and transportation. what, what's the outlook for next year? i mean, at what point do you think things are gonna start turning around for, for some of your big customers? i think that, that what you're gonna see is a longer clawbacks in any of the travel-related products anybody that's truly related to travel right now is seeming to see is a longer clawbacks in any of the travel-related products anybody that's truly related to travel right now is seeming to see is a longer clawbacks in any of the travel-related products anybody that's truly related to travel right now is seeming to see is a longer clawbacks in any Increases, albeit small increases. i think where we're really gonna be concentrating in the outfitters business is gonna be on those small and mid-sized businesses and making their customer experience easier. we think that there's a big opportunity for us to improve the customer experience online of getting your product logo or getting your product customized in multiple ways and making that an easier, an easier customer experience. and that's what we're gonna see. COMMERCIATION AND THAT PART OF BUSINESS YOU KNOW ALEX, I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON THAT AS FAR AS THE UNDERWRITERS. IT'S REALLY THREE DIFFERENT BUSINESSES IF YOU REMEMBER IT'S ABOUT ONE THIRD SCHOOL, ONE THIRD SMALL MID-SIZED BUSINESS AND ONE THIRD LARGE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS. SO JEROME MENTIONED THAT THE LARGE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IS PROBABLY GONNA BE THE SLOWEST RECOVERY WE WERE VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE THE SEQUENTIAL IMPRO Very much, both of you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Morrada with C L King and Associates. Your line is now open. Good morning, Jerome and Jim. Congratulations on the third quarter as well. As far as Jerome, you just touched on it as it relates to staying at home or outerwear. Assuming we get a relatively normal winter season from this time. FORWARD COULD THERE STILL BE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THAT CATEGORY JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GOING OUT AS MUCH AND IF SO HOW DO YOU QUANTIFY THAT I THINK STEVE FROM WHAT WE PUT OUT WITH GUIDANCE WE'VE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT WE THINK WILL BE HAPPENING OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW MONTHS YOU KNOW THE COLD WEATHER IS REALLY IN FRONT OF US NOT BEHIND US BASED UPON THE DATE SO FAR SO I THINK WE'VE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND THE GUIDANCE I THINK AS FAR AS QUANTIFICATION STEVE TO JEROME'S POINT IT'S IN THE GUIDANCE. I THINK THE OTHER THING WE FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT AND WE MENTION THIS BECAUSE WE HAD SUCH A HEALTHY BACK END OF THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE THIRD QUARTER OUR INVENTORY POSITIONS ARE SO HEALTHY SO LEAN THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WE MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CHALLENGE IN SOME OF THE HEAVY OTHER WAREHOUSE YOU KNOW WE DON'T THINK THERE'S PERCENTAGE OF SALES RIGHT NOW AND HOW CAN YOU CAPITALIZE ON THAT SEGMENT OF THE BUSINESS GOING FORWARD? I THINK A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WORK THERE INTERNATIONALLY ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU HEAR US DOING ON THE U S SIDE. I THINK SO MANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL QUARTERS SHARE FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FROM A DIGITAL PERSPECTIVE FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FROM A DIGITAL ANALYTICS PERSPECTIVE FROM WHAT What we've been doing with capturing new customers, we're now rolling many of those things out, especially in Europe, and we've really seen significant positive impacts there. And how big a percentage of sales was that in the third quarter? I don't think we give that as a specific number, but I think you can go back to history and do some of the math, obviously it continues to grow. The overall global e-commerce business is now probably up over 80 percent as a percent of our total. I'm sorry, there seems to be an error in the transcription. Could you please provide me with the correct transcription?"

WILL JUST MOVE RIGHT INTO THE NEXT UH THE NEXT DISCUSSION YOU CAN SUBMIT QUESTIONS UH TO US VIA UH EMAIL TO MYSELF OR <UNK> UH YOU CAN ALSO USE BLOOMBERG IV TO FIND US WITH QUESTIONS OR YOU CAN USE THE Q&A BOX WITHIN UH YOUR ZOOM WINDOW UM SO WITH WITH NO FURTHER ADO LET'S GET STARTED UM WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE WITH US THIS MORNING AMERICAN EXPRESS DOUG BUCKMINSTER GROUP HEAD GLOBAL CONSUMER SERVICES IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN DOUG I WISH IT WAS IN PERSON I WISH IT WAS IN CARNEGIE HALL BUT MAYBE NEXT YEAR HOW ARE YOU EXACTLY IT'S GREAT GREAT TO SEE YOU TOO CRAIG THANKS FOR HAVING ME YEAH YOU BET UM SO UM LOVE THE BACKGROUND LOVE THE IMAGE UM BUT- <LAUGH> LET ME UH WHILE WE GET STARTED WITH JUST YOU KNOW A A UM A BROAD QUESTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW CAN YOU UPDATE US ON THE STATE OF CONSUMER AND OVERALL SPENDING AT THIS POINT IN THE RECOVERY YEAH YOU KNOW I I THINK UM AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WE SAW THE TROUGH IN APRIL AND WE'VE SEEN A REBOUND SINCE THEN YOU KNOW I WOULD CHARACTERIZE UH THE TREND SINCE MID JULY AS RELATIVELY STABLE ON THE NON TNT SIDE SO OUTSIDE OF TNT RELATIVELY STABLE LITTLE BOUNCING AROUND DUE TO DAYS MIX TIMING OF HOLIDAYS LIKE LABOR DAY IN PARTICULAR AND SLOW VERY STEADY GROWTH BUT BUT SLOW GROWTH ON THE TNT SIDE RIGHT SO I I WOULD SAY STABLE WOULD BE THE THE ADJECTIVE THAT CAPTURES THAT DUST OKAY UM AT THIS POINT I ASSUME COULD WE PERHAPS CHARACTERIZE THIS A LITTLE GO A LITTLE DEEPER ON THIS EX TNT UM IF YOU WERE TO CHARACTERIZE THE OVERALL VOLUMES YOU'RE SEEING EX TNT EX CORPORATE CARD YOU KNOW REALLY ARE CONSUMERS GETTING BACK TOWARD POSITIVE TERRITORY WITHIN CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS AT THIS POINT YEAH I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW CONSUMERS CONSUME RIGHT THEY'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT A WAY UH TO LIVE THEIR LIFE AND UM AND ENRICH THEIR LIVES AND I WOULD SAY WHILE THERE'S A LOT OF SUBSTITUTION IN THE NON CANDY SPACE ESPECIALLY PHYSICAL FOR FOR ONLINE AND E-COM I WOULD SAY WE FEEL GOOD THAT HEALTHY LEVELS OF CONSUMER VOLUMES THERE UM I THINK WHAT'S GONNA WHAT'S GONNA DEFINE THE TRAJECTORY OF UH VOLUME REBOUND FROM HERE ON OUT IS UH IS THE DIRECTION OF TNT WHICH WHICH YOU KNOW IS A CATEGORY UH WE OVER INDEX ON SO MAYBE SOME THOUGHTS THERE YOU KNOW AMEX HAS A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF TNT THAN I THINK ANY OTHER CARD ISSUER ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE NETWORK AND THE INSIGHTS YOU GET OFF OF THAT UM ON A GLOBAL BASIS SO MAYBE UH YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE RECOVER FROM THIS ARE THERE ANY GREEN SHOOTS YOU'RE SEEING IN TNT AT ALL AT THIS POINT I MEAN I THINK UM YOU KNOW MY POSITION IS CONSUMER TRAVEL WILL COME BACK UM I THINK THAT'S OUR OUR ENTERPRISE POSITION IS THAT WE EXPECT CONSUMER TRAVEL TO COME BACK IT'S AN ESSENTIAL PART OF UH THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY IN OUR DEMOGRAPHIC UM I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN TO DATE IN TERMS OF THE REBOUND IS AN EFFECT OF SUBSTITUTION SO PEOPLE SUBSTITUTING DRIVING VACATIONS HOMESTAY RENTALS FOR YOU KNOW UH FOR AIR BASED TRAVEL AND IN SOME CATEGORIES WE'VE SEEN INNOVATION AS WELL RIGHT I'VE SEEN THE DINING SPACE IN PARTICULAR EXPANSION OF OUTDOOR DINING PICK UP TAKE AWAY DELIVERY AT HOME MEAL PREP UH THAT LEVEL OF INNOVATION HAS UH HAS BOUNCED UH THE RESTAURANT CATEGORY MORE THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT JUST FROM DYING IN VOLUMES ALONE RIGHT UM SO I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE WHEN WE GET BACK TO HISTORIC LEVELS I THINK IS IS LARGELY A QUESTION OF OF CONFIDENCE AND MEDICAL SOLUTIONS RIGHT I THINK I I THINK UH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VACCINE THE APPROVAL OF THE VACCINE I EXPECT WILL UNLEASH A LOT OF ANTICIPATORY AND PENT UP DEMAND ON CONSUMERS THEY WILL START TRAVEL PLANNING AGAIN THE INTEREST IN TRAVEL BASED PAYMENT PRODUCTS AND TRAVEL BASED LOYALTY CURRENCIES I THINK WILL WILL SPIKE IS ALL THAT PENT UP DEMAND FOR TRAVEL PEOPLE START TO SEE THE END IN SIGHT THOUGH THEY START TO BUILD CONFIDENCE THAT IN A SIX TO 12 MONTH TIME PERIOD UH THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TRAVEL AGAIN BUT I THINK GETTING BACK TO HISTORIC UH VOLUMES IS GONNA REQUIRE THAT MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> AND IN TERMS OF HOW THAT AFFECTS THE DISCOUNT RATE AT AMERICAN EXPRESS UM ESPECIALLY WITHOUT THE LONG HAUL CRO THE THE LONG HAUL TRAVEL UM MAYBE A A DISCUSSION THERE JUST BRIEFLY REMIND INVESTORS HOW THAT DYNAMIC IS PLAYING OUT YEAH WELL THERE'S NO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT UM THE TNT VOLUMES TAKING A DISPROPORTIONATE HIT LIKE THIS DOES HAVE A MIXED RELATED IMPACT ON OUR DISCOUNT RATE RIGHT SO I THINK UM YOU KNOW THE DISCOUNT RATE WE WE'VE BEEN ON RECORD FOR A FEW YEARS NOW SAYING WE WE GRIND DOWN LESS ON ABSOLUTE DISCOUNT RATE AND ARE FOCUSED ON DRIVING DISCOUNT REVENUE AND UTILITY THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE DARK BLUE CERTAIN B2B CATEGORIES UM BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION YOU KNOW THAT HISTORIC DISCOUNT RATE HAS TAKEN A MIX RELATED IMPACT AS A RESULT OF REALLY A DISPROPORTIONATE FALL IN UH IN TNT TNT SPEND OKAY WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL MOVE OFF OF THAT THAT TOPIC THAT ISN'T UH HELPFUL RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE DYNAMIC BUT MAYBE ON TO SOMETHING THAT IS WHICH IS YOU KNOW CAN YOU DISCUSS HOW SPENDING HABITS HAVE CHANGED YOU KNOW AND TO WHAT DEGREE YOU'RE SEEING THESE HABITS YOU KNOW COALESCE INTO LONG TERM UH REPEATABLE BEHAVIOR YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY AROUND E-COM CONTACTLESS- YEAH AND IF IT'S DIFFERENT BETWEEN CONSUMER SEGMENTS YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK UM MY TAKE ON THE EFFECTS OF THIS CRISIS ARE THAT IT DIDN'T CREATE ANY NEW TRENDS BUT IT CHANGED SORT OF THE SLOPE OF PRE EXISTING TRENDS RIGHT E-COMMERCE WAS TAKING SHARE FROM OFFLINE DIGITAL PAYMENTS WERE TAKING SHARE FROM CASH AT POS RIGHT AND WE HAVE SEEN A AN INFLECTION OR KINK IN THOSE CURVES UH AS MOST ISSUERS HAVE OVER THE LAST UH SIX MONTHS YOU KNOW WHETHER WE'VE SEEN THOSE TRENDS ACCELERATED BY YEAR TWO YEARS IT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS BUT I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS FROM THOSE TRENDS AS THE CRISIS UH AS THE CRISIS RELAXES UM YOU KNOW I THINK ON THE CONTACTLESS SIDE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE AROUND THAT THERE ARE MARKETS OUTSIDE THE US AS YOU KNOW SOUTHEAST ASIA AUSTRALIA THE UK WHERE THERE'S VERY DEEP UH CONTACTLESS PENETRATION AND UM AND THAT HAS CONTINUED TO GAIN SHARE DURING THIS CRISIS IN THE US THE CONTACTLESS VOLUMES ARE MUCH MORE MODEST THEY ARE INCREASING AT A RAPID RATE BUT I DO EXPECT THAT THE MOVE AWAY FROM CASH AND THE COMFORT WITH USING CREDIT PRODUCTS EVEN FOR MICRO LEVEL TRANSACTIONS AT POS UH WILL BE AN ENDURING OUTCOME OF THIS AND I I THINK UM WHILE I DON'T THINK IT DOES A LOT PER SE TO DRIVE DOLLAR VOLUMES OF BILLINGS I THINK IT DOES A LOT TO BUILD HABIT AND WALLET POSITION OF OF CREDIT PRODUCTS AND IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE US WHERE E-COM IS LESS ESTABLISHED IT'S HAD A MORE PROFOUND EFFECT LIKE ITALY IS A FACE-TO-FACE RETAIL MARKET WE'VE SEEN PHENOMENAL GROWTH IN E-COMMERCE WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WELL OVER 50% OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN E-COMMERCE IN ANY MONTH DURING THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE CRISIS HAD NEVER HAD AN E-COMMERCE TRANSACTION ON AMEX BEFORE WOW UM SO THERE WE'VE SEEN SOME REAL UM I I I AGAIN I THINK IT'S A TREND THAT WOULD HAVE PLAYED OUT BUT IT WAS A VERY LARGE ACCELERATION OF THAT TREND AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT AMEX HAS A A BETTER ACCEPTANCE FOOTPRINT OUTSIDE THE US IN E-ECOM THAN IT DOES IN BRICK AND MORTAR I YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE UH BY LARGE DUE TO PARTNERSHIPS WITH VARIOUS PSPS AND AGGREGATORS AND SUCH WE HAVE A REALLY STRONG FOOTPRINT IN IN E-COM OKAY UM SO IN TERMS OF UH THE HEALTH OF THE US CONSUMER THE HEALTH OF THE CONSUMER IN GENERAL YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HIGH HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT FURLOUGHS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS YOU KNOW AS WE SAW THIS MORNING UM IT'S BEEN REMARKABLE HOW WELL THE INDUSTRY IS FARING RIGHT NOW UM YOU KNOW I NOTICED THAT AMEX IS UH CREDIT QUALITY IS AT ITS BEST POINT OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS ON CONSUMER AND SHOCKINGLY ITS BEST POINT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS IN SMALL BUSINESS AND SO MAYBE SOME CONTEXT THERE BE YOU KNOW DISCOVERS UH CEO UH DID CAUSE SOME CONCERN THE OTHER DAY BY SAYING THEY EXPECT THE MATERIAL UPLIFT IN CREDIT QUALITY METRICS LATER THIS YEAR SO JUST YOUR PERSPECTIVE YEAH I MEAN UM LOOK I THINK MOST ISSUERS HAVE SEEN A MORE MODEST IMPACT THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPLIED BY THE END OF Q1 QUALITATIVE RESERVES THAT THEY TOOK RIGHT I THINK LOOKING AT MACRO INDICATORS AROUND UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS CHANGES IN SEQUENTIAL GDP YOU KNOW UH IF YOU WERE SITTING BACK BEING AN ARMCHAIR CREDIT MANAGER YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED UM MUCH LARGER AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON DELINQUENCY AND WRITE OFFS AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS AS YOU SAY WE HAVE UH WE HAVE NOT SEEN THEM AS MOST ISSUERS HAVEN'T PLAY OUT OF BY AND LARGE NOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONTRIBUTORS TO THAT RIGHT I WOULD SAY THE JOBLESS CLAIMS THE GEOGRAPHY OF THOSE THE THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THOSE JOBLESS CLAIMS YOU KNOW UH UH WEREN'T AS CONCENTRATED IN OUR CUSTOMER BASE OUR MEMBER BASE UM AS THE MACRO NUMBERS WOULD SUGGEST UH I WOULD ALSO SAY AS EVERYONE KNOWS THERE'S JUST A TON OF LIQUIDITY IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S THROUGH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS PRIVATE SECTOR FORBEARANCE PROGRAMS UM AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE WE HAVE CREDIT QUALITY AND DELINQUENCY AND RIGHT OFF SIDE THAT ARE BETTER YEAR ON YEAR UH THAN UH THAN THEY WERE UM YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE TO WHILE WHILE WE'RE PLEASED WITH THAT WE ALSO HAVE A HEALTHY LEVEL OF YOU KNOW PARANOIA ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BRING RIGHT THE MACRO ECONOMY SOME OF THESE FORBEARANCE PROGRAMS WITH 10% OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES BEING IN FORBEARANCE THAT KIND OF GOING AWAY GOVERNMENT SUPPORT UM MODERATING UH PERHAPS PRIVATE SECTOR FOLLOW THROUGH IN TERMS OF WHITE COLLAR JOB LOSSES SO YOU KNOW WE FEEL GREAT ABOUT THE EARLY INNINGS OF THIS CRISIS BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE MINDFUL THAT IT'S IT'S NOT OVER YOU KNOW JUST ARE THERE ANY SIGNS IN THE PORTFOLIO AT ALL THAT WOULD BE CONCERNING YOU KNOW LOOK I THINK IN THE IN THE COMMERCIAL OR SMALL BUSINESS PORTFOLIO CLEARLY THERE ARE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE MORE AFFECTED BY THIS FORTUNATELY THEY TEND TO BE INDUSTRIES WHERE OUR CONCENTRATION IS UH IS LOWER YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE SOME SOME THINGS ABOUT THIS CRISIS HAVE ACTUALLY IMPROVED VISIBILITY IN A WAY I MEAN WE HAVE REALLY GOOD VISIBILITY INTO OUR CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO FORBEARANCE PROGRAMS WITH COMPETITORS RIGHT WHICH ALLOWS US TO KINDA TARGET AND THINK ABOUT THE PRECISION OF OUR UNDERWRITING AND EXISTING CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT A LITTLE BIT MORE CRISPLY BUT BUT I WOULD SAY THERE ARE THERE ARE NO REAL HOTSPOTS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW I I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW BACK IN APRIL MAY ALL OF US HAD THESE SORT OF SHORT TERM CRISIS RELIEF PROGRAMS RIGHT WHERE PAYMENT HOLIDAY NO INTEREST CHARGED AND YOU KNOW TYPE THING YOU DO AFTER A NATURAL DISASTER LIKE A HURRICANE AND WE WE MADE A UH A JUDGMENT THAT WE WEREN'T GONNA KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD BY CONTINUING TO EXTEND THOSE PROGRAMS WE WERE GONNA WE WERE GONNA MOVE CUSTOMERS IF THEY NEEDED TO MOVE ON TO LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS FOR REPAYMENT CONFIDENCE RIGHT SO OUR 12 MONTH FINANCIAL RELIEF PROGRAM WHICH YOU KNOW ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE THEIR UH MINIMUM PAYMENT MAINTAIN THEIR MEMBERSHIP THEY DON'T GET THEIR MEMBERSHIP CANCELED AND RETAIN SOME LEVEL OF SPEND UTILITY AS WELL RIGHT AND WE THINK THAT UH THAT THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO TRANSITION THE PORTFOLIO UM IN A VERY CUSTOMER FRIENDLY WAY IN A WAY THAT HAS STABILIZED THE RECEIVABLES METRICS AS WELL OKAY UM I WANNA KEEP THIS TRY TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION WITH INVESTORS SO INVESTORS ARE FUNNELING QUESTIONS TO US AND WE JUST GOT ONE THAT UM I'LL JUST READ IT FOR YOU BASICALLY YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT TNT SPEND RECOVERY IS VERY LINKED TO COVID RESOLUTION YOU KNOW AS CUSTOMERS CURRENTLY DIVERT THAT SPENDING TOWARD NON TNT PURCHASES HOW IS AMEX ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF CUSTOMER SPENDING IN NON TNT AND HOW MEANINGFULLY CAN THAT MOVE THE NEEDLE ON BILLINGS GROWTH YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW WE DID EARLY IN THIS CRISIS IS DECIDE THAT WE WERE GONNA FOCUS ON EXISTING CUSTOMERS UM THE VISIBILITY AROUND LARGE SCALE PROSPECT ACQUISITION WAS CHALLENGED OUR VALUE PROPOSITIONS TEND TO INDEX ON TNT AS WE'VE NOTED AND SO WE SAID JOB ONE WAS TAKING CARE OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHICH CAUSED US TO MAKE UM A LONG TERM BALANCE OF YEAR UM LARGE DOLLAR VALUE COMMITMENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN TERMS OF INJECTING MORE RELEVANT RIGHT FOR THE TIMES TYPE OF VALUE AND THAT COULD BE ACCELERATORS IN GROCERY AND IN DINING FOOD DELIVERY OUR WIRELESS AND STREAMING CREDITS ON OUR OUR PLATINUM PRODUCT PROMOTIONS WITH AMAZON AND OTHER UM OTHER MERCHANT PARTNERS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE MEASURING SUCCESS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HOW EFFECTIVELY WE RETAIN OUR CUSTOMERS AND ESPECIALLY THE CUSTOMERS THAT DRIVE 50 TO 60% OF OUR MARGIN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND HOW WELL WE COMPETE WITHIN THEIR WALLETS PER SHARE OF WALLET AND ON BOTH OF THOSE METRICS WHICH WE TRACK VERY CLOSELY AND AT A VERY GRANULAR LEVEL WE FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT HOW WELL WE'RE COMPETING UH FOR OUR CUSTOMERS' BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE WE'VE BUILT SOME CONFIDENCE HERE THAT YOU KNOW AS CERTAIN NATURAL HEDGES IN OUR BUSINESS TAKE EFFECT SO PEOPLE AREN'T VISITING LOUNGES AS MUCH IT IT FREES UP RESOURCES FOR US TO CREATE NEW MORE RELEVANT VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS THAT'S WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR IT HAS WORKED FOR US SO FAR UH WE'RE IN THE EARLY INNINGS UM AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN AND WE'LL DO THAT GOING FORWARD AS WELL YOU KNOW WE ALSO JUST NEED TO I THINK THINK ABOUT WE WE THINK ABOUT OUR CO-BRAND PRODUCTS AS LIKE TRAVEL PRODUCTS ACTUALLY LIKE 90% OF THE SPEND ON A NUMBER OF OUR LARGE CO-BRANDS IS IN NON TNT CATEGORIES RIGHT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS SPENDING IN EVERYDAY CATEGORIES TO SAVE UP AND CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ASPIRATIONAL TRAVEL IN THE FUTURE AND SO THAT BILLING BASE ISN'T AS EFFECTIVE AS LONG AS CONSUMERS BELIEVE IN THE LONG TERM VALUE OF THOSE LOYALTY CURRENCIES AND THE TRAVEL THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN GAIN ACCESS TO SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE IMPLYING THAT THE CO-BRANDED PORTFOLIOS OR PERFORMING THE TRAVEL RELATED CO-BRAND PORTFOLIOS ARE PERFORMING NO DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PORTFOLIOS YEAH THERE ARE UM THEY'RE PERFORMING NO WORSE THAN OTHER PORTFOLIOS LOOK THERE ARE PORTFOLIOS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE DOING EXTRAORDINARILY WELL RIGHT CERTAIN REAL A RETAIL CO-BRANDS WHETHER IT'S THE SMALL BUSINESS CO-BRAND WITH AMAZON WHETHER IT'S OTHER DEPARTMENT STORE CO-BRANDS WE HAVE OUTSIDE OF THE US UM BUT IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT OUR US UH CERTAINLY OUR CASHBACK PRODUCTS AS ALL CASHBACK PRODUCTS IN THE INDUSTRY THAT RATIONAL SHORE VALUE IS PERFORMING VERY WELL BUT I THINK WE'VE BEEN ON RECORD SAYING YOU KNOW SAY OUR DELTA PORTFOLIO HAS EXPERIENCED A MORE MODEST COMPRESSION OF BILLINGS THAN OUR US PORTFOLIOS AT LARGE INTERESTING UM WELL COUNT ME ONE OF THOSE CO-BRAND UH HOLDERS WITH DELTA UH HOPEFULLY I GET TO USE SOME OF THOSE MILES AT SOME POINT SOON I THINK MY FAMILY WOULD APPRECIATE THAT <LAUGH> THAT THAT'S THE PENT UP DEMAND I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT WE ALL FEEL THAT WAY OH I SEE <CROSSTALK> HAVEN'T SEEN MY FATHER IN SIX MONTHS IT'S THERE IT'S DEFINITELY THERE UM SO OKAY UM LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE COMPETITIVE RESPONSE THAT YOU'VE SEEN BECAUSE CLEARLY AMEX ISN'T THE ONLY ONE THINKING ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS AMEX HAS HISTORICALLY UM KEPT THEIR SPENDING LEVELS AND SUP AND SUPPORTIVE CONSUMERS AT A HIGHER LEVEL THROUGH CRISIS AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE RETURNS AMEX HAS VIA THE NETWORK SO HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO TAKE A LEAD IF YOU HAVE BEEN AND WHAT'S BEEN THE RESPONSE YEAH YOU KNOW I AM THEY THEY ALWAYS SAY CRISIS UH BUILD CHARACTER THEY LIKE REVEAL CHARACTER TO BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS AND I'VE BEEN AROUND AMEX A LONG TIME UM I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WAY WE'VE KIND OF RALLIED AROUND OUR CUSTOMERS IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS I MEAN IN THE TIMES OF GREATEST UNCERTAINTY UH WE SIGNED UP FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF VALUE INJECTION BOTH THE PRODUCT LEVEL VALUE I DESCRIBED AS WELL AS WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH OUR THREE MONTH SHOP SMALL PROGRAM UM WHEN WE HAD OUR LEAST VISIBILITY WE DOUBLED DOWN ON UH ON OUR CUSTOMERS UM AND AS I SAID EARLIER I THINK IT'S PAID REAL DIVIDENDS FOR US WE TRACK UM SPEND SHARE WITHIN OUR MEMBERS WALLETS AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT BACK IN LIKE APRIL WE TOOK A HIT AND WE HAVE CLIMBED BACK UM AS A RESULT OF THAT VALUE INJECTION AND SOME REALLY DIALED UP CUSTOMER UH MARKETING UM AS I THINK STEVE AND JEFF HAVE BOTH SAID WE SEE UH RETENTION RATES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO 2019 RIGHT NOW WITHIN OUR BASE AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE THEY'RE BETTER THAN THEY WERE IN 2019 AND OUR RETENTION RATES IN GENERAL ARE JUST EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH I MEAN WE WE RETAIN MORE THAN 98% OF OUR BILLINGS BASE YEAR TO YEAR OKAY I DON'T I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD THAT STAT BEFORE SO THAT'S A IT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD ONE TO WRITE DOWN UM SO UH WANTED TO ASK ABOUT LENDING LENDING AMEX IS GETTING MORE CREATIVE AND ITS LENDING PRODUCTS THERE WAS RECENTLY UH A LAUNCH OF A DIFFERENT LENDING PRODUCT ASSOCIATED WITH PLATINUM UM SO MAYBE YOU CAN DISCUSS HOW AMEX IS EXPANDING ITS LENDING IF YOU'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING A GREATER SHARE OF THE LEND WALLET WHICH I BELIEVE HISTORICALLY WAS ABOUT HALF THAT OF THE SPEND SHARE YES SO IF YOU CAN DIG INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT THAT'D BE GREAT YEAH SO YOU YOUR MEMORY IS REALLY GOOD UH YOU KNOW TYPICALLY WE HAVE MID 40S UM SPEND SHARE AND WE HAVE UH LOW 20S UH LENDING SHARE WITHIN OUR CUSTOMERS YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S THERE'S KIND OF LEGACY POINT OF VIEW THAT OUR CUSTOMERS DON'T BORROW ON CREDIT CARDS BUT OUR CUSTOMERS TEND TO ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT A THIRD OF THE INDUSTRY BILLINGS ON CREDIT AND ABOUT A THIRD OF INDUSTRY OUTSTANDINGS ON CREDIT UM AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS UM UH EXPECT LENDING OR FINANCING CAPABILITIES ON THEIR PAYMENT PRODUCTS AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN GROWING IF YOU LOOK BACK 2019 IN THE THREE YEARS PREVIOUS WE PROBABLY GROW GREW AT 2X THE INDUSTRY RATE AT LEAST SOME SOME YEARS 3X THE INDUSTRY RATE IN TERMS OF UH LENDING VOLUMES THERE WAS A LOT OF INVESTOR CONCERN THE ANALYSTS CONCERN AT THE TIME ABOUT COULD WE DO THAT PRUDENTLY WOULD WE BE ABLE TO MANAGE THROUGH THE NEXT CRISIS EFFECTIVELY GIVEN THAT OR WAS THERE A SURPRISE UH A SURPRISE LOOMING ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE SAID AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO IT IS YOU KNOW WE EXPECT TO SOURCE THE MAJORITY OF OUR LENDING GROWTH FROM WITHIN OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER BASE RIGHT WHETHER THAT'S INSTALLMENT CAPABILITIES TERM LOANS OR SOME OF THE NEW FEATURES YOU'VE DESCRIBED AND FOR US THEY'RE IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO CUSTOMERS EXPECT THEM BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY PROVIDE SOME MEANINGFUL REVENUES THAT WE CAN REINVEST INTO HIGHLY COMPETITIVE VALUE PROPOSITIONS SO YES WE HAVE PUT BOTH REVOLVE AND TRANSACTION BASED INSTALLMENT CAPABILITIES ON OUR FULL US CONSUMER PRODUCT STUFF SO HISTORIC GREEN GOLD PLATINUM UM AND WE'LL BE WORKING THROUGH A PROCESS OF INTRODUCING THOSE FEATURES UH TO OUR MEMBERS IN THE CURRENT QUARTERS WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T SOUND TONE DEAF IN TERMS OF THE MARKETING WE'RE DOING AND WHAT NEW FEATURES WE'RE INTRODUCING UM BUT WE BELIEVE CUSTOMERS EXPECT THAT AND ON INSTALLMENT IN PARTICULAR I'M REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THAT RIGHT THERE'S A FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE TO THESE CLOSED END INSTALLMENT PROGRAMS AND THEY RESONATE TREMENDOUSLY WITH MILLENNIAL AND YOUNGER GENERATIONS THAT START GETTING USED TO KIND OF INSTALLMENT AND PUT SALE TYPE CAPABILITIES YEAH LEMME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT BECAUSE UH THAT'S IT'S A HOT MARKET IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH IT'S REALLY PENETRATED UH US CREDIT UM IT SEEMS THAT THE BARRIERS ARE LOWER WHEN IT COMES TO AN E-COMMERCE TRANSACTION FOR INSTANCE UH WE BELIEVE THAT A FIRM WILL BE AVAILABLE TO EVERY SHOPIFY MERCHANT AT THE PRODUCT LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE CHECKOUT LEVEL UM ON THOSE WEBSITES SO MAYBE YOU CAN DISCUSS FOR A MINUTE HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THOSE PRODUCTS PERHAPS LEAPING IN FRONT OF AMEX'S ABILITY TO LEND TO ITS CUSTOMER BECAUSE OF THE PLACEMENT YEAH WELL I THINK YOU KNOW THE GOOD THING ABOUT UM ABOUT OUR PLANET FUNCTIONALITY IS OUR CUSTOMERS GO TO THE POINT OF SALE KNOWING IT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM AND IT INTRODUCES ZERO FRICTION IN CHECKOUT RIGHT BECAUSE ON THE BACK END ON THEIR APP THEY CAN OPT INTO A PLAN OF THREE SIX 12 MONTHS IN DURATION WITH VERY TRANSPARENT FEES ASSOCIATED WITH IT UM SO I THINK AS OPPOSED TO HAVING ENG TO ENGAGE IN THE PURCHASE THAT BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS A FIRM AND SHOPIFY OTHERS CAN DO TO MAKE THAT POINT OF SALE EXPERIENCE MORE LIGHTWEIGHT REDUCED FRICTION THERE UM BUT YOU CAN'T GET LESS FRICTION THAN WE HAVE IN THAT UM PURCHASE EXPERIENCE I ALSO THINK IT'S A PLATFORM THAT'S UM HAS A LOT OF POSSIBILITY IN TERMS OF INNOVATING WITH OUR PARTNERS RIGHT SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT OUR AIRLINE AND HOTEL PARTNERS AND THE CAPACITY TO PUT THAT IN THE PURCHASE PATH TO PUT IT UM YOU KNOW UH ON THEIR WEB PROPERTIES TO BOTH REMIND EXISTING CUSTOMERS OF THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS THAT BUT ALSO TO DRIVE CARD ACQUISITION SAYING A DELTA PURCHASE PATH WE THINK IT HAS POWERFUL POTENTIAL OKAY ALL RIGHT UM ON THE CARD PORTFOLIOS AMEX HAS DONE UM SINCE STEVE TOOK OVER AMEX HAS DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB OF GETTING PRODUCTS ON STEADY REFRESH CYCLES WHICH HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE RATE OF GROWTH IN NET CARD FEES YEAH AND SO HAS THE PANDEMIC CAUSED A DELAY IN THAT CYCLE OR A DELAY IN THE TYPICAL NEW CUSTOMER ACCOUNT ACQUISITION YOU EXPECT OFF OF A REFRESH THAT MIGHT CAUSE UM A SLOWDOWN IN THOSE FEES AND THEN A RE-ACCELERATION AT SOME POINT YEAH SO I THINK WE HAVE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF THAT YOU KNOW WE EXITED ' 19 WITH NORTH OF 20% CARD FEE UH GROWTH UM AND YOU KNOW THIS YEAR RIGHT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT WE ACTUALLY REFRESHED OUR ENTIRE DELTA UH CO-BRAND PORTFOLIO AND PRICED FOR THE VALUE IN THAT UM SO I WOULD SAY THE THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED A COUPLE AREAS UM YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S AFFECTED OUR ACQUISITION BONDS AS I SAID IN Q2 WE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON EXISTING CUSTOMERS WE PULLED BACK ON ACQUISITION THAT DEFINITELY SLOWS THE FLOW OF NEW FEE PAYING UH CUSTOMERS I THINK THERE MAY BE EXAMPLES WHERE WE REFRESH PRODUCTS AND HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER WE TAKE PRICE AT THE TIME WE REFRESH OR WHETHER WE DEFER THAT FEE INCREASE FOR 12 MONTHS I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IN TERMS OF THE COMMITMENT TO A REGULAR CYCLE OF PRODUCT REFRESH ADDING VALUE AND PRICING FOR THAT VALUE BOTH ON THE BACK AND THE FRONT BOOK WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THAT AND I THINK YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT UM REGARDLESS OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT 2021 WILL FEATURE SOME LARGE SCALE REFRESHES AS WELL OKAY UM I WANNA ASK YOU ABOUT ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE TO SUPPORT YOUR CO-BRAND PARTNERS ESPECIALLY IN TNT AND DO YOU HAVE CONCERN AROUND YOU KNOW YOU SEE SOME OF THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE THREATS OR IF THEY'RE REAL WHEN A UNITED GOES OUT AND SAYS WE'RE GETTING READY TO LAY OFF 50% OF OUR DOMESTIC STAFF UM DELTA HAS CLEARLY NOT SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT POINT IS HOW DO YOU VIEW THOSE PARTNERS OR DO YOU VIEW THEM AS SEVERELY DISTRESSED AND HOW'S AMEX THINKING ABOUT THAT YEAH WELL I MEAN I FUNDAMENTALLY I VIEW THEM AS AS UNDER STRESS AS WE ALL ARE BUT SINCE I DO BELIEVE IN THE RETURN ESPECIALLY OF LEISURE TRAVEL UM ON THE BACK OF A VACCINE I BELIEVE IN THE LONG TERM UH OF THOSE PARTNERS AS WELL I ALSO HAPPEN TO THINK WE HAVE WE HAVE GREAT PARTNERS WE HAVE A REALLY PREMIUM SET OF PARTNERS WHETHER IT'S DELTA WHETHER IT'S HILTON WHETHER IT'S BRITISH AIRWAYS WHO WE JUST REACT WITH UM UH AND YOU KNOW MY MY VIEW AS IT WAS IN YOU KNOW THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS WAS THESE ARE GREAT TIMES TO TO LEAN IN BUILD PARTNERSHIP AND INVEST TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN OUR JOINT CUSTOMER BASE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT THE VALUE INJECTIONS WE'VE DONE WITH DELTA THAT

        "model_prediction": "Good morning. this is craig moore with autonomists. thanks for joining us this morning for our fifth annual future of commerce symposium. sorry for the brief delay in getting started. i just wanted to mention a few housekeeping items before we get started. you can use the same dial in or web link for the entire day. there will be a few breaks, but for many of the sessions, we will just move right into the next. the next discussion you can submit questions to us via email to myself or ken zahskey you can also use bloomberg ib to find us with questions or you can use the q and a box within your zoom window so with no further ado, let's get started american express, doug buckman Group head, global consumer services. it's great to see you again, doug. i wish it was in person. i wish it was in carnegie hall, but maybe next year. how are you? it's great. great to see you, too, craig. thanks for having me. yeah, you bet. so, love the background, love the image. but let me get started with just, you know, a broad question, which is, can you update us on the state of consumer and overall spending? At this point in the recovery yeah, and you know, i think as we've talked about before, we saw the trough in april and we've seen a rebound since then. you know, i would characterize the trend since mid-july as relatively stable on the non-teeny side, so outside of teeny relatively stable little bouncing around due to days mix, timing of holidays like labor day in particular and Slow, very steady growth, but but slow growth on the t and e side right, so i would say stable would be the the adjective that captures it at best okay, um, at this point, i assume could we perhaps characterize this a little, go a little deeper on this, x t and e if you were to characterize the overall volumes you're seeing, x t and e if you were to characterize the overall volumes you're seeing, x t and e if you were to characterize the overall volumes you're seeing, x t and e if you were to characterize the overall volumes you're seeing, x t and e if you were to characterize the overall volumes you're seeing, x t and e if you were to characterize the overall volumes you're seeing, x t and e if you were to characterize the overall volumes you're are consumers getting back towards positive territory within credit card portfolios at this point? yeah, i mean, i think you know, consumers consume, right? they're going to figure out a way to live their life and and enrich their lives. and i would say while there's a lot of substitution in the non-t&i space, especially physical for for online and e-commerce, we feel good. healthy levels of consumer volumes there i think what's gonna what's gonna define the trajectory of volume rebound from here on out is is the direction of t and e which which you know is a category we over index on so maybe some thoughts there you know amex has a deeper understanding of t and e than i think any other card issuer especially considering the network and the insights they have Get off of that on a global basis so maybe your thoughts on how we recover from this are there any green shoots you're seeing in t n i at all at this point i mean i think um my position is consumer travel will come back i think that's our our enterprise position is that we expect consumer travel to come back i think that's an essential part of the consumer experience, especially in our demographic. i think, you know, what we've seen to date in terms of the rebound is an effect of substitution. so people substituting driving vacations, home stay rentals for, you know, for air-based travel. and in some categories, we've seen innovation as well, right? we're seeing the dining space in particular expansion of outdoor dining. pickup takeaway delivery at-home meal prep that level of innovation has has bounced the restaurant category more than you would expect just from dine-in volumes alone, right? so i think the you know where when we get back to historic levels, i think is largely a question of confidence and medical solutions, right? i think the the establishment of dine-in is largely a question of confidence and medical solutions, right? i think the establishment of dine-in is largely a question of confidence and medical solutions, right? i think the establishment of dine-in is largely a question of confidence and medical solutions, right? i think the establishment of dine-in is largely a question of confidence and medical solutions, right? i think the establishment of dine-in is largely a question of confidence and medical solutions, right? i think the establishment of dine-in is largely a Of a vaccine, the approval of the vaccine, i expect will unleash a lot of anticipatory and pent-up demand on consumers. They will start travel planning again. The interest in travel-based payment products and travel-based loyalty currencies, i think, will spike, as all that pent-up demand for travel people start to see the end in sight there. They start to build confidence that, in a six, twelve months, Time period they'll be able to travel again. but i think getting back to historic volumes is gonna require that and in terms of how that affects the discount rate at american express, um, especially without the long haul, the long haul travel, um, maybe a discussion there just briefly remind investors how that dynamic is playing out. well, there's no, there's no question. That t and e volumes taking a disproportionate hit like this does have a mixed related impact on our discount rate, right? so i think you know the discount rate, and we we've been on record for a few years now saying we we grind down less on absolute discount rate and are focused on driving discount revenue and utility through programs like opt blue, certain b to c programs. Categories but there's no question you know that historic discount rate has taken a mix related impact as a result of really a disproportionate fall in t and e spending ok well we'll move off of that that topic that isn't helpful right now in terms of the dynamic but maybe on to something that is which is can you discuss how spending habits have changed you know and to and e spending In what degree you're seeing these habits you know coalesce into long-term repeatable behavior you know especially around e-commerce contactless and if it's different between consumer segments yeah you know i think my take on the effects of this crisis are that it didn't create any new trends but it changed sort of the slope of pre-existing trends right Commerce was taking share from offline digital payments were taking share from cash at pos, right and we have seen an inflection or a kink in those curves as most issuers have over the last six months, you know, whether we've seen those trends accelerated by a year, two years, it's anybody's guess, but i don't think we don't think we're going backwards from those trends as the crisis as the crisis continues. Relaxes um i think on the contactless side you know there's a lot of noise around that there are markets outside the us as you know southeast asia australia the u k where there's very deep contactless penetration and and that has continued to gain share during this crisis in the us the contactless volumes are much more modest they are increasing at a rapid rate but i do expect that the contactless volumes are much more modest they are increasing at a rapid rate but i do expect that the contactless volumes are much more modest they are increasing at a rapid rate but i do expect that the contactless volumes are much more modest they are increasing at a rapid rate but i do expect that the contactless volumes are much more modest they are increasing at a rapid rate but i do expect that the contactless volumes are much more modest they are increasing at a rapid Move away from cash and the comfort with using credit products even for micro-level transactions at p o s will be an enduring outcome of this. and i think while i don't think it does a lot per se to drive dollar volumes of billings i think it does a lot to build habit and wallet position of credit products and in some markets outside the u s where econ is king Less established it's had a more profound effect like italy is a face-to-face retail market we've seen phenomenal growth in e-commerce what's interesting is well over fifty percent of the participants in e-commerce in any month during the first few months of the crisis had never had an e-commerce transaction on amex before so there we've seen some real i again i think it's a trend It would have played out but it was a very large acceleration of that trend and correct me if i'm wrong but amex has a better acceptance footprint outside the u s in ecom than it does in brick and mortar i would say that's probably true by and large due to partnerships with various psps and aggregators and such we have a very strong footprint in ecom Okay, um, so in terms of the health of the u. s. consumer, the health of the consumer in general, you know, especially considering high, higher unemployment, furloughs, unemployment claims, you know, as we saw this morning, it's been remarkable how well the industry is faring right now. um, you know, i noticed that amex's credit quality is at its best point ever. Over the last twelve months on consumer and shockingly its best point over the last three years in small business and so maybe some context there you know discover's ceo did cause some concern the other day by saying they expect a material uplift in credit quality metrics later this year so just your perspective yeah i mean look i think most issuers Have seen a more modest impact than would have been implied by the end of q1 qualitative reserves that they took, right? I think looking at macro indicators around unemployment plans, changes in sequential gdp you know if you were sitting back being an armchair credit manager you would have expected much larger and negative impacts on delinquency and write-offs and the The fact of the matter is as you think we have we have not seen them as most issuers haven't play out by and large. now there are a number of contributors to that, right? i would say the jobless claims the geography of those, the demographics of those jobless claims, you know, weren't as concentrated in our customer base, our member base as the macro numbers would suggest. i would also say as everyone knows, there's just a day. Ton of liquidity in the system right now, whether it's through government programs, private sector forbearance programs and so you're right, we have we have credit volume, delinquency and write-off side that are better year on year than they were you know, i think we have to while while we're pleased with that we also have a healthy level of you know, paranoia About what the next twelve months will bring right the macro economy some of these forbearance programs with ten percent of residential mortgages being in forbearance that kind of going away government support moderating perhaps private sector follow-through in terms of white collar job losses so you know we feel great about the early endings of this crisis but you know we're mindful that it's not over You know, just are there any signs in the portfolio at all that would be concerning? you know, look, i think in the in the commercial or small business portfolio, clearly there are industries that are more affected by this. fortunately, they tend to be industries where our concentration is is lower. you know, there are some some things about this crisis that have actually improved. visibility in a way. i mean, we have really good visibility into our customers that have entered into forbearance programs with competitors, right, which allows us to kind of target and think about the precision of our underwriting and an existing customer management a little bit more crisply. but i would say there are no real hot spots within the portfolio right now. you know, i would say there are no real hot spots within the portfolio right now. Back in april, may, all of us had these sort of short-term crisis relief programs, right? Where payment holiday, no interest charged, and you know, it's a type of thing you do after a natural disaster like a hurricane. and we, we made a judgment that we weren't going to kick the can down the road by continuing to extend those programs. we were going to, we were going to move customers if they needed to move. Onto longer-term solutions for repayment confidence, right? So our twelve-month financial relief program, which you know allows customers to reduce their minimum payment, maintain their membership, they don't get their membership canceled and retain some level of spend utility as well, right? And we think that that has allowed us to transition the portfolio in a very customer-friendly way, in a way that has Stabilized the receivables metrics as well okay i want to keep this try to keep this conversation with investors so investors are funneling questions to us and we just got one that i'll just read it for you basically you've made it clear that t and e spend recovery is very linked to covid resolution you know as customers currently divert that spending towards non t and e purchases how is amex able to do that Increase their share of customer spending in non-t and e and how meaningfully can that move the needle on billings growth yeah, i mean, i think it's a great question. i mean, one of the things you know, we did early in this crisis is decide that we were going to focus on existing customers the visibility around large-scale prospect acquisition was challenged our value propositions tend to index on t and e as we've noted, and so we said job one was taking care of existing customers Customers which caused us to make a long-term balance of year large dollar value commitment to our customers in terms of injecting more relevant right for the times type of value and that could be accelerators in grocery and in dining food delivery our wireless and streaming credits on our platinum product promotions with amazon and other Other merchant partners and you know, we're measuring success right now in terms of how effectively we retain our customers and especially the customers that drive fifty to sixty percent of our margin on an annual basis and how well we compete within their wallets for share of wallet. And on both of those metrics, which we track very closely at a very granular level, we feel really good about how we're doing. While we're competing for our customers' business and you know, i think we've we've built some confidence here that you know, as certain natural hedges in our business take effect, so people aren't visiting lounges as much it it frees up resources for us to create new, more relevant value for our customers that's what we did this year. it has worked for us so far we're in the early innings and we're confident that we can and will do so. Going forward as well you know we also just need to i think think about we we think about our co-brand products as like travel products actually like ninety percent of the spend on a number of our large co-brands is in non-t&e categories right what they're doing is spending in everyday categories to save up and create the opportunity for aspirational travel in the future and so that billing base isn't as effective As long as consumers believe in the long-term value of those loyalty currencies and the travel that they can they can gain access to. so it sounds like you're implying that the co-brand portfolios are performing the travel-related co-brand portfolios are performing no different from other portfolios yeah, there are they're performing no worse than other portfolios look, there are that we have that are doing extraordinarily well, right? certain retail co-brands, whether it's the small business co-brand with amazon, whether it's other department store co-brands we have outside the u.s. but if you were to look at our u.s. certainly our cash back products as all cash back products in the industry, that rational sure value is performing very well. and i think we've been on record saying say our delta portfolio has Experienced a more modest compression of billings than our u s. portfolios at large interesting well count me one of those co-brand holders with delta hopefully i get to use some of those miles at some point soon i think my family would appreciate that that's the pent-up demand i'm talking about right we all feel that way i've seen my father in six months it's there it's definitely there so okay um Let me ask you about the competitive response that you've seen because clearly amex isn't the only one thinking about these problems amex has historically kept their spending levels and supportive of consumers at a higher level through crises and i think that's because of the returns amex has via the network so how have you been able to take a lead if you have been and what's been the response? Yeah you know i um they always say crises build character they like reveal character too both of individuals and institutions and i've been around amex a long time um i'm very proud of the way we've kind of rallied around our customers in this time of crisis i mean in the times of greatest uncertainty we signed up for an extraordinary Level of value injection, both the product level value i described as well as what we've done with our three month shop small program when we had our least visibility we doubled down on on our customers and as i said earlier i think it paid real dividends as we track spend share within our members wallets and there's no question that back in like april we took a hit and we have climbed back As a result of that value injection and some really dialled up customer marketing. and as i think steve and jeff have both said, we see retention rates that are superior to twenty nineteen right now within our base. and you know, i think we've talked about it before, they're better than they were in twenty nineteen, and our retention rates in general are just extraordinarily high. i mean, we, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, we retain, More than ninety eight percent of our billing space year to year ok i don't i think i've heard that stat before so that's a it's definitely a good one to write down um so wanted to ask about lending lending amex is getting more creative in its lending products there was recently a launch of a different lending product associated with platinum so Maybe you can discuss how amex is expanding its lending. if you've been successful in getting a greater share of the lend wallet, which i believe historically was about half that of the spend share. yes. so if you can dig into that a little bit, that'd be great yeah. so your memory is really good you know, typically we have mid forties spend share and we have a low twenties lending share within Our customers, you know, i think there's this kind of legacy point of view that our customers don't borrow on credit cards. but our customers tend to account for about a third of industry billings on credit and about a third of industry outstandings on credit. and we believe that our customers expect lending or financing capabilities on their payment products and, you know, we Have been growing, if you look back 2019 and the three years previous, we probably grew at two x the industry rate at least, some, some years three x the industry rate in terms of lending volumes there was a lot of investor concern and analyst concern at the time about could we do that prudently would we be able to manage through the next crisis effectively given that, or was there a surprise a surprise looming one of the things we've said is And we remain committed to it is you know, we expect to source the majority of our lending growth from within our existing customer base, right, whether that's installment capabilities, term loans or some of the new features you've described and for us, they're important because not only do customers expect them but they obviously provide some meaningful revenues that we can re-invest into highly competitive value proposition so yes, we have. Put both revolve and transaction-based installment capabilities on our full u.s. consumer product set. so historic, green, gold, platinum and we'll be working through a process of introducing those features to our members in the current quarters. we want to make sure that you know, we don't sound tone deaf in terms of the marketing we're doing and what new features we're introducing but we believe customers expect that and on installment. Implementation, in particular. i'm really enthusiastic about that, right? there's a financial discipline to these closed-end installment programs and they resonate tremendously with millennial and younger generations that start getting used to kind of installment and point-of-sale type capabilities yeah, let me ask you about that because that's it's a hot market. it's hard to understand how much it's really penetrated u s Credit um it seems that the barriers are lower when it comes to an ecommerce transaction. for instance we believe that a firm will be available to every shopify merchant at the product level as opposed to just the checkout level on those websites. so maybe you can discuss for a minute how you're thinking about those products perhaps leaping in front of you. Of amex's ability to lend to its customers because of the placement yeah well, i think you know, the good thing about our planet functionality is our customers go to the point of sale knowing it's available to them and it introduces zero friction in checkout, right? because on the back end, on their app, they can opt into a plan of three, six, twelve months in duration with very transparent pricing. fees associated with it so i think as opposed to having to engage in the purchase path and i think there are a lot of things a farm and shopify others can do to make that point of sale experience more lightweight reduced friction there but you can't get less friction than we have in that purchase experience i also think it's a platform that has a lot of possibility in terms of innovating with our Partners, right? So if you think about our airline and hotel partners and the capacity to put that in the purchase path to put it you know on their web properties to both remind existing customers of their ability to access that but also to drive card acquisitions, say, in a delta purchase path, which we think has powerful potential okay, all right. on the card portfolios, amex has done since steve took over, amex has done a phenomenal job of getting products on steady refresh cycles which has had a profound impact on the rate of growth and net card fees and so has the pandemic caused a delay in that cycle or a delay in the typical New customer account acquisition you expect off of a refresh that might cause a slow down in those fees and then a re-acceleration at some point yeah so i think we have done a really good job of that. you know, we exited nineteen with north of twenty percent card fee growth and you know, this year right before the pandemic hit, we actually refreshed our entire delta co-brand portfolio. AND PRICED FOR THE VALUE IN THAT SO I WOULD SAY THE THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED A COUPLE OF AREAS YOU KNOW I THINK ITS AFFECTED OUR ACQUISITION VOLUMES AS I SAID IN Q2 WE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON EXISTING CUSTOMERS WE PULLED BACK ON ACQUISITION THAT DEFINITELY SLOWS THE FLOW OF NEW FEE PAYING CUSTOMERS I THINK THERE MAY BE EXAMPLES WHERE WE REFRESH PRODUCTS AND I THINK THERE MAY BE EXAMPLES WHERE WE REFRESH PRODUCTS AND I THINK THERE MAY BE EX Have to think about whether we take price at the time we refresh or whether we defer that fee increase for two months. i think we're going to have to be sensitive to the environment. but in terms of the commitment to a regular cycle of product refresh adding value and pricing for that value both on the back and the front book we remain committed to that and i think you should expect that regardless of The environment that twenty twenty one will feature some large-scale refreshes as well okay um i want to ask you about all the work you've done to support your co-brand partners, especially in t and e and do you have concern around you know you see some of these announcements that i'm not sure if they're threats or if they're real when a united goes out and says we're getting ready Ready to lay off fifty percent of our domestic staff delta has clearly not said anything like that but the point is how do you view those partners or do you view them as severely distressed and how's amex thinking about that yeah well i mean fundamentally i view them as as under distressed as we all are but since i do believe in the return especially of leisure travel On the back of a vaccine i believe in the long term of those partners as well. i also happen to think we have we have great partners we have a really premium set of partners whether it's delta whether it's hilton whether it's british airways who we just reupped with and you know my my view as it was in you know the great financial crisis was these are great times to To lean in, build partnership and invest together to strengthen our joint customer base. That's what we've done. And if you look at the value injections we've done with delta, that we've done with marriott, that we've done with hilton, and these are partners that as you say they're under a fair amount of stress and they have come to the table innovated with us, co-invested to make those products appealing even in a travel challenge time and i think you'll see You'll see more of that in twenty one. I feel I feel great about the long-term health of those portfolios. And I feel really good about the partners. Okay, we've got about a minute. I really wanted to give you a chance to answer amex is really leaned in on digital in terms of assets you've picked up resy mezzy kake pocket concierge you know to name a few Lunch how is that all coming together to support your customers are we gonna see significant changes to the american express mobile app which i think is the best in the industry as it is to bring those capabilities to bear yeah it's a great it's a great question it's one that's live on our minds as well and you know i mean the most recent capability based acquisition would have been cabbage on the small business side right And you know, we have been on a journey to both digitize our existing products and experiences like dining's always been top passionate for our customers, right? it's you know, we have a billion dining transactions, it's the number one request into our concierge and travel and so digitizing and adding content there was sort of the no brainer to us but your point Is right. we have seen through the digitization of our products and servicing a material drop in offline service. a large shift to online. and that is further fueled by the fact that half of our new customers are under the age of thirty five. eighty percent of our acquisitions happen in digital channels. and so that trend plus the content we're adding right so you add dining You add installation type capabilities. You add you know, new sme product sets. You know, our mobile product and web product are going to have to flex to make that expanded range of content easier to navigate for folks. There's no question, but to your point, i think we feel like we started a really strong place, right, in terms of our own internal assessment as well as external recognition of our mobile product. Well, i'm gonna have to wrap it there, doug. i really appreciate you joining us. i really want to do this in person next time let's try to do that. enjoy the last fleeting days of summer. all right, you too, craig. great to see you. thank you. take care, doug. all right, bye."

OUR ELECTRIC TRANS UH DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT EARNED .60 CENTS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED WITH EARNINGS OF .61 CENTS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 THE LOW EARNINGS WERE A RESULT OF BOTH HIGHER STORM RESTORATION COSTS AND PROPERTY TAX EXPENSE AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF UH OF SHARE DILUTION OUR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT EARNED .36 CENTS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED WITH RECURRING EARNINGS OF .33 CENTS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 IMPROVED RESULTS UH WERE DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT AND RELIABILITY IN OUR TRANSMISSION FACILITIES

SLIDE FOUR AND OUR EXPERIENCE RESTORING POWER AFTER TROPICAL STORM ISAIAS RAVAGED CONNECTICUT ON OCTOBER FOURTH WE SERVE 149 UH CITIES AND TOWN IN CONNECTICUT AND EVERY ONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES SUFFERED DAMAGE FROM ISAIAS UH MUCH OF IT CATASTROPHIC AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE WE HAD NEARLY 22,000 DAMAGE LOCATIONS THAT WE HAD TO ADDRESS AND BROUGHT IN AN ARMY OF ELECTRIC UH RESTORATION AND TREE CREWS TO RESTORE POWER ALL THE WHILE WORKING ON THE RESTORATION IN A PANDEMIC SETTING THE RESTORATION PROCESS LASTED NINE DAYS MEANING WE COMPLETED OUR WORK ONE TO TWO DAYS FASTER THAN WE HAD IN THE LAST TWO TROPICAL STORMS THAT HIT CONNECTICUT EVEN THOUGH WE HAD UH 30% TO 35% MORE DAMAGE LOCATIONS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE COMPLETED THAT WORK SAFELY WITH NO SERIOUS ELECTRICAL CONTACT AND NO COVID EXPOSURE AMONG THE ENORMOUS WORKFORCE WE BROUGHT TO CONNECTICUT JUST JUST A TREMENDOUS EFFORT UH BY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES FROM ACROSS ALL PARTS OF OF EVERSOURCE AT THIS TIME WE ESTIMATE THAT DEFERRED COSTS ACROSS ALL THREE STATES WILL TOTAL MORE THAN $275 MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT UM INCURRED IN CONNECTICUT THAT FIGURE WILL BE ADJUSTED AS THE ACTUAL INVOICES ARE RECEIVED WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL ACTIVELY PURSUING UH INVOICES FROM HUNDREDS OF VENDORS THAT ASSISTED US DURING THE STATEWIDE UH RESTORATION EFFORT UH WHERE WE WERE SETTING NEW POLES OR HANGING MILES OF NEW WIRES OR REPLACING HUNDREDS OF TRANSFORMS THERE RELATED COSTS ARE TO BE CAPITALIZED THE ULTIMATE RECOVERY OF STORM COSTS AND THE EVALUATION ON PERFORMANCE UH AND SAFELY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY RESTORING POWER TO OUR CUSTOMERS IS PENDING AN ONGOING REVIEW BY THE CONNECTICUT PUBLIC UTILITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITY OR PURA THAT REVIEW IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED IN LATE UH APRIL OF 2021 STICKING WITH OUR REGULATED BUSINESS I'LL THROW UP THE SLIDE UH FIVE AND A REVIEW OF THIS YEAR'S UH DISTRIBUTION RATE REVIEWS THIS PAST FRIDAY THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITIES ISSUED ITS DECISION IN THE NSTAR GAS RATE REVIEW THAT WE FILED LAST YEAR IT SUPPORTS OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN THE NSTAR GAS SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF OUR 300,000 CUSTOMERS THE DECISION ALLOWS NSTAR GAS TO INCREASE DISTRIBUTION REVENUES BY $23 MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS THE BPU APPROVED THE <INAUDIBLE> OF 9.9% AND A CAPITAL STRUCTURE WITH UH 54.77% EQUITY IT ALSO PERMITS US UH TO IMPLEMENT PERFORMANCE BASED RATING FOR A 10-YEAR TERM THAT UH WHICH SOUNDS UH UPRATING PERFORMANCE BY NSTAR GAS WILL TARGET ANNUAL BASE RATE INCREASES OF INFLATION PLUS ONE POINT UH ZERO THREE PERCENT THIS IS AN EARNING SHARING MECHANISM THAT WOULD RETURN 75% OF THE BENEFIT TO CUSTOMERS SHOULD WE RECEIVE THE ROE OF 10.9% AND SHARING MECHANISM ON THE DOWN SIDE IF OUR ROE FALLS BELOW 8.4% UH ALSO EXCITING IS THE DECISION ALSO APPROVES OUR FIRST EVER GEOTHERMAL PILOT PROGRAM ANOTHER LONGSTANDING RATE PROCEEDING INVOLVES PUBLIC SERVICE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE IN <INAUDIBLE> LAST MONTH WE AND ALL THE PARTIES TO THE PSNH RATE CASE FILED A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN THE RATE REVIEW THAT THAT HAS BEEN PENDING FOR NEARLY UM YOU KNOW A YEAR AND A HALF AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SLIDE WE SETTLED ON A $45 MILLION DOLLAR ANNUALIZED RATE INCREASE THAT INCLUDES A 9.3% UH RETURN ON EQUITY AND A 54.4 UH PERCENT EQUITY LAYER SHOULD REGULATORS APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT THE PERMANENT UH INCREASE WOULD TAKE EFFECT IN JANUARY JANUARY FIRST OF 2021 YOU MAY RECALL THAT THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION ALLOWED US TO IMPLEMENT A TEMPORARY RATE INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $28 MILLION DOLLARS BACK IN UH JULY JULY FIRST OF 2019 THE FINAL APPROVAL RATES WOULD BE RETROACTIVE BACK TO THAT DATE UH 18 MONTHS WE WOULD UH RECOVER THAT IN A TRUE UP UH OVER THE COURSE OF OF THE YEAR 2021 WE CAN SETTLE CONSIDER THE SETTLEMENT TO BE A CONSTRUCTIVE OUTCOME TO PSNH'S FIRST <INAUDIBLE> DECADE AND HAVE ASKED THE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PUC TO APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT BEFORE THE END OF NOVEMBER FROM THE RATE REVIEW REVIEWS <INAUDIBLE> SIX AND OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF THE ASSETS OF COLUMBIA GAS IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR $1.1 BILLION DOLLARS OF CASH EXCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS MOST OF THESE ASSETS WERE ASSIGNED TO EVERSOURCE GAS COMPANY IN MASSACHUSETTS A NEW SUBSIDIARY I MENTIONED THAT WE FORMED IN MAY OF 2020 AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE MOST OF EVERSOURCE GAS'S SERVICE TERRITORY IS ADJACENT TO NSTAR GAS OR YANKEE GAS SERVICE TERRITORIES ADDITIONALLY NSTAR ELECTRIC ALREADY PROVIDES ELECTRIC SERVICE TO ABOUT 20 OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT EVERSOURCE GAS SERVES WITH NATURAL GAS AS A RESULT WE EXPECT TO REALIZE OPERATIONAL BENEFITS FOR OUR NEWEST 330,000 NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY LIVE THE FINANCE THE TRANSACTION WE SOLD APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION DOLLARS OF EQUITY IN JUNE AND WE FINANCED THE DEBT PORTION OF THE TRANSACTION IN AUGUST AND AGAIN WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE <INAUDIBLE> TO OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2021 AND INCREMENTALLY <INAUDIBLE> IN THE YEARS AHEAD A CRITICAL FACTOR IN ENSURING THAT THIS TRANSACTION BRINGS BENEFITS TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS IS AN EIGHT-YEAR RATE PLAN THAT WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHER KEY PARTIES PRIOR TO OUR FILING WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITIES THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THAT PLAN ARE LISTED ON SLIDE SEVEN IT WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS IN OUR EVERSOURCE GAS OF MASS SYSTEM AND REFLECT THOSE INVESTMENTS IN RATES IN A REASONABLY TIMELY MANNER WE ARE THANKFUL THAT THE DPU APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT AND THE ACQUISITION VERY QUICKLY UH NOW THAT WE HAVE THE KEYS TO THE PROPERTY AND A AND A LONG TERM PLAN IN PLACE WE ARE WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING OUR NEW EVERSOURCE GAS CUSTOMERS WITH THE SAME HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE OUR OTHER 550,000 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS THAT WE HAVE IN MASSACHUSETTS AND CONNECTICUT AS I NOTED EARLIER WE PLAN TO INTEGRATE EVERSOURCE GAS OF MASSACHUSETTS INTO OUR UPDATED FIVE-YEAR PROJECTIONS THAT WE'LL PROVIDE YOU IN FEBRUARY WE CONTINUE TO PROJECT APPROXIMATELY THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF REGULATED COMPANY CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THIS YEAR DESPITE THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE PANDEMIC AND THE NEED TO TAKE CREWS OFF OF CAPITAL PROJECTS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PART OF AUGUST TO DEAL WITH THE AFTERMATH OF TROPICAL STORM ISAIAS THROUGH SEPTEMBER OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S APPROXIMATELY THE SAME LEVEL AS THIS TIME LAST LAST YEAR IN 2019 WE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS ON OUR TRANSMISSION CAPITAL PROGRAM IN THE THIRD QUARTER PUTTING SEVERAL PROJECTS INTO SERVICE AT OR BELOW BUDGET AND THESE BENEFITS OF OF UH LOWER COSTS WILL FLOW THROUGH TO NEW NEW ENGLAND'S ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS FROM THE REGULATED BUSINESS ALTERNATIVE OFFSHORE WIND PARTNERSHIP UH WITH ORSTED UH ON <UNK> WE'VE HAD A FEW DEVELOPMENTS SINCE OUR JULY 31ST EARNINGS CALL UH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT WAS THAT IN AUGUST THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT POSTED A COMPLETE REVIEW SCHEDULE FOR OUR 130 MEGAWATT SOUTH FORK PROJECT ON LONG ISLAND THE SCHEDULE CULMINATES IN A DECISION ON A CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS PERMIT OR COP AS IT'S KNOWN IN MID-JANUARY OF 2022 WE ARE ALSO MAKING PROGRESS ON THE OTHER PERMITS IN SEPTEMBER WE FILED A SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL WITH THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE TO RESOLVE MUCH OF THE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROJECT THAT LIES WITHIN NEW YORK JURISDICTION IN OCTOBER SEVERAL OF THE NEW YORK STATE AGENCIES SIGNALED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL BY SIGNING ON TO THE AGREEMENT WE'VE STRUCTURED AN AGREEMENT ON HOST COMMUNITY PAYMENTS IN THE NECESSARY REAL ESTATE RANKS WITH THE TOWN OF EAST HAMPTON WHERE THE OFFSHORE CABLE WOULD LAND AND WOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE LONG ISLAND GRID NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION SITING HEARING FOR SOUTH FORK IS SCHEDULED TO COMMENCE THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE STATE SIGNING TO COM TO BE COMPLETED IN 2021 BEFORE BOEM ISSUES THE COP BASED ON THAT SCHEDULE WE NOW THE PROJECT TO ENTER SERVICE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2023 THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTATIONS WE DISCLOSED DURING OUR MAY AND JULY EARNINGS CALLS WHILE WE WERE STILL UH WAITING FOR THE REVIEW SCHEDULE TURNING TO OUR OTHER PROJECTS YOU RECALL THAT UH WE FILED OUR BOEM APPLICATION FOR REVOLUTION WIND IN MARCH WE EXPECT BOEM TO ESTABLISH A REVIEW SCHEDULE FOR THAT PROJECT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2021 WE DO NOT EXPECT TO PROVIDE AN UPDATED IN SERVICE FOR THIS UH PROJECT UNTIL THE SCHEDULE IS ISSUED BUT AT THIS POINT IT IT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE PROJECT GO INTO SERVICE BY THE END OF 2023 ALSO WE FILED OUR SUNRISE WIND APPLICATION WITH BOEM ON SEPTEMBER FIRST AND EXPECT BOEM TO ESTABLISH A REVIEW SCHEDULE FOR THE PROJECT NEXT YEAR ONCE WE RECEIVE THAT REVIEW SCHEDULE WE'LL BE ABLE TO BETTER ESTIMATE UH MORE UP TO DATE INSERVICE SCHEDULE BUT AGAIN AT THIS TIME IT WOULD SEEM UH THAT THE END ' 24 IN SERVICE IS IS NOT LIKELY WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR OFFSHORE WIND BUSINESS AND EXPECT TO HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS UH TO EXPAND OUR OFFSHORE WIND PARTNERSHIP BEYOND THE 1700 AND 14 MEGAWATTS CURRENTLY UNDER CONTRACT AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE UH WE HAVE ENOUGH LEASE CAPACITY CON TO CONSTRUCT AT LEAST 4000 MEGAWATTS ON THE 550 SQUARE MILES OF OCEAN TRACKS THAT WE HAVE UNDER LONG TERM LEASE UH OFF OFF THE UH SOUTHEAST UH COAST OF MASSACHUSETTS TO THIS POINT ON OCTOBER 20TH WE SUBMITTED A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE BIDS INTO THE SECOND NEW YORK OFFSHORE WIND RFP WHERE THE STATE IS LOOKING FOR BETWEEN 1000 AND 2500 MEGAWATTS NEW YORK STATE OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY EXPECT TO ANNOUNCE THE WINNER OR WINNERS BEFORE THE THE THE END OF THE YEAR OUR SUNRISE PROJECT UH AS A REMINDER WON THE LARGEST PORTION OF NEW YORK'S FIRST RNP LAST YEAR UH 880 MEGAWATTS ADDITIONALLY JUST LAST WEEK RHODE ISLAND GOVERNOR GINA RAIMONDO UH ANNOUNCED

OFFSHORE WIND OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE YOU KNOW VERY CREATIVE AND YOU'RE ALREADY CONSERVATIVELY KIND OF WELL WITHIN YOUR BAND SO SHOULD WE SORT OF BE THINKING ABOUT THESE INCREMENTAL ITEMS AS POTENTIALLY RINGING YOUR GROWTH TO MAYBE SIX TO EIGHT PERCENT OR SOMETHING THAT WILL HIT YOU TO THE TOP END AND THEN SORT OF EXTEND THAT RUNWAY WITH YOUR CURRENT TRAJECTORY I MEAN THE REASON WHY I ASK IS SIX TO EIGHT PERCENT SEEMS TO SORT OF THAT NEW TOP QUARTILE BUCKET IN OUR SPACE WHERE FIVE TO SEVEN PERCENT IS BECOMING A LITTLE BIT MORE TYPICAL SO CURIOUS HOW YOU'RE SORT OF THINKING ABOUT THIS DO YOU SEE

DOESN'T INCLUDE UH COLUMBIA UH ASSETS UH IT ALSO DOESN'T INCLUDE UM YOU KNOW GRID MODERNIZATION ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PENDING IN IN CONNECTICUT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE OR OR AMI THAT THAT THAT UH COULD COULD BE A POTENTIAL UH TO MOVE FORWARD UM RELATIVELY SOON IN IN MASSACHUSETTS UH IN TERMS OF TAKING A A LOOK AT THAT BY THE BY THE REGULATOR SO UM I SEE THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LEVERS TO UH GROW AND GROW AT UH AT AT AT EVEN A HIGHER RATE THAN WE HAD EXPECTED BEFORE GOT IT THAT'S HELPFUL UH AND THEN UH SO JUST LASTLY FOR ME IS CAN YOU JUST MAYBE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATION IN CONNECTICUT I MEAN THE LEGISLATION THAT PASSED WAS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE THAN THE GIRAFFE LEGISLATION BUT OBVIOUSLY SOME DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE REFUNDS AND AND PENALTIES OFFSET BY THE POTENTIAL UPSIDE FROM LIKE PBRS SO SORT OF HOW ARE YOU GUYS THINKING ABOUT THIS INTERNALLY UH SURE THE UH ENERGY LEGISLATION WE'VE WE'VE SAID CONSISTENTLY THAT UH PBR IS A IS A UH FORMULA AND A TEMPLATE THAT THAT THAT WE THINK IS EFFECTIVE WE HAVE PBR STRUCTURES IN IN OTHER STATES AND UM WE THINK THAT UM HAVING A A ROBUST DISCUSSION UH ON PBR IN IN CONNECTICUT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND WE'RE VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OF THAT PROVISION YEAH REALLY UH YOU KNOW THE ENERGY LEGISLATION UH DIRECTED PURA TO TO EVALUATE THAT AND AND OPEN A DOCKET BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR SO JUNE OF OF 2021 AND IT

PENALTIES ARE TWO AND A HALF PERCENT OF OUR DISTRIBUTION REVENUES IN CONNECTICUT AND THAT GOES UP GOES UP TO FOUR PERCENT SO YOU KNOW IT ALSO GIVES PURA SOME ADDITIONAL TIME YOU KNOW TO TO REVIEW CASES SO YOU KNOW WHICH IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW SEEMS TO BE APPROPRIATE SO UM THE THE LEGISLATION AS YOU AS YOU INDICATED UH IT OUT THERE UH AND UH PURA IS WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS OF IT

FOR YOUR QUESTION AND YOUR COMMENTS AND I HOPE AND HOPE YOUR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE DOING WELL TOO UM JUST TO CLARIFY WE WILL UH OUR HISTORY HAS BEEN TO UM ADD ANOTHER YEAR INTO THE INTO THE OUTLOOK SO 2025 WOULD BE THAT THAT YEAR SINCE OUR FORECAST GOES THROUGH THE 2024 TIME PERIOD SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT UH YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE AND REALLY OUR OUR VIEW ON HOW TO LOOK AT OFFSHORE WIND IT IT DOESN'T CHANGE BY BY ANY OF THE SCHEDULE ITEMS WE WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY OR IT WE'VE WE'VE LOOK AT IT AS UM SHOWING THE THE CORE BUSINESS AS UH AS THE DRIVER AND THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT OF THE OF THE GROWTH RATE AND THEN TO SHOW THAT WIND IS ADDITIVE TO THAT IN IN IN WHAT WAY SO THAT WOULD BE THE INTENT GOING FORWARD I THINK THAT UM WHEN I'VE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION BEFORE THE ANSWER IS IS IS WAS AND STILL IS AS AS MORE YEARS OF WIND COME IN TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THAT PARTICULAR YEAR THEN TO ME IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO TO ROLL IT ALL TOGETHER BUT UH AT THIS STAGE THE EXPECTATION ESPECIALLY IN THIS UH UPCOMING FEBRUARY UPDATE WOULD BE TO HAVE THE CORE BUSINESS EXTEND THAT THROUGH 2025 AND THEN UH SHOW UH OFFSHORE WIND UH IN IN ADDITION TO THAT AND AND IF YOU DON'T MIND ELABORATING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER I I KNOW THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY ON EXACTLY THE PERMING SCHEDULE THAT INHIBITS YOUR ABILITY TO SAY WHEN THESE PROJECTS IN A REGION SERVICE CAN YOU AT LEAST TRY TO PUT SOME MORE PARAMETERS AROUND WHAT UM EACH OF THESE PIECES OF THE PROCESS COULD TAKE SO IF THERE'S LIKE A WINDOW IF YOU WILL IT MAY BE TOO EARLY YEAH SO IT IN TERMS OF UM YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S UH PEOPLE HAVE UH REALIZED OUT THERE AND AND WE'VE BEEN ASKED QUESTIONS AND I I THINK YOU'VE ASKED US UH THE QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WITH WITH DELAYS ON <INAUDIBLE> WIND AND OTHER THINGS UH THERE'S BEEN SOME DELAYS IN TERMS OF BOEM'S NOTICE OF INTENT UH UH OF INTENT AND AND TO PREPARE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT AND FRANKLY WE WE WOULD HAVE WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED UH IN OUR ORIGINAL SCHEDULE UH SCHEDULES THAT SOME OF THESE UH UM <INAUDIBLE> LAGS THAT YOU KNOW TO PREPARE THE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT WOULD BE WOULD BE OUT BY NOW SO THESE ARE EXPECTED I I BELIEVE UM YOU KNOW THAT THAT PLANS SCHEDULED FOR REVIEWING UH UH AND RELEASING THESE IS IS UNDERWAY SO I WOULDN'T EXPECT UH YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE SCHEDULE BUT UH AT THIS STAGE IT WOULD BE UH PRUDENT TO WAIT TO SEE THE THE THE UH SCHEDULE THAT COMES OUT OF BOEM BEFORE WE WE COMMIT TO A FINAL UH INSERVICE DATE BUT I WOULDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE SIGNIFICANT GOT IT EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT I'LL PASS IT FROM THERE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS JULIAN UH NEXT QUESTION IS FROM <UNK> FROM EVERCORE GOOD MORNING DRAGESH HEY GOOD MORNING GUYS THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION UH JUST JUST FOLLOWING UP ON UH YOU KNOW THE THE OFFSHORE WIND HERE WHAT TO EXPECT YOU KNOW THE THIS UH EIS UH DECISION I SUPPOSE THAT IS GOING TO BE OUT <INAUDIBLE> STATEMENT RATHER THAN MONTH OR OR UH EARLY DECEMBER WHAT TO EXPECT THERE AND THEN HOW DOES THAT IMPACT YOUR YOUR FUTURE PROJECT TIMELINES YEAH THE UM THESE NOTICE OF IN OF INTENT THEY CONTAIN UM A PLAN SCHEDULE YOU KNOW THAT THAT IN THE ANALYZE THEY HAVE CONTAINED BOEM'S PLAN SCHEDULE FOR REVIEWING EACH OF THE COSTS SO THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT UM PIECE OF INFORMATION TO TO HAVE AVAILABLE SO THAT THAT'S REALLY THE WHAT'S INCLUDED IN IN THAT IS IT'S A PLAN SCHEDULE FOR REVIEWING THE COSTS THAT THAT COMES OUT WITH THE THE NOTICE OF IN INTENT ALL RIGHT SO I GUESS MAYBE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT ISN'T THERE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT THAT BOEM IS SUPPOSED TO UH SORT OF PUT OUT HERE IN IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ONE FOR VINEYARD RIGHT YES YES OH OKAY YEAH I'M NOT UM I I APOLOGIZE UM YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE TO ASK UH VINEYARD WIND ON ABOUT THAT OKAY BUT BUT BUT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A READ THROUGH FOR YOU OR YOUR OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS I GUESS THAT'S WHAT MY QUESTION WAS WELL CERTAINLY UM ALL OF THE DEVELOPERS OFF THE COAST UH THEY WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS <INAUDIBLE> OF IMPACT STUDY AND AND LOOKING AT SPACING AND UM OF OF WHEN TURBINES AND WE CAME UP WITH A A ONE NAUTICAL MILE A ONE NAUTICAL MILE SPACING SO CERTAINLY UH THERE COULD BE COMPONENTS THAT COME OUT IN IN ANY DECISION FOR UM VINEYARD WIND THAT YOU'D HAVE TO YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK AT TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY IMPACT UH YOU KNOW TO OTHER DEVELOPERS INCLUDING US BUT UM IN TERMS OF WHAT MIGHT BE IN THAT OR THE EXACT TIMING UM I THINK UH VINEYARD MIGHT MIGHT HAVE A BETTER PERSPECTIVE OF THAT OKAY PERFECT THAT'S ALL I HAD GUYS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANKS DRAGESH UH NEXT QUESTION IS FROM JEREMY FROM JP MORGAN GOOD MORNING JEREMY GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR HAVING ME JUST WANT TO START OF WITH UH WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF LOOPING CON ED INTO THE PROPOSED SUNRISE II UH SUNRISE WIND II RFP HERE EVERSOURCE HAS UH EXPERIENCE IN BUILDING TRANSMISSION AND I'M CURIOUS WHAT ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES CON

OPERATING IN NEW YORK SO I'D SAY THEY BRING A A KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL SET OF OF THE AREA THAT UH CERTAINLY WE DON'T HAVE UM YOU KNOW AS AS DEPTH A KNOWLEDGE AS AS THEY WOULD SO UH CERTAIN SKILL SETS THERE THAT THE LOCAL UH UH PLAYER WOULD BRING UM SO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT THE UM COMPONENTS OF A RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE THOSE THINGS ARE ALL TO BE DISCUSSED AS WE AS WE MOVE THROUGH BUT IT'S CERTAINLY UM BENEFICIAL I THINK TO THE PROJECT TO HAVE UH SOMEBODY WITH UM UH CON ED'S SKILL SETS INVOLVED GOT IT AND AS FAR AS POTENTIAL OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IS THERE ANY KIND OF THOUGHTS ON HOW THAT COULD DEVELOP UM NOT AT THIS TIME NO GOT IT AND THEN WILL THE DELAY IN OFFSHORE WIND PERMITTING HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE <INAUDIBLE> PLANS IS IT IS IT FAIR TO ASSUME THE $700 MILLION OF EQUITY IN YOUR CURRENT FIVE-YEAR PLAN MOVES TO THE BACK END HERE AND HOW IS OFFSHORE WIND CAP EX UH SPENDING TRACKED YEAR-TO-DATE VERSUS THE $300 TO $400 MILLION RANGE THAT UH YOU EXPECTED UM WE HAVEN'T DISCLOSED A

I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT UH UNDER WHAT WE EXPECTED AT AT AT THIS TIME UM IN TERMS OF THE FINANCING UH YOU'RE RIGHT THAT'S WE ANNOUNCED A YEAR AGO YOU KNOW THIS TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF OF EQUITY NEED THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE FORECAST AND WE WE ISSUED $1.3 OF THAT SO THERE'S $700 MILLION REMAINING THAT UM AND AND I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING AS I'VE SAID UH ALL ALONG IS WE'D BE OP

ANY ANYTHING BUT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH UH ON FIRST BLUSH I'D SAY IT'S CONSISTENT WITH UM PURA'S DESIRE TO HAVE UH SOME RATE CHANGES YOU KNOW MOVE INSTEAD OF IMPLEMENTING RATES AT PEAK TIMES OF USAGE MAYBE SUCH AS JULY IMPLEMENT THEM ON YOU KNOW CHANGE THE TIME OF IT TO IMPLEMENT IT UH MAYBE IN A IN A SHOULDER MONTH LIKE AS LIKE MAY OR SOMETHING UM AND MOVE TO ANNUAL RECONCILIATIONS AS OPPOSED TO UH SEMI-ANNUAL SO THIS THIS WOULD UM YOU KNOW IT DOES IT DOES DELAYS THIS COULD HAVE UH EFFECTIVELY THIS IS A CASH FLOW UH ITEM AND IT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR OUR OUR DEFERRALS UM THAT THAT WE

KNOW ZOOM MEETINGS OR TEAM CALLS OR WHATEVER UH THE THE THE UH THE UH VIDEO CAPABILITIES ARE THAT WE'RE USING BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING THAT AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE AGENCIES ARE WORKING FULL SPEED REGARDLESS OF UM YOU KNOW WHO WHO'S YOU KNOW PRESIDENT OR WHAT THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE BUT CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE UM YOU KNOW THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION I THINK WE'VE ALL AS A AS A COUNTRY UM YOU KNOW THAT UH THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL TARGETED OUT THERE AND WHEREVER YOU FALL ON THE UH THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM IT'S GOOD TO HAVE UH CERTAINTY AS OPPOSED TO UNCERTAINTIES SO I THINK WE'RE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THERE SO WE CAN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD OKAY BUT JUST SO IT JUST SO FOR MY CLARITY THE PROCESS OF

THINK THAT ONE WAS COMING OR IT WAS GOING A CERTAIN WAY IT REALLY HADN'T HASN'T MATERIALIZED SO I THINK IT'S BEST TO WAIT 'TIL THE THE FINAL THE FINAL ORDER COMES OUT AT THIS POINT OR ORDERS AS IT MAY BE RIGHT HEY AND UH BIGGER CRYSTAL BALL QUESTION UH WOULD BE UH YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT HYDRA QUEBEC HAS A PRETTY BIG LONG TERM CONSTRUCTION PLAN FOR GEN YOU KNOW HYDRO GENERATION UP THERE AND I KNOW THAT THEIR LONG TERM PLANS INCLUDED LOTS AND LOTS OF NORTHERN PASS TYPE TRANSMISSION LOTS UH YOU KNOW DO YOU THINK THERE'S EVER A TIME AT SOME POINT WHERE THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER UH ANOTHER WACK OR ANOTHER GO AT TRANSMISSION AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW BIG TRANSMISSION PROJECT THINK A LOT OF THAT IS DEPENDENT UPON WHAT THE STATES WANT TO GET RIGHT SO THIS THIS THESE ARE GONNA BE PROCESSES NOW THAT ARE DRIVEN BY STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES AND THE STATE'S DESIRE TO UM UM HAVE UH EITHER OFFSHORE WIND OR SOLAR OR HYDRO IN IN THE MIX SO UM YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY AT THE STATES NOW I MEAN THE STATES IN OUR AREA ALL WANT UH AGGRESSIVE UH UH CARBON REDUCTION TARGETS SO IT WOULDN'T BE OUT OF THE QUESTION TO SEE A STATE YOU KNOW WANT TO UM YOU KNOW CONTRACT FOR FOR MORE OF THAT BUT THERE'S NOTHING UH THERE'S NOTHING PLANNED ON OUR END AS NOTHING THAT I SEE AT THIS STAGE ON THE STATE'S AGENDA THAT WOULD WOULD SAY THAT BUT WHEN YOU SAY THE WORD EVER YOU KNOW

ON OFFSHORE WIND YOU KNOW IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE RECENT DELAYS I WAS WONDERING IF THAT CHANGES HOW YOU'RE STRATEGIZING AROUND OTHER BIDS THAT YOU'RE PUTTING INTO FUTURE UM RFPS UH LIKE BAKING IN MORE CONTINGENCY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT GIVE A GREATER LEVEL OF COMFORT AROUND THE ECONOMICS OF FUTURE PROJECTS THAT YOU MIGHT WIN UH THANK YOU DAVE FOR YOUR COMMENT AND I HOPE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE DOING UH WELL UM CERTAINLY UM EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT YOU GET YOU KNOW AND THIS ISN'T JUST OFFSHORE WIND YOU KNOW THIS THIS IS YOU KNOW ON ON ALL OUR BUSINESS BUT I'LL I'LL FOCUS ON OFFSHORE WIND SINCE THAT'S THE QUESTION YOU KNOW EVERY EVERY MONTH THAT GOES BY EVERY QUARTER THAT GOES BY WE GAIN MORE INSIGHT AND INFORMATION ABOUT UH CONSTRUCTION ABOUT YOU YOU KNOW UH UH WEIGHTS ABOUT ABOUT YOU KNOW LOT OF FACTORS AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE FACTORED INTO SUBSEQUENT BIDS SO THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US YOU KNOW AS WE'RE MOVING INTO A BID UH RECENT BID IN NEW YORK IS DIFFERENT THAN WE HAD FROM BIDS THAT WE MADE YOU KNOW IN RHODE ISLAND OR CONNECTICUT OR MASSACHUSETTS SO EVERY EVERY DATA POINT IS IMPORTANT TO US AND WE FACTOR THAT INTO THE NEXT BID SO I I SAY THAT ABSOLUTELY THAT UM SCHEDULES AND HOW HOW YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THE SITING PROCESS AND ALL OF THAT UH INFORMS UM YOU KNOW SUBSEQUENT BIDS AND UM SO I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT ALL THOSE THINGS GET GET YOU KNOW UP TO THE MINUTE UH ATTENTION BEFORE A BID GOES OUT OKAY GOT IT UM THAT'S HELPFUL AND I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON UM JUST O AND M COSTS IN THE O AND M BUDGET COULD YOU REMIND US UM HOW YOU SEE THAT TRAJECTORY UH JUST FOR THE OVERALL BUSINESS GOING FORWARD YOU'VE BEEN YOU'VE GOT A GREAT TRACK RECORD OF CONTROLLING O AND M UM SO WHAT ARE THE KEY LEVERS UM IN YOUR UH IN YOUR TOOL BELT SO THAT YOU THAT YOU WOULD FOCUS ON GOING FORWARD FOR MANAGING O AND M UM SO THERE'S A YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE GOT UH PEOPLE PROCESS AND AND TECHNOLOGY RIGHT SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE UM ARE LEVERAGED TO HELP YOU KNOW OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM AS WELL AS OUR OUR OPERATING PROGRAM SO UM YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO UH IMPLEMENT UH SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT UH IMPROVES PROCESSES THAT MAKES IT MORE EFFECT YOU KNOW EFFICIENT AND AND EFFECTIVE WORKFORCE SO WE HAVE UM STILL A ROBUST I'D SAY SERIES OF UH TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS UM IF YOU IF YOU UH I'LL START OFF BY JUST SETTING THE STAGE IN THE GUIDANCE WE DID WE SAID THAT WE EXPECTED O AND M COSTS TO BE YOU KNOW DOWN THIS YEAR AND THEN JUST FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD KIND OF UH FLAT UH GOING GOING FORWARD SO HOW HOW ARE WE ABLE TO DO THAT UM IT IT IS BY SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING MORE PRODUCTIVITY MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND TOOLS FOR OUR YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL LINE WORKERS AND GAS FITTERS AND IN THE FIELD TO GET THEIR WORK TO UPDATE THEIR UM WORK THAT WE CAN THEN TAKE THAT AND AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE DRAWINGS AND FILES WE DON'T NEED YOU KNOW TO HAND IT OFF TO SOMEBODY AND SO THERE'S STILL UM THESE PRODUCTIVITY UH TECHNOLOGY CHANGES ARE HAPPENING SOME WENT IN LAST YEAR SOME GOING IN THIS YEAR AND AND MORE PLANNED FOR NEXT SO THAT THAT WILL BE I'D SAY THE LEVER OR THE UNDER THE UH UH THE UNDERPINNING FOR US TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE PROCESSES AND AND TAKE UH UH UNNEEDED COSTS OUT OF THE BUSINESS OKAY GREAT THAT'S HELPFUL THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE CALLER YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU DAVID UH NEXT QUESTION IS FROM TRAVIS MILLER FROM MORNINGSTAR GOOD MORNING TRAVIS GOOD MORNING THANK YOU QUICK CLARIFICATION ON THE STORM COSTS THAT $275 MILLION NUMBER IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY HOW MUCH DID YOU EXPENSE IN THE QUARTER AND HOW MUCH WAS EITHER DEFERRED OR CAPITALIZED OR AND WILL BE PENDING THAT UH THE REGULATORY FILING THAT YOU MENTIONED SURE THAT THAT AMOUNT THAT YOU UH UH REPEATED WAS THE DEFERRED THAT'S HOW MUCH OF A STORM COST THAT WE DEFERRED IN UH FOR TROPICAL UH STORM ISAIAS AND THAT WAS ACROSS UM ALL STATES BUT PRIMARILY UH IN CONNECTICUT SO THAT'S OUR DEFERRAL THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW ONCE A STORM GETS TO A CERTAIN LEVEL IT TRIGGERS A DEFERRAL SO WE UM THAT THAT ALL IS DEFERRED STORM COSTS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF IF THERE ARE OTHER STORMS CERTAINLY WE HAVE UH WE HAVE AN ACTIVE CORNER FOR STORMS IN GENERAL BUT THERE ARE OTHER STORMS UH OTHER THAN ISAIAS THAT DID IMPACT THE QUARTER I MEAN OUR OUR STORM COSTS WERE UP YOU KNOW ABOUT $10 MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FOR THE QUARTER AND WENT THROUGH YOU KNOW OUR OUR O AND M SO IT'S NOT THE YOU KNOW FOR THE QUARTER IT IT'S IT'S AT THAT LEVEL AND THEN THE $274 OR FIVE YOU MENTIONED IS THE IS THE DEFERRED ACROSS THE SYSTEM OKAY GREAT THAT'S THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU AND THEN UH A QUICK FOLLOW UP TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE CONNECTICUT LEGISLATION AND THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE IN THERE AS I UNDERSTOOD IT ABOUT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAVING SOME UH REVIEW POWER THERE WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY SEPARATE FROM PURA COULD DO IN TERMS OF EITHER TAKING BACK SOME EARNINGS OR UH RATE CHANGES STUFF LIKE THAT SEPARATE FROM WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PURA WELL CERTAINLY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY UH CAN ENACT LEGISLATION THAT IT FEELS IS APPROPRIATE IN IN ANY UH MATTER SO UM YOU KNOW I I DO THINK SPECIFICALLY TO THE THE ENERGY LEGISLATION THAT WAS ENACTED UH RECENTLY IN CONNECTICUT THAT MOST YOU KNOW THINGS UM ALL WERE YOU KNOW FOR THE MOST PART MOVED TO TO PURA YOU KNOW SO THE THE REGULATORS OF THE THE I GUESS I'D LOOK AT IT AS THE LEGISLATION WOULD PROVIDE THE INTENT THE FRAMEWORK THE DIRECTION AND THEN PURA IS THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE THE ONES WHO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE BASED RATES THEY'LL THEY'LL BE THE ONES WHO UH INITIATE THE STORM UM STANDARDS AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND AND LOOK AT UM YOU KNOW SHOULD THERE BE PENALTIES SHOULD THERE BE FOOD YOU KNOW PENALTIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I THINK THAT EFFECTIVELY YOU KNOW THE THE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY CAN CAN CERTAINLY ENACT UH ANY AND ALL LEGISLATION UH IT IT FEELS UM IT IT SHOULD AND AND THE WAY THAT THIS LEGISLATION SEEMS TO HAVE TURNED OUT WAS THAT THEN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT LEGISLATION IS IN THE HANDS OF PURA OKAY SO THE POTENTIAL FOR ANY OTHER RISKS FOR ANY OTHER CALL BACKS WOULD LIKELY GO THROUGH PURA INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY BASED ON THAT CONNECTICUT LEGISLATION THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT GREAT YEAH AS I SAY YOU KNOW THE UM PURA THE DOCKETS ARE ACTIVE IN UH IN AND WILL BE ACTIVE OVER YOU KNOW A CERTAIN TIME UM DATES THAT THE LEGISLATION HAS GIVEN PURA SO WOULD EXPECT THAT UH PURA WILL HAVE UM HAVE THE PEN ON THIS BUT AGAIN AS I SAY YOU KNOW WHAT LEGISLATION CAN CAN ALWAYS BE ENACTED IN IN ANY UM IN ANY AREA YEAH OKAY GREAT APPRECIATE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU TRAVIS OUR NEXT QUESTION UM IS FROM ANDREW WEISEL FROM SCOTIA GOOD MORNING ANDREW HEY GOOD MORNING UH THANKS FOR FITTING ME IN UM FIRST QUESTION IS UH WITH THE TWO RATE CASES NOW COMPLETED CAN YOU REMIND US WHAT SUBSIDIARIES MIGHT BE NEXT TO FILE GENERAL RATE CASES YOU HAVE PLENTY OF REGULATORY ITEMS OF COURSE WITH <INAUDIBLE> OTHER INITIATIVES BUT FOR GENERAL RATE CASES UM WELL ACCORDING TO UM THE REQUIREMENTS IN CONNECTICUT UH CONNECTICUT COULD BE UH AN AREA THAT IS REQUIRED TO FILE UH BY THE UH INTERESTING UH UH FRAMEWORK THAT'S THERE UM AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SORT OF A YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR SORT OF EVENT BUT OTHER THAN THAT UM WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE REGULATORY ARENA OKAY GREAT THEN ON OFFSHORE WIND UM CAN YOU JUST THINKING UH SORRY CAN YOU SHARE YOUR LATEST THINKING ON HOW BIG YOU'RE WILLING TO LET THAT BUSINESS GET YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU'RE PURSUING UH BEYOND THE THREE EXISTING PROJECTS ANY THINKING AS FAR AS FROM AN EARNINGS MIX PERSPECTIVE IF THERE'S A LIMITATION OR WOULD THE WILL YOU PLAN TO JUST BID BID BID AND GET AS MANY PROJECTS AS YOUR LEASES WILL SUPPORT WELL I WANNA BE CLEAR ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT UM BID BID BID IS THE BEST STRATEGY OUR STRATEGY IS TO HAVE A FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE ABOUT GROWING THAT BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF OF RETURNS THAT THAT BENEFIT OUR SHAREHOLDERS SO JUST BY WINNING A BID UM YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T DO IT IT HAS TO BE WE HAVE TO AND WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE IN TERMS OF THE UH AMOUNTS THAT WE BID AND THE RETURNS THAT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO UM IT AS LONG AS THE RETURNS ARE AT AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL THAT UM UH FOR THAT BUSINESS IT MAKES SENSE TO UH MAKE THE BID WIN THE BID AND AND AND EXPAND THE BUSINESS THERE UM THE WHAT WE'VE SAID IS WE OUR TRACKS THE WHAT WE OWN OFF THE COAST OF UH OR WHAT WHAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO IN TERMS OF THE LEASE AREAS YOU KNOW WE COULD DO ABOUT UH 4000 AT LEAST 4000 MEGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND SO THERE'S KIND OF A YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE MAXIMUM CAPABILITIES THAT WE WE HAVE SO IT'S NOT AN AN INFINITE UH GROWTH TYPE OF THING AND UM WE HAD INDICATED THAT UH WHEN LEASES WERE AVAILABLE THAT ARE NOT IN OUR REGION THAT WE WERE NOT INTERESTED IN THEM SO LEASES IN OUR REGION LIKE THE ONES WE'RE INVOLVED IN ARE ARE GOOD BUT OTHER LEASE AREAS YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S NOT FOR US IN OTHER PARTS OF THE MID-ATLANTIC ETC SO IT'S A WE'RE CONSTRAINED BY THE LEASE AREA AND UM WHEN OUR WE'RE GUIDED BY THE FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE TOO ON OUR BIDS AND OUR RETURNS GOT IT THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE SAID BID BID BID RESPONSIBLY OKAY <CROSSTALK> THANKS A LOT GUYS AND I HOPE YOU STAY WELL ANDREW THANKS ALL RIGHT ANDREW THANK YOU VERY MUCH UH THAT SORT OF WRAPS UP TODAY UM IF YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS UH PLEASE GIVE US A CALL OR SEND US AN EMAIL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING AND SEEING MANY OF DURING THE VIRTUAL EEI CONFERENCE NEXT WEEK AND THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS CONCLUDES TODAY'S CONFERENCE THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING

I'M JEFF COGAN, EVERSOURCE ENERGY'S PRESIDENT FOR INVESTOR RELATIONS. DURING THIS CALL, WE'LL BE REFERENCING SLIDES THAT WE POSTED LAST NIGHT ON OUR WEBSITE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE ON SLIDE ONE, SOME OF THE STATEMENTS MADE DURING THIS INVESTOR CALL MAY BE FORWARD LOOKING AS DEFINED WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE U S PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF NINETY FIVE. THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASE AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISK AND UNCERTAINTY WHICH MAY CAUSE THE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM FORECASTS AND PROJECTIONS. THESE FACTORS ARE SET FORTH IN THE NEWS RELEASE ISSUED YESTERDAY. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM T K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND OUR FORM T K FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE Two thousand and twenty. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-gap measures and how those measures reconcile to gap results is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent ten k seeking today will be phil lembo our executive vice president and cfo also joining us today are joe nolan our executive vice president for strategy customer and corporate relations. JOHN LERERA OUR TREASURER AND SENIOR VP FOR FINANCE AND REGULATORY AND JAY BOOTH OUR CONTROLLER NOW I WILL TURN SLIDE TWO AND TURN OVER THE CALL TO PHIL THANK YOU JEFF MORNING EVERYONE I HOPE EVERYONE ON THE CALL REMAINS HEALTHY AND THAT YOUR FAMILIES ARE SAFE AND DOING WELL THIS MORNING I'LL COVER A VARIETY OF AREAS REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THE THIRD QUARTER DISCUSS RECENT REGULATORY DISCUSS RECENT REG Developments including the acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts to provide an update on recent developments around our offshore wind partnership with Orsted. I'll start with slide two noting that recurring earnings were one dollar and two cents per share in the third quarter of twenty twenty compared with recurring earnings of ninety eight cents per share in the third quarter of twenty nineteen gap results which included a charge of one dollar per share. Share relating to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts totaling one dollar and one cent per share in the third quarter of twenty twenty in the first nine months of twenty twenty are recurring earnings excluding Columbia Gas acquisition costs totaling two dollars and eighty-nine cents per share compared with recurring earnings of two dollars and sixty-nine cents per share in the first nine months of twenty twenty. NINETEEN AND EXCLUDING THE NORTHERN PATH TRANSMISSION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE GAP RESULTS FOR SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR WERE TWO DOLLARS AND SEVENTY SIX CENTS PER SHARE TURNING TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS OUR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT EARNED SIXTY SENSES PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY COMPARED WITH EARNINGS OF SIXTY ONE CENTS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE LOWER EARNINGS WERE RESULTS STORM RESTORATION COSTS AND PROPERTY TAX EXPENSES AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF SOME SHARED DELUXE OUR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT EARNED THIRTY SIX CENTS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY COMPARED WITH RECURRING EARNINGS OF THIRTY THREE CENTS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN IMPROVED RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT AND RELIABILITY IN OUR TRANSMISSION FACILITIES PARTI Delusion: Our natural gas distribution segment lost four cents per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of five cents per share in the third quarter of last year. Improved results were due to higher revenues. I should note that because we didn't close on our acquisition of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets until October ninth, the transaction had no impact. ON THIS THE GAS SEGMENT THIS SEGMENT DURING THE QUARTER EACH QUARTER THIS YEAR WE'VE BOOKED ACQUISITION RELATED COSTS AT THE PARENT AND HAVE SEGREGATED THEM FOR INCREASED TRANSPARENCY BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR ONGOING RESULTS OF OUR NEW GAS FRANCHISE WHICH IS NAMED EVERSOURCE GAS COMPANY OF MASSACHUSETTS WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE NATURAL GAS SEGMENT INTEGRATION RELATED COSTS HOWEVER WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECORDED SEPARATELY AT THE PARENT AND EXCLUDED FROM OUR RECURRING GAP EARNINGS OUR WATER DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT EARNED SEVEN CENTS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWO COMPARED WITH EARNINGS OF SIX CENTS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IMPROVED RESULTS WERE DUE TO A THREE THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR AFTER TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF OUR HARBIN MASSACH We have facilities in the town of Easthampton that earned three cents per share in the third quarter of 2020, excluding the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts asset acquisition cost, which is equal to our earnings in the third quarter of last year. As you probably noted in our earnings release, we can see on slide three that we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings per share guidance of three dollars and sixty cents to three dollars and seventy cents. Seventy cents and that is excluding the non-recurring costs related to the purchase of columbia gas of massachusetts assets. We are also reaffirming our long-term eps growth rate of five to seven percent from our core regulated business through the year twenty twenty four we continue to be to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range largely due to the investments we need to make on behalf of our customers as we outline. FOR YOU EARLIER IN THE YEAR AS A REMINDER WHILE WE FULLY EXPECT THE COLUMBIA GAS ASSETS TO BE ACQUIRED TO OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE STARTING IMMEDIATELY IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE WE HAVE NOT YET UPDATED OUR LONG TERM FINANCIAL OUTLOOK TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION OF COLUMBIA GAS ASSETS AT OUR CAPITAL OUR CAPEX OR OUR EARNINGS ROADS IN ADDITION AS WE'VE DISCLOSED PREVIOUSLY EARNINGS FROM OFFSHORE WIND WOULD BE Incremental to our poor business growth will provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecasts adding in ever so much gas company Massachusetts projections and provide an update of our offshore wind partnership during our year-end call in late February. From the third quarter results, I'll turn to slide four and our experience restoring power after tropical storms.

The decision allows Starbucks Rewards to increase distribution revenues by twenty three million dollars on an annualized basis.

That's approximately the same level as this time last year in 2019. We made considerable progress on our transmission capital program in the third quarter, putting several projects into service.

Our first question this morning is from Shar from Guten. TIMES GOOD MORNING SHARR GOOD MORNING JEFF GOOD MORNING SHARR SOME COUPLE OF QUESTIONS HERE I JUST JUST WANT TO FEEL SOME OF YOUR LANGUAGE AROUND SORT OF THE GROWTH RATE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WHICH STILL EXCLUDES COLUMBIA GAS AND OFFSHORE WIND OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE YOU KNOW VERY CREATIVE AND YOU'RE ALREADY CONSERVATIVELY KIND OF WELL WITHIN YOUR BAND SO SHOULD WE SORT OF BE THINKING ABOUT THESE INCREMENTAL ITEMS 100 PERCENT OR SOMETHING THAT WILL HIT YOU TO THE TOP END AND THEN SORT OF EXTENDS THAT RUNWAY WITH YOUR CURRENT TRAJECTORY I MEAN THE REASON I WANT TO ASK IS SIX TO EIGHT PERCENT SEEMS TO BE SORT OF THAT NEW TOP QUARTILE BUCKET IN OUR SPACE WHERE FIVE TO SEVEN PERCENT IS BECOMING A LITTLE BIT MORE TYPICAL SO I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU'RE SORT OF THINKING ABOUT THIS DO YOU SEE VALUE TO BE A TALK TO BE IN THE TOP QUARTILE OR YOU DON Sure, thanks for the question and that. I hope you're doing well. Certainly, the addition of Columbia Gas and will be additive to our existing forecast. So, we're working through all the details of that, so we're able to provide you with a full update in February. But we expect to get a significant benefit from that from that franchise. And it's say we also expect to get a significant benefit from that from that franchise. And it's say we also expect to get a significant benefit from that from that franchise. And it's say we also expect to get a significant benefit from that from that franchise. And it's say we also expect to get a significant benefit from that from that franchise. And it's say we also expect to get a significant benefit from that from that franchise. And it's EXPECTS AS THOSE OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS COME ONLINE ONLINE TO ALSO BE ADDITIVE TO REMIND FOLKS I KNOW I SAID IT BUT AND YOU DID THAT THE FIVE TO SEVEN PERCENT GROWTH RATE IS FROM THE FROM THE EXISTING CORE BUSINESS WHICH DOESN'T INCLUDE COLUMBIA ASSETS IT ALSO DOESN'T INCLUDE GRIID MODERNIZATION ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PENDING IN CANADA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE OR Our A M I that that could could be a potential to move forward relatively soon in Massachusetts in terms of taking a look at that by the by the regulator so I see that we have a number of levers to grow and grow at even a higher rate than we expected before got it that's helpful and then just lastly for me is can you just maybe Talk a little bit about your expectations for the legislation in connecticut. i mean the legislation that passed was more constructive than the draft legislation but obviously some disappointment with the refunds and and penalties offset by the potential upside from like pbrs so sort of how are you guys thinking about this entirely sure the energy legislation we we said consistently that pbr is a is a formula and a template THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE AND IT AUTHORIZES PIERRE TO YOU KNOW ESTABLISH STORM STANDARDS AND POTENTIAL PENALTIES AS YOU MENTION THERE ISN'T THERE IS AN INCREASED POTENTIAL OF PENALTIES CURRENTLY THOSE PENALTIES ARE TWO AND A HALF PERCENT OF OUR DISTRIBUTION REVENUES IN KANSAS AND THAT GOES UP TO FOUR PERCENT SO YOU KNOW IT ALSO GIVES PIERRE SOME ADDITIONAL TIME YOU KNOW TO REVIEW CASES SO THAT WHICH IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW SEEMS TO BE APPROPRIATE SO THE LEGISLATION AS YOU AS YOU INDICATED IS OUT THERE AND PIERRE IS WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS OF IT AND WE EXPECT TO BE WORKING THAT THROUGH IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY WITH THEM OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS GOT IT TERRIFIC THAT'S ALL I HAD TODAY THANKS GUYS THANKS SHARK OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM STEVE LYSHMAN THANKS WOLF, GOOD MORNING STEVE, GOOD MORNING, UM, HEY, DO YOU HEAR ME? YES, STEVE, I CAN. YEAH, GREAT. SO, JUST A QUESTION ON THE DELAYS IN YOUR OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS. COULD YOU MAYBE TALK TO, I KNOW WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT TIMING BUT HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMICS OF THOSE PROJECTS FROM DELAY? ART OF PUTS AND TAKES AND IS IT HURTING THE ECONOMICS OF THE PROJECTS YOU ALREADY HAVE SIGNED UP TO YEAH GUYS THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTIONS STEPHEN I HOPE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE DOING WELL UM I GUESS YOU SHOULD GO TO THE PUTS AND TAKES PIECE YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY THINK THAT SCHEDULE CHANGES RESULT IN UPS OR DOWNS THERE'S BENEFITS OR THAT PEOPLE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND IN THAT. SO CERTAINLY IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT ADJUSTED SCHEDULES YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADJUST YOUR INSTALLATION VESSEL OPTIMIZATION BETTER YOU KNOW THE TURBINE SIZES THEMSELVES ARE GETTING LARGER SO YOU COULD MOVE THROUGH LARGER TURBINE SIZES IF PROJECTS ARE DUE AT A LATER TIME TIME PERIOD VERSUS AN EARLIER TIME PERIOD AND CERTAINLY THE COST SUPPLY CHAIN AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS IN SUPPLY CHAIN IS ONLY GETTING BETTER SO SO I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVED COST ECONOMICS AS YOU MOVE INTO A SCHEDULE THAT YOU YOU MAY NOT THINK OF YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE GENERALLY THINK OF PROJECTS AS YOU KNOW IF IT'S DELAYED IT'S A COST INCREASE BUT THAT OUR OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WORK HERE IN THE OFFSHORE WIND BUSINESS THAT OFFSETS THAT HOW ABOUT HOW ABOUT ANY NEGATIVES IS IT HOW ABOUT LIKE DO YOU LOSE ARE YOU GOING TO LOSE ANY TAX CREDITS OR ANYTHING ELSE YES CERTAINLY PENGUIN TIME VALUE YES IN TERMS OF THE SCHEDULES WE'RE LOOKING AT WE DON'T EXPECT TO HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR TAX ASSUMPTIONS BUT CERTAINLY SIGNIFICANT DELAYS DELAYS COULD HAVE IMPACTS ON YOUR TAX ASSUMPTIONS, DELAYS COULD ALSO HAVE IMPACTS ON CONTRACTS THAT YOU HAVE WITH COUNTERPARTIES. BUT IN OUR SPECIFIC CASE, THAT'S THE GENERAL CASE. IN OUR SPECIFIC CASE, WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK WITHIN BOTH OF THOSE THE TAX AREA AND THE CONTRACT AREA IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY WITH WHERE WE SEE THE SCHEDULES GOING IN THE FUTURE Okay, thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Angie from Seaport Global. Good morning, Angie. Good morning, Angie. So, I have a question about Massachusetts. You know, you've had this very constructive decision for Mass General. But how do you see the future of gastroenterology in the state? And so, how do you see the future of gastroenterology in the state? And so, how do you see the future of gastroenterology in the state? And so, how do you see the future of gastroenterology in the state? And so, how do you see the future of gastroenterology in the state? And so, how do you see the future of gastroenterology in the state? And so, how do you see the future of gastroenterology in the state? And so Especially in light of the fact that you just acquired an additional gas utility in Massachusetts. Good morning, Angie, and thank you for your question and hope you're doing well. You know, the way that I would position it, the way that I think people should think about it is that there's nobody, first of all, who's more aggressive in terms of looking at clean energy strategies and CARBON REDUCTION THAN EVERY SOURCE IN TERMS OF HAVING A CARBON NEUTRAL GOAL BY 2030 WE HAVE WORKED EFFECTIVELY WITH ALL PARTIES IN ALL STATES BUT IN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHERS WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU KNOW SORT OF THE FUTURE OR THE OUTLOOK IN TERMS OF THE GAS BUSINESS WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THESE INTERVENING PARTIES FOR FOUR YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM BENEFITS ON WHAT WE THINK AN APPROPRIATE STRATEGY IS THERE. SO THIS IS A LONG TERM OUTLOOK IN TERMS OF THAT THE STATE WANTS TO YOU KNOW HAVE AGGRESSIVE CLEAN ENERGY AND CARBON REDUCTION TARGETS WELL SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THE PARTIES THERE. BUT WE DON'T SEE IT AS A THREAT TO THE GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS UM In the region at all. Okay. And in Connecticut, you know, there's this recent back-and-forth between you guys and Porter about the extension of the lack of basically disconnections on the back of COVID. I mean, it sounds a bit concerning that Porter is pushing back so strong that they don't need to sign off on that extension. I would assume that it's a bit concerning that Porter is pushing back so strong that they don't need to sign off on that extension. I would assume that it's a bit concerning that Porter is pushing back so strong that they don't need to sign off on that extension. I would assume that it's a bit concerning that Porter is pushing back so strong that they don't need to sign off on that extension. I would assume that it's a bit concerning that Porter AN ACTUAL PRACTICE, NORMAL PRACTICE FOR A REGULATED UTILITY TO SEEK A RECOVERY OF THESE UNDERCOVERED REVENUES. I MEAN, CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE HOW YOU SEE IT IN CONNECTICUT GIVEN THE LATEST LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND ALSO SOME DETERIORATION AND AND YOU KNOW BETTER RELATIONSHIPS IN THE STATE? YES, SO WE ARE NOT DOING SHUT OFFS ACROSS ALL ANYWAY FRANCHISED AT THIS POINT AND SPECIFICALLY WE KNOW YOU'RE WORKING WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS WE'RE WORKING WITH FUEL AGENCIES ASSISTES AGENCIES ON AN APPROACH HERE THAT WORKS THAT WORKS BETTER FOR CUSTOMERS WE'VE ALSO ENGAGED WITH PIERRE AS YOU MENTIONED AND OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS YOU KNOW ON THIS ISSUE SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL GET TO A GOOD PLACE HERE YOU KNOW NOBODY WAN BURDEN CUSTOMERS WITH ANY MORE THAN THAN WE'RE ALL READY ALL OF US ARE BURDENED WITH IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND AND COVID ET CETERA SO WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE ISSUE WE'RE WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS AS I SAY AND SOME OF THE ASSISTANCE AGENCIES AND AND I'M SURE WE'LL GET TO A GOOD OUTCOME HERE VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU ANGIE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM JULIE I'M IN FROM BANK OF AMERICA GOOD MORNING JULIAN HEY GUYS GOOD MORNING TEAM THANKS FOR THE TIME I HOPE ALL OF YOU ARE DOING WELL AND SAFE FAMILIES AS WELL PERHAPS JUST TO PICK UP OFF OF THAT OR PERHAPS TO CLARIFY IF I CAN SOME OF THE LAST ROUNDS OF QUESTIONS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE FOUR Q'S ROLL FORWARD ARE YOU ROLLING INTO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THEN MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT INCLUDING OR EXCLUD WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE AT LEAST FOR THOSE PROJECTS WHERE THERE'S AN UNDETERMINED DATE TO CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED THERE JULIE THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION AND YOUR COMMENTS THAT I HOPE AND HOPE YOUR YOUNG FAMILY IS DOING WELL TOO JUST TO CLARIFY WE WILL OUR HISTORY HAS BEEN TO ADD ANOTHER YEAR INTO THE OUTLOOK SO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WOULD BE THAT THAT YEAR SINCE OUR FORECAST GOES THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY FOURTH TIME PERIOD SO THAT SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE AND REALLY OUR VIEW ON HOW TO LOOK AT OFFSHORE WIND IT DOESN'T CHANGE BY BY ANY OF THE SCHEDULE ITEMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY OR IF WE WE'VE LOOKED AT IT AS SHOWING THE CORE BUSINESS AS THE DRIVER AND THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE GROWTH RATE AND THEN TO SHOW THAT WIND IS ADDITIVE TO THAT IN WHAT WAY SO THAT WOULD BE THE INTENT GOING FORWARD I THINK THAT WHAT I'VE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION BEFORE THE ANSWER IS IS IS WAS AND STILL IS AS MORE YEARS OF WIND COME IN TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THAT PARTICULAR YEAR THAN TO ME IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ROLL IT ALL TOGETHER BUT AT THIS STAGE THE EXPECTATION ESPECIALLY IN THIS UPCOMING FEBRUARY UPDATE WOULD BE TO HAVE THE CORE BUSINESS EXTEND THAT THROUGH 20 YEARS Twenty five and then show offshore wind in addition to that. And if you don't mind elaborating a little bit further, i know that there's a certain degree of uncertainty on exactly the permitting schedule that inhibits your ability to say when these projects in a region of service can you at least try to put some more parameters around what each of these pieces of the process could take so such that there's like a window if you will it may be too early Yeah, so in terms of um, you know, there's people have realized out there, and we've been asked questions, and I think you've asked us the questions in terms of, you know, what, with delays on vineyard wind and other things, there's been some delays in terms of boom's notice of intent, of intent, and to prepare their environmental impact statement, and frankly, we would have, we would have expected IN OUR ORIGINAL SCHEDULE SCHEDULES THAT SOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS YOU KNOW TO PREPARE THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT WOULD BE WOULD BE OUT BY NOW SO THESE ARE EXPECTED I BELIEVE YOU KNOW THAT THE PLAIN SCHEDULE FOR REVIEWING AND RELEASING THESE IS UNDERWAY SO I WOULDN'T EXPECT A YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE SCHEDULE BUT AT THIS STAGE IT WOULD BE A PRUDENT Sorry, I need more information to provide a proper answer. Can you please provide me with the question or topic you would like me to help you with? Uh, you know, the, the offshore wind here, what to expect, you know, there's this eis decision, I suppose, that's gonna be out, or, uh, it's gonna be out this month, or, uh, early december. What to expect there, and then how does that impact your, your future project timelines? Yeah, the, uh, these notices of intent that they contain, they, they contain a plan schedule, you know, that, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, They have contained Bone's planned schedule for reviewing each of the cops. So that would be an important piece of information to have available. So that's really the what's included in that is a planned schedule for reviewing the cops that that comes out with the notice of intent. I guess maybe I'm talking about the environmental impact statement isn't there an environmental impact statement that Bone is supposed to sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Can you please provide more context or clarify your question? Developers off the coast, you know, we've been going through this cumulative impact study and we're looking at spacing and of wind turbines and we came up with a one nautical mile by one nautical mile spacing. So certainly there could be components that come out in any decision for renewed wind that you'd have to take a look at to see if it has any impacts, you know, to other developers. Including us but in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing, I think Vinge might might have a better perspective of that. Okay, perfect. That's all I had, guys. Thanks so much. Alright, thanks, Durgesh. Next question is from Jeremy from J.P. Morgan. Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning. Thanks for having me. Just want to start off with what are the benefits of loop quantum computing?

In terms of the financing, you're right that we announced a year ago. You know, there's two billion dollars of equity need that would support the forecast. And we issued one point three of that. So there's still a hundred million remaining that and I would say the same thing, as I've said all along, as we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we'd be, we' OPPORTUNISTIC AND CONSIDER WHAT OUR CAPITAL FORECASTS ARE AND WHAT THE MARKET CONDITIONS ARE YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK TO FULFILL THE REST OF THAT OFFERING THAT WE DISCUSSED GOT IT THAT'S HELPF I'LL LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU THANK YOU JERRY NEXT QUESTION IS FROM PAUL PATTERSON FROM GLEN ROCK MORNING PAUL GOOD MORNING GUYS I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE DRAFT DECISION IN CONNECTICUT ON MONDAY AND BUT WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT UM ANY IF IT WERE IN FACT TO BECOME A FINAL ORDER WHAT THE WHAT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT COULD BE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE DRAFT INFORMATION ON RATES OR WHAT CAN YOU BE MOST SPECIFIC THE PURA CASE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RIGHTS RIGHT THE RIGHT REVIEW THAT WAS REVERSED THAT PROCEEDING I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE SPECIFIC NAME I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTERS NONE OF THAT MATTER The rates that we implemented over the summer, both we and you, to take an additional look, I think this is what you're referring to. So we did receive the draft order, and really, it's kind of hot off the press. We're currently evaluating that, and we're going to see what comments we might have and comments on the draft could do. I think it's the twelfth of November, so we have some time to flush out anything. But it's consistent. CONSISTENT WITH ON FIRST BLUSH I'D SAY IT'S CONSISTENT WITH PURE DESIRE TO HAVE SOME RATE CHANGES YOU KNOW MOVE INSTEAD OF IMPLEMENTING RATES AT PEAK TIMES OF USAGE MAYBE SUCH AS JULY IMPLEMENT A MONTH YOU KNOW CHANGE THE TIME OF IT TO IMPLEMENT IT MAYBE IN A SHORTER MONTH LIKE MAY OR SOMETHING AND MOVE IT TO ANNUAL RECONCILIATIONS AS PER SEMI ANNUAL SO THIS THIS WOULD YOU KNOW IT IS IF THIS IS DELAYED IT COULD HAVE EFFECTIVELY THIS IS A CASH FLOW ITEM IT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR OUR DEFERALS THAT THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE THERE BUT YOU KNOW I THINK IT GENERALLY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIRE AS WE SAID THAT TO MOVE OFF THESE PEAK PERIODS FOR MAKING RATE CHANGES AND SHOULDER PERIODS AND SEE WHAT WE GO FROM THERE BUT WE'RE WE'RE ACTIVELY REVIEWING THAT LAST NIGHT AND TODAY WE WILL BE AND HAVE ANY COMMENTS THAT WE WOULD HAVE DUE AS I HAVE SAID ON THE TWELFTH OH THERE WAS ONE PART OF IT THAT WOULD REDUCE THE CARRYING CHARGES FROM THE AH FROM WAX TO A PRIME RATE ON A VARIETY OF RECONCILIATION MECHANISMS UM IS THERE ANY UM DO WE HAVE ANY I KNOW THIS IS ALL POPULAR AND EVERYTHING BUT DO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF FORECAST AS TO WHAT THE UM BUT THOSE RECONCILIATION MECHANISMS, LIKE HOW MUCH CAPITAL MIGHT BE TIED UP IN THOSE? NOW THAT YOU DID THAT THAT IS A POINT TO UM THE CARRYING COST AT PRIME WHICH IS CONSISTENT IN SOME OTHER JURISDICTIONS, I GUESS. SO NOW IT'S NOT THE SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW ITEM BUT IT'S CERTAINLY ONE THAT PIERRE HAD PUT OUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE The topic of discussion is about recovering deferred balances with a prime rate versus a low rate. The speaker then discusses the possibility of a change in administration and its potential impact on the permitting process for offshore wind. The conversation ends with the speaker asking if the audience believes that a change in administration would have a significant impact on the permitting process for offshore wind. The permitting process. I mean, when we meet with with b o e m, you know, the bureau of ocean energy management, you know, that people are active. We're actively working. We're actively having you know, zoom meetings or teams calls or whatever, the video capabilities are that we're using. But, you know, we're actively working at that and i can assure you of that. THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE AGENCIES ARE WORKING FULL SPEED REGARDLESS OF WHO'S YOU KNOW WHO'S PRESIDENT OR WHAT THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE. BUT CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE YOU KNOW THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. I THINK WE'VE ALL AS A COUNTRY YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL TARGETED OUT THERE AND WHEREVER YOU FALL ON THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM IT'S GOOD TO HAVE CERTAINTY Instead of uncertainty, so I think we're all looking forward to what the final outcome is there, so we can, we can move forward. Okay, but just so, so, so, for my clarity, the process of the boehm is pretty much the, the agency, the, the, the bureaucratic process that's going on. Really, you don't see a significant change one way or the other, regardless of the outcome of the presidential election. Is that a, a, a right, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a GOING ON YOU KNOW THERE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY GOING THROUGH QUESTIONS WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE VARIED STATE AGENCIES SO NOW I SAY THAT THE WORK IS CONTINUING AT THAT AS YOU SAY THE BUREAUCRAT LEVEL OK AWESOME THANKS MUCH YOU ALL THANKS PAUL NEXT QUESTION IS FROM MIKE WYNSTEIN FROM CREDIT SUISSE GOOD MORNING MIKE HEY MORNING MONEY PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL PHIL MONEY MICHAEL P Bleep bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop Cases, and certainly the impact of the election one way or the other, what, what that could have in terms of commissioners and that type of thing. So, um, the only thing I know for certain is that we're, we're looking at our ten point five seven rates and reserving to that level and an eleven point seven four cap. And you know, we'll just have to wait and see what the final, the final outcome is. WILL WELL LOOK AT BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE AH ANY ANSWER I KNOW IN YEARS PASSED WHEN I TRIED TO WAIT WHEN I TRIED TO THINK THAT ONE WAS COMING OR IT WAS GOING AH SERIOUS WAY IT REALLY HADN'T HASN'T MATERIALIZED SO I THINK IT'S BETTER TO WAIT FOR THE FINAL THE FINAL ORDER COMES OUT AT THIS POINT OH BORDERS AS IT MAY BE RIGHT GREAT BRISTOL QUESTION WOULD BE I YOU KNOW THAT HYDRO QUEBEC HAS A PRE The speaker is discussing a hydrogen generation project. They mention that the project is long-term and includes many transmission lines. The speaker then asks if there is ever a time when there might not be enough hydrogen to meet demand. The other person responds by saying that they think the demand for hydrogen will continue to grow. POLICIES AND THE STATE'S DESIRE TO HAVE EITHER OFFSHORE WIND OR SOLAR OR HYDRO IN THE MIX. SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY THERE IS A LOT OF ACTIVITY AT THE STATES NOW. I MEAN THE STATES IN OUR AREA ALL WANT AGGRESSIVE CARBON REDUCTION TARGETS. SO IT WOULDN'T BE OUT OF THE QUESTION TO SEE A STATE WANT TO YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW Y I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? Our next question is from Insouci Kim from Goldman Sachs. Good morning Insouci. Hi good morning guys. My only question is and apologies if I miss this but could you give just an update on the Connecticut grid mark filings and any updates on expected distribution of decisions from the commission and you know timing of investments et cetera. Thanks for your question and I hope you and your family are doing well. You didn't miss it. I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that I mentioned that YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF WHAT ITEMS COULD BE ADDITIVE TO OUR FIVE TO SEVEN PERCENT CORE BUSINESS GROWTH RATE I ALLUDED TO GRIMMOD IN CONNECTICUT OR NEW HAMPSHIRE OR POTENTIALLY ADDITIONAL A M I DOCKETS IN MASSACHUSETTS BUT THERE'S REALLY BEEN NO CHANGE THAT WE'VE FILED COMMENTS AND PLANS BACK IN JULY AND CERTAINLY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES THAT WE'VE FILED COMMENTS AND PLANS BACK IN JULY AND CER A LOT, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON, AND I THINK I MAY HAVE SAID EAST AYAHIS WAS IN OCTOBER BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT EAST AYAHIS WAS IN AUGUST SO SINCE AUGUST THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON ON STORMS AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DOCKETS AND AS SOMEBODY ELSE MENTIONED WE HAVE DOCKETS GOING ON IN TERMS OF MORE LATORIUMS AND WHAT NOT SO THIS YOU KNOW THE EXPECTATION WAS THERE WAS GOING TO BE We're looking at another process in Connecticut towards the end of the year. I really haven't seen anything that would indicate a specific schedule you know on that. So I guess our best guess is still you know it's still in the in the pipeline and you may see more activity on grid modernization there in Connecticut as we move over the next several months. But in terms of being in our forecast, it's been a long time. It would be clear that there is currently no zero, there is no grid model spending in our capital forecast for any grid model programs that haven't been approved, like in Connecticut or New Hampshire. So, you know, once they are approved and once we see what our role would be in them, and once we see what that looks like, then we have more confidence in putting in the plan. So that could be. Somebody we have information on by the time we get to the February update so you know we'll have to stay tuned on that it makes sense that's all I had thank you guys and stay safe all right you do thanks in two next question is from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley stand by David good morning Jeff good morning Phil thanks so much for taking my question mornin' David OFFSHORE WIND YOU KNOW IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE RECENT DELAYS I WAS WONDERING IF THAT CHANGES HOW YOU'RE STRATEGIZING AROUND OTHER BIDS THAT YOU'RE PUTTING INTO FUTURE RFPs LIKE BAKING IN MORE CONTINGENCIES ANYTHING THAT MIGHT GIVE A GREATER LEVEL OF COMFORT AROUND THE ECONOMICS OF FUTURE PROJECTS THAT YOU MIGHT WIN THANK YOU DAVE FOR YOUR COMMENT AND I HOPE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE DOING WELL CERTAINLY EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION That you get you know and if this isn't just offshore wind you know if this is you know on all our business but I'll focus on offshore winds and that's the question you know every every month it goes by every quarter it goes by we gain more insight and information about construction about you know you know lots of facts about all of those things all of those things are factored into subsequent bids SO THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US YOU KNOW AS WE'RE MOVING INTO A BID RECENT BID IN NEW YORK IS DIFFERENT THAN WE HAD FROM BIDS THAT WE MADE YOU KNOW IN RHODE ISLAND OR CONNECTICUT OR MASSACHUSETTS. SO EVERY EVERY DATA POINT IS IMPORTANT TO US AND WE FACTOR THAT IN TO THE NEXT BID. SO I SAY THAT ABSOLUTELY THAT SCHEDULES AND HOW YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THE SIGHTING PROCESS AND ALL OF THAT INFORMS Um, subsequent bids, and so, I can assure you that all those things get, get, you know, up to the minute attention before a bid goes out. Okay, got it. That's helpful. And I just wanted to touch on just, O and M costs in the O and M budget. Could you remind us how you see that trajectory, just for the overall business, going forward? You've got a great track record of controlling O and M costs. So, what are the key levers? UH01 M Y UH1 R sil IH1 N Y AO1 R sil IH1 N Y UH1 R T UW1 L B IH1 L T S sil S OW1 sil DH AH0 T Y UW1 W UH1 D F OW1 K AH0 S AA1 N G OW1 IH0 NG F AO1 R W ER0 M AE1 N IH0 JH IH0 NG OW1 N EH1 M sil S IY1 Z sil DH EH1 R IH0 Z sil Y UW1 N IY1 V sil W IY1 V G AA1 T sil AH0 P IY1 P AH0 L P R AA1 S EH2 S AH0 N D sil T EH1 These processes make it more effective, you know, efficient and effective workforce. So we have still a robust, I'd say, series of technology improvements. If you, if you, I'll start off by just setting the stage. In the guidance we gave, we said that we expected an m cost to be, you know, down this year and then just for the forecast period, kind of flat going forward. WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT IT IS BY SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND WE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING MORE PRODUCTIVITY MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND TOOLS FOR OUR INDIVIDUAL LINE WORKERS AND GAS PITERS AND IN THE FIELD TO GET THEIR WORK TO UPDATE THEIR WORK THAT WE CAN THEN TAKE THAT AND AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE DRAWINGS AND FILES WE DON'T NEED YOU TO HAND IT OFF TO SOMEBODY AND SO THERE'S STILL These productivity technology changes that are happening some went in last year, some going in this year and more planned for next. So that that will be, I say, the lever the under the the underpinning for us to have the ability to continue to improve processes and take unneeded costs out of the business. Okay, great, that's helpful. Thanks so much for the call. You're welcome. Thank you, David. Next question? FROM BRAVES MILLER FROM MORNING STAR MORNING TRAVIS GOOD MORNING THANK YOU QUICK CLARIFICATION ON THE STORM COST THAT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION NUMBER IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY HOW MUCH DID YOU EXPEND IN THE QUARTER AND HOW MUCH WAS EITHER DEFERRED OR CAPITALIZED OR WILL BE PENDING THAT THE REGULATORY FILING THAT YOU MENTIONED The repeated question was, \"How much of a storm cost did we defer in both tropical and non-tropical storms? And that was across all states, but primarily in Connecticut. So that's our deferral. That would be, you know, once the storm gets to a certain level, it triggers a deferral. So we... that all is deferred storm cost right now.\" IN TERMS OF THERE ARE OTHER STORMS CERTAINLY WE HAD AH WE HAD AN ACTIVE QUARTER FOR STORMS IN GENERAL BUT THERE ARE OTHER STORMS OTHER THAN EYE AYEZ THAT DID IMPACT THE QUARTER I MEAN OUR STORM COSTS WERE UP YOU KNOW ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FOR THE QUARTER THAT WENT THROUGH YOU KNOW OUR O W N M S THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE QUARTER ITS AT THAT LEVEL AND THEN THE TWO SEVENTY FOUR OR FIVE YOU MENTIONED IS Across the system. Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up to the discussion on the Connecticut legislation. And there's some language in there, as I understood it, it's about the general assembly having some review power there. What's your thought in terms of the scope of what the general assembly, separate from pura, could do in terms of either taking back some earnings or rate changes and stuff like that, separate from pura? Well, certainly the general assembly can enact legislation that it feels is appropriate in any matter. So, you know, I do think specifically to the energy legislation that was enacted recently in New York that most, you know, things all were moved to New York. YOU KNOW, SO THE REGULATOR, SO THE REGULATOR, I GUESS I LOOK AT IT AS THE LEGISLATION WOULD PROVIDE THE INTENT, THE FRAMEWORK, THE DIRECTION, AND THEN PUERA IS THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING IT. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE ONE TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE BASED RATES. THEY'LL BE THE ONES TO INITIATE THE STORM YOU KNOW, STANDARDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND AND LOOK AT SHOULD THERE BE PENALTIES OR SHOULD THERE BE FOOD YOU KNO Duties and things like that. So I think that effectively, you know, the general assembly can certainly enact any and all legislation it feels it should and in the way that this legislation seems to have turned out was that the implementation of that legislation is in the hands of pure. Okay, so the potential for any or the risk for any kind of clawbacks would likely go through pure instead of going through the GENERAL ASSEMBLY BASED ON THAT CANNOT GET LEGISLATION THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT GREAT YEAH AS I SAY YOU KNOW THE PURAH THE DOCKETS ARE ACTIVE IN IN IT WILL BE ACTIVE OVER YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN TIME DATES THAT THE LEGISLATION HAS GIVEN PURAH SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT PURAH WILL HAVE HAVE THE PEN ON THIS BUT BUT AGAIN AS I SAY YOU KNOW LEGISLATION CAN ALWAYS BE ADOPTED IN ANY GENERAL ASSEMBLY BASED ANY AREA YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEA RED MOD AND OTHER INITIATIVES BUT FOR GENERAL RATE CASES WELL ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS IN CONNECTICUT CONNECTICUT COULD BE AN AREA THAT IS REQUIRED TO FILE BY THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK THAT'S THERE AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOMETH RELENTLESS AREA\n\nOKAY GREAT\n\nTHEN ON OFFSHORE WINDS\n\nCAN YOU JUST THINKING SHARE YOUR LATEST THINKING ON HOW BIG YOU'RE WILLING TO LET THAT BUSINESS GET YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU'RE PURSUING BEYOND THE THREE EXISTING PROJECTS ANY THINKING AS FAR AS FROM AN EARNINGS MIXED PERSPECTIVE IF THERE'S A LIMITATION OR WOULD YOU WILL PLAN TO JUST BID BID BID AND GET AS MANY PROJECTS AS YOUR LEASES W WELL I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT BIG BIG BID ISN'T OUR STRATEGY OUR STRATEGY IS TO HAVE A FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE ABOUT GROWING THAT BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF OF RETURNS THAT BENEFIT OUR SHAREHOLDERS SO JUST BY WINNING A BID YOU KNOW THAT DON'T DO IT IT HAS TO BE WE HAVE TO AND WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE In terms of the amounts that we did and the returns that we're looking for. So as long as the returns are at an appropriate level for that business, it makes sense to make the bid, win the bid, and expand the business there. The what we've said is we are tracks, what we own off the coast of or what we have access to in terms of lease areas you know. We could do about four thousand, at least four thousand megawatts of offshore wind. So it's kind of a you know, that's the maximum capability that we we have. So it's not an infinite growth type of thing. And we had indicated that when leases were available that are not in our region, that we were not interested in them. So leases in our region, like the ones that were involved in are good, but offshore lease areas are good. That's not for us in other parts of the mid-Atlantic, et cetera. So it's we're constrained by the lease area and where we're we're guided by the financial discipline to on our bids and our returns. Got it, that's really helpful. I guess I should have said, bid, bid, bid responsibly. Okay, well, that's how it goes. VERY MUCH THAT SORTS UP TODAY IF YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS PLEASE GIVE US A CALL OR SEND US AN EMAIL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING AND SEEING MANY OF YOU DURING THE VIRTUAL EYI CONFERENCE NEXT WEEK THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS CONCLUDES TODAY'S CONFERENCE THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING AND YOU MAY NOW DISCONNECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for.

INVESTMENT MARKET <INAUDIBLE> EXPECTATION HAVE BEEN REVISED DOWN TO A LINE 9% UNDER DECREASE IN GDP DURING 220 2000 AND 20 FOR <INAUDIBLE> THIS WILL BE AN ECONOMIC CONTRACTION NOT SEEN IN MANY DECADES

<INAUDIBLE> EMPLOYMENT FOLLOWING THE PAST <INAUDIBLE> YEAR ECONOMIC CRISIS BACK IN 95 AND 2000 AND 9 IT TOOK SEVEN QUARTERS FOR THE MEXICAN ECONOMY TO RECOVER ITS PREVIOUS LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HOWEVER IN THE CURRENT ONE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ECONOMY COULD RECOVER IN WITHIN A SIMILAR PERIOD OF TIME GIVEN THE DEPTH AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SHOCK AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY MEANING MEANINGFUL FISCAL PROBLEM TO AVOID DISTRIBUTE CONTRACTION IN IN ITS EMPLOYMENT WITH EXTERNAL DEMAND <INAUDIBLE> ONLY <INAUDIBLE> AND WITHOUT ANY MECHANISM TO <INAUDIBLE> RATE

ABILITY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS TRIPS VIABLE COMPENSATION AS WELL AS LIMITING BASE SALARY INCREASES AMONG OTHER IMPROVEMENTS LESS BUSINESS TRAVEL AND SALARY CAPS WOULD GREATLY LED TO A SEQUENTIAL 1.9% DECREASE IN OUR TOTAL EXPENSES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR SUCH EXPENSE CONTROLS COMBINED WITH STRONG OPERATING INCOME AND THE CONCLUSION OF OUR THREE-YEAR INVESTMENT PLAN

VERY GRADUAL RECOVERY OF THE ECONOMY WHICH HAS OBVIOUS IMPLICATIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WE EXPECT OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO WILL LIKELY BE DRIVEN BY COMMERCIAL LOANS MAINLY MEDIUM AND LARGE CORPORATES GOVERNMENT LOANS AS WELL AS MORTGAGES THE CONSUMER BOARD RECOVER VERY GRADUALLY AND THIS WILL DEPEND ON THE SPEED OF THE RENTAL TURNAROUND IN EMPLOYMENT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AS WELL AS BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE ALTHOUGH VISIBILITY AND ASSET QUALITY IS LIMITED DUE TO THE PAYMENT HOLIDAY PROGRAM WHICH HAVE BEEN TALKING UM AND TAKING RAPID AND DECISIVE ACTION IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE LOAN BOOK OUR RECOVERIES PLAN WHICH INCLUDES A VERY DETAILED AND IN DEEP ANALYSIS OF EACH CUSTOMER'S SITUATION IS ALLOWING US TO PREEMPTIVELY AND SWIFTLY UH PREPARE THE BANK FOR COMPLICATED QUARTERS AHEAD IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE ALLOCATED A LARGE NUMBER OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES AND BRANCHES INVOLVED IN CARRYING OUT THE RECOVERY STRATEGY WE WILL CONTINUE FOCUSING ON ENHANCING CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND ON CROSS-SELLING NON-CREDIT PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT NON-INTEREST INCOME WE ALSO REMAIN COMMITTED IN TO MAKING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THE BANK TRANSFORMATION MAINLY IN IT AND DIGITALIZATION BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR EFFICIENCIES IN OTHER LINES WITH THE STRICT COST CONTROL IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE BOTTOM LINE AND FINALLY REST ASSURED THAT OUR BANKS IS OPERATING FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH WITH ROBUST CAPITAL AND HIGH LIQUIDITY LEVELS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO OVERCOME THIS COMPLICATED BUT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE TEMPORARY CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE NOW READY TO TACKLE QUESTIONS PLEASE OPERATOR LET'S GO AHEAD THANK YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE SIGNAL BY PRESSING STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU'RE USING A SPEAKER PHONE PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR MUTE FUNCTION IS TURNED OFF TO ALLOW YOUR SIGNAL TO REACH OUR EQUIPMENT AGAIN PRESS STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE ASK ONE QUESTION AND A FOLLOW-UP IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS PLEASE RE-ENTER THE QUEUE WE'LL PAUSE FOR JUST A MOMENT TO ALLOW EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNAL FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU OUR FIRST QUESTION IS FROM THE LINE OF JASON MOLLIN FROM SCOTIABANK PLEASE GO AHEAD HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH UH MY QUESTION IS ON THE OPERATING OUTLOOK UM THE DISCLOSURE IS EXCELLENT IT'S IT'S ALWAYS BEEN I LIKE THE WAY YOU PRESENTED IT UM ON SLIDE 19 WE WE CAN LOOK AT THE THE MAIN UM THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR THE OPERATING INCOME AND CLEARLY AS YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT MARKET RELATED REVENUE WAS VERY STRONG WELL ABOVE UH HISTORICAL LEVELS ABOUT 14% OF THE TOTAL OPERATING INCOME COMPARED TO LET'S SAY THREE OR 4% IN THE PAST UH THESE ARE DIFFERENT TIMES BUT HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT EFFICIENCY GOING FORWARD YOU TALKED ABOUT COST CONTROL WE SAW THAT UM IF YOU CAN JUST GIVE US UM A GENERAL SENSE YOU YOU MENTION UH YOU THERE ARE CERTAIN COSTS YOUR YOU CAN CONTROL AND YOU ARE CONTROLLING CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE A- AN OPPORTUNITY TO RATIONALIZE PHYSICAL BRANCH NETWORK UM AFTER THE INVESTMENTS YOU YOU MADE UM WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY GOING FORWARD THE THE DYNAMIC IS IS QUITE SKEWED FROM ALL OF THESE MOVING PARTS THE VERY HIGH TRADING UM AND AND THE LOW THE LOW REVENUES GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON THANK YOU THANK YOU LOOK I MEAN I DID NOT SET I MEAN UH AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NUMBERS BASICALLY WE HAVE UH DECREASED UH THE OPERATION COST OF THE BANK QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I MEAN NOT TRAVELING AND NOT UH DOING MANY THINGS BASICALLY HAVE REDUCED NATURALLY THE COST BUT WE HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY STRICT IN THE IN NEW PROJECTS AND NEW SITUATIONS I MEAN WE ARE BASICALLY FOCUSING ALL OUR EXPENSES IN IT TO SUPPORT THE BACKBONE AND TO BE READY FOR WHAT'S COMING UM SO IN THAT SENSE THAT'S ONE OF YOUR PRIORITY SECONDLY WE ARE TAKING A LOOK UH UH AND WE'RE DOING A DEEP DIVE IN TERMS OF UH ALL OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND UM WE'RE NOT GONNA GET TAKE I MEAN UM WRONG DECISIONS IN TERMS OF CLOSING DOWN A BIG NUMBER OF UH OF UM BRANCHES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE RATIONALLY LOOKING AT EACH OF THE MICRO-MARKETS THAT WE HAVE DIVIDED THE COUNTRY INTO AND WE WILL DECIDE UM WITH EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN THERE SO UH BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY STRICT IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE GROWTH OF THE PAST UH FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IN TERMS OF BRANCHES WE ACTUALLY HAVE DECREASED THE NUMBER OF TOTAL BRANCHES WE HAVE JUST UH WE HAVE BEEN VERY INTELLIGENT IN THE WAY WE HAVE MANAGED THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS UPGRADED UH THE CURRENT AND THE MOST IMPORTANT BRANCHES WHICH WE ARE GOING TO BASICALLY BE UH TAKING A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME THAN THE TIME THAT WE UH WERE THINKING OF OF UM UPGRADING ALL THE BRANCHES THAT ARE NOT UP TO THE STANDARD SO THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY RATIONALIZE ALL UH ALL UH ALL EXPENDING AND DO IT ON WHERE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IS BASICALLY THE IT PLATFORM AND THE DIGITALIZATION OF THE BANK SO IN THAT SENSE WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY CONCENTRATED ON THAT UH WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT I MEAN GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE THE BANK UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE BASICALLY WORKING FROM HOME UH YOU BASICALLY GET TO UNDERSTAND JUST ACTUALLY HOW REALLY HOW MUCH PEOPLE DO YOU NEED UH WHAT CAN YOU RATIONALIZE ET CETERA SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FROM US IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY UH RESPONSIBLE IN THE WAY WE MANAGE THAT AND UH CONCENTRATE ON THOSE POINTS WE ARE WORKING CURRENTLY ON THAT PLAN WE ARE WORKING ON OUR THREE-YEAR PLAN AND UH AND UH WE'RE BASICALLY INCLUDING ALL THESE UH INWARD SOLUTION MAYBE UH AS A FOLLOW UP MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> JUST SOME COMMENTS ON WHAT YOU'D SEEN UH THROUGHOUT YOUR PEERS AND THE SANTANDER GROUP IN IN THE REGION OR ELSEWHERE ARE THERE OTHER THINGS YOU THINK THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO MEXICO THAT COULD HELP UM PERHAPS ON THE SIDE OF THE BANKING SYSTEM PERHAPS IN TERMS OPERATIONALLY OR IT OR OR ANY FACTORS AT ALL THANK YOU WH- WHAT WE'RE DOING BASICALLY IS FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING UH THESE THE PLATFORMS ET CETERA BUT WE'RE DOING IT WE'RE DOING IT UH NOW INSTEAD OF EACH COUNTRY BASICALLY DEVELOPING THE PLATFORMS WE ARE DOING IT UH TOGETHER SO THAT BASICALLY IS GOING TO HELP OUT QUITE A LOT SO UH IT'S NOT MEXICO FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IN MEXICO WE'RE DEVELOPING THE NEW SUPER APP AND THE NEW SUPER APP IS GOING TO BE USED IN THE IN IN IN IN ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE ONBOARDING UH FOR SMES WE ARE USING THE ONE THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED AT THE IN EUROPE SO ALL THOSE TYPE TYPE OF THINGS ARE GOING TO HELP US OUT BASICALLY IN REDUCING OUR COST UH FOR THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING AND WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER MUCH MORE WITHIN THE GROUP IN ORDER TO DO THAT SO YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT I MEAN IN THE COST OF UH BASICALLY DEVELOPING THINGS AND IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF OUR UH UM SISTER BANKS SO SO SO THOSE T- GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH <CROSSTALK> IMPLEMENTING AT THIS TI- AT THIS POINT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT YOU'RE WELCOME TOO THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF JORGE KURI FROM MORGAN STANLEY PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UM I I WONDERED WHAT'S ABOUT NET INTEREST MARGIN UM YOU YOU YOU POINTED OUT THAT YOU EXPECT FURTHER UM COMPLICATIONS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS GIVEN UH FALLING GRADES AND WEAK UH LOAN DEMANDS AND UM MIXED DETERIORATION UM AS AS YOU LOOK AT 2021 UH IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU SAID ON N- NOT A STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY NEXT YEAR AND WITH AVERAGE RATES NEXT YEAR BEING M- M- MUCH LOWER THAN 2020 IF IF INDEED RATES END UP AT 4% AND W- WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION FOR THE NET INTEREST MARGIN NEXT YEAR AND FOR NII I- I- IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE ANOTHER YEAR OF UM NII COMPRESSION AND AND TO TO WHAT EXTENT THAT CAN BE OFFSET UH ELSEWHERE IN THE PML AND AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS ON UM THE ON THE COVERAGE RATIO AND I AND I KNOW THAT BANKS YOU YOU KNOW THE THE BANKS NORMALLY DON'T TARGET A COVERAGE RATIO I GET IT UM BUT BUT EVIDENTLY THE THE THE SIZE OF YOUR RESERVES UH HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO THE SIZE OF YOUR LOGBOOK THE SIZE OF YOUR MPLS AND THE SIZE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOANS THAT ARE ON THEIR RESTRUCTURING UM AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR CAPEX RATIO AT 100 138% IT LOOKS LOW RELATIVE TO WHERE BANORTE ENDED UP AT 201% AND <UNK> 185% SO I I WONDER YOU KNOW WHY WHY W- W- WHY NOT JUST YOU KNOW TAKE A MUCH BIGGER CHARGE ON PROVISIONS THIS QUARTER UM YOU KNOW EVIDENTLY THERE IS THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AHEAD AND UM THE MORE THE BETTER A- AND AND SO IS THIS PIECEMEAL JUST GOING TO YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY PUT MORE PRESSURE ON YOUR EARNINGS GOING FORWARD RATHER JUST YOU KNOW TAKE A REALLY BIG ONE SWOOP AND YOU KNOW R- RAISE YOUR COVERAGE TO NORTH OF 200% UM AND AND IS THAT LIKELY MAYBE SOMETHING YOU WILL DO IN THE THIRD QUARTER THANK YOU UM LOOK JORGE I WILL ASK UM THIS IS HECTOR I WILL ASK UM I WILL ANSWER THE FIRST PART AND THEN I WILL ASK DIDIER TO COMPLETE ON THE ON THE BASIC NUMBERS OF NII OKAY UM I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I MEAN IF IF YOU SAW THE PRESENTATION WE ARE BASICALLY CHANGING THE MIX OF UM OF THE CREDIT LOAN PORTFOLIO OKAY FIRST OF ALL I MEAN UM IF YOU HAVE SEEN I MEAN UH WE HAVE DECREASED QUITE A LOT OUR EXPOSURE UNFORTUNATELY TO SMES GIVEN THE LACK OF UH WARRANTIES FROM THE GOVERNMENT FROM NAFINSA OKAY SO UH THE PORTFOLIO HAS DROPPED ALMOST 10% SO IN THAT SENSE UH THAT BASICALLY IS A HIGH-YIELD PORTFOLIO WHICH UM IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO SHRINK UNLESS WE WE SEE SOME WARRANTIES FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND YOU IF YOU SEE OUR PORTFOLIO WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT WE HAVE LIKE 62% OF IT ALREADY WARRANTED BY NAFINSA OKAY THE CORRESPONDING VOLUME THIS BASICALLY GOES TO ANSWER YOUR SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF UH THE AMOUNT OF UH THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES THAT WE HAVE DONE UH THEN YOU SEE THAT UH ALSO WE SEE THAT FOR EXAMPLE CONSUMER CREDIT AND UH CONSUMER LOANS ARE GOING TO DECREASE AS WELL SO THE MIX IS COMPLETELY CHANGING THAT WE'RE GOING THE I MEAN WE'RE GOING BASICALLY BACK TO WHERE WE WERE WH- WHERE WE WERE FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD MUCH MORE EXPOSURE TO CORPORATES AND TO MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES THAN TO CONSUMER LOANS REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE THAT DIFFERENT MIX OKAY SO THAT'S WHY NII IS SHRINKING ON THE OTHER SIDE WHAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN DOING IT WAS WITH PRICING AND WE ARE VERY S- STRICT ON PRICING RISK OKAY SO UM WE'VE BEEN INCREASING THE MARGIN ON THE CORPORATE LOANS QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO THAT FACT YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE BASICALLY LOOKING AT THE THE RISK THAT WE ARE TAKING AND UH WE ARE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE RATINGS OF THOSE COMPANIES AND WE ARE PRICING RISK ACCORDINGLY OKAY THIS IS NOT A SITUATION IN WHICH WE WANT TO SPEND THE PORT- CREDIT PORTFOLIO JUST TO EXPAND IT WE ARE BASICALLY DOING IT JUST TO THE COMPANIES THAT WE BELIEVE THAT HAVE A FUTURE AND THAT WILL BE THERE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND BOTH WE'RE PRICING THE RISK ACCORDINGLY SO IN THAT SENSE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE US GOING TOWARDS THAT ALSO THE OTHER CONCENTRATION IS MORTGAGES WHICH WE UH WHICH WE BELIEVE I MEAN THERE IS A SECTOR STILL UH OF GROWTH I MEAN AS YOU KNOW THERE IS A LACK OF A OR OR A BIG DEFICIT IN TERMS OF HOMES IN MEXICO SO WE BELIEVE THERE IS STILL A PART OF THE POPULATION THAT CAN AFFORD A MORTGAGE UH MORTGAGES PENETRATION IN MEXICO WAS QUITE LOW VERSUS THE REST AND ALSO LOAN PENETRATION IS QUITE LOW SO WE BELIEVE THERE IS A CHANCE TO TO TO CONTINUE TO PENETRATE THAT SECTOR AND MAYBE ON PAYROLLS ON SOME SITUATIONS WE WILL BASICALLY BE UH ALSO LENDING IN THAT IN THE IN THAT PART I MEAN AND AUTO LOANS ALSO WE HAVE SEEN SOME INTERESTING UH DEVELOPMENT THERE WITH VERY CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO IT SO IN THAT SENSE THE MIX OF THE PORTFOLIO IS GOING TO CHANGE AND PROBABLY DIDIER CAN LET YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW DO WE SEE NII EVOLVING IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WERE ASKING IN TERMS OF UM THE RESERVES UH WE MAYBE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN DOING RESERVES ACCORDINGLY WH- TO WHAT WE BELIEVE WE ARE DOING UH IN TERMS OF UH UH HOW THE PORTFOLIO IS UH IS UH BEHAVING AT THIS POINT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THE PORTFOLIO NOT ON PAYMENTS HOLIDAYS IS BEHAVING MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN WE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS GOING TO T- THAT IT WAS GOING TO TURN ACTUALLY I'M QUITE SURPRISED ABOUT IT HOPEFULLY UH IT CONTINUES THAT WAY BUT IN THAT SENSE WE ARE BASICALLY BEING- IN MY OPINION UH BEING VERY RESPONSIBLE IN THE AMOUNT OF UH OF RESERVES THAT WE ARE MAKING AT THIS POINT ALSO WE HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB UH WITH THE DATA UH HOPES THAT WE HAVE IN REVIEWING UM THE PORTFOLIO ON HOLIDAYS AND THAT PORTFOLIO IS BEING DIVIDED AS WE SAID IN 36 CLUSTERS OKAY THESE CLUSTERS HAVE BEEN DIVIDED UPON RI- UPON THE AMOUNT OF RISK THAT WE HAVE ON EACH PARTICULAR SITUATION AND IN SOME OF THESE PORTFOLIOS UH EVEN BEFORE THE PAYMENT HOLIDAY ENDS WE ARE ALREADY TALKING TO CLIENTS AND DISCUSSING THE WAY UH UH THAT THAT WE COULD GET PAID ON THOSE PARTICULAR SITUATIONS BECAUSE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT WHOEVER GETS PAID FIRST IS THE ONE THAT IS THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO GET PAID SO WE ARE BASICALLY BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE ON THAT SENSE TO TALK TO OUR CLIENTS AND BASICALLY TRYING TO GET THAT AND TO RECOVER THE PORTFOLIO AS YOU HAVE SEEN 55% OF OUR BRANCHES HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO UH COLLECTING BRANCHES I MEAN UH TO BASICALLY THIS UH UH WE'RE DEDICATING OUR EXECUTIVES TO COLLECT WE HAVE DIVIDED THEM UP IN THE SECTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN THAT OR THAT ARE GOING TO BE HIT THE MOST IN THE ECONOMY SO IN THAT SENSE I BELIEVE WE'RE VERY WELL PREPARED ALTHOUGH I MEAN OR NEVERTHELESS UH IS ALWAYS I MEAN A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO GO OVERBOARD AND WE BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT UH THE RIGHT APPROACH IS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE MADE BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS EVOLUTION WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY CONSERVATIVE IN THE WAY WE MANAGE THAT OKAY UM DIDIER I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMPLETE ABSOLUTELY EH ABSOLUTELY HECTOR I WOULD LIKE TO TO COMPLEMENT ON WHAT YOU MENTIONED EH EH GREAT TALKING TO YOU JORGE LONG TIME NO SPEAK UM EH IN TERMS OF UH EH NIMS YOU KNOW EH DEFINITELY YOU KNOW AS WE LAID OUT IN THE PRESENTATION WE SEE SIGNIFICANT UH PRESSURES AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION THAT I THINK IT'S IT'S EH IT'S QUITE RELEVANT UM THE THE SPEED AT WHICH INTEREST RATES HAVE COME DOWN IN MEXICO IS IS IS IS SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW JUST IN THIS QUARTER EH THE AVERAGE OF THE REFERENCE UH REFERENCE RATE CAME DOWN 123 BASIS POINTS THAT'S THE THE THE FASTEST DECLINE THAT EH WE'VE SEEN EH IN THE RECENT HISTORY WE WE DIDN'T SAW A A AN INCREASE OF THOSE EH YOU KNOW OF THAT MAGNITUDE WHEN EH WHEN INTEREST RATES WERE WERE COMING UP OKAY SO THAT'S ONE THING TO HAVE IN MIND THE THE THE IMPACT THAT YOU SEE IN THIS QUARTER I THINK IS IS PROBABLY MOST <INAUDIBLE> THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN A RELATIVE BASIS RELATIVE TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR AND RELATIVE TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR OKAY UM ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT WHEN INTEREST RATES WERE CLOSE TO 4% AS WE PROBABLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED YOU KNOW ARE CLOSE TO 5% YOU KNOW AND THIS WAS THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF 2016 UH I THINK THAT EH THE THE NUMBER THAT THAT WE REPORTED THE 448% IN THIS QUARTER YOU KNOW HAVE TO DO WITH WITH WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO YOU KNOW THE SPEED AT WHICH INTEREST RATES EH EH CAME DOWN AND ALSO ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE THE THE THE CHANGE IN MIX ON OUR LOAN SIDE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE EH THE INCOME FROM EH INTEREST RATES COMING DOWN WE WE INCREASED OUR PAY INTEREST SECURITIES PORTFOLIO SIGNIFICANTLY YOU KNOW AND THOSE ARE YOU KNOW LOWER MARGIN UH EH ASSETS RELATIVE TO THE THE THE LOAN PORTFOLIO JUST TO YOU KNOW SHARE WITH YOU UH WE'VE BOUGHT IN THIS ACCOUNT YOU KNOW BOTH DIVESTMENT AND MATURITIES THE OVERALL GROWTH IN OUR PAY INVESTMENT AND SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS 96 BILLION OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS SO UM WHAT WE EXPECT COMING DOWN THE ROAD YOU KNOW PAY FOR THE REST OF 2020 AND EH FOR NEXT YEAR I THINK THAT UH YOU KNOW HAVING SAID THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY YOU KNOW I THINK THAT PROBABLY THE THE MOST SEVERE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF NAME ARE THE ONES THAT WE SAW THIS QUARTER YOU KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW 10 TO 15 BASIS POINTS EH PROBABLY FURTHER ADJUSTMENT OR SLIGHT EH IMPROVEMENT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR OKAY AND NEXT YEAR I THINK THAT EH WE'LL WE'LL PROBABLY GET TO SEE NAMES SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE TO THE ONES THAT WE WERE SEEING EH EH IN THIS QUARTER NOW IN REGARDING TO THE CURRENT RATIO YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT WE DON'T TARGET <INAUDIBLE> THAT THAT'S UH RESULTING NUMBER AND ALSO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU EH MAKE REFERENCE TO YOU KNOW OUR NUMBER 138% LOOKS LOW RELATIVE TO <INAUDIBLE> THE FIRST QUARTER THIS YEAR THEY HAD 140% UH IN THIS IN THE SECOND QUARTER THEY DID AS WE DID ALSO <INAUDIBLE> INCREASE THE PROVISIONS FOR DIFFERENT TO US THEY MADE A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE OFF 4.6 BILLION PESOS SO THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEIR INCREASED TO 200% UH I'M PROBABLY JUST ELABORATING ELABORATING EH THE MORE ON WHAT INFORMATION YOU KNOW UH THE LETTER OF PROVISIONS THAT WE HAVE ARE IN LINE WITH THE EXPECTED LOSSES THAT WE WE ESTIMATE UM YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE A OR YOU MIGHT QUESTION WHETHER WE YOU KNOW THIS IS ENOUGH OR NOT YOU KNOW AND LET ME SHARE WITH YOU THAT YOU KNOW UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES WE WE HAVE DEFINITELY DONE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OR SCENARIO ANALYSIS OKAY SO IF <INAUDIBLE> RECOVERY IN THE MEXICAN ECONOMY YOU KNOW WE HAVE WITH THESE QUARTERS EH PROVISIONS WE ARE YOU KNOW MORE THAN COVERED YOU KNOW FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR NOW DO WE THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A TYPE RECOVERY IN THE MEXICAN ECONOMY I DON'T THINK SO YOU KNOW IT'S VERY YOU KNOW LOW PROBABILITY YOU KNOW NOW WE HAVE A <INAUDIBLE> YOU KNOW THE THE OUR LEAVE OF PROVISIONS ACCORDING TO OTHER TYPES OF <INAUDIBLE> MORE A U TYPE OR AN ADVERSE SCENARIO HAVING AGILITY CONTRACTION OF 12.5% YOU KNOW AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THESE QUARTERS PROVISIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR THERE COULD BE CLOSE TO 60 TO 75% DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE <INAUDIBLE> EH CONTRACTION THAT THAT YOU ASSUME OKAY EH EH SO SO THERE SHOULD BE UH DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN EXPECTED LOSSES AND PROVISIONS AND THE PROVISIONS THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD WE THINK THAT WITH INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE UH ARE QUITE STRONG TO COVER YOU KNOW EXPECTED LOSSES IF THE THE THE ECONOMY ENDS UP CONTRACTING MORE THAN WE ARE EXPECTING RIGHT NOW DEFINITELY WE WILL NEED TO PROVIDE A PROVISION OF PROVISIONS SOMETHING THAT I I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO EH YET YOU KNOW THE THE <INAUDIBLE> BANK <INAUDIBLE> UM THEY RELEASED IN THE STABILITY FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT PUBLISHED A FEW WEEKS AGO AN ANALYSIS REGARDING NPL FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND THEY WHAT THEY DID IS LOOK AT INFORMATION FROM THE ENTIRE BANKING SYSTEM FROM THE LAST 20 YEARS AND THEY PAY YOU KNOW USING AN ECONOMETRIC MODEL THEY THEY ESTIMATED YOU KNOW WHERE ARE THE CRITICAL VARIABLES THAT DETERMINE NPLS AND THEY BREAK DOWN THE THE THE PORTFOLIO IN CONSUMER LOANS IN MORTGAGE LOANS AND IN CORPORATES SO ONCE THEY DETERMINE YOU KNOW THESE ECONOMETRIC MODEL THEN THEY PROVIDED A YOU KNOW A SHOCK WITH THE VARIABLES THAT WE'RE SEEING UH LATELY AND THEY ESTIMATED HOW MUCH UH NPL RATIOS RATE FOR THE ENTIRE BANKING SYSTEM UM FOR CONSUMER LOANS THAT WOULD IMPLY A 32% INCREASE FOR MORTGAGES 19% AND FOR CORPORATES ALSO 32% SO WHEN YOU DO THAT MATH AND YOU BREAK DOWN YOU KNOW BY TYPES OF LOANS BY TYPE OF BANK YOU GET TO SEE YOU KNOW THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BALLPARK ESTIMATE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY EVERY SINGLE BANK HAS DIFFERENT PRACTICES IN ORIGINATION PRACTICES AND RECOVERIES AND SO ON BUT YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE IN TERMS OF USING THIS MODEL YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU YOU WILL EXPECT AT EACH BANK WITH WITH PROVISION OKAY THANK YOU THANK HECTOR FOR THE UH DETAILED RESPONSES WE WILL TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM THE LINE OF ERNESTO <INAUDIBLE> FROM BANK OF AMERICA PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING HECTOR THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY UH MY FIRST QUESTION IS A FOLLOW UP ON THE PREVENTIVE PROVISIONS OF 349 PESOS SO YOU THINK THIS LEVEL OF PROVISIONS WILL BE ENOUGH FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR OR ARE YOU GOING TO EVALUATE TO CREATE MORE DEPENDING ON THE BEHAVIOR OF PAYMENTS UP TO THE RELIEF PROGRAM AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS UH A DIFFERENT ONE BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE EXPOSURE TO EITHER MEXICO ON THE CHAPTER 11 OR <INAUDIBLE> THAT HAS RESTRUCTURED LOANS WITH THE BANKS FOR ABOUT A YEAR BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN NOT DISCLOSE YOUR EXPOSURE SO MAYBE IF YOU CAN REMIND US HOW MUCH OF YOUR LOAN BOOK IS EXPOSED TO AIRLINES AND HOW MUCH TO FOOD AND BEVERAGE AND IF THERE IS A SECTOR THAT IS CONCERNING YOU AND FINALLY UH MY MY LAST QUESTION IS UM COMPETITION IN MORTGAGE LOANS UH WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT BANKS REDUCING THE INTEREST RATES UH OF MORTGAGES IN LIGHT OF THE LOWER RATES SO HOW HAS BEEN YOUR STRATEGY TO ATTRACT MORE MORE MORTGAGE CLIENTS AND HOW UH COMPETITIVE IS YOUR INTEREST RATE THANK YOU THANK YOU ERNESTO UH LET ME LET ME START AND THEN MAYBE I WILL COMPLEMENT FIRST OF ALL ON THE <INAUDIBLE> OF PROVISION LIKE UM I HAVE SPOKEN MANY TIMES TO MY CRO AND HE BASICALLY TELLS ME THAT UH WHEN I ASK YOU AND ASK HIM THE SAME QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME AT THIS POINT AND HE SAYS LOOK I DON'T HAVE MY CRYSTAL BALL UM SO CLEAR AND IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHAT WE'RE DOING I MEAN WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST JOB IN IN BASICALLY REVIEWING THE PORTFOLIO WE DO LIKE THAT WE SEE THE RATE THAT WE REVIEW THE THE BEHAVIOR AND WE'RE BASICALLY TRYING TO BE AS CONSERVATIVE AS WE CAN IN ORDER TO MANAGE IT SO UM AND IF WE SEE THAT THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT I MEAN THE PAYMENT SHOCK COMES IN THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST WE'RE PREPARING FOR NEXT WEEK ACTUALLY WHEN THE FIRST LOANS THAT WENT INTO THE HOLIDAY START UM TO TO MATURE AND WE WE SEE THAT WE SEE HOW THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO IS AND THEN WE'LL TAKE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE OUR NUMBERS UH RIGHT AS UH I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE PROVISIONS AS SOON AS THEY COME IF UH NEEDED OKAY AND THE SECOND POINT IN MEXICO YES AND AND <INAUDIBLE> WE DO HAVE UH EXPOSURE TO THEM NOTHING THAT WE CANNOT CONTROL OR NOTHING TOO BIG FOR THE SIZE OF THE BANK I MEAN OUR TOP EXPOSURE TO AIRLINES UM IS NOT BIG I MEAN COMPARED TO THE TOP OF THE HEIGHTS OF THE PORTFOLIO I WOULD SAY EH PROBABLY <INAUDIBLE> IT'S NOT BIG IT'S NOT VERY SIGNIFICANT VERSUS THE SIZE OF THE BANK AND UH WE HAVE LOANS OR PROVISIONS ALREADY ON SOME <INAUDIBLE> TO MEXICO SO WE CAN TELL YOU THAT IN IN THE PROVISIONS THAT WE MAKE SOME OF THEM ARE MADE TO FOR THE EXPOSURE WHICH IS NOT RELEVANT IN TERMS OF <INAUDIBLE> YES WE DO HAVE EXPOSURE TO THEM ALSO NOT I MEAN NOT SIGNIFICANT AND WE ARE BASICALLY IN THOSE STRUCTURE AND PROCESS AS OF NOW AND UH WE SEE THAT THE COMPANY CAN RECOVER UH FAIRLY I MEAN I DON'T SEE THAT <INAUDIBLE> IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION <INAUDIBLE> UNFORTUNATELY IN FRONT OF ME AND WE CAN BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE <INAUDIBLE> IN TERMS OF THE COMPETITION OF MORTGAGE LOANS UM IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT WHAT WE DO UH UH WE CANNOT IMPORTANT DIFFERENTIATION IN TERMS OF HOW WE DO MORTGAGES VERSUS OUR COMPETITION IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT <INAUDIBLE> FEES IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROTOTYPE NOBODY HAS REPLICATED IN THE MEXICAN MARKET I MEAN SOME OF THE OTHER BANKS BASICALLY HAVE TRIED TO DO <INAUDIBLE> WHAT WE ARE DOING <INAUDIBLE> THE BEST RATE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET BUT IN ORDER TO GET THE RATE UH RATE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET WHICH IS SEVEN POINTS 75% FOR A 15 YEAR MORTGAGE YOU HAVE TO BASICALLY TURN INTO TURN FIRST INTO YOUR MOST IMPORTANT BANK TO YOUR NUMBER BANK NUMBER ONE BANK BUT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT RATE YOU HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS WITH US THAT BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR PAYROLL YOU HAVE TO DIRECT MAYBE YOU YOU <INAUDIBLE> YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR INSURANCE YOU HAVE TO SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE RATE IN THAT REGARD WHAT HAPPENS IS EVEN IF THE LOAN IS AT 7.75 AND WE'RE ALSO VERY CAUTIOUS IN THE LOAN VALUE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT THAT LOAN THAT'S WHY PRECISELY I WAS EXPLAINING IN THE PRESENTATION THAT THAT'S WHY OUR <INAUDIBLE> FOR MORTGAGE IS 37% LARGER THAN THE REST SO WE GO DIRECTLY TO THE MORT- TO THE WEALTHY PEOPLE OKAY TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE BEST SITUATION RIGHT NOW SO WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PORTFOLIO IS MORE RESILIENT IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AND ALSO THAT UM WE GET THE BEST CLIENT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT BASICALLY CAN ACHIEVE THIS RATE AND CAN ACHIEVE THESE AND HAVE THESE CHARACTERISTICS TO ACT IN THIS TYPE OF ROLE SO THAT'S WHY THE THE THE PORTFOLIO WE BELIEVE IS GONNA BEHAVE WELL AND IS GOING TO BE MANAGED UM OR IS GOING BE UM BEHAVE IN A NICE IN A NICE WAY DUE TO THAT FACT OKAY AND WE HAVE SEEN THE WAY THE PORTFOLIO HAS PERFORMED AND WE SEE THAT THE PERFORMANCE IS ACCORDING TO OUR EXPECTATIONS GIVEN THE VERY COMPLICATED CIRCUMSTANCES OKAY SO IN THAT REGARD I MEAN THERE IS COMPETITION I MEAN THERE ARE SOME BANKS I MEAN A COUPLE OF BANKS HAVE TRIED TO COME IN AND AND BASICALLY COMPETE WITH US HEAD TO HEAD IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATIONS AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEMS THAT WE SEND TO THE MARKET THEN WE CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER PROTOTYPE <INAUDIBLE> THE <INAUDIBLE> BASICALLY HAS A PARTICULAR AND HAS EVERYTHING INCLUDED IN THE RATE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FEES ANY COMMISSIONS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY ANCILLARY COSTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT PARTICULAR THING IS FOR PEOPLE THAT I MEAN THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS UNDER THE TABLE AND THAT WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR IT'S COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT TO THE CLIENT AND THAT IS ABOVE 9% AS A RATE AND UH AND THAT'S FOR A DIFFICULT DIFFERENT TYPE OF CLIENT SO WE HAVE A CHINESE MENU FOR EVERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF <INAUDIBLE> UH WHAT WE DO AND AND FOR EXAMPLE <INAUDIBLE> FOR A DIFFERENT SECTOR THAT IS MUTUAL THAT IS BASICALLY CLIENTS WITH LOWER TICKET AND UM WELL THERE ARE SOME OF THESE CLIENTS ARE VERY GOOD AND UH HAVE VERY GOOD CREDIT QUALITY AND UH THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDED TO COMPETE IN THAT SECTOR I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OR NOT PLEASE BE A COMPLEMENT SURE HECTOR UM EH REGARDING YOUR FIRST FIRST QUESTION ERNESTO UH IT WAS AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED UNITING <INAUDIBLE> ON THE YOU KNOW HOW SEVERE IS THE CONTRACTION THIS YEAR YOU KNOW AND HOW THAT IMPACTS THE CAPACITY FOR CLIENTS TO TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS WE THINK THAT EVENTUALLY IF THERE'S UH YOU KNOW A U TYPE RECOVERY AND GDP CONTRACTING SOMEWHERE AROUND 10-12 % THEN WE HAVE MADE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS QUARTER MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT WE REQUIRE AND THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW 60-75 % OF WHAT WE REQUIRE YOU KNOW WITH INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW OKAY BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON HOW THIS EVOLVES AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE CLOSELY MONITORING EH YOU KNOW HOW OUR CLIENTS ARE ARE BEHAVING OKAY NOW ON YOUR SECOND QUESTION REGARDING THE EXPOSURE THAT YOU HAVE TO MEXICAN <INAUDIBLE> EH YOUR OBVIOUSLY FOR REASONS WE CANNOT DISCLOSE THOSE BUT WE CAN EH REASSURE YOU THAT THESE TWO EXPOSURES THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT WITHIN OUR TOP 10 EXPOSURES EH TO MENTION WE HAVE ALREADY PROVISIONS PARTIALLY EXPOSURE WITH MEXICO THAT'S CLOSE TO 45% OF THE EXPOSURE THAT WE HAVE THAT IS NOT MATERIAL OKAY AND I DON'T HAVE WITH ME THE BREAKDOWN IN TERMS OF FOOD AND BEVERAGE THE BREAKDOWN THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW IT'S MORE UH THE ONE THAT IS USED MORE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES AND DO NOT HAVE THAT DETAIL BUT EH FOR SURE WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THAT THIS IS SUPER HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM BRIAN <UNK> FROM CITIBANK PLEASE GO AHEAD UH EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTION BEFORE MY QUESTION I WANTED TO MAKE A <INAUDIBLE> THAT <INAUDIBLE> CAPABILITY DO SO <INAUDIBLE> WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE SORRY <CROSSTALK> I THINK THAT'S 40% RIGHT 40% THANK YOU AND AND NOW FOR MY QUESTION UH YOU KNOW <INAUDIBLE> QUALITY AND YOU MENTIONED <INAUDIBLE> PORTFOLIO HAS A LARGE DEGREE OF <INAUDIBLE> UH MY QUESTION IS COULD YOU <INAUDIBLE> AND THE <INAUDIBLE> WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING IN

THERE'S JUST ONE LOAN THAT YOU CONTINUE PAYING THAT'S THAT'S MORTGAGES AND PROBABLY CREDIT CARDS ARE EH YOU KNOW AT THE BOTTOM OF EH YOUR PAY PRIORITIES YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE EH EH TROUBLE THE NPLS

YOU KNOW COST OF RISK BY WAY OF EH EH THE PROVISIONS THAT EH WE'RE TAKING IT'S CLOSE TO 11% SO I DON'T KNOW HECTOR IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO IF PERCHANCE YOU WOULD LIKE TO TO FURTHER COMPLEMENT ON THIS THIS IS THE OPERATOR MR CHAVEZ' LINE HAS GONE IDLE I WILL TRY TO RECONNECT HIM AT THIS TIME WOULD WE LIKE TO TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION EH SURE THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM TITO LABARTA FROM GOLDMAN SACHS HI GOOD MORNING UH THANK YOU FOR THE CALL AND TAKING THE QUESTIONS UM ONE QUESTION ON THE THE MARKET RELATED INCOME I KNOW YOU TALKED YOU KNOW THE BIG SPIKE IN THE QUARTER BUT DO DO YOU THINK THAT GOES BACK TO NORMAL ALREADY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OR DO YOU THINK THAT CAN REMAIN ELEVATED ELEVATED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME JUST TO GET I KNOW IT'S HARD TO PREDICT BUT <INAUDIBLE> MARKET RELATED INCOME GOING FORWARD AND IF I CAN ASK JUST ONE FOLLOW UP ON ON THE PROVISION UM YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND GIVEN THIS <INAUDIBLE> YOU KIND OF FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE YOU ARE BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF RISK BEFORE THIS QUARTER HAD BEEN AROUND 2.6 2.7 YOU KNOW BARRING ANY CHANGES IN THE SCENARIO THAT YOU SEE RIGHT NOW IS THAT 2.6 2.7 WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT SORT OF GOING FORWARD AS WELL AGAIN BARRING ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN IN THE CURRENT SCENARIO OKAY THANK YOU I MEAN WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS UM YES WE HAVE HAD A GOOD RUNNING IN TERMS OF MARKET RELATED INCOME I THINK THAT THAT THE BANKS POSITION TO LOSE HOPE THE THE IMPORTANT POINT IS <INAUDIBLE> AND IN <INAUDIBLE> IT CONTINUES TO BE THE WAY THAT IT IS THEN YOU CAN EXPECT THAT WE CAN UM THAT WE CAN BASICALLY HAVE GOOD NUMBERS THERE I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN THE IN THE IN THE THIRD QUARTER NUMBERS AS GOOD AS THEY WERE IN THE IN THE IN THIS QUARTER BOTH I MEAN IT ALSO DEPENDS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IN TERMS OF THE PROVISIONS AND THE COST OF RISK <INAUDIBLE> YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT ABSOLUTELY EH YOU KNOW I THINK THAT EH ONCE YOU TAKE OUT THE PROVISIONS THAT WE DID THIS QUARTER I THINK THAT COST OF RISK SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE NUMBERS THAT EH WE WERE HAVING OVER THE LAST SAY FIVE QUARTERS EH BUT NOT TO LEVELS THAT WE'VE REPORTED THIS QUARTER SO SOME REQUIRE EH EH 300 PESOS POINT THAT THAT WOULD BE MY MY EH MY TAKE AND OBVIOUSLY AS YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW WITH INFORMATION THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE OKAY OKAY THANK YOU I'LL TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM THE LINE OF CARLOS GOMEZ FROM HSBC PLEASE GO AHEAD HELLO GOOD MORNING UM I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT CREDIT RISK BUT NOT TO YOUR CORPORATE BUT TO THE VIRTUAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM WE ALREADY SAW ONE COMPANY GOT HAS LIQUIDATED HAS BEEN PUT IN LIQUIDATION BUT EH BY THE NATIONAL BANKING COMMISSION UH <INAUDIBLE> CRISIS <INAUDIBLE> BEING UNABLE TO OPERATE SO EVENTUALLY ONE WOULD IMAGINE <INAUDIBLE> MIGHT GET INTO TROUBLE UH ARE YOU TAKING SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS UH IN REGARD TO ANY SECTORS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND DO- DO YOU THINK WE- YOU'LL ENCOUNTER MUCH TROUBLE OR MOST OF THEM WILL BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THIS OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU CARLOS I MEAN UM I MEAN IN ALL THESE PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AND DEPEND HOW LONG THE CRISIS IS GONNA TAKE I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE DOWN SOME FINANCIAL PLAYERS I MEAN THAT SINCE WE ARE- YES WE ARE BEING VERY CAUTIOUS AND REVIEWING AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT UH THEIR POSITION IS AND THEIR SITUATION UM AND WE'RE GONNA BASICALLY CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT AS THE CRISIS CONTINUES TO- TO- TO EVOLVE SO IN THAT SENSE UH WE ARE VERY CLOSE IN UH TO THAT PARTICULAR SECTOR WE DON'T HAVE- I MEAN WE ARE NOT A BIG LENDER TO THE SECTOR I MEAN UH UH I CAN TELL YOU THAT UM IF YOU UH THEY'RE NOT IN THE <INAUDIBLE> TEN MOST IMPORTANT CLIENTS THEY'RE NOT FINANCIAL PLAYERS SO IN THAT SENSE WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE <INAUDIBLE> THAT WE HAVE OUT TO THEM BUT WE ARE VERY CONCERN TAKING A LOOK AND MONITORING UH THEM ALL THE TIME OKAY HOPEFULLY THE CRISIS IS SHORTER AND NOBODY ELSE GOES DOWN BUT UM WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS ANY PARTICULAR <INAUDIBLE> THAT USING MONEY <INAUDIBLE> SPECIAL MONITORING YOU KNOW MARKET-RELATED OR CONSUMER-RELATED OR PAYROLL I THINK MICROFINANCE IS A SECTOR THAT WE NEED TO BE UH VERY CLOSE MONITORING WE DON'T HAVE TO- WE DON'T HAVE TO S- A LOT BIG <INAUDIBLE> TO THEM BUT THAT'S A SECTOR THAT COVERING WOULD BE COMPLICATED AS ALWAYS IN THESE TYPE OF SITUATIONS THE PEOPLE THAT SUFFER THE MOST ARE THE ONES THAT UH ARE ON THE- ARE ON THE BASE OF THE PYRAMID SO UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE CASE AND WE ARE MONITORING THAT QUITE CLOSELY THANK YOU SO MUCH TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM <UNK> FROM <INAUDIBLE> PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS REGARDING LIQUIDITY UM I MEAN YOUR LIQUIDITY <INAUDIBLE> IMPROVED NICELY IN THE QUARTER IN PART IT WAS ALL BE- TO THE $1.8 BILLION THAT ISSUANCE <INAUDIBLE> BUT ALSO GIVEN A VERY STRONG INCREASE IN FUNDING WITH BANKS IN THIS QUARTER SO COULD YOU PLEASE PROVIDE SOME <INAUDIBLE> TO THE NATURE OF THIS FUNDING SOURCE AND WHAT WOULD BE YOUR STRATEGY FOR LIQUIDITY IN THE COMING QUARTERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH EH HI ALONZO UM YOU KNOW THERE ARE P- SEVERAL FACTORS UH REGARDING LIQUIDITY PAY- PAY- I THINK THAT THE- THE MOST UM UH RELEVANT IS OUR YOU KNOW HOW WE FUND A- A YOU KNOW THE- LET'S SAY THE LOAN TO THE <INAUDIBLE> THAT AS MENTIONED WAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST UH NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE REPORTED SINCE WE BECAME A LISTED COMPANY CLOSE TO 92% SO THAT'S- THAT'S IN MY OPINION THAT'S THE MOST <INAUDIBLE> AND FUNDAMENTAL WAY OF UH LOOKING AT IT THEN UM AS YOU RIGHTLY MENTIONED THE UM THE DEBT ISSUANCE IS UH YOU KNOW CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE INCREASE OF OUR UH UH LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO AND WE ARE MONITORING YOU KNOW ANY P- P- POTENTIAL USE OF UH THE COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR CLIENTS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S PROBABLY THE ONE UH UH LET'S SAY RISK THAT COULD MATERIALIZE IN- IN- IN THE SHORT TERM WE HAVE AMPLE OF LIQUIDITY TO HONOR OR PAY YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE COMMITTED LINE OF CREDIT THAT UH THAT WE HAVE BUT THAT- THAT'S THE ONE- THE MOST RELEVANT UH DRIVER IN TERMS OF CONSUMPTION OF UH LIQUIDITY THE OTHER TYPES OF UH YOU KNOW EVENTS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY YOU KNOW ARE YOU KNOW ARE MORE GRADUAL YOU KNOW AND THOSE COULD BE YOU KNOW UH A CONTRACTION IN DEPOSITS THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT UM AND I THINK THAT THE BANK HAS UH MANAGED UM QUITE PRACTICALLY YOU KNOW PER LIQUIDITY TO BE PREPARED FOR YOU KNOW ANY POTENTIAL P- P- YOU KNOW REALLY WORST CASE UH SCENARIO FURTHER DOWN THE- THE ROAD THANK YOU AND REGARDING THE LINE OF UH YOUR BALANCE SHEET THE LINE OF BANK AND OTHER LOANS UH WHICH INCREASED 81% IN QUARTER ONE QUARTER DO YOU- DO YOU- DO YOU THINK THESE LINE WOULD- WILL REMAIN AS CLOSE TO THOSE LEVELS OR DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SUBSTITUTE THESE SOURCE OF FUNDING WITH PROBABLY OTHER DEBT ISSUANCES IN COMING QUARTERS WHAT YOUR STRATEGY THERE UH YOU KNOW WE- WE MONITOR CONSTANTLY THE DIFFERENT UH TYPE OF UH FUNDING SOURCES AND DEPENDING ON THE- THE SPECIFIC UH UH YOU KNOW 10-YEAR COST YOU KNOW WE END UP YOU KNOW WE DRAWING OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF UH THE- THE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES SO YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT NOT ONLY THAT PARTICULAR LINE ITEM BUT EVERY SINGLE LINE ITEM IS- IS- IS REVIEWED YOU KNOW AND UNDER CURRENT MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES WE YOU KNOW IT'S- IT'S OUR P- OBLIGATION TO LOOK AT BETTER WAYS OF UH UH YOU KNOW NOT ONLY FUNDING THE BANK BUT YOU KNOW KEEPING UH STRUCTURES IN PLACE SO THAT THE BANK YOU KNOW CAN CONTINUE SUPPORTING UH YOU KNOW LONG GROWTH SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR ALONZO SO SO YES YOU KNOW IT COULD BE THAT WE KEEP IT AT THOSE LEVELS OR THAT WE REDUCE IT IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND YOU KNOW A- A MORE EFFECTIVE UH FUNDING SOURCE <INAUDIBLE> THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM YURI FERNANDES FROM J.P. MORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD UH THANK YOU <INAUDIBLE> I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE <INAUDIBLE> ON NPL RATIO UH IT WAS NOT <INAUDIBLE> QUARTER OVER QUARTER UH AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT SOME PEERS THEY HAD HIGHER-TIER JOBS AND THAT MAY EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE UH BUT GIVEN HOW THE PLAYERS UH WHERE THE <INAUDIBLE> WAS NOT AS HIGH UH WE KIND OF SAW MORE FLATTISH UH <UNK> BEHAVIOR UH BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL ACCOUNTING BECAUSE OF THE <INAUDIBLE> SO WHAT DROVE THE ITERATIONS QUARTER FOR- FOR YOU AND MY SECOND QUA- UH QUESTION IS REGARDING A SPECIAL ACCOUNTING CRITERIA UM WHEN WE LOOK TO THOSE NUMBERS UM THE- THE BALANCE OF NATL THEY ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN- THAN THEY ONCE- THE OLD ACCOUNTING VERSUS THE CURRENT SPECIAL ACCOUNTING AND I WOULD LIKE SOME KIND OF DIFFERENCE HERE LIKE UH A VERY NEGATIVE OUTLOOK WOULD BE TO SEE YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE NUMBERS MATERIALIZING AS LOSSES SO IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN UH FOR ME THE DIFFERENCES ON THE SPECIAL ACCOUNTING VERSUS THE OLD ACCOUNTING AND IF THE BALANCE OF NATLS THERE UM MAY- MAY BECOME LOSSES I WOULD APPRECIATE THANK YOU UM HI YURI UH IN TERMS OF UH THE NPL RATIO YOU KNOW THIS- THIS QUARTER WHAT DROVE THIS LIKELY DETERIORATION WAS BASICALLY A CREDIT CARD THAT WENT UP FROM 4.14% TO 4.82% AND THE- AND IT'S A MISS BASICALLY GOING FROM 2.61% TO 3.37% UM AS- AS WE DISCUSS UH DURING THE QUARTER- DURING THE CALL UM UH YOU KNOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO DID NOT UH ENROLLED IN THE- IN THE SUPPORT PROGRAMS SO BUT UH WE'RE SEEING YOU KNOW THIS SLIGHT DETERIORATION HAS TO DO MORE WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE- THE PORTFOLIO OF THE CLIENTS THAT DID NOT- DID NOT ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN OUR VIEW GIVEN YOU KNOW THE- THE YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ECONOMY IT WAS JUST A YOU KNOW A SLIGHT DETERIORATION NOW ON YOUR SECOND QUESTION UH COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT YOU KNOW I- I DON'T- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE COMPARING YOU KNOW THE SPECIAL ACCOUNTING CRITERIA TO THE OTHER ACCOUNTING CRITERIA SO UH THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING UM BEFORE <INAUDIBLE> THE NEW REGULATION FOR- FOR COVID UM YOU HAVE LIKE A TABLE UH ON YOUR RELEASE UH COMPARING UH THE SPECIAL ACCOUNTING CRITERIA VERSUS THE FORMER I THINK LIKE D6 ACCOUNTING CRITERIA AND WHEN WE LOOK TO THE BALANCE OF NON-PERFORMING LOANS I BELIEVE THE BALANCE YOU HAVE TO DATE SOMETHING LIKE 18 BILLION PES- 19 BILLION PESOS THAT IM- THAT IMPLIES THE 2.5% INTERNAL RATIO BUT IF YOU LOOK TO THE OLD ACCOUNTING CRITERIA THE- THE D6 ACCOUNTING UH I THINK THE BALANCE OF NPLS THEY ARE CLOSER TO 40 44 BILLION PESOS SO THE NPL RATIO THEY WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER UH I UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE A LOT OF LOANS THAT WILL NOT REALLY BECOME AN NPL THAT THEY ARE THERE BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT UH AS SOON AS THESE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA GO- GO- GOES BACK TO NORMAL IF WE COULD SEE YOU KNOW LIKE A- A- A- A HIGHER NEED OF PROVISIONS WORKING ON NPLS SO THAT'S WHY I ASK THE DIFFERENCE AND IF IT- IF- AND IF IT MAKES SENSE YOU KNOW TO- TO EXPECT THEM WORSENING UM ON THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT UH YOU KNOW IT- IT'S THOROUGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE LEVEL OF- OR- OR THE TYPE OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT UH WE MAKE BECAUSE UH THE- THE SYSTEM THAT ACCOUNTING CRITERIA IS VERY STRINGENT IN TERMS OF A- A- LET'S SAY A <INAUDIBLE> AND PERCENTAGE OF UH YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU- YOU- THE CLIENT HAVE PAID BACK SO I THINK THAT IT'S- IT'S A- IN MY OPINION IT'S- IT'S SOMEHOW UH EXTREME COMPARISON OKAY SO IT- IT HAS TO DO WITH YOU KNOW UM WITH THE UM UH SPECIAL ACCOUNTING CRITERIA YOU BASICALLY UH ALLOW CLIENTS NOT TO PAY UH UH YOU KNOW OR EVERY CLIENT THAT'S NOT PAYING THEIR INTEREST AND CAPITAL STAYS CURRENT YOU KNOW AND UH UNDER THE OLD OR THE PREVAILING ACCOUNTING CRITERIA YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT JUST THE- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND DEPENDING ON IF YOU ARE YOU KNOW LET'S SAY UH UH CORPORATE CLIENT YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID BACK WHETHER YOU'RE 20% OR MORE OR HOW YOU KNOW THE TIME THAT HAS ELAPSED YOU KNOW IT- IT- IT'S VERY I WOULD SAY THE PRECAUT- I WOULD SAY THAT THE PRESUMPTIONS ARE CRITICAL AND I THINK THAT UH UH PROBABLY WHAT IT'S- WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE FOLLOWING TWO QUARTERS WE'LL GET TO KNOW THE- THE HARD DATA YOU KNOW WE YOU KNOW RATHER THAN UH YOU KNOW COMPARING THOSE NUMBERS WITH BIG ASSUMPTIONS I THINK THAT UH UH AS SOON AS CLIENTS START PAYING BACK OR NOT WE'LL GET TO KNOW YOU KNOW HOW YOU KNOW THE MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACT OKAY RATHER THAN JUST MAKING YOU KNOW SOME ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU KNOW COULD MATERIALIZE OR NOT AS MENTIONED DURING THE CALL I THINK THAT UH WE HAVE MAKE- WE HAVE MADE A GOOD ASSESSMENT IN TERMS OF THE RISK THAT EACH CLIENT HAS YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM AND WE HAVE ALSO ASKED THEM YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE DOING AND WHETHER THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PAY BACK SO TAKING ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT THAT'S HOW WE- WE COME UP WITH THIS UH PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPECTED LOSSES THAT WE ASSUME SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU YURI JUST TO WAIT A COUPLE OF QUARTERS AND WITH- WITH THE HARD DATA YOU KNOW JUST ANALYZE YOU KNOW IF WE UH UH ON ONE HAND THE BENEFIT OF THESE TEMPORARY MEASURES THAT THE BANKING COMMISSION PROVIDED AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW THE- THE- THE TRUE IMPACT THAT IT HAS HAD YOU KNOW <INAUDIBLE> NO NO SPECTACULAR THANK YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL TAKE THE NEXT QUESTION IT COMES FROM NICOLAS RIVA FROM BANK OF AMERICA YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH UM FOR TAKING MY QUESTION I HAVE ONE- ONE QUESTION I APOLOGIZE IF YOU ALREADY MENTIONED IT UM UH SO YOU MENTIONED THAT 19% OF THE- OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO UM HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO SOME KIND OF RELIEF MEASURE <INAUDIBLE> UM HAVE THESE MEASURES ENDED ALREADY FOR ANY CLIENTS AND IF SO IF YOU CAN TELL US UM WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THESE CLIENTS UH THAT HAVE RESUMED UM PAYMENTS ALREADY SINCE IT'S BEEN ALREADY ABOUT UM FOUR MONTHS SINCE THE FULL OUTBREAK OF THE PANDEMIC AND- AND IF THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IF THE PAYMENT HOLIDAY HASN'T ENDED FOR- FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CLIENTS IF YOU CAN TELL US WHEN YOU MAKE THESE- THESE PROVISION CHARTS THE 3.9 BILLION PESOS IN THIS QUARTER UM DID YOU INCORPORATE ANY ASSUMPTIONS UM IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL BE THE PERCENTAGE OF THESE 19% OF THESE CLIENTS UNDER THE DEBT RELIEF PROGRAM THAT WILL PAY YOU BACK ONCE THE PAYMENT HOLIDAYS UM END THANK YOU YOU KNOW FIRST THE PAYMENT HOLIDAYS UH UH PAYMENT HOLIDAY PERIOD ENDS UH UH TOMORROW SO WE'LL START THE- THE- YOU KNOW SEEING UH WHETHER CLIENTS UH PAY BACK OR NOT UH STARTING NEXT WEEK SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION YET YOU KNOW NOW REGARDING YOU KNOW HOW WE UH UH MADE PROVISIONS FOR UH FOR THIS QUARTER YOU KNOW AND AS MENTIONED UH UH THROUGHOUT THE CALL YOU KNOW WE CLASSIFIED UM THE CLIENTS DEPENDING ON THE RISK THAT UH THEY HAVE UM THE EXPOSURE THAT THEY HAVE WITH US THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE- THEY HAVE WITH US SO WE- WE CLASSIFIED THE YOU KNOW RETAIL CLIENTS IN 25 CLUSTERS AND <INAUDIBLE> IN 11 CLUSTERS SO DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF UH UH OF CLUSTER THAT EACH UH CLIENT FALLS IN YOU KNOW THERE'S EITHER A HIGH RISK OR HIGH EXPOSURE <INAUDIBLE> YOU KNOW FOR CLIENTS AND WE ASSUME CERTAIN PROBABILITY OF THOSE CLUSTERS EITHER PAYING BACK THEIR LOANS OR NOT OKAY SO THAT'S HOW WE CAME UP WITH- WITH THE- WITH THE PROVISIONS THAT UH WE- WE- WE MADE THIS QUARTER SO YES THERE IS BUT IT DEPENDS- YOU KNOW THERE ARE 36 RESPONSES IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHETHER B- WE EXPECT A HIGH NUMBER OR NUMBER OF CLIENTS TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS IT'S- IT'S- IT YOU KNOW IT'S- IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE DONE THAT WE FEEL UH RELATIVELY CONFIDENT THAT WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE PROVIDED IS- IS- IS GOOD UH IS A GOOD PROVISION FOR <INAUDIBLE> DETERIORATION FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM <UNK> FROM UBS PLEASE GO AHEAD OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING MY QUESTION IT IS JUST ONE UH I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC UH OF THE CREDIT RELIEF PROGRAM HELD BY THE BANK AND <INAUDIBLE> ON NPLS 2.5% AND ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATION UH IF THEIR LOANS REACH AT ALMOST 15% OF TOTAL LOANS IF I'M NOT WRONG UH ROUGHLY A SIMILAR LEVEL TO THE OTHER BANKS BUT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PLAYERS AND EVEN CONSIDERING THE BRAZILIANS THE CHILEANS <INAUDIBLE> UH THEY HAVE A <INAUDIBLE> NPLS DECREASED IN THE SECOND Q UH UH YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS DETERIORATION UH IS COMING FROM THE SME AND THE CREDIT CARD <INAUDIBLE> SO I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND IF THIS HIGH <INAUDIBLE> NPLS BEHAVED WORSE THAN EXPECTED BY THE BANKS CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF LOANS THAT WERE POSTPONED AND WHAT DOES THE BANK UH SEES FOR THIS SEMESTER IN TERMS OF FOSTERING THE CREDIT RELIEF PROGRAM IN CASE OF REGULATORS UH EXTEND <INAUDIBLE> AND CHANGE THE RULES FOR IT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THAT YOU KNOW UH THE FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW THE NPLS THAT UH INCREASED THAT WE SEE IN THE SECOND QUARTER ARE ALSO SEEDED WITH THOSE CLIENTS THAT DO NOT ENTER INTO THE UH UH RELIEF PROGRAM OKAY SO YOU HAVE TO DO WITH THAT 81% OF CLIENTS THAT DECIDED NOT TO ENTER INTO- INTO THE PROGRAM AND OBVIOUSLY THOSE CLIENTS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO THE- THE DETERIORATION OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY YOU KNOW UH HECTOR MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE- THE- THE UH LOSSES THAT YOU KNOW THE EMPLOYEE LOSSES THAT WE'VE SEEN UH SO IT'S- IT HAS TO DO MORE WITH THAT OKAY WITH THE- LET'S SAY WITH THE CLIENTS THAT DO NOT ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM OKAY WHETHER WE WERE EXPECTING UH YOU KNOW THAT TYPE OF DETERIORATION YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IF SOMEONE TELLS YOU THAT THEY WERE ENVISIONING THIS TYPE OF ECONOMIC DETERIORATION I THINK THAT THEY'RE LYING YOU KNOW I THINK THAT UH UH WE'VE UH WE WERE NOT EXPECTING THIS TYPE OF UH UH CONTRACTION YOU KNOW THE MAGNITUDE THAT WE ARE SEEING YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT HOW EVERY SINGLE UH UH ANALYST UPDATES HIS FORECAST FOR THE MEXICAN ECONOMY EVERY WEEK YOU GET TO SEE THE DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS SO- SO I THINK THAT IT DO NOT SURPRISES US YOU KNOW WE MENTIONED THAT GIVEN THIS- THIS DETERIORATION OF UH ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WE THINK IT'S JUST A SLIGHT DETERIORATION OKAY UM THE- BUT AS MENTIONED WE WILL GET TO SEE THE FINAL IMPACT UH OR THE FINAL NUMBERS PROBABLY IN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE QUARTERS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ONLY WHAT HAPPENS THE REST OF THE YEAR I THINK THAT UH UH THIS- THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC AT LEAST FOR MEXICO HAS A POSSIBILITY OF YOU KNOW GOING

        "model_prediction": "Good day everyone and welcome to Banco Santander Mexico's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Following the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eduardo Saavedra, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations. Let's take some opening remarks and introduce today's other speakers. Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate everyone's participation today. BY NOW EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO OUR EARNINGS PRESS RELEASE AND THE PRESENTATION FOR TODAY'S CALL, BOTH OF WHICH WERE DISTRIBUTED BEFORE THE MARKET OPENED TODAY AND CAN BE FOUND IN OUR INVESTOR RELATIONS WEBSITE. PRESENTING ON OUR CALL TODAY WILL BE AT GIOVANNI RICCI, EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT AND CEO GIULIA MENA, OUR CFO ROBERTO BRIANDA, EXECUTIVE GENERAL DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS WHO WILL REVIEW OUR SECOND QUARTER RES To help mitigate the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, then we will be happy to answer your questions during the Q&A session. Before we begin our formal remarks, allow me to remind you that certain statements made during the course of this discussion constitute forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that could cause actual results to materially differ. A DIFFERENT INCLUDING FACTORS THAT COULD BE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THIS RISK PLEASE REFER TO OUR FILINGS WITH THE SEC AND THE MEXICAN STOCK EXCHANGE HECTOR PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU HECTOR GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO THOSE IN EUROPE THANK YOU FOR JOINING OUR ANNUAL CALL TODAY I HOPE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE HEALTHY AND SAFE AS WE DISCUSSED LAST QUARTER MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC The well-being of our employees and customers has remained our utmost priority. Before giving you an update on the measures we have implemented in this regard, let me begin a review by providing context. This past quarter has been quite challenging as we started seeing the impact of the pandemic on the Mexican economy on our business and of course on our results. Despite the impact, I assure you that our rank remains strong and focused. Liquidity levels are solid and well above the minimum regulatory levels. Secondly, we have a clear strategy which we are executing to support our customers and minimize the impact of the pandemic on the finances. Thirdly, we expect to emerge from this difficult environment as a stronger institution. Business volumes closed the second quarter with high single digit year-on-year growth while we experienced an adverse shift in our portfolio mix towards lower yielding segments. CONSUMER AND SME LOANS STARTED TO CONTRACT IN LINE WITH MARKET TRENDS WHILE THE COMMERCIAL AND MORTGAGE LOANS WERE RELENTLESS AND CONTINUED TO REGISTER SURPLUSES THE TIMELY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED BY BANCO DE MEXICO AND THE CNBV HAVE ALLOWED US TO MAINTAIN AMPLE LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL ENABLING US TO OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS SUPPORT MECHANISMS TO TEMPORARILY ALLEVIATE THE CASH FLOW AND THE FINANCIAL STRESS CAUSED BY ECONOMIC FALLOUT OF THE Although asset quality deteriorated slightly in the quarter, we made preemptive loan loss provisions of three point nine billion pesos in addition to the normal quarterly provisions in preparation for future losses. We would revise this amount in the future as more information becomes available on the performance of our loan portfolio during the coming quarters. As we normally do, we will provide an overview of our business environment, but let me emphasize again our conviction that And where Mexico is very well positioned against the current and still growing economic impact of the covid nineteen pandemic in slide four we present select economic indicators that show the magnitude of the impact in the pandemic is having on economic activity and having on economic activity and employment as you may recall twenty twenty gdp growth expectations for the mexican economy were modest prior to the pandemic mainly due to weak private investment prospects WITH EVIDENT INDICATORS SHOWING A CONTRACTION OF MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR IN DROP IN FIXED INVESTMENT, MARKET CONSENSUS EXPECTATIONS HAVE BEEN REVISED DOWN TO A RANGE OF NINE PERCENT ANNUAL DECREASE IN GDP DURING TWO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO FOR ADDITIONAL CONTEXT THIS WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC CONTRACTION NOT SEEN IN MANY DECADES THIS SIGNIFICANT F ACTIVITY RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION FORMAL JOBS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER ACCORDING TO SOCIAL SECURITY DATA BUT AS MANY AS TWENTY MILLION JOBS LOST TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INFORMAL EMPLOYMENT FOLLOWING THE PAST TWO SEVERE ECONOMIC CRISIS BACK IN NINETY FIVE AND TWO THOUSAND NINE IT TOOK SEVEN QUARTERS FOR THE MEXICAN ECONOMY TO RECOVER ITS PREVIOUS LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HOWEVER IN THE CURRENT ONE WE CONSID IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ECONOMY COULD RECOVER WITHIN A SIMILAR PERIOD OF TIME GIVEN THE DEPTH AND MAGNITUDE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SHOCK AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY MEANINGFUL FISCAL PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THE SEVERE CONTRACTION IN ITS EMPLOYMENT WITH EXTERNAL DEMAND ROUNDING ONLY GRADUALLY AND WITHOUT ANY METHOD TO ALIVATE HOUSEHOLDS, INCOME LOSS AND AN OPEN ECONOMY LIKE MEXICO FACES A SLOW PATH TO RECOVER PREVIOUS TO PREVIOUS ACTIVITY LEV Prospects being forecasted at only plus three percent. It could take three to four years to recover two thousand and nineteen levels of activity. Under these conditions, inflation pressures should remain low. We expect three point six for two thousand and twenty. Allowing Banco de Mexico to cut interest rates a little further. We expect another hundred basis points of cuts through the year, which would take the reference rate to around four percent a year. In summary, this scenario of low growth and low interest rates represents a challenging outlook for Mexico's commercial and consumer environments and for our business. If you turn to slide five, you will notice that despite the severe shock to economic activity and employment, the system's loans and deposit volumes still show a significant year-over-year expansion of eight percent and fourteen percent, respectively. It is explained by large and medium-sized companies and government entities that have drawn on the credit lines to maintain the liquidity of their balance sheets in order to continue operating during the months of which the stay-at-home guidelines have been in effect. On the other hand, consumer loans showed a relevant contraction reflecting the initial impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior and product origination practices being maintained by financial institutions. It is worth noting that system-wide demand deposits remain strong, up 18 18 percent year-on-year, likely reflecting heightened needs for liquidity among households and companies. Collateralized home lending guidelines remain in effect. Please turn to slide six or we would like to give you an update on the bank operations during the past few months. Our health and business continuity protocols remain in effect. Such as suspending non-essential travel, limiting the number of people at gatherings and group events, and enhancing sanitary measures at branches, corporate offices, ATMs, and contact centers. As of today, most corporate employees continue working from home while only essential personnel are working on-site. Approximately 80 percent of the bank branches are open and 92 percent of our ATMs are operational. Functioning normally. The bank's digital channels and contact centers have also been operating normally. Our digital monetary transactions increased sixty-four percent year-over-year while our digital sales represented forty-four percent of total sales. In fact, our digital resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels. Further, more agile resources have been channeled into implementing additional adoption levels. We have been supporting our customers through a debt relief program, offering deferred payments for individuals and SMEs, and case-by-case debt restructuring to our corporate customers. I will elaborate on this program in a moment. As part of our commitment to our communities, we have made numerous donations and supported initiatives that aid the medical community and vulnerable populations. We also donated an app to the Mexico City government which allows the population to self-diagnose based on symptoms, locate medical facilities within their capacity near them and obtain information on the pandemic. On slide seven, you will find a snapshot of our debt support program that I mentioned before. Currently, ninety percent of our total loan portfolio is under the payroll holiday program for individual and small and medium-sized enterprises. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS BENEFITING FROM IT THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WE ARE HELPING CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE ENCOUNTERED LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS BY PERMITTING THEM TO SKIP LOAN PAYMENTS BOTH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL FOR FOUR MONTHS WITHOUT ANY PENALTY OR COST BECAUSE OF THIS FEATURE UNDER THE PROGRAM IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSSESS AT THIS TIME THE EXTENT OF THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON OUR ASSET QUALITY HOWEVER WE HAVE BEEN PROACTIVE IN ADDRESSING Quality over the past few months by contacting our customers to better understand their financial situation and by analyzing their ability to pay. More than 50 percent of our branch network personnel is focused on recoveries, calling customers directly. Likewise, the collections and commercial and credit departments have segmented the portfolio by level of concern, identifying risk and exposure according to customer quality. Through this more granular process, we are... We have been smart-coding each type of client within thirty-six different clusters. We have also been analyzing our customer behavior patterns using our CRM capabilities. We know that more than ninety-five percent of our payroll customers continue to receive their salaries. For those payroll customers who are no longer receiving their salary, we are collecting for unemployment insurance with current information. We estimate that close to forty percent of our payroll customers are collecting for unemployment insurance with current information. Our customers should be able to continue honoring fully the conditions of their loans. The need is simple. Since it is still unclear if the rest will be able to remain current, we are offering upfront loan restructurings to many of them in order to speed up the recovery process. It will not be until the third and fourth quarters of this year that we will have sufficient hard data on the behavior of the portfolio. With regard to our commercial book, we are taking a hard look at it. A case-by-case approach to manage our exposure. As we did during the past critical periods, we have remained very close to our customers and are helping them navigate this current challenging environment. For those companies that face difficulties, we have been offering multiple alternatives to support them. Our current portfolio of commercial structured loans is close to fifty billion pesos and accounts for sixteen percent of our loan portfolio with medium and large size corporates. In addition to actively managing our portfolio, know that seventy six percent of our payment holiday portfolio is associated with mortgages and esms, which both have warrants. Within our total esm book, sixty seven percent of the portfolio is backed up by warrants issued by nafin, one of mexico's development banks, which allows us to share the risk with them, specifically for those esms that are in the refferal program. Out of them have warrants. Furthermore, payrolls and auto loans, nine percent of the deferred portfolio, are semi-secured given the collateral represented by each customer's salary and car. Please turn to slide eight, for I would like to share with you some of the key characteristics of our mortgage portfolio which is giving us relative comfort due to its defensive nature. Our organic mortgage portfolio accounts for 86 percent. The existing portfolio has a long-to-value ratio of 44%, while originations have an LTV of 70%, providing very good warranty coverage. The NPV ratio of this portfolio is 3.6% and has been quite stable for some time. For the past two years, our Hypotheekbank mortgage has allowed us to attract higher-income customers which are more defensive. In the current environment, to expand on this point, our average ticket has been increasing since our launch. Since we launched our product, it is currently not only the highest among our peers, but it's currently 37 percent higher than the average ticket of our peers. In addition, Ipoteka Plus customers are loyal as they also have their perks and their credit cards with us. Having a low-loan-to-value ratio as well as being the main bank of our customer lowers the cost. The probability of non-payment at this type of customer tends to prioritize the home mortgages in economic downturns. All in all, considering the level of warrants we have, the structure of our portfolio, and the proactive measures we are taking, we consider we are on the right path to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the quality of the long portfolio. On slide nine, let me comment on origination dynamics and the mix we have seen. In the past few months, commercial loans continue to support total loan growth. Therefore, their contribution within local loan origination increased from 78 percent in the second quarter of nineteen to 82 percent in the second quarter of two thousand and twenty. Behind these figures, commercial loans now represent sixty-four percent of our total loans. This changing mix has had an impact on our n a i as will be explained later in the call. In terms of origination dynamics, we have seen encouraging trends during the quarter that I've noted here. In the mortgage and commercial segments, June's loan origination registered relevant sequential improvements compared to May, surpassing January's twenty-two level. In consumer loans, June's loan origination remains twenty-five percent below the first quarter in twenty, monthly average. However, it is under thirty-three percent. 2 PERCENT ABOVE THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY MINIMUM WHICH LASTED APRIL AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SLIDE OUR CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONS ARE VERY STRONG AT THE END OF JUNE OUR COMMON EQUITY TIER ONE C P I W ONE RATIO STOOD AT ELEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT FIFTY EIGHT BASIS POINTS ABOVE MARCH AND WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT MINIMUM REQUIREMENT ESTABLISHED FOR THE BANKS OUR SIZE The decision made during April's shareholders meeting to postpone the dividend payment for 2020 has allowed us to further strengthen our capital position. In terms of liquidity, our second quarter in 2020 liquidity coverage ratio reached two hundred and eleven percent, well above the Bank of Mexico's regulatory requirement and supported by the senior notes we issued back in April. Before turning the call over to Lydia, I would like to finish my remarks. BY REITERATING THAT WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE SAFELY AND DECISIVELY TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR BANK IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT CRISIS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN ADDITION TO IMPLEMENTING PROPER PROTOCOLS AND MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS WE HAVE CONTINUED SERVING CLIENTS WITH HIGH STANDARDS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE THROUGH OUR BRANCHES AND DIGITAL CHANNELS AGAIN WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR BANK IS WELL POSITIONED LET ME PASS OVER THE COVER OVER TWO MINUTES WHO WILL REVIEW THE PARTS MOST IMPORTANT TRENDS AND METRICS THANK YOU THANK YOU EHCTOR GOOD DAY EVERYBODY PLEASE TURN TO SLIDE 11 FOR AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RECENT LOAN PERFORMANCE TOTAL LOANS EXPANDED SEVEN PERCENT YEAR-ON-YEAR BUT CONTRACTING CONTRACTED THREE PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY GIVEN STRONG CORPORATE LOAN DEMAND AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER LOW MARGIN SEGMENT AND SIX PERCENT YEAR IN YEAR RESPECTIVELY DUE TO THE ECONOMICS TO THE ECONOMY'S WEAK PERFORMANCE BY CONTRAST MORTGAGE LOANS INCREASED A SOLID NINE PERCENT YEAR IN YEAR AND EXPANDED THIRTEEN PERCENT WHEN EXCLUDING THE RUN OFF EFFECT OF G E I N G PORTFOLIOS WHICH WAS WELL ABOVE MARKET GROWTH HIGH MARGIN SEGMENTS HAVE REDUCED THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO NET INTEREST INCOME BY ALMOST A HUNDRED BASIS POINTS INDIVIDUAL LO SLOW DOWN GROWING FOUR PERCENT ON A YEAR-ON-YEAR BASIS MAINLY SUPPORTED BY MORTGAGES AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY MORTGAGES HAVE PROVED TO BE A DEFENSIVE SEGMENT WITHIN THE MEXICAN MARKET DURING THE PAST PERIODS OF ECONOMIC INSTABILITY WITH THIS IN MIND WE DECIDED TO LOWER EVEN MORE THE RATE OF OUR IPOTECAPLUS PRODUCT TO SEVEN POINT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT TARGETING LOYAL CUSTOMERS AS OF JUNE CLOSE TO SIXTY PERCENT OF O Products. In July, we launched a new product, a new mortgage product called Ipoteka Free, which is the first commission-free mortgage product in Mexico. Unique characteristics of this product are the customers do not have to pay an application fee, monthly commission, or a home appraisal. Nor are life and unemployment insurance required. Leaving only nominal fees to be paid by the customer when applying for this product. As you can see, even during these challenging times, we haven't stopped innovating. There continues to be a trend of credit card loans as we take a more conservative approach toward this segment. In addition to managing customer credit limits, credit card usage declined thirty percent year over year during the quarter as many clients stayed at home. This drop had a negative impact on balances, of course. As to usage, rates reached a very low level in April they recovered in May and June, although remaining slightly. Growing our consumer loans has been concentrated in payday loans, growing two point five percent year on year and still above the market per CMBV data as of the end of May. Personal loans continue to contract consistent with our strategy to focus on more defensive segments of the market, as noted by sector. Finally, our other loan production in June more than doubled compared to previous quarters average, boosted by our new commercial lending. The alliance with Masda turning to slide 13, growth in our base of loyal digital customers continues to demonstrate important progress with year-on-year increases of almost 17 percent and 31 percent, respectively. Despite the challenging business environment, loyalty penetration that is loyal to active customers stands at 35 percent, four hundred points higher than a year ago. We have seen continuous growth in the use of digital channels as customers have stayed home during the pandemic. This quarter's product sales via digital channels accounted for forty four percent of the total, almost doubling year ago levels. Digital monetary transactions also spiked, reaching almost one third of the total while mobile transactions represented ninety three percent of total digital transactions versus eighty four percent in 2019. Mobile customers also kept growing at a solid thirty eight percent year on year rate, reaching four point three million at the end of the quarter. As you can see on slide 14, commercial loans grew nine percent year-over-year, but decreased sequentially as some corporates started prepaying some lines withdrawn in the first quarter of this year. Government and middle market segments continued to register double-digit year-over-year expansion, although their sequential evolution showed lower and stable volumes, respectively. SME loans registered a fourth sequential quarterly contraction, as this segment showed a weakening trend even before the pandemic. OUTSTANDING LOANS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE WE HAD IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN TEN QUARTERS AGO. THE DOWNWARD TREND IS ALSO RELATED TO OUR LOWER RISK APPETITE FOR LENDING IN THE SME SEGMENT. GIVEN THAT MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR SME LOAN BOOK JOINED THE PAYMENT HOLIDAY DEFER PROGRAM AND THOSE CUSTOMERS CANNOT USE THEIR CREDIT LINES WHILE IN THE PROGRAM, LOAN ORIGINATION IN THIS SEGMENT WILL REMAIN LOW UNTIL WE DEPOSITS ON SLIDE FIFTEEN THIS INCREASED TEN PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR WHILE QUARTER ON QUARTER WE SAW A TWO PERCENT CONTRACTION DURING THE QUARTER THERE WAS A SHIFT BETWEEN DEMAND AND TIME DEPOSITS FAVORED BY LOWER INTEREST RATES AS OF THE SECOND QUARTER THIS YEAR DEMAND DEPOSITS REPRESENTED SIXTY FOUR PERCENT OF TOTAL DEPOSITS AND WERE UP ELEVEN PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR DEPOSIT GROWTH FROM INDIVIDUAL STANDS STANDS OUT AT TWENT Retrieve these types of deposits. After an atypical first quarter of this year, deposits from individuals continue to grow faster than corporate deposits in line with our strategy to further increase our exposure to retail deposits. Retail deposits now represent 33% of total deposits. Almost four hundred basis points higher than its contribution in the first quarter of twenty eighteen. Turning to slide sixteen, we have a very strong capital and liquidity position. We have highlighted the following aspects:\n\n* We maintain a sound funding position with a net loans to deposits ratio of 91.08%, one of the strongest levels since becoming a listed company.\n* Our liquidity coverage ratio increased 89 percentage points relative to the first quarter of this year and now stands at 211%, well above the regulatory threshold of 100%.\n* We also remain very comfortable with our debt profile, with manageable debt maturities.\n\nRegarding the company, we have highlighted the following aspects:\n\n* We maintain a sound funding position with a net loans to deposits ratio of 91.08%, one of the strongest levels since becoming a listed company.\n* Our liquidity coverage ratio increased 89 percentage points relative to the first quarter of CAPITALIZATION, OUR RATE INCREASED FORTY SIX BASIS POINTS SEQUENTIALLY TO SIXTEEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT REFLECTING THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE DUE PAYMENTS AS RECOMMENDED BY THE BANKING COMMISSION WHILE OUR CORE TIER ONE RATIO WAS UP 80 BASIS POINTS TO ELEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT AND OUR CORE TIER ONE RATIO STOOD AT THIRTEEN POINT ZERO THREE PERCENT AS YOU CAN SEE ON SLIDE SEVENTEEN NET INCOME DECREASED FOUR PERC As a result, net interest margin contracted by 128 basis points to 4.5% for the quarter. Our margin decline was a result of lower interest rates and lower balances within the high-yielding segments coupled with higher average assets. As a consequence, there was a significant increase in our securities portfolio. Without this last effect, our net interest margin would have contracted only 34 basis points. As a sector, we were expecting net interest margin. INCOME TO CONTINUE CONTRACTING DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR DUE TO ANTICIPATED DECREASES IN INTEREST RATES COMBINED WITH A CHANGE IN OUR PORTFOLIO MIX WHERE GROWTH WOULD LIKELY COME FROM LOW YIELDING SEGMENTS AND WITH A LIKELY CONTRACTION IN HIGH YIELDING SEGMENTS HOWEVER THIS DOWNWARD PRESSURE WILL BE PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY OUR EXPANDED INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES PORTFOLIO PLEASE MOVE ON TO SLIDE EIGHTEEN NET COMMISSIONS AND FEES DECRE The double digit decline in credit card transactions credit card usage decreased forty two percent in April thirty four percent in May and fourteen percent in June on a year on year basis insurance fees register only a slight contraction given renewals of several groups insurance policies which partially compensated for softer insurance demand insurance represents almost thirty percent of our total fees and has proven to be a defensive segment Even considering the the the pandemic with health and life insurance growing while retail insurance is slightly decreased our investment banking team has been very active mainly in financial advisory services which translated into strong fee growth of thirty one percent in this line of our business which partially compensated for weaker results in other areas mainly credit card fees turning to slide nineteen gross profit and income grew nine percent year on year DRIVEN BY A SOLID PERFORMANCE IN MARKET RELATED INCOME WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE OUR HISTORICAL AVERAGE LEVELS OF BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION PESOS PER QUARTER DECLARED INTEREST RATES THE EFFECT MARKET VOLATILITY ESPECIALLY DURING APRIL AND MAY SUPPORTED MARKET MAKING INCOME IN ADDITION WE SOLD INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES IN ORDER TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION GENERATING NON RECURRING GAINS all this contributed for market related income that accounted for thirteen point eight percent of gross operating revenues three point five times higher than the historical average of four percent moving on to provisions on slide twenty in light of the deterioration of mexico's economic environment and in anticipation of a possible deterioration of our loan portfolio both due to the pandemic in june we registered a special charge of low loans provisions on top of both provisions on slide twenty in light of the deterioration of mexico's economic environment and in anticipation of a possible deterioration of our loan portfolio both due to the pandemic in june we registered a special charge of low loans provisions on top of both provisions on slide twenty in light of the deterioration of mexico's economic environment and in anticipation of a possible THOSE NORMALLY REQUIRE THE THREE POINT NINE BILLION PESOS CHARGE RAISED TOTAL PROVISIONS TO EIGHT POINT THIRTY FIVE BILLION PESOS IN THE QUARTER UP 88 PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR AND SIXTY TWO PERCENT SEQUENTIALLY WE HAVE MADE THIS ESTIMATE OF PRE-EMPTIVE PROVISIONS WITH THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AT HAND HOWEVER THIS AMOUNT COULD BE REVISED IN THE FUTURE AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE COST OF RISK FOR THE QUARTER STOOD AT THREE POINT N An increase in years and forty nine basis points sequentially. Our total NP L ratio showed a slight twenty eight basis points year over year increase to two point five percent, mainly due to the SME segment. Together with mortgage and credit card portfolios, as explained earlier, these ratios only reflect the performance of eighty one percent of our total portfolio that does not fall under the payment holiday program. We consider this ratio encouraging, as its evolution is quite benign. WHEN CONSIDERING THE SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT HOWEVER IT WOULD NOT BE UNTIL THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEARS OF THIS YEAR THAT THE DEBTORS PERIOD PROGRAM WILL END IT WILL BE AT THAT TIME THAT M P L RATIOS WILL REFLECT THE REAL MAGNITUDE OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC NOW PLEASE TURN TO SLIDE TWENTY ONE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES INCREASE ONE POINT TWO PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR TO CONTROL PERSONAL COSTS MAINLY RESOURCES FOR VIABLE COMPENSATION AND AMOORTIZATION EXPENSES RELATED TO THE STRATEGIC AND I T INVESTMENTS THAT WE MADE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AS WE WILL CONTINUE INVESTING IN THE DIGITALIZATION OF THE BANK AND IN TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES WERE TARGETING GRADED OPERATING EFFICIENCIES IN THE COMMON QUARTERS SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS TRIPS VIABLE COMPENSATION AS WELL AS LIMITING BASIC SALARY This has already led to a sequential one point nine percent decrease in our total expenses during the second quarter of this year. Such expense controls combined with strong operating income and the conclusion of our three year investment plan contributed to a three hundred and fifty eight basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio which decreased to forty point seven percent on a six month basis, the ratio improved to two hundred and twenty seven basis points year on year to forty two point three percent. Putting into profitability on slide twenty two, you will note that our earnings were mainly impacted by the special low-income provisions that we discussed earlier. Profit before taxes was down twenty-four percent year-over-year for the quarter, and eleven percent for the first half of the year. Net income decreased twenty-five percent year-over-year to four point two billion pesos, while our effective tax rate increased thirty-eight basis points year-over-year to twenty-five point three percent. This resulted in an eleven point five percent profitability. decrease in net income for the first six months of twenty twenty which was nine point six billion pesos return on equity was eleven point nine percent, five hundred forty three basis points below the year ago level and down three hundred sixty two basis points sequentially here to date aeroe contracted three hundred twenty eight basis points to thirteen point five percent let me now turn the call back to ector gilcrest for some final remarks ECTOR PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU RIVIERE PLEASE TURN TO SLIDE TWENTY THREE LET ME SHARE WITH YOU SOME FINAL THOUGHTS ON WHAT LIES AHEAD GIVEN THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THIS HEALTH CRISIS AND THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING ITS ORIGIN AND MAGNITUDE WE ANTICIPATE ONLY A VERY GRADUAL RECOVERY OF OUR ECONOMY WHICH HAS OBVIOUS IMPLICATIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WE AFFECT OUR LONG PORTOFOLIO WE LIKELY BE DRIVEN Special loans, mainly medium and large corporations, government loans as well as mortgages. The consumer will recover very gradually and this will depend on the speed of the eventual turnaround in employment, economic activity as well as business and consumer confidence. Although visibility on asset quality is limited due to the parental holiday program which has been talking and taking rapid and decisive action in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. ON THE LOAN BOOK A RECOVERY PLAN WHICH INCLUDES A VERY DETAILED AND IN DEEP ANALYSIS OF EACH CUSTOMER SITUATION IS ALLOWING US TO PERIMPTIVELY AND SWIFTLY PREPARE THE BANK FOR COMPLICATED QUARTERS AHEAD. IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE ALLOCATED A LARGE NUMBER OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES AND BRANCHES INVOLVED IN CARRYING OUT RECOVERY STRATEGY WE WILL CONTINUE FOCUSING ON ENHANCING CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND ON CROSS SELLING NON CREDIT PRO We also remain committed to making additional investments in the bank transformation mainly in IT and digitalization. But we will continue to look for efficiencies in other lines with a strict cost control in order to support the bottom line. And finally, rest assured that our banks is operating from a position of strength with robust capital and high liquidity levels that will allow us to overcome this complicated but what we believe are temporary circumstances.

AGAIN, PRESS STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION. PLEASE ASK ONE QUESTION AND A FOLLOW-UP. IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS, PLEASE RE-ENTER THE CUE. WE'LL PAUSE FOR JUST A MOMENT TO ALLOW EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK A QUESTION. Opportunity to signal for questions. Thank you.\n\nOur first question is from the line of Rehan Moline from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, thank you very much. My question is on the operating outlook. The disclosure is excellent, as always. I like the way you presented it. On slide nineteen, we can look at the main main drivers for the operating income. And clearly, as you talked about, market-related revenue was very strong, well above historical levels. About fourteen percent of the total operating income compared to, let's say, three or four percent in the past. These are different times. But how should we think about efficiency going forward? You talked about cost control. We saw that. If you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can, if Can you give us a general sense of the costs involved? You mentioned there are certain costs you can control and you are controlling. Can you talk a little bit about the physical infrastructure? Is there an opportunity to rationalize the physical branch network after the investments you've made? What should we be looking for in terms of efficiency going forward? The dynamic is quite skewed from all of these moving parts. AND THE LOW THE LOW REVENUES GIVING WHAT'S GOING ON THANK YOU THANK YOU LOOK I MEAN AS YOU HAVE SAID I MEAN AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NUMBERS BASICALLY WE HAVE DECREASED THE OPERATION COST OF THE BANK QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I MEAN NOT TRAVELING AND NOT DOING MANY THINGS BASICALLY HAVE REDUCED NATURALLY THE COST FOR WHAT WE HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY AUSTERE IN NEW PROJECTS AND NEW SITUATIONS I MEAN WE ARE BASICALLY FOCUSING ALL OUR SPENCES IN I T TO SUPPORT THE BACKBONE AND TO BE READY FOR WHAT'S COMING SO IN THAT SENSE THAT'S GONNA BE OUR PRIORITY SECOND PRIORITY WE ARE TAKING A LOOK WE'RE DOING A DEEP DIVE IN TERMS OF ALL OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA GET TAKE I MEAN ROUGH DECISIONS IN TERMS OF CLOSING DOWN A BIG NUMBER OF OUR BRANCHES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE RATIONALLY LOOKING AT EACH OF THE MICRO MARKETS THAT WE HAVE DIVIDED THE COUNTRY INTO AND WE WILL DECIDE WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN THERE SO BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY STRICKT IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE GROWTH OF THE POST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IN TERMS OF BRANCHES WE ACTUALLY HAVE DECREASED THE NUMBER OF TOTAL BRANCHES WE HAVE JUST WE HAVE BEEN VERY INTELLIGENT IN THE WAY WE H Branches which we are gonna basically be taking a little bit more time than the time that we were thinking of of upgrading all the branches are not up to the standard so this exactly what we're doing we're gonna basically rationalize all of all of expending and do it on where the most important thing is that is basically the it platform and the digitalization of the bank so in that sense we're gonna be going VERY CONCENTRATED ON THAT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT I MEAN GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE AT THE BANK UNDER THESE INCOME TAXES WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE BASICALLY WORKING FROM HOME YOU BASICALLY GET TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW REALLY HOW MUCH PEOPLE DO YOU NEED WHAT CAN YOU RATIONALIZE ETC. SO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE FROM US IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE VERY RESPONSIBLE IN THE WAY WE MANAGE THAT AND WE ARE WORKING ON OUR THREE YEAR PLAN AND WE ARE BASICALLY INCLUDING ALL THIS IN ORDER TO DO SO MAYBE AS A FOLLOW UP JUST SOME COMMENTS ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT YOUR PEERS IN DESSENT AND THERE GROUP IN THE REGION OR ELSEWHERE ARE THERE OTHER THINGS YOU THINK THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO MEXICO THAT COULD HELP PERHAPS ON THE SIDE OF THE BANKING SYSTEM, PERHAPS IN TERMS OF TERMS OPERATIONALLY OR I T OR ANY FACTORS AT ALL THANK YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING BASICALLY IS FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING DIGITAL PLATFORMS ET CETERA WHAT WE'RE DOING IT WE'RE DOING IT NOW INSTEAD OF EACH COUNTRY BASICALLY DEVELOPING THE PLATFORMS WE ARE DOING IT TOGETHER SO THAT BASICALLY IS GOING TO HELP OUT QUITE A LOT SO IT'S NOT MEXICO FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IN MEXICO WE'RE DEVELOPING THE NEW SUPER APP AND THE NEW FOR EXAMPLE, THE EMBARGO AGAINST SANCTIONS WE ARE USING THE ONE THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED IN EUROPE. SO ALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE GOING TO HELP US OUT BASICALLY IN REDUCING OUR COSTS FOR THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING AND WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER MUCH MORE WITHIN THE GROUP IN ORDER TO DO THAT. SO YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT I MEAN, THE COST OF BASICALLY DEVELOPING THINGS AND ITS GOING TO COME DOWN DUE TO THE FACT THAT W The next question comes from the line of Jorge Guerrero from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about net interest margin. You pointed out that you expect it to be at this point. Further complications in the next couple of quarters given falling rates and weak loan demand and mixed deterioration. As you look at twenty twenty one in the context of what you said on not a strong economic recovery next year and with average rates next year being much lower than twenty twenty if indeed rates at about four percent. What is the expectation for net interest margin next year and for ai? is it possible that we're likely to see another year of ai compression and to what extent that could be offset elsewhere in the pnl? and my second question is on the coverage ratio. Banks normally don't target a coverage ratio. I get it. But what's evident is that the size of your reserves have a relationship to the size of your loan book, the size of your NPAs, and the size of the amount of loans that are on their restructuring. And so when I look at your coverage ratio, it looks low relative to where Banco Noroeste ended up at two hundred and one percent, and Bancolombia at one hundred and eighty-five percent. SO I WONDER YOU KNOW WHY WHY NOT JUST TAKE A MUCH BIGGER CHARGE ON PROVISIONS THIS ORDER UM YOU EVIDENTLY THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AHEAD AND EVEN MORE THE BETTER AND SO IS THIS PEAS MILK JUST GOING TO YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY PUT MORE PRESSURE ON YOUR EARNINGS GOING FORWARD RATHER THAN JUST TAKE A REALLY BIG WANE SOUP AND RAISE YOUR COVERAGE TO THE NORTH OF TWO HUNDRED PERCENT LIGHTLY MODIFIED VERSION: SOMETHING YOU CAN DO IN THE THIRD ORDER. THANK YOU. Procurement unfortunately is a means given the lack of warrants from the government from lafayette ok so the portfolio has dropped almost ten percent so in that sense that basically is a high yield portfolio which is going to continue to shrink unless we see some warrants from the government and if you see our portfolio which is quite important we have like sixty two percent of it already warranted by lafayette ok so the course of action basically goes to answer your second question A QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES THAT WE HAVE DONE THEN YOU SEE THAT ALSO WE SEE THAT FOR EXAMPLE CONSUMER CREDIT AND CONSUMER LOANS ARE GOING TO DECREASE AS WELL SO THE MIX IS COMPLETELY CHANGING AND WE ARE GOING BASICALLY BACK TO WHERE WE WERE FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD MUCH MORE EXPOSURE TO CORPORATES AND TO MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES THAN TO CONSUMER LOANS REMEMBER THAT WE HAD We've been increasing the margin on the corporate loans quite significantly due to the fact that we are basically looking at the risk that we are taking and we are looking very closely at the ratings of those companies and we are pricing accordingly. So that's why NIY is shrinking. On the other side, what we also have been doing is we were pricing and we are very strict on pricing risk. Ok. So we've been increasing the margin on the corporate loans quite significantly due to the fact that we are basically looking at the risk that we are taking and we are looking very closely at the ratings of those companies and we are pricing accordingly. So that's why NIY is shrinking. On the other side, what we also have been doing is we were pricing and we are very strict on pricing risk. Ok. So we' THIS IS NOT A SITUATION IN WHICH WE WANT TO SPEND THE PORTAL OF THE GREAT PORTFOLIOS JUST TO EXPAND IT WE ARE BASICALLY DOING IT JUST TO THE COMPANIES THAT WE BELIEVE HAVE A FUTURE AND WILL BE THERE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND BOTH WERE PRICING THE RISK ACCORDINGLY SO IN THAT SENSE YOU WILL SEE US GOING TOWARDS THAT ALSO THE OTHER CONCENTRATION IS MORTGAGES WHICH WE BELIEVE THERE IS A SECTOR STILL OF GROWTH I MEAN THERE IS A LACK OF OR A BIG DEFICIT IN TERMS OF HOMES IN MEXICO SO WE BELIEVE THERE IS STILL A PART OF THE POPULATION THAT CAN AFFORD A MORTGAGE MORTGAGES IS PENETRATION IN MEXICO WAS QUITE LOW VERSUS THE REST AND ALSO LOW PENETRATION IS QUITE LOW SO WE BELIEVE THERE IS A CHANCE TO TO CONTINUE PENETRATING THAT SECTOR AND MAYBE ON PAYDAY LOANS ON SOME SITUATIONS WE WILL BASICALLY BE ALSO LENDING IN THAT IN THAT PART I MEAN AN AUTO LOANS ALSO WE H VERY CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO IT SO IN THAT SENSE THE MISS OF THE PORTFOLIO IS GOING TO CHANGE AND PROBABLY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LET YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW DO WE SEE AI EVOLVING IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WERE ASKING IN TERMS OF THE RESERVES WE WE WE ACTUALLY BEEN DOING RESERVES ACCORDING TO WHAT WE BELIEVE WE ARE DOING IN TERMS OF HOW THE PORTFOLIO IS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS H PAYMENT HOLIDAYS IS BEHAVING MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN WE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS GONNA THAT IT WAS GONNA TURN ACTUALLY I'M QUITE SURPRISED ABOUT IT HOPEFULLY IT CONTINUES THAT WAY BUT IN THAT SENSE WE ARE BASICALLY BEING IN MY OPINION BEING VERY RESPONSIBLE IN THE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT WE ARE MAKING AT THIS POINT ALSO WE HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB WITH THE DATA That we have in reviewing the portfolio on holidays and that portfolio is being divided as we said in thirty six clusters. Okay, these clusters have been divided upon upon the amount of risk that we have on each particular situation and in some of these portfolios even before the payment holiday ends we are already talking to clients and discussing the way that we could get paid. DEBT ON THOSE PARTICULAR SITUATIONS BECAUSE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT WHOEVER GETS PAID FIRST IS THE ONE THAT IS GONNA GET PAID. SO WE ARE BASICALLY BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE ON THAT SENSE TO TALK TO OUR CLIENTS AND BASICALLY TRYING TO GET THAT TO RECOVER THAT PORTFOLIO. AS YOU HAVE SEEN FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR BRANCHES HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO COLLECTING BRANCHES. I MEAN TO BASICALLY THIS WE'RE DEDICATING OUR EXECUTIVES TO COLLECT WE HAVE DIVIDED THEM UP ON THEM IN THE SECTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN THE ECONOMY OR THAT ARE GONNA BE HIT THE MOST IN THE ECONOMY SO IN THAT SENSE WE REALLY WERE VERY WELL PREPARED ALTHOUGH I MEAN NEVERTHELESS IT'S ALWAYS I MEAN A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO GO OVERBOARD WE BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH IS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE MADE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS EVOLUTION, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE'RE GONNA BE VERY CONSERVATIVE IN THE WAY WE MANAGE THAT OKAY ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY LATER THOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMPLETE IT SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION THAT I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S QUITE RELEVANT UM THE SPEED AT WHICH INTEREST RATES HAVE COME DOWN IN MEXICO IS IS IS SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW JUST IN THIS QUARTER THE AVERAGE OF THE REFERENCE RATE CAME DOWN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE BASIS POINTS THAT'S THE THE FASTEST DECLINE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE RECENT HISTORY WE DIDN'T SEE AN INCREASE OF THOSE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW JUST IN THIS QUARTER Of that magnitude when when interest rates were were coming up ok so that's one thing to have in mind that the the the impact in nim that you see in this quarter i think is is probably most severe that we're going to see in a relative basis relative to the first quarter of this year and relative to the second quarter of last year ok also bear in mind that when interest rates were close to four percent AS WE PROBABLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED YOU KNOW OUR NIM WAS CLOSE TO FIVE PERCENT YOU KNOW AND THIS WAS YOU KNOW THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE DETAILS THAT WE REPORTED THE FOURTH FORTY EIGHT PERCENT IN THIS QUARTER IT HAS TO DO WITH THE WITH WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO YOU KNOW THE SPEED AT WHICH INTEREST RATES CAME DOWN OK AND ALSO ON TOP OF THAT YOU H The change in mix on our loan side, and also the fact that in order to protect net interest income from interest rates coming down, we increased our investment in securities portfolio significantly, you know, and those are, you know, lower margin assets. ASSETS RELATIVE TO THE LOAN PORTFOLIO JUST JUST TO YOU KNOW SHARE WITH YOU WE'VE BUYED YOU KNOW THIS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT YOU KNOW BOTH DIVERSIFICATION AND MATURITIES THE OVERALL GROWTH IN OUR PEER INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS NINETY SIX BILLION PESOS OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS SO WHAT WE EXPECT COMING DOWN ROAD YOU KNOW PAY FOR BUT THE REST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THE YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR I THINK THAT AH YOU KNOW HAVING SAID THAT IT'S THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY YOU KNOW I THINK THAT PROBABLY THE MOST SEVERE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF NIME ARE THE ONES THAT WE SHOW THIS QUARTER YOU KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW TEN TO FIFTEEN BASIS POINTS PROBABLY FURTHER ADJUSTMENT OR SLICE LIGHT IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR OK AND NEXT YEAR I THINK THAT WE WILL PROBABLY GET TO SEE NAMES SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE TO THE ONES THAT WE WERE SEEING IN THIS QUARTER OK NOW REGARDING THE COVERAGE RATIO YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT WE DON'T TARGET THAT COVERAGE RATIO IF THAT'S THAT'S RESULTED IN NUMBERS AND ALSO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU MAKE REFERENCE TO YOU KNOW OUR NUMBER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT LOOKS SLOW RELATIVE TO BANORTE YOU KNOW BANORTE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR THEY HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY PERCENT IN THIS IN THE SECOND QUARTER THEY DID AS WE DID ALSO YOU KNOW INCREASE THE PROVISIONS BUT DIFFERENT TO US YOU KNOW THEY DID A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE OFF FOUR POINT SIX BILLION PESOS SO THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW THEIR CORRESPONDING INCREASE WAS PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT For current circumstances, we have definitely done different types of sensitivity analysis or scenario analysis. Okay, so if there's a V type recovery in the Mexican economy, you know, we have with these quarterly provisions, we're more than covered for the rest of the year. Now, do we think that there's going to be a V type recovery in the Mexican economy? I don't think so. You know, it's very, very low probability. ABILITY: NOW WE HAVE ASSIGNED YOU KNOW THE OUR LEVEL OF PROVISIONS ACCORDING TO OTHER TYPES OF SCENARIOS, YOU KNOW MORE A Y U TYPE OR AN ADVERSE SCENARIO HAVING A G D P CONTRACTION OF TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT YOU KNOW AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THESE QUARTERS PROVISIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR THERE COULD BE CLOSE TO SEVENTY SIX TH TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE G D P A contraction that that you assume ok so so there there should be a direct correlation between expected losses and provisions and the provisions that we are putting forward we think that with the information that we have are quite strong to cover you know expected losses if the economy ends up costing more EXTRACTING MORE THAN WE ARE EXPECTING RIGHT NOW DEFINITELY WE WILL NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS SOMETHING THAT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO YET YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL BANK BANCO DE HONDURAS RELEASED IN THE STABILITY FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT PUBLISHED A FEW WEEKS AGO AN ANALYSIS REGARDING M P I L S FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND WHAT THEY DID IS LOOK AT INFORMATION FROM THE ENTIRE BANKING SYSTEM FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND THEY USED AN ECONOMETRIC MODEL THEY ESTIMATED YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE CRITICAL VARIABLES THAT DETERMINE LENDING POLICY AND THEY BREAK DOWN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN CONSUMER LOANS IN MORTGAGE LOANS AND CORPORATE SO ONCE THEY DETERMINE THIS YOU KNOW THIS ECONOMETRIC MODEL THEY ESTIMATED YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE CRITICAL VARIABLE The metric model then they provided a you know a shock with the variables that we're seeing lately and they estimated how much n p l ratios would derate for the entire banking system for consumer loans that would imply a thirty two percent increase for mortgages nineteen percent and for corporate also thirty two percent so when you do that math and you break it down A loan, you know, by the type of loan, by type of bank, you get to see, you know, this is obviously a bull's-eye estimate, because, obviously, every single bank has different practices in, you know, origination practices, and recoveries, and so on. But you can get a sense of the magnitude in terms of, you know, using this model, how much you would expect that each bank would provision, okay? Sorry, I need more information to accurately transcribe the audio. Can you please provide me with the name of the person speaking, the context of the conversation, and any other relevant details? I'm going to evaluate to create more depending on the behavior of payments after the relief program. And then my second question is a difficult one because we would like to know if you have exposure to aeromexico on the chapter 11 or twelfth that has restructured loans with the banks for about a year but I understand if you cannot disclose your exposure so maybe if you can remind us how much of your loan book is exposed to airlines and how much is exposed to other lending institutions. MUCH TO FOOD AND BEVERAGE AND IS THERE IS A SECTOR THAT IS CONCERNING YOU AND FINALLY MY LAST QUESTION IS SOME COMPETITION IN MORGAGE LOANS WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT BANKS REDUCING THE INTEREST RATES OF MORGAGES IN LIGHT OF THE LOWER RATES SO HOW HAS YOUR STRATEGY TO ATTRACT MORE MORGAGE CLIENTS AND HOW COMPETITIVE IS YOUR INTEREST RATE THANK YOU Thank you, minister. Let me, let me start, and then the director will complement. First of all, on the follow-up of provisions, like I haven't spoken many times to my cio, and he basically tells me that when I asked you and asked the same question, you're asking me at this point, and he basically says, look, I mean, I have a crystal ball, so clear, and it's quite impossible, but it's going to be difficult to assess what we're doing. I mean what I can tell you is that we're doing our best job in basically reviewing the portfolio we do that every single day we review the behavior of it and we're basically trying to be as conservative as we can in order to manage it so and if we see that the portfolio continues to deteriorate or is much more complicated we're going to find out i mean the payment shock comes in the first week of august we're preparing for it Next week, actually, when the first loans that went into the painting holiday start to mature, and we'll see how the performance of the portfolio is, and then we'll take, I mean, you're going to see our numbers, write as, I mean, we want to take the provisions as soon as they come, if they're needed, okay? And our second point, in Argentina, yes, and the same, we do have exposure to them. Nothing that we cannot control or nothing too big for the size of the bank. I mean, our total exposure to airlines is not big. I mean, compared to the total size of the portfolio, I would say probably Guerrero knows a percentage much better, but it's not big. I mean, it's not very significant versus the size of the bank. And we have done some provisions already on some of the exposure we have to Mexico. Okay? We can tell you that in the provisions that we made, some of them are made to for the aluminum exposure which is not relevant. In terms of aluminum, yes we do have exposure to them, also not, I mean, not significant. And we are basically in the restructuring process as of now and we see that the company can recover fairly. I mean, I don't see that aluminum is gonna be a particular situation, food and drink. I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're trying to say. Could you please rephrase your question or statement? Some of the other banks basically have tried to do a little bit of what we do in IPOtec. IPOtec is the best rate available in the market. But in order to get a rate best available in the market which is seven point ninety five percent for a fifteen year mortgage you have to basically turn into turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. What in order to do that you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. What in order to do that you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. What in order to do that you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. What in order to do that you have to basically turn earth into your most important bank, your number one bank. What in order to do that you have to basically BE ABLE TO GET THAT RATE YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS WITH US THAT BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR PAYROLL YOU HAVE TO DIRECT DEBIT YOUR UTILITIES WITH US YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR INSURANCE YOU HAVE SO THERE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT RATE IN THAT REGARD WHAT HAPPENS IS EVEN IF THE LOAN IS AT SEVEN POINT SEVENTY FIVE AND WE'RE ALSO VERY CAUTIOUS IN THE LOAN TO VALUE THAT WE DO IN TH I was explaining in the presentation that's why our ticket for mortgage is thirty seven percent larger than the rest. So we go directly to the mortgage to the wealthy people, okay, to the people that are in the best situation right now. So we believe that our portfolio is more resilient in these particular situations and also that we have the best client because those are the ones that basically can achieve this rate and can achieve this and have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a Characteristics to act in this type of product. So that's why the portfolio we believe is going to behave well and it's going to be managed or is going to behave in a nice, in a nice, in a nice way due to that fact. Okay. So and we have seen the way the portfolio has performed and we see that the performance is according to our expectations given the very complicated circumstances. So in that regard. I MEAN THERE IS COMPETITION. I MEAN THERE ARE SOME BANKS. I MEAN A COUPLE OF BANKS HAVE TRIED TO COME IN AND BASICALLY COMPETE WITH US HAVE TO HELP IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATIONS BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT WE THAT WE SEND TO THE MARKET. THEN WE CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT IS THE HYPOTHECA FREE. THE HYPOTHECA FREE BASICALLY HAS THE PARTICULARITY THAT HAS EVERYTHING INCLUDED IN THE RATE. FOR PEOPLE THAT I MEAN THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS UNDER THE TABLE AND THERE WERE NO COMPLETELY CLEAR THIS IS IMPOSSIBLY TRANSPARENT TO THE CLIENT AND THAT HYPO THEKA IS ABOVE NINETY PERCENT THAT'S THE RATE AND THAT'S FOR A DIFFICULT DIFFERENT TYPE OF CLIENTS SO WE HAVE A CHINESE MENU FOR EVERY TYPE OF DIFFERENT CLIENT THAT WOULD LIKE TO ACCESS WHAT WE DO AND FOR EXAMPLE THE HYPO THEKA FREE GOES TO A DIFFERENT SECTOR THAT IS NEW TO That is basically clients with a lower ticket. And there are some of these clients that are very good and have very good credit quality. And that's where we decided to compete in that sector. I don't know if this answered your question, ernest. And please be a compliment. Sure, ernest. Regarding your first question, ernest, you know, it depends on the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, HOW SEVERE IS THE GDP CONTRACTION THIS YEAR, YOU KNOW, AND HOW THAT IMPACTS THE CAPACITY FOR CLIENTS TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS WE THINK THAT THE YOU KNOW AS MENTIONED IF THERE'S A YOU KNOW LIKE A Y U TYPE RECOVERY AND YOU KNOW GDP CONTRACTING SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN TO TWELVE PERCENT THEN WE HAVE MADE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS QUARTER MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT WE REQUIRED AND THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT WE REQUIRE YOU KNOW WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW OK SO BUT IT'S GONNA BE DEPENDENT ON HOW THIS EVOLVES YOU KNOW AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE CLOSELY MONITORING A YOU KNOW HOW OUR CLIENTS ARE ARE BEHAVING OK NOW ON YOUR SECOND QUESTION REGARDING THE EXPOSURE THAT WE HAVE TO ILLICIT MEXICO AND ALCALAZ YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY FOR CONF THESE TWO EXPOSURES THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT WITHIN OUR TOP TEN EXPOSURES AS HYGIENE MENTIONED WE HAVE ALREADY PREVENTED PARTIALLY THE EXPOSURE THAT WE HAVE WITH IDOMEXICO AND THAT'S CLOSE TO FOURTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE DISPOSURE THAT WE HAVE THAT IS NOT THAT MATERIAL OK AND I DON'T HAVE WITH ME THE BREAK DOWN IN TERMS OF FOOD AND BEVERAGE THE BREAK DOWN THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS MORE THAN THE ONE THAT THE CDC USES MORE I'm sorry, I need more information to provide an accurate transcription. Could you please provide me with the name of the speaker and the context of the conversation? YOU MENTION THAT BASED ON YOUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP ABILITIES YOU SEE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS CONTINUING TO PAY WHAT IS THAT EXACT PERCENTAGE? SORRY THAT'S FORTY PERCENT. I THINK THAT'S FORTY PERCENT. THANK YOU AND NOW FOR MY QUESTION YOU KNOW WE SEE SOME DECLINE IN QUALITY ACROSS THE BOARD AND I apologize, but I am unable to provide a transcription of the audio as the language used is not understandable. Could you please provide me with the language used in the audio so that I can assist you better? CREDIT CARDS YOU DO NOT HAVE A COLLATERAL YOU KNOW SO SO LAWS GIVEN FOR FAULTS IN IN CREDIT CARDS IS CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT YOU KNOW YOU BASICALLY DO NOT RECOVER THAT MUCH YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF CREDIT CARDS YOU KNOW AND YOU THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE ONE OF THE PRODUCTS MOST IMPACTED YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOANS THAT CLIENTS HAVE YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT MORTGAGES ARE THE ONES THAT YOU PAY YOU DON'T YOU KNOW YOU CONTINUE PAYING YOU KNOW IF THERE'S JUST ONE LOAN THAT YOU CONTINUE PAYING THAT'S THAT'S MORTGAGES AND PROBABLY CREDIT CARDS ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PRIORITIES YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A TROUBLE YOU KNOW THE M P E L S THAT WE SEE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU In credit cards, you know, have been increasing slightly, but I think it's relatively stable when you compare it, you know, historically. So we don't, we don't expect, you know, a significant, you know, deterioration, you know, but, you know, the cost of risk, you know, with the provisions that we're taking is close to eleven. Sorry, I need more information to provide a proper answer. Can you please provide me with the question or topic you would like me to help you with? Time, would you like to take the next question? Do you want to take the next question? Sure. The next question comes from Tito Labarta from Goldman Sachs. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the call. Uh, one question on the, uh, market-related income. I know you need to know, uh, the big spike in the quarter. But, uh, do you think that goes back to normal already in the third quarter or do you think that can remain elevated elevated for some period of time? I guess, I know it's tough to predict, but if you could give me some more color on how you think about market-related income going forward, that would be great. Uh, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and If you look at the cost of risk before this quarter, it had been around two point six, two point seven, you know, barring any changes in the scenario that you see right now, is that two point six, two point seven, what we should expect sort of going forward as well, again, barring any significant changes in the current scenario. Thank you. I mean, what i can tell you is, yes, we had a good run in terms of market related. Income, I think the bank's well positioned to do so. The important point is volatility and if volatility continues to be the way it is, then you can expect that we can we can basically have good numbers there. I don't think we're gonna have in the in the in the third quarter numbers as good as they were in the in the in this quarter but it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't A few days in the next few months. In terms of the provisions and the cost of risk, did you want to comment on that? Absolutely, Hirotaka. You know, I think that once you take out the undocumented provisions that we did in this quarter, I think that cost of risk should be slightly higher than the numbers that we were having over the last five quarters. But not to levels that we reported. Quarter. So, somewhere, you know, below the three hundred basis points, that would be my, my take. And, obviously, as you mentioned, you know, with the information that we currently have, okay? I have a question about credit risk, but not to your corporate, but to the stress of the financial system. We already saw one company that has been liquidated or has been put into liquidation by the national banking commission. This is becoming a very long crisis, with ten percent of the economy being unable to operate. So, eventually, one would imagine that some situations might get into trouble. In regard to any effects of the financial system and do you think we'll you'll encounter much trouble or most of them will be able to go through this okay. Thank you. Thank you. Cavelos, I mean, I mean in all these particular situations and depend how long the crisis is gonna take. I mean it's probably gonna take down some financial patiers. In that sense we are yes, we are being very cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what they're doing. POSITION IS AND THEIR SITUATION AND WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT AS THE CRISIS CONTINUES TO TO EVOLVE SO IN THAT SENSE WE ARE VERY CLOSE IN TO THAT PARTICULAR SECTOR WE DON'T HAVE I MEAN WE ARE NOT A BIG LENDER TO THE SECTOR I MEAN WE ARE NOT A BIG LENDER TO THE SECTOR THERE ARE THERE ARE TEN MOST IMPORTANT CLIENTS THERE ARE THERE ARE TEN MOST IMPORTANT CLIENTS THERE ARE THERE ARE TEN MOST IMPORTANT CLIENTS THERE NOT FINANCIAL PLAYERS SO IN THAT SENSE WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE EXPOSURE THAT WE HAVE OUT TO THEM BUT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT TAKING A LOOK AND MONITORING THEM ALL THE TIME OK HOPEFULLY THE CRISIS SHORTENS AND NOBODY ELSE GOES DOWN BUT LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS MICRO FINANCE IS A SECTOR THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CLOSELY MONITORING. WE DON'T HAVE TO WE DON'T HAVE TO ALOUD BIG SCORES TO THEM BUT THAT'S A SECTOR THAT CORPORATELY WOULD BE COMPLICATED AS ALWAYS IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATIONS THE PEOPLE THAT SUFFER THE MOST ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ON THE BASES OF THE PYRAMID. SO FORTUNATELY THAT'S THE CASE AND WE ARE MONITORING THAT WELL. 非常感谢您。 I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? IT WAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE REPORTED SINCE WE BECAME A LISTED COMPANY, CLOSE TO NINETY TWO PERCENT. SO THAT'S THAT'S IN MY OPINION THAT'S THE MOST ROBUST AND FUNDAMENTAL WAY OF LOOKING AT IT. THEN AS YOU RIGHTLY MENTIONED THE DEBT ISHANCE IS YOU HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE INCREASE OF OUR LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO. The ratio and we are monitoring any potential use of the committed lines of credit that we have with our clients. If you look at it, it's probably the one, let's say, risk that could materialize in the short term. We have ample liquidity to honor every single committed line of credit that we have. Money is the most relevant driver in terms of consumption of liquidity. The other types of events that could impact our liquidity, you know, are more gradual, you know. And those could be, you know, a construction in deposits that we're not seeing that. And I think that the bank has managed, you know, quite well. Invasively know of liquidity to be prepared for any potential really worst case scenario further down the road. Thank you. And regarding the lineup in your balance sheet, the lineup of banks and other loans which increased eighty one percent quarter over quarter, do you think this lineup would remain at those levels or do you think you could substitute this source of funding with some other source of funding? PROBABLY OTHER ISSUES IN COMING QUARTERS. WHAT'S YOUR STUDY THERE? YOU KNOW, WE WE MONITOR CONSTANTLY THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNDING SOURCES AND DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE AE YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT NOT ONLY THAT PARTICULAR LINE ITEM BUT EVERY SINGLE LINE ITEM IS IS RUBBED YOU KNOW AND UNDER CURRENT MARKET SITUATIONS WE YOU KNOW IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO LOOK AT BETTER WAYS OF AE AE YOU KNOW NOT ONLY FUNDING THE BANK BUT KEEPING THE STRUCTURES IN PLACE SO THAT THE BANK YOU KNOW CAN CONTINUE SUPPORTING YOU KNOW LONG TERM GROWTH Sorry, I didn't understand what you said. Could you please rephrase your question or statement in English? I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? The second question is regarding the special accounting criteria. When we look at those numbers, the balance of NPVs are much higher than the ones, the old accounting versus the current special accounting. And I would like to understand the difference here if it's like a very negative outlook with which you see, you know, like those numbers materializing as losses. So, if you can explain for me the differences on the special accounting versus the old accounting. And if the balance of NPV there may become losses, I would appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nUm, hi Yuri. In terms of the NPV ratio, you know, this quarter, what drove the slight deterioration was basically credit cards that went up from 49 to 48 to 47 to 46 to 45 to 44 to 43 to 42 to 41 to 40 to 39 to 38 to 37 to 36 to 35 to 34 to 33 to 32 to 31 to 30 to 29 to 28 to 27 to 26 to 25 to 24 to 23 to 22 to 21 to 20 to 19 FROM TWO POINT SIXTY ONE PERCENT TO THREE POINT THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT UM AS AS WE DISCUSSED DURING THE QUARTER DURING THE CALL UM AS WE DISCUSSED DURING THE QUARTER DURING THE CALL UM AS WE DISCUSSED DURING THE QUARTER DURING THE CALL UM AS WE DISCUSSED DURING THE QUARTER DURING THE CALL UM AS WE DISCUSSED DURING THE QUARTER DURING THE CALL UM AS WE DISCUSSED DURING THE QUARTER DURING THE CALL UM AS WE DISC AND IT'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN OUR VIEW GIVEN YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ECONOMY IT'S JUST YOU KNOW A SLIGHT DETERIORATION NOW ON YOUR SECOND QUESTION CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE COMPARING IT TO YOU KNOW THE SPECIAL ACCOUNTING CRITERIA TO THE OTHER ACCOUNTING CRITERIA SO BEFORE THE SIXTH DEGREE REGULATIONS FOR COVID-19 YOU HAVE LIKE A TABLE ON YOUR RELEASE COMPARING THE SPECIAL ACCOUNTING CRITERIA VERSUS THE FORMER I THINK LIKE B D SIX ACCOUNTING CRITERIA AND WHEN WE LOOK TO THE BALANCE OF NON-PERFORMING LOANS I BELIEVE THE BALANCE YOU HAD TO DATE SOMETHING AROUND LIKE EIGHT TEN BILLION PESOS NINETY TEN BILLION PESOS THAT IMPLIES THE TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT INTEREST RATE BUT IF YOU LOOK TO THE OLDER ACCOUNTING CRITERIA THE D I THINK THE BALANCE OF NPLS ARE CLOSER TO FORTY FORTY FOUR BILLION PESOS SO THE NPL RATIO WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER I UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE A LOT OF LOANS THAT DO NOT REALLY BECOME NPLS THERE THEY ARE THERE BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT AS SOON AS THESE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA GO GOES BACK TO NORMAL IF WE COULD SEE YOU KNOW LIKE A HIGHER NEED OF PROVISIONS WORKING ON NPLS SO THAT'S WHY I ASK THE DIFFERENCE AND IF IT IF IT MAKES SENSE YOU KNOW I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S IN MY OPINION IT'S IT'S SOMEHOW EXTREME COMPARISON OH KAY SO IT HAS TO DO WITH YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE SPECIAL ACCOUNTING CRITERIA YOU BASICALLY ALLOW CLIENTS NOT TO PAY YOU KNOW EVERY CLIENT THAT'S NOT PAYING THEIR INTEREST IN CAPITAL IT STAYS CURRENT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW AND UNDER THE OLD OR PREVAILING ACCOUNTING CRITERIA YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT JUST THE BAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE NINETY DAYS PAST DUE AND DEPENDING ON IF YOU ARE YOU KNOW LET'S SAY A CORPORATE CLIENT YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID BACK WHETHER YOU ARE TWENTY PERCENT OR MORE OR HOW THE TIME THAT HAS ELAPSED YOU KNOW IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT I THINK THAT AS SOON AS CLIENTS START PAYING BACK OR NOT WE WILL GET TO KNOW YOU KNOW HOW YOU KNOW THE MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACT OK RATHER THAN JUST MAKING YOU KNOW SOME ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU KNOW COULD MATERIALIZE OR NOT AS MENTIONED DURING THE CALL I THINK THAT WE HAVE MADE A GOOD ASSESSMENT IN TERMS OF THE RISK THAT EACH CLIENT HAS YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM AND WE HAVE ALSO ASKED THEM YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE DOING AND WHETHER THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PAY BACK SO TAKING ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT THAT'S HOW WE WE HAVE COME UP WITH THESE AYE AYE PROVISIONS ASSASSOCIATED WITH THE SPECTIC LOSSES THAT YOU ASSUMED SO I WOULD I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU JUDIE JUST TO WAIT A COUPLE OF QUARTERS AND WITH THE HARD DATA YOU KNOW JUST ANALYZE IF WE BE THE YOU KNOW ONE HAND THE BENEF I apologize for the inconvenience. The next question comes from Nicole Rivera from the Bank of America. Yes, thank you very much. We will take the next question. It comes from Nicole Rivera from the Bank of America. Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. I have only one question. I apologize if you already answered it. I think the true impact that has had on our asset quality is unclear. No, that's very clear. Thank you very much. We will take the next question. It comes from Nicole Rivera from the Bank of America. Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. I have only one question. I apologize if you already answered it. I think the true impact that has had on our asset quality is unclear. No, that's very clear. Thank you very much. We will take the next AND YOU MENTIONED THAT NINETY PERCENT OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO SOME KIND OF DEBT RELIEF MEASURES PAYMENT HOLIDAYS GIVEN BREAKS PERIODS HAVE THESE MEASURES ENDED ALREADY FOR ANY CLIENTS AND IF SO IF YOU CAN TELL US WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF THIS CLIENTS THAT HAVE RESUMED PAYMENTS ALREADY SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF THIS CLIENTS THAT HAVE RESUMED PAYMENTS ALREADY SINCE THE PANDE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS IN THE FULL OUTBREAK OF THE PANDEMIC AND IF THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IF THE PAYMENT HOLIDAY HAS ENDED FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CLIENTS IF YOU CAN TELL US WHEN YOU MADE THIS PROVISION CHARGE OF THE THREE POINT NINE BILLION PESOS IN THIS QUARTER DID YOU INCORPORATE ANY ASSUMPTION IN TERMS OF WHAT WOULD BE THE PERCENTAGE OF THIS NINETEEN PERCENT OF THIS CLIENTS UNDER THE RELIEF PROGRAMME I WILL PAY YOU BACK ONCE THE PAYMENT HOLIDAY ENDS THANK YOU YOU KNOW FIRST THE PAYMENT HOLIDAYS PAYMENT HOLIDAY PERIOD ENDS TOMORROW SO WE'LL START THE BAY YOU YOU KNOW SEEING WHETHER CLIENTS PAY BACK OR NOT IN STARTING NEXT WEEK WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION YET NOW REGARDING HOW WE MADE PROVISIONS FOR THIS QUARTER You know, and as mentioned throughout the call, we classified the clients depending on the risk that they have, the exposure that they have with us, the relationship that they have with us. So, we, we classified the retail clients in twenty-five clusters and SMEs in eleven clusters. So, depending on the level of clustering that you have, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know A CLIENT FALLS IN YOU KNOW THERE'S EITHER A HIGH RISK OR HIGH EXPOSURE A CATEGORY YOU KNOW FOR CLIENTS AND WE ASSUME CERTAIN PROBABILITY OF THOSE CLUSTERS EITHER PAYING BACK THEIR LOANS OR NOT OKAY THAT'S HOW WE CAME UP WITH WE WITH WE THE PROVISION THAT WE WE WE MADE THIS QUARTER SO YES THERE'S BUT IT DEPENDS YOU KNOW THERE ARE THIRTY SIX RESPONSES IN TERMS OF WHETHER PAY BACK A HIGH RISK OR HIGH EXPOSURE Numerous or low number of clients to pay back their loans. It's it you know it's it's because of these analysis that we've done that we feel relatively confident that with the information that we have what we have provided is is is good is a good provision for asset quality deterioration for the rest of the year ok thank you very much the next question comes from olivo artuzo from ubs please go ahead Okay, thank you very much for taking my question. It is just one. I just wanted to understand the dynamic of the credit relief program held by the bank and the hike on NPLs to two point five percent. According to my calculation, the deferred loans reach almost fifteen percent of total loans. If I am not wrong, they are roughly a similar level to the other banks, but different from other players and even considered. And the Brazilian and Chilean subsidiaries they have also fostered their credit relief problem. N.P.L. decreased in the second quarter. You mentioned that this deterioration is emanating from the S.E.M. and the credit card segment. So I just wanted to understand if this hike in N.P.L.s behaved worse than expected by the bank considering the amount of loans that were owed. And what does the bank cease for this semester in terms of fostering? The credit relief program, in case of regulators, extend the schedule and change the rules forward. So, thank you very much. No, I think that, you know, the first of all, you know, the, the, the increase that we see in the second quarter is associated with those clients that do not enter into the relief program. Okay, so it has to do with that. Eighty one percent. Of clients that decided not to enter into into the program and obviously those clients are also exposed to the the deration of the economic activity you know the ector mentioned you know the the losses that you know the unemployed losses that we've seen so it's it has to do more with that okay with the clients that do not enter into into the program and obviously those clients are also exposed to the the deration of the economic activity you know the ector mentioned you know the the losses that you know the unemployed losses that we've seen so it's it has to do more with that okay with the clients that do not enter into into the program and obviously those clients are also exposed to the the deration of the economic activity you know the ector mentioned you know the the losses that you know the unemployed losses that we've seen so it's Whether we were expecting you know that type of deterioration, you know, I think that if someone tells you that they were envisioning this type of economic deterioration, I think that they're lying. You know, I think that we were not expecting this type of contraction, you know, the magnitude that we were seeing. If you look at how every single analyst updates its The forecast for the Mexican economy every week you get to see the downward adjustments. So, so I think that it does not surprise us. You know, we mentioned that given this, this deterioration of a economic activity, we think it's just a slight deterioration. Okay. But as mentioned, we will get to see the final impact or the final result. FINAL NUMBERS PROBABLY IN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE QUARTERS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ONLY YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS THE REST OF THE YEAR I THINK THAT THIS IS THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC AT LEAST FROM MEXICO HAS A POSSIBILITY OF YOU KNOW GOING FURTHER THAN JUST TWENTY ZERO SO WE'LL GET TO SEE THAT OH I THINK IT'S QUITE EARLY TO TO HAVE A DEFINITIVE VIEW ON COMPLETE IMPACT OF A PANDEMIC ON OUR ECONOMY Quality:\n\n* OK, OK, thank you very much.\n* The last question comes from Bikash Bhattacharjee from Pactuall. Please go ahead.\n* Hi, everyone. My questions were already answered. Thank you very much. There are no further questions in the queue, and I would like to turn the floor back over to Mister Ector Chavez for any closing remarks.

FROM OUR US REGIONAL BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDERS GROWING 37% OVER THE PREVIOUS PERIOD AND 58% OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR SO BROAD-BASED GROWTH ABOVE ACROSS BOTH DIRECT AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FROM A

FIBER BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURES CAUSING GOVERNMENTS TO CAREFULLY RECONSIDER THE SECURITY RISKS OF THEIR NETWORKS AND IMPLEMENTATION POLICIES AND ARE IMPLEMENTING POLICIES TO BAN HIGH-RISK VENDORS FROM

AS COMPARED TO 41.6% IN THE PRIOR QUARTER AND 41% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 THE QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER INCREASE IN BOTH GAAP AND NON- GAAP GROSS MARGINS WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN VOLUME AS WELL AS FAVORABLE PRODUCT AND SERVICES MIX AND LOWER FREIGHT-RELATED CHARGES IN THE CURRENT QUARTER THE INCREASES IN BOTH GAAP AND NON- GAAP GROSS MARGINS ON A YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN VOLUME AS WELL AS PRODUCT MIX WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FREIGHT-RELATED CHARGES AND EXPEDITE PREMIUMS TELE-OPERATING EXPENSES ON A GAAP BASIS WERE $54.4 MILLION FOR QUARTER THREE OF 2020 COMPARED TO $59.5 MILLION REPORTED IN THE PRIOR QUARTER AND $62.7 MILLION FOR QUARTER THREE OF 2019 THE QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO MARKET-DRIVEN DECREASES IN OUR DEFERRED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS WELL AS EXPENSE REDUCTIONS IN BOTH R&D AND SGNA AS A RESULT OF OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM INITIATED IN 2019 AND REDUCED TRAVEL EXPENSES OFFSET BY INCREASES IN SOME RESTRUCTURING-RELATED COSTS THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES WERE A RESULT OF LOWER EXPENSES IN BOTH R&D AND SGNA AND LOWER TRAVEL-RELATED EXPENSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MARKET-DRIVEN

PRIOR QUARTER AND $59.4 MILLION IN QUARTER THREE OF 2019 BOTH THE NON- GAAP QUARTER OF A QUARTER AND YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSE WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPENSE

DECREASES IN BOTH GAAP AND NON- GAAP OTHER INCOME AS COMPARED TO QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER WERE PRIMARILY MARKET-DRIVEN CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THE DECREASE IN GAAP AND NON- GAAP OTHER INCOME ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REALIZED FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES OFFSET BY MARKET-DRIVEN UPSIDES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THE COMPANY'S

CURRENT QUARTER TAX EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PROFITABILITY IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AS THE DEFERRED TAX BENEFITS GENERATED BY OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS CONTINUE TO BE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE THE TAX EXPENSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF LAST YEAR WAS THE RESULT OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR DOMESTIC DEFERRED TAX ASSETS GAAP NET INCOME FOR QUARTER THREE OF 2020 WAS

TOTALED $132.2 MILLION BY QUARTER END AFTER PAYING $4.3 MILLION IN DIVIDENDS DURING THE QUARTER FOR THE QUARTER WE USED $7 MILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS NET TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS $1.2 MILLION AT QUARTER END RESULTING IN A DSO OF 69 DAYS COMPARED TO 67 DAYS IN THE PRIOR QUARTER AND 73 DAYS AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER 2019 THE VARIABILITY IN DSOS QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER AND YEAR-OVER-YEAR IS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS DURING THE QUARTER AND CUSTOMER MIX NET INVENTORIES ENDED THE QUARTER AT $120.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $106.1 MILLION IN Q2 OF 2020 AND $104.9 MILLION AT THE END OF Q3 2019 THE INCREASE IN OUR INVENTORIES FOR THE QUARTER THAT JUST ENDED WAS IN PREPARATION FOR NEW PRODUCT RAMP-UPS AND STRATEGIC INVENTORY BUFFER PURCHASES MADE TO ENSURE SUPPLY CONTINUITY DURING THE PANDEMIC WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE POSITIONED TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT LOOKING AHEAD TO THE NEXT QUARTER THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC THE ABILITY OF COMPONENTS SUPPLIES TO ALIGN WITH OUR CUSTOMER DEMAND THE BOOK-AND-SHIP NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS THE TIMING OF THE REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE PROJECTS THE VARIABILITY OF ORDER PATTERNS INTO THE CUSTOMER BASE IN WHICH WE SELL AS WELL AS THE FLUCTUATION AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY CAUSE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR EXPECTATIONS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS WE EXPECT THAT OUR FOURTH QUARTER 2020 REVENUE WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF $122 MILLION TO $132 MILLION DOLLARS AFTER CONSIDERING THE PROJECTED SALES MIX WE EXPECT THAT OUR FOURTH-QUARTER GROSS MARGIN ON A NON- GAAP BASIS WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF 41% TO 42% WE ALSO EXPECT NON- GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2020 WILL BE BETWEEN $50 AND $51 MILLION AND FINALLY WE ANTICIPATE THE CONSOLIDATED TAX RATE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2020 ON A NON- GAAP BASIS WILL BE A BENEFIT AT A MID-SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE RATE RESULTING FROM THE EXPECTED MIX OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME IN THE QUARTER WE BELIEVE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IMPACTING REVENUE AND EARNINGS REALIZED IN 2020 WILL BE COMPONENT AVAILABILITY A MACRO SPENDING ENVIRONMENT FOR CARRIERS AND ENTERPRISES ONGOING EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC THE VARIABILITY OF MIX AND REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECT ROLL-OUTS THE PROPORTION OF INTERNATIONAL REAL- REVENUE RELATIVE TO OUR TOTAL REVENUE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ACTIVITY LEVELS IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS THE ADOPTION RATE OF OUR BROADBAND ACCESS PLATFORMS POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TAX LAWS CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

WE EXPECT YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A PLAN TO GET TO ABOUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND WE EXPECT THAT WE'RE GONNA HOLD THAT INTO NEXT YEAR SO I I WOULDN'T TRY TO MODEL ANY INCREASES I THINK LIKE A LOT OF

SUSTAINABILITY OF THE MOMENTUM THE <INAUDIBLE> UM UH FIRST OF ALL A LOT OF ACTIVITY AND I TAL- I I TOUCHED ON THE GROWTH RATES IN THE TIER THREE SPACE A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE TIER THREES UM WHICH IS YOU KNOW JUST SEPARATE FROM WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RDOF SO UM A LOT OF NETWORK UPGRADES WE ROLLED OUT OUR COMBO CARD WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE 10-GIG SOLUTION A GOOD PICKUP ON THE COMBO CARD UM AND SO JUST A LOT OF ACTIVITY AND AND I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS GOT TO DO WITH JUST END USER DEMAND YOU KNOW BASED OFF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THE R- YOU KNOW IMPORTANCE OF THE CONNECTIVITY UM SAME THING IN THE TIER TWOS I THINK THE TIER TWOS UM FINALLY UM GAINED PAST WHATEVER FINANCIAL ISSUES THEY MAY HAVE HAD AND SOME OF THEM HAVE STARTED EXECUTING ONE OF THEM EXPLICITLY STARTED EXECUTING ON EXPANSION PLANS UM AND I DON'T SEE THAT STOPPING UM AND I THINK THE OTHER ONE ACTUALLY IS KIND OF OPENED UP AND GETTING BETTER UM AND THAT INCLUDES NOT JUST THOSE BUT SOME OF THE MSOS AS WELL SO I I I DON'T SEE A NEAR-TERM END IN FACT I SEE PEOPLE PLANNING FARTHER OUT THAN UM AND KIND OF FIGURING OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO READJUST TO YOU KNOW WHAT MAY BE A DIFFERENT WORK ENVIRONMENT UM IN A LOT OF AREAS THAN WHAT THEY HAD GOING INTO THIS PANDEMIC AND I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL PANDEMIC-DRIVEN EITHER I MEAN THE THE ACTIVITY THAT'S GOING ON IN THE TIER TWOS HAS BEEN PART OF THEIR STATED PLAN IT JUST GOT PUT OFF THE TIER THREES HAVE BEEN HEATING UP FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME EVEN PRIOR TO THAT AND WE HAD SOLID GROWTH IN THAT SPACE LAST YEAR AS WELL UM AND THEN UH THE TIER ONE UM YOU KNOW WE REALLY IN THE US WE'RE IN THE CABLE MSO SPACE AND WE'RE WITH A WITH LARGE CARRIERS AND UH WITH ONE OF THOSE LARGE CARRIERS HERE IN THE TELCO SPACE IN RELATION TO PON AND I WOULD SAY THE ACTIVITY THERE IS UM I WOULD SAY WE'VE SEEN GOOD ACTIVITY I WOULDN'T CALL IT MID YOU KNOW UM EARTH-SHATTERING I WOULD SAY IT'S SOLID UM AND THERE'S MORE A LOT OF THAT WORK IS REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO INTO NEXT YEAR SO I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS JUST I THINK IT WILL PICK UP THERE WE'LL PROBABLY BE A YEAR YOU KNOW THIS TIME NEXT YEAR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAN THAT UM DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT IT DOES IT DOES THANKS A LOT AND JUST FOR A QUICK FOLLOWUP ON THE GROSS MARGIN I KNOW YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THAT VOLUMES AND PRODUCT MIX MAYBE UM COULD YOU EXPAND ON IT SO WE COULD MAKE LIKE WHAT <INAUDIBLE> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT SO IT'S PRODUCT MIX I MEAN AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S WE'RE SELLING UM WITHOUT GETTING TOO DEEP INTO IT WE WE'RE SELLING PON YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS IF YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT OUR BUSINESS HAS DONE UM WE'VE REALLY MADE THE TRANSITION FROM COPPER TO FIBER AND SOME OF THE FIBER COMPONENTS THAT WE'RE SELLING SPECIFICALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LLPS AND STUFF JUST HAVE A RICHER MIX WE ALSO HAVE UM BASED OFF OF INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC REVENUE MIX WE HAVE A YOU KNOW A MATERIALS DIFFERENCE IN THOSE GROSS MARGIN PROFILES THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE TWO BIGGEST THINGS THAT THAT WERE DRIVING GROSS MARGIN DIFFERENCE MAKES SENSE THANK YOU OKAY YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FORM THE LINE OF PAUL SILVERSTEIN OF COWEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN TOM JUST A CLARIFICATION UH FIRST BEFORE MY QUESTION SO THE RESPONSE OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTION O- OBVIOUSLY OR I TRUST NON-US IS LOWER MARGIN THAN THE US AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION BUT ON THE PRODUCT PIECE OF THE REVENUE I APOLOGIZE IF YOU JUST SAID THIS THE MARGIN DIFFERENTIAL IT IT'S MORE FAVORABLE FOR YOUR FIBER-BASED OR LESS FAVORABLE IS THAT IS THAT THE DISTINCTION YOU'RE MAKING IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCT MIX INFLUENCING THE GROSS MARGIN PROFILE AND AND WHAT IS THE KEY DIFFERENCE THERE ON THE PRODUCT SIDE YEAH I I WOULD SAY ON THE I I WOULD SAY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FIBER SPACE IS WE'RE SELLING UM THE MIX TOWARDS LLPS IS MUCH HIGHER GOT IT <CROSSTALK> EXACTLY SORRY GOT IT SO THAT THAT IS THE KEY DRIVER IN THE PRODUCT MIX UH THAT'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE THEM LISTED THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S DEFINITELY IN THE TOP THREE ALL RIGHT WE MIGHT- WE HAVE A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP MY I APOLOGIZE- GO AHEAD MIKE OF COURSE I ASK YOU EVERY QUARTER IN TERMS OF LONGTERM MARKET PROFILE YOU OBVIOUSLY JUST HAD A VERY GOOD MARKET QUARTER DRIVEN BY BOTH VOLUME AND THE SHIFT TO LLPS YOUR GUIDING BACK TO YOUR TRADITIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE LOW 40S FOR THE UH DECEMBER QUARTER HAS THERE BEEN ANY CHANGE IN REVIEW ABOUT WHAT RETURN ARE YOU STILL LOOKING AT LOW 40S GROSS MARGIN PROFILE LONGER-TERM LOW WITH THE BENEFIT OF VOLUME WITH SHIFT TO LLPS CAN THAT BE BETTER THAN THAT AND I'VE GOT ONE FOLLOWUP QUESTION YEAH I THINK I WAS I WOULD SAY LOW TO MID SO SOMEWHERE RIGHT IN IN THAT RANGE AND YOU YOU SEE VARIABILITY HERE AND REMEMBER IN Q1 WE WERE PRETTY HOT SO IT JUMPS AROUND A LOT SO I TRY TO PROJECT THIS BY LOOKING AT WHAT WE SEE BUT WE ARE BOOK-AND-SHIP BUSINESS AND WHAT COMES IN DURING A QUARTER IS A LITTLE BIT HARD TO TO TEST BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT 41-42 GUIDANCE IS PROBABLY WHAT THE MIX WILL TURN OUT TO BE FOR THE QUARTER UH <INAUDIBLE> UH I THINK THE VARIABILITY ALSO LIKE THE THING TO TO UM MAYBE THINK ABOUT PAUL AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TWO OR THREES WILL DO NEXT YEAR IF TWO OR THREES ARE STRONG THAT TYPICALLY HELPS US BECAUSE NOT JUST THE THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY BUY BUT ALSO THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO THAT TENDS TO DRIVE MORE STRENGTH THE THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FACTOR IN AT THIS POINT IN NOT CHANGING THE LONGER-TERM GUIDANCE IS THERE IS A SI- REAL POTENTIAL FOR MATERIAL INTERNATIONAL REVENUE UP-TICKING NEXT YEAR AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TIER THREES HERE IN THE US ARE GOING TO KEEP PACE WITH THAT IS IS KIND OF THE THING THAT YOU KNOW WE JUST HAVE TO LOOK AND SEE BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE PRESSURE UM SOME OF THE PRESSURE'S BEEN ALLEVIATED IN PLACES LIKE EUROPE BECAUSE OF THE THE STANCE ON ON YOU KNOW ON SOME OF THE VENDORS THERE BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL A HANGOVER EFFECT ON ALL OF THAT AND THE STRONGER THAT THAT THAT BUSINESS IS YOU'LL TEND TO SEE A WEAKNESS IN THE GROSS MARGIN SO TOM FROM THE STATEMENT YOU JUST MADE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN TIER THREE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE ARE TIER THREE TODAY UH WE MANU- WE REALLY DON'T BREAK THAT OUT I TELL YOU IT'S VERY YOU KNOW IT'S MATERIAL IT'S OVER I THINK NOW IT'S OVER $50 MILLION BUT UM WE DON'T BREAK THAT UP ONE QUICK FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY I I KNOW IT'S HARD PREDICTING THE FUTURE BUT THE SOONER YOU GET THE REVENUES YOU'RE EXPECTING FROM THESE NEW TIER ONE WINS UM HOW LIKE DO YOU ALL HAVE ANY VISIBILITY AS TO WHAT THE MARGIN PROFILE IS IN TOTAL NOT ASKING FOR ANY SPECIFIC CUSTOMER BUT ON THE TIER ONES WOULD THAT BE CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT MARKET STRUCTURE WOULD

PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO OUT AND REPLACE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY DON'T HAVE TO WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE SDX THERE'S JUST NOTHING ELSE OUT THERE IT'S COMPLETELY DESEGREGATED IT IS THE NEXT-GENERATION SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS THAT'S ACTUALLY NOW OUT IN THE MARKET WE'VE ACTUALLY SHIPPED IT TO PAYING CUSTOMERS IT IS WHAT HAS BEEN SELECTED BY PRETTY MUCH EVERY TIER ONE THAT WE HAVE WON IN RELATION TO PON AND WE THINK IT IS THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT WILL TOUCH IT RIGHT NOW UM THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT KIND OF TRY ARE ARE REACTING TO IT UM BUT WE THINK WE HAVE A

MORNING UM YOU ANSWERED A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS ON THAT LAST ONE THERE UM BUT I WILL SAY THAT UH ACTUALLY NOKIA MADE THE SAME COMMENT THIS QUARTER WITH REGARD TO- I I CAN BELIEVE IT THAT'S <CROSSTALK> YEAH REGARDING UH FIBER ECLIPSING AND COPPER IN THEIR ACCESS STATEMENT SO THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE WELL WHAT COMMENT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT UH I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SDX I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING- OH TALKING ABOUT THEIR DIS-AGGREGATED SOLUTION OH OKAY I SEE UM A LITTLE COMPETITIVE INTENSITY THERE YEAH BUT THOSE SUCCESSES AND INDUSTRY-WIDE YOU KNOW TREND TOWARD COPPER GOING ON AND SO THANKS FOR CLARIFYING THAT FIBER WAS LARGER THIS QUARTER I WANT TO FOLLOW BACK UP ON THE TIER THREE COMMENT THAT THAT 50 MILLION THAT'S A QUARTERLY NUMBER THAT YOU GAVE FOR THE SIZE OF THE TIER THREE OKAY SO WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S INTERESTING AND- I I SAID LARGER THAN 50 LIKE I SAID WE DON'T- I HEAR YOU OBVI- OKAY YEAH AND THAT THAT WOULD MAKE IT YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR LARGEST SEGMENT IF YOU LOOK AT KIND OF INTERNATIONAL US TIER THREE TIER TWO AND TIER ONE YOU KNOW BY SOME DISTANCE ACTUALLY AND YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY SEEING GOOD GROWTH THERE AND YOU HAD A LOT OF IMPRESSIVE GROWTH NUMBERS IN VARIOUS SEGMENTS MOST OF WHICH WOULD SEEM TO IMPLY SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF KIND OF A I DON'T KNOW 30% YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE AMONG US TIER ONES OR YOU KNOW OTHER PARTS OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE DOMESTIC-BASED AND YOU KNOW I'M GUESSING THAT MAY BE A FUNCTION OF THE YOU KNOW THE COPPER PROGRAMS THAT YOU REFERENCE BUT YOU KNOW IS IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT AND WHAT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO KIND OF YOU KNOW WILL WILL IT TAKE THE THE NEW DEAL COMING IN TO KIND OF STABILIZE AND MAKE THAT GROW OR OR HOW ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT PART OF YOUR BUSINESS YEAH SO I DON'T THINK IT'S TIER ONES I THINK THAT I THINK IT'S I THINK IN TIER TWOS AND TIER THREES ON THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS WE'VE DONE GOOD I THINK THE ISSUE THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR WAS PREDOMINANTLY ON A COP BASIS WAS PREDOMINANTLY TELMEX AND SO WE HAVE A LARGE COPPER-BASED PROGRAM GOING ON WITH THEM THAT WAS TENS OF MILLIONS A QUARTER AND IT JUST COMPLETELY STOPPED SO THE THE HOLE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET IS TELMEX NOT IT'S NOT THE US CARRIER BASE AND THAT WAS VERY MUCH A COPPER-BASED VECTORED UH VSO SOLUTION THAT THEY'RE ROLLING OUT UM I THINK I JUST ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION IS THAT UH YEAH IN PART AND LAST ONE FOR ME IS UH YOU KNOW AS YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL GROWTH UH NEXT YEAR YOU KNOW OB- OBVIOUSLY SHOULD THE TIER THREES CONTINUE TO GROW YOU KNOW 60% MAYBE THEY COULD KEEP UP WITH THAT UM RATE OF GROWTH I ASSUME FOR PLANNING PURPOSES YOU KNOW YOU MODEL SOME SLOWING IN THAT TIER THREE GROWTH RATE DESPITE YOU KNOW OUR OFF-RAMPING UP IN SOME OTHER POSITIVE DRIVERS UM JUST JUST TO BEGIN WITH AND YOU KNOW CAN WE ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW FROM AN INTERNATIONAL STANDPOINT YOU KNOW YOU EXPECT INTERNATIONAL REVENUES TO GROW FASTER THAN DOMESTIC NEXT YEAR GOOD GOOD THAT IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION THAT I I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU TODAY SO IT IT IT FOR THAT UM THE THING ABOUT THE TIER THREES IS NOT JUST A A UH LET ME JUST SAY OFF-CARRIERS BECAUSE IT'S BROADER THAN TRADITIONAL TIER THREE CARRIERS BUT THE THING ABOUT UM THESE THESE CARRIERS IS THE GROWTH RATE THROUGH THE YEAR HAS BEEN INCREASING AND I I DON'T SEE A CHANGE IN NEXT YEAR SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO QUARTERS OF GROWTH BEFORE THESE YOU KNOW THE THE UM REALLY THAT ONE MAMMOTH TIER ONE IN IN EUROPE THAT IS GONNA START THAT'S GONNA BE ALL OF THE MENTAL AND WE'RE ABOUT TO ECLIPSE IT NOW THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER ACTIVITIES GOING ON THERE'S UM A PROCESS GOING ON IN AUSTRALIA UH CARRIERS LIKE UM ORANGE WHO WE ANNOUNCED AN AWARD WITH UM VODAFONE ALL OF THESE TELEFONICA UM WHICH IS OF COURSE NOT JUST IN EUROPE BUT IN BRAZIL ALL OF THOSE HAVE GOT PROCESSES THAT ARE IN PLACE OR ARE UH WHERE THEY'RE COMING TOWARDS A DECISION BUT THOSE WILL CARRY THOSE ARE REALLY IF YOU THINK THEY DON'T GET AWARDED UNTIL NEXT YEAR THEY'RE A YEAR AWAY FROM THAT SO THE REAL MAMMOTH MEETING FOR MENTAL PIECE WAS UM A NEW CUSTOMER FORCE THAT THAT'S UM DEPLOYING THE SDX NEXT YEAR AND IT IT'LL JUST BE STARTING AROUND THE HALF SO I COULD ABSOLUTELY ENVISION NEXT YEAR WHERE UM THE TIER THREES ACTUALLY ECLIPSE IT ON A PURE GROWTH KNOWLEDGE BASIS UM BUT I BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR A FACT YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE TO GET INTO THE YEAR AND REALLY SEE RDOF WILL START AROUND THE TURN OF THE SECOND HALF BUT IF YOU KNOW REALLY FOR IT TO BE MATERIAL THAT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME SO YOU KNOW THAT'LL JUST BE I I

THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WHICH MAY BE MADE DURING THE CALL. IT IS NOW MY PLEASURE TO TURN THE CALL OVER TO TOM STANTON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ADVANCER. SIR, P Good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter 2020 conference call. With me today is Adtran CFO Mike Fiorentino. Following my opening remarks, Mike will review the quarterly financial performance in detail and then we'll take any questions that you may have. I'd like to begin by expressing our concern and sympathy for those affected by the ongoing global pandemic that has touched our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. The current times have changed the way we communicate, work, and live. MERN AND I REMAIN ENCOURAGED BY OUR PERSEVERANCE AND THE FAITH OF SUCH ADVERSITY WITH THESE CHALLENGES IT IS MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER TO CONNECT PEOPLE COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES WITH EACH OTHER THE RESULTS FOR OUR THIRD QUARTER DEMONSTRATED SOLID EXECUTION AGAINST OUR PLAN THIS INCLUDED BROAD BASED DEMAND ACROSS OUR CUSTOMER SEGMENTS WITH REGIONAL AND EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDERS LEADING THE WAY WE WERE ALSO MAKING GREAT PROGRESS WITH TIER EARLIER THIS YEAR AND CONTINUE TO HAVE VERY STRONG MOMENTUM ON NEW CUSTOMER ACQUISITION ACROSS A BROAD BASE OF MARKET SEGMENTS FROM A TOPLINE PERSPECTIVE REVENUE FOR THE QUARTER WAS A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE POINT ONE MILLION WITH FORTY FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT GROSS MARGINS NETWORK SOLUTIONS ACCOUNTED FOR EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE REVENUE AT A HUNDRED FIFTEEN POINT TWO DURING THE QUARTER WE HAD ONE TEN PERCENT SERVICE PROVIDER CUST ALONG WITH STRONG CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BOTH OUR DIRECT AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL PARTNERS THAT SERVE THE REGIONAL BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET WE ADDED THIRTY EIGHT NEW SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS DURING THE QUARTER BRINGING THE TOTAL TO NINETY NINE FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF TWENTY TWO THESE NEW CUSTOMERS RANGE FROM GLOBAL TIER ONE OPERATORS TO ELECTRIC CO-OPS COOPERATIVES MUNICIPAL CABLE MSO AND REGIONAL BROADBAND PROVIDERS THE NEW CUSTOMER TR In the early stages of a generational communications infrastructure network upgrade cycle driven by a confluence of favorable government regulatory technology and competitive factors the strength we saw during the quarter was fueled by our continued momentum with regional broadband operators who were up sixty percent year over year and thirty three percent quarter over quarter. We were also helped with a solid performance for our US tier two customers who were up eighteen percent year over year. As they started to emerge from restructuring and are again investing in their network expansions in Europe, our revenue from emerging altnet providers was up seventy six percent year over year, and twenty percent quarter over quarter. And highlighting our growth in that region. For the third quarter, our fiber access and aggregation business group grew thirty four percent over the previous period, and increased sixty six to sixty seven percent on a year over year basis. This is our top sales category within fiber access. Our PON OLT revenue grew thirty one percent quarter over quarter and a strong seventy seven percent year over year which we believe is significantly outpacing the growth in the general market and will continue to step up our market share position in this key segment. We also saw strong revenue contribution from our US regional broadband service providers growing thirty seven percent over the previous period and fifty eight percent over the previous year. With a broad-based growth across both direct and distribution channels, from a supply chain perspective, lead times remained extended on some key components and vendors. Our operations team took several cooperative steps to mitigate logistics and component availability challenges to meet our customers' needs. In our efforts to address these needs, we have increased our inventory levels and incurred increased freight costs due to decreased capacity associated with higher transportation rates and expedited fees. From an organizational perspective, the structural changes that we have implemented over the last twelve months continue to improve our operational efficiency. The company has achieved material reductions in operating expenses through control and expense management and we are ahead of our plan for the target operating model moving forward. On the product side, we are focusing on growing our wallet share with our service provider customers. In addition to selling fiber-based OLTs, we are growing our residential gateway business. Residential Gateway Revenue Grew Twenty Two Percent Quarter Over Quarter and a Strong Sixty Four Percent Year Over Year as We Increase the Number of Olt Customers Also Buying Our Rgs by Seventeen Percent Today in Addition to Rg Attach Rates We Have Also Focused on Increasing Attach Rates for Our Mosaic Software Subscription Services as We Migrate Customers to Our Mosaic Suite in Our Upcoming Mosaic One Virtual Control Center on October Twenty Ninth the Sdc Began There are nine hundred and four auctions for sixteen billion of ardof broadband subsidies. There are three hundred and eighty-six qualified bidders that represent over seven hundred operators. Meanwhile, the Connect American Fund was targeted to the large price-cap carriers, providing a first right of refusal for the ardof subsidies. They provide an opportunity for rural local exchange carriers and community broadband providers, such as rural electric cooperatives, to receive ten years of funding. The use of ad funding to begin to positively impact our revenue beginning in the mid 2021 time frame. In Europe and around the world, the strategic importance of 5G and fiber infrastructure is causing governments to carefully reconsider the security risks of their networks and implementation policies and are implementing policies to ban high-risk vendors from participating in these network builds. As a result, Adtran stands out as a safe, technically advanced alternative. These high-risk vendors as national operators look to limit, cap or replace high-risk vendors in their network. Twenty twenty has brought forth a number of challenges that none of us could have imagined. However, we have risen to these challenges and are emerging as an even stronger and more resilient company. We have achieved much thus far in twenty twenty with the material benefits of just beginning to bear fruit and as they start to become more fully recognized. We have much to be excited about including the growing number of new customers selecting our products and services to build out or upgrade their networks with rapid adoption of our mosaic platform and subscription services and our sdx solutions as tier one operators begin their transition to the network of the future and the promise of arista awards and begin and being able to help regional service providers, utilities and municipalities provide DIGITAL SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY SERVE I AM PROUD OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR EMPLOYEES FOR THE SUCCESS WE HAVE SEEN THIS FAR THIS YEAR WE LOOK FORWARD TO A STRONG FINISH TO TWENTY TWENTY AND HAVE A BRIGHT BRIGHT OUTLOOK AS WE LOOK AHEAD INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE MICHAEL WILL NOT PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF FINANCIALS AND FOLLOWING HIS REMARKS I WILL LOVE UP TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU TALK AND GOOD MOR Fourth Quarter 2020 During my report, I will be referencing both gap and non-gap results. With respect to non-gap financial measures that are discussed on this call but are not presented in our earnings release reconciliations to their comparable gap measures are published in a supplemental financial schedule that appears on our investor relations web page at w w w dot adtran com for non-gap measures discussed On this call that are presented in the earnings release, reconciliations are contained within the release. The supplemental financial schedules on our web page also presents certain revenue information by segment and category and other non-GAAP reconciliations which I will be discussing today. As Tom said, Adtran's third quarter revenue came in at one hundred and thirty-three point one million dollars compared to one hundred and twenty million. Eight point seven million dollars in the prior quarter and one hundred and fourteen point one million dollars for the third quarter of twenty nineteen breaking this down across our operating segments our network solutions revenue for the third quarter was one hundred and fifteen point two million dollars versus one hundred and eleven point three million dollars reported for Q2 of twenty nineteen and ninety four million dollars in Q3 of twenty nineteen. In nineteen nineteen, our services and support revenue in Q3 of this year was seventeen point nine million dollars compared to seventeen point four million reported in the second quarter of twenty twenty and twenty point one million dollars for the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Across our revenue categories, access and aggregation revenue for quarter three of twenty twenty was eighty five point four million dollars compared to. Eighty two point eight million dollars in the prior quarter and sixty five point one million dollars in quarter three of twenty nineteen revenue for our subscriber solutions and experience category was forty three point one million dollars for the quarter versus forty four million dollars in quarter two of twenty nineteen and forty two point five million dollars in quarter three of twenty nineteen. Traditional and other products' revenue for the quarter was four point six million dollars compared to five point five million for quarter two of twenty twenty and six point five million dollars for quarter three of twenty nineteen looking at our revenues geographically domestic revenue for Q3 twenty twenty was ninety two point eight million dollars versus eighty four point five million dollars reported in quarter three of twenty nineteen. Two of twenty twenty and eighty three point one million dollars in quarter three of nineteen our international revenue for the quarter was forty point three million dollars compared to forty four point three million for quarter two of nineteen and thirty point nine million dollars in quarter three of nineteen for the third quarter of nineteen we had two. TEN PERCENT OF REVENUE CUSTOMERS BOTH OF THESE WERE DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS OUR GAP GROSS MARGIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WAS FORTY FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT AS COMPARED TO FORTY ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT LAST QUARTER AND FORTY POINT SIX PERCENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN NON GAP GROSS MARGIN FOR QUARTER THREE WAS FORTY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT AS COMPARED TO FORTY ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT LAST Six percent in the prior quarter and forty one percent in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. The quarter over quarter increase in both gap and non-gap gross margins were driven by increases in volume as well as favorable product and services mix and lower freight related charges in the current quarter. The increases in both gap and non-gap gross margins on a year over year basis were driven by increases in volume as well as favorable product and services mix and lower freight related charges in the current quarter. Increases in volume as well as product mix which were partially offset by higher freight related charges and expedite premiums. Total operating expenses on a gap basis were fifty four point four million dollars for quarter three of twenty twenty compared to fifty nine point five million dollars reported in the prior quarter and sixty two point seven million dollars for quarter three of twenty nineteen. The quarter over quarter decrease was primarily related to market-driven decreases in our deferred compensation expense as well as expense reductions in both R&D and SG&A as a result of our restructuring program initiated in twenty nineteen and reduced travel expenses offset by increases in some restructuring related costs. The year over year decrease in operating expenses. Were a result of lower expenses in both R&D and SGNA and lower travel-related expenses partially offset by market-driven increases in our deferred compensation expense and an increase in contract services costs on a non-GA basis. Our third quarter operating expenses were $49.4 million compared to $52.3 million in the prior quarter. AND FIFTY NINE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN QUARTER THREE OF TWENTY NINETEEN BOTH THE NON GAP QUARTER OF A QUARTER AND YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPENSE REDUCTION EFFORTS AND LOWER TRAVEL RELATED EXPENSES OPERATING INCOME ON A GAP BASIS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY NINE WAS FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS Compared to an operating loss of six million dollars in the prior quarter and an operating loss of twenty point three million reported in Q3 of nineteen nineteen non-GAAP operating income for Q3 of twenty twenty was nine point nine million dollars compared to an operating income of one point three million dollars in Q2 of twenty twenty in an operating loss of twelve point six million dollars. DOLLARS IN QUARTER THREE OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE QUARTER OVER QUARTER AND YEAR OVER YEAR GAP AND NON GAP PROFITABILITY WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES WITH FAVORABLE GROSS MARGIN MIX AND REDUCED OPERATING EXPENSES OTHER INCOME ON A GAP BASIS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY WAS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO OTHER INCOME OF EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION IN THE PRIOR QUARTER AND OTHER INCOME OF ONE POINT FIVE INCOME OF ONE POINT NINE MILLION IN QUARTER THREE OF TWENTY NINETEEN OUR NON GAP OTHER INCOME FOR THE QUARTER WAS NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS COMPARED TO OTHER INCOME OF FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN Q TWO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND OTHER INCOME OF TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR QUARTER THREE OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE DECREASES IN BOTH GAP AND NON GAP OTHER INCOME AS COMPARED TO OTHER INCOME OF FIVE Quarter over quarter were primarily market driven caused by changes in the valuation of our investment portfolio the decrease in gap and non-gap other income on a year over year basis was primarily driven by realized foreign exchange losses offset by market driven upsides in the valuation of our investment portfolio the company's tax provision FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY WAS SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF EXPENSE AS COMPARED TO AN EXPENSE OF ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PRIOR QUARTER AND AN EXPENSE OF TWENTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE CURRENT QUARTER TAX EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PROFITABILITY IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AS THE DEFERRED TAX BENEFITS GENERATED BY OUR DOMEST Continued to be offset by changes in our valuation allowance the tax expense in the third quarter of last year was the result of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets gap net income for quarter three of twenty twenty was five point five million dollars compared to a net income of eight hundred thousand dollars in the prior quarter and a net loss of forty six point one million dollars dollars in the third quarter of twenty nineteen non-gap net income for the third quarter of twenty twenty was seven point nine million dollars as compared to an income of one point six million dollars in the prior quarter and a loss of two point eight million in quarter three of twenty nineteen earnings per share assuming dilution on a gap basis was eleven cents per share as compared to two per share Two cents per share last quarter and a loss of ninety six cents per share in the third quarter of twenty nineteen non-guap earnings per share assuming dilution for the third quarter was sixteen cents compared to an income of four cents per share in the prior quarter and a loss of six cents per share in quarter three of twenty nineteen turning to the balance sheet unguap Restricted cash and marketable securities totaled one hundred and thirty-two point two million dollars at quarter end after paying four point three million dollars in dividends during the quarter. For the quarter, we used seven million dollars of cash from operations. Net trade accounts receivable was one hundred point two million dollars at quarter end, resulting in a DSO of sixty-nine days compared to sixty days. Seven days in the prior quarter and seventy three days at the end of the third quarter of twenty nineteen. The variability in DSOs quarter over quarter and year over year is mainly attributable to the timing of shipments during the quarter and customer mix. Net inventories ended the quarter at one hundred and twenty point three million dollars compared to one hundred and six point one million dollars in Q two. Twenty twenty and one hundred and four point nine million at the end of Q three twenty nineteen the increase in our inventories for the quarter that just ended was in preparation for new product ramp ups and strategic inventory buffer purchases made to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity during In the current environment, looking ahead to the next quarter, the possible effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ability of component supplies to align with customer demand, the brokerage nature of our business, the timing of revenue associated with large projects, and the variability of order patterns into the customer base in which we sell, as well as the fluctuation in currency. EXCHANGE RATES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY CAUSE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR EXPECTATIONS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS WE EXPECT THAT OUR FOURTH QUARTER TWENTY TWENTY REVENUE WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AFTER CONSIDERING THE PROJECTED SALES MIX WE EXPECT THAT OUR FOURTH QUARTER GROSS MARGIN ON A NON GAP BASIS WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF ONE H The range of forty one percent to forty two percent. We also expect non-gap operating expenses for the fourth quarter of twenty twenty will be between fifty and fifty one million dollars. And finally, we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the fourth quarter of twenty twenty on a non-gap basis will be a benefit at a mid single digit percentage rate resulting from the fourth quarter of twenty twenty on a non-gap basis will be a benefit at a mid single digit percentage rate resulting from the fourth quarter of twenty twenty on a non-gap basis will be a benefit at a mid single digit percentage rate resulting from the fourth quarter of twenty twenty on a non-gap basis will be a benefit at a mid single digit percentage rate resulting from the fourth quarter of twenty twenty on a non-gap basis will be a benefit at a mid single digit percentage rate resulting from the fourth quarter The expected mix of domestic and international income in the quarter. We believe that the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in twenty twenty will be component availability, a macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises, the ongoing effects of the COVID nineteen pandemic, and the variability of mix and revenue associated with project rollouts. International revenue relative to our total revenue, professional services activity levels in both domestic and international markets, the adoption rate of our broadband access platforms, potential changes in tax laws, currency exchange rate movements, and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels. AVAILABLE AT ADTRANS INVESTOR RELATIONS WEB PAGE AT WWW DOT ADTRANS DOT COM NOW I'LL TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO TOM GREAT THANK YOU MIKE YEAH AT THIS POINT WE'RE READY TO OPEN IT UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS PEOPLE MAY HAVE THIS IS THE TIME IF YOU'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OVER THE PHONE LINES PLEASE PRESS STAR THAN ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD WE WILL PAUSE FOR A MOMENT TO COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE YOUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? Which was for fiber extension and we did pick another tier one customer within the quarter where they expanded their programs with us to include a different variation on the technology that we had been previously awarded. So we were asked but I didn't mention any of my notes got it that's helpful and then I think you also mentioned that you'd made good progress with your previously announced tier ones and I guess you know those would include among others d t OPEN REACH MAYBE IN THE UNNAMED US TIER ONE IS THERE ANY UPDATES YOU CAN GIVE US ON THOSE IN TERMS OF PROGRESS, END OR YOU KNOW REVENUE EXPECTATIONS, INITIAL REVENUE EXPECTATIONS? YEAH, SO ONE OF THOSE IS A BLANK NEW CUSTOMER FOR US, AS YOU'RE AWARE, AND ALL THREE OF THEM ARE GOING WELL. ALL THREE OF THEM ARE AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF LAB WORK. WE ACTUALLY HAVE RECEIVED SOME P O S FROM THE NEW CUSTOMER BUT THAT BUT THAT Associated with you know, you know, initial, say, initial lab work and it's kind of some of the software work that we're doing for them. So we actually, so that actually booked and shipped in the quarter. But all three of them are going well. So when we expect material revenue contributions from them to really start in the first half towards the first half of next year. Got it. And then QUESTION ON ARDOFF: YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEING KIND OF A MID TWENTY ONE REVENUE OPPORTUNITY. I THINK SOME OF YOUR COMPETITORS HAVE SUGGESTED MAYBE IT'S MORE OF A TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO. ANY FURTHER CLARIFICATION ON YOUR THOUGHTS ON TIMINGS THAT SORT OF A THREE Q TWENTY ONE ONE OR FOUR TWENTY ONE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT? YEAH: YEAH AND I GUESS HERE AGAIN THIS IS THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW MONE Um, you know, you have so many participants. Some of them have plans completely worked out, some of them don't have plans at all. They've been just focusing on the bidding process. So, um, I think you'll start seeing it in around the half, and then you'll start seeing it ramp up from there. The number of X looks like what kind of normalized P and E level any any thoughts on how much that may add back into the model as as P and E gets back to you know some kind of normalized level we expect you know we've had a plan to get to about where we are right now and we expect that we're gonna hold that into next year so I wouldn't try to model any increases I think like a lot of companies everybody's rethinking the whole P and E going forward SOMEHOW I THINK YOUR MODEL GOING IN THE NEXT YEAR SHOULD LOOK A LOT LIKE WHAT WE'RE SEEING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR THAT MIKE I'LL SEE YOU LATER THANK YOU THANK YOU YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM RODAL ALL OF GOLDMAN SACHS YOUR LINE IS OPEN HI THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS THIS IS BARRY LYON ON GOLDMAN SACHS JUST TO START OFF COULD YOU GIVE US SOME COLOR ON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THINGS THIS YEAR THAN Of broadband demand and activity here in the US and may be trying to handicap that across the tier one, two, three and then also how you're thinking about the pushability of the momentum into next year. First, a lot of activity and I've touched on the growth rates in the tier three space, a lot of activity in the tier threes which is just separate from what's going on in the tier one space. ARD OFF, SO A LOT OF NETWORK UPGRADES. WE ROLLED OUT OUR COMBO CARD, WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE TEN GIG SOLUTION, A GOOD PICK UP ON A COMBO CARD AND SO JUST A LOT OF ACTIVITY AND I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS GOT TO DO WITH JUST END USER DEMAND YOU KNOW BASED OFF OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN AND PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD CONNECTIVITY. SAME THING IN THE TIER TWOS. I THINK THE TIER TWOS ARE FINALLY GETTING PASS WHATEVER FINANCIAL ISSUES THEY MAY HAVE HAD AND SOME OF THEM HAVE STARTED EXECUTING ONE OF THEM HAS EXPLICITLY STARTED EXECUTING ON EXPANSION PLANS AND I DON'T SEE THAT STOPPING AND I THINK THE OTHER ONE ACTUALLY IS KINDA WOKE UP AND GETTING BETTER AND THAT INCLUDES NOT JUST THOSE BUT SOME OF THE M S OWZ AS WELL SO I DON'T SEE A NEAR TERM END IN FACT I SEE PEOPLE PLANNING FAR THER OUT THAN THAT KIND OF FIGURING OUT HOW THEY'RE GONNA READJUST TO WHAT MAY BE A DIFFERENT WORK ENVIRONMENT IN A LOT OF AREAS THAN WHAT THEY HAD GOING INTO THIS PANDEMIC AND I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL PANDEMIC DRIVEN EITHER. I MEAN THE ACTIVITY THAT'S GOING ON ON THE TIER TWOS HAS BEEN PART OF THEIR STATED PLAN IT JUST GOT PUT OFF THE TIER THREES HAVE BEEN HEATING UP FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME EVEN PRIOR TO THAT. WE HAD SOLID GROWTH IN We're in the cable MSO space and we're with it with large carriers and with one of the large carriers here in the Toccoa space in relation to Pawn. And I would say the activity there is um I would say we've seen good activity. I wouldn't call it m it you know I'm earth shattering. I would say it's solid and there's more a lot of that work is really trying to figure out what they're going to do into next year. So I think a lot of that is just trying to figure out what they're going to do into next year. I THINK A REAL PICKUP WILL PROBABLY BE A YEAR YOU KNOW THIS TIME NEXT YEAR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAN THAT DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION? Too deep into it. We're selling pond. One of the things, if you step back and look at what our business has done, we've really made the transition from copper to fiber. And some of the fiber components that we're selling, specifically, when you're talking about OLTS and stuff, just have a richer mix. We also have based off of international and domestic revenue mix. Those are the material differences in those gross margin profiles. Those are the pond. The two biggest things that are driving gross margin difference. Yes, thank you. Your next question comes from line of Paul Silverstein of Callan. Your line is open. Tom, just a clarification of first, before my question, to the response of the previous question. Obviously, or I trust non-U.S. lower margin in the U.S. as a general proposition. But on the product piece. Of the revenue. I apologize if you just said this the margin differential it's more favorable for your fiber based or less favorable. Is that that distinction you're making in terms of the product mix influencing the gross margin profile in what is the key difference there on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on the product mix on O L T S I S M U CH HIGHER GOT IT O L T S ARE OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE MOVING FORWARD EXACTLY RIGHT GOT IT SO THAT THAT'S THE KEY DRIVER OF THE PRODUCT NEXT THAT'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A LIST OF THAT BUT THAT'S THAT'S DEFINITELY IN THE TOP THREE WE'VE MUCH MUCH STRONGER MIKE THE QUESTION I ASK YOU EVERY QUARTER IN TERMS OF LONG TERM MARKET PROFILE YOU OBVIOUSLY JUST HAD A VERY SHARP RISE IN YOUR MARKET QUARTER DRIVEN BY BOTH VOLUME AND THE SHIFT TO LTs YOU'RE GUIDING BACK TO YOUR TRADITIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE LOW FORTIES FOR THE DECEMBER QUARTER HAS THERE BEEN ANY CHANGE IN YOUR VIEW ABOUT LONGER TERM? ARE YOU STILL LOOKING AT A LOW FORTIES GROSS MARGIN PROFILE LONGER TERM WITH THE BENEFIT OF VOLUME WHICH SHIFT TO LTs CAN THAT BE BETTER THAN THAT? THEN I'LL HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION IN THAT RANGE AND YOU SEE VARIABILITY IN HERE. REMEMBER IN QU ONE WE WERE PRETTY HOT ALSO. SO IT JUMPS AROUND A LOT. SO I TRY TO PROJECT THIS BY LOOKING AT WHAT WE SEE. BUT WE ARE A BOOKING SHIP BUSINESS AND WHAT COMES IN DURING A QUARTER IS A LITTLE BIT HARD TO TEST BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THE MIX WILL TURN OUT TO BE FOR THE QUARTERS. I THINK THE VARIABILITY ALSO IS THE THING THAT WILL TURN OUT TO BE IMPORT BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT FALLING AND WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TIER THREES WILL DO NEXT YEAR IF TIER THREES ARE STRONG THAT TYPICALLY HELPS US BECAUSE NOT JUST THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY BUY BUT ALSO THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS ASSASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO THAT TENDS TO DRIVE MORE STRENGTH THE THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FACTOR IN AT THIS POINT IS NOT CHANGING THE LONGER TERM GUIDANCE IS THERE IS A REAL POT Three's here in the US are gonna keep pace with that is it is kind of the thing that you know we just have to look and see that there is no doubt that the pressure some of the pressure has been alleviated in places like Europe because of the stance on on some of the vendors there but you know there still hangover effect on all of that and the stronger that that business is you'll tend to see a weakening of gross margins so comps are dimming just made it I THINK YOU CAN MAKE GOOD PROGRESS IN TIER TWO OR THREE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE IS TIER TWO OR THREE TODAY I WELL YOU KNOW WE REALLY DON'T BREAK THAT DOWN I'LL TELL YOU IT'S VERY YOU KNOW IT'S MATERIALS OVER LET ME PICK AN AREA IT'S OVER FIFTY MILLION BUT WE DON'T BREAK THAT DOWN ONE QUICK FINAL QUESTION IF YOU MAY I KNOW IT'S HARD PREDICTING THE FUTURE BUT ASSuming Y ASK WHAT THE MARGIN PROFILE IS IN TOTAL NOT ASKING ANY SPECIFIC CUSTOMER BUT ONLY THE SINGLE ONE WOULD THAT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT MARGIN STRUCTURE WOULD IT BE DILUTED WOULD IT BE A CREATOR ANY SENSE AH I WAS GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT INTERNATIONAL GROSS MARGINS IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LITTLE CREATIVE TO INTERNATIONAL GROSS MARGINS BUT IT WOULD BE DILUTED TO TOTAL CORPORATE GROSS MARGINS ALRIGHT I APPRECIATE IT THANK And that gets better over time? How much of that pile in versus where's what's going on with the U.S. market in tier three? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Your next question comes from the line of Bill D'Alessandro of Tyson Capital. Your line is open. And thank you, a couple of different questions. First of all, the V, the two tier ones, the one that you won and the one that you lost with the new program that you specifically are a part of. Would you talk about the ramp and the timing for material revenues and is that different than your comment about late in the first half of next year that you made to a bigger comment and then the second question is, is can you talk through this the European country shutdowns that are happening once again here in the last few days and what implications, if any, that has for you? Sure, let me start with the first one, of course, it's the ramp and the timing for material revenues and is that different than your comment about late in the first half of next year that you made to a bigger comment and then the second question is, is can you talk through this the European country shutdowns that are happening once again here in the last few days and what implications, if any, that has for you? The first half of the ramp that I was talking about was really around the previous S D X awards, the three customers that we've talked about, and really I'm talking about in totality. There are some different dates on all of those, but we'll start saying, as a combination, we'll start seeing material revenue around the half of next year. As far as the new ones, one of them is going to be really big. VERY QUICK BUT IT'S A VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY It's a well-known customer to us. They have very specific plans with very specific revenue targets associated with it. The current date is third quarter. I will make sure you tell you that these things tend to slip a little bit. But the what I was talking about before was really the fireworks. As far as the shutdowns are concerned, other than, you know, it really hasn't, we've been operating in a relatively shutdown environment many ways from an end-user demand. DIFFERENCE UM AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN IN IN THE WAY THAT THEY'RE OPERATING WHERE IT REALLY AFFECTS US IS WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MEET WITH CUSTOMERS AND AND REALLY YOU KNOW WITH THE LAB ACTIVITY WE HAVE GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW IT TENDS TO IMPACT THAT SO FAR WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MANOEUVRE AROUND THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY MATERIAL DELAY BECAUSE OF THE UM AND THE QUARANTINE SITUATION SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN AND I DON'T EXPECT IT I THINK ESPECIALLY OUR BIGGER CUSTOMERS OR EVEN OUR SMALLER CUSTOMERS NOW THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN EUROPE HAVE KIND OF DEVELOPED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE CAN TALK TO THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE LAB WORK THROUGH ISSUES IN MANY CASES GET INTO THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES REMOTELY AND OPERATE THE WAY WE NEED TO OPERATE SO I'M NOT YOU EVERY TIME YOU HEAR ABOUT A WEEK DELAY THAT'S NOT THAT FREQUENT AND THE DEPLOYMENT IS NOT IMPACTED BY A STAY AT HOME ORDERS YEAH YEAH NO CHANGE IN THAT AND EVEN IN YOU KNOW EUROPE WHAT WE WERE SEEING IS FARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR And in many cases, there's been no change in those plans. Great, thank you. And if I may, throw in one more question, Latin America, but what are you seeing with your important customers down there? Um, so they're actually doing well. We have some strong, um, I don't want to overplay it, but they're doing well. And in the Caribbean, we're actually doing well. We have some strong, um, I don't want to overplay it, but we're doing well. So they're actually doing well. And the Caribbean, we're actually doing well. We have some strong, um, I don't want to overplay it, but we're doing well. So they're actually doing well. And the Caribbean, we're actually doing well. At this point, we have some activity going on in places like Brazil where there are also, of course, honestly, you know, the Sdks. Maybe you know the Sdks. It's kind of the architecture people want to go to. And so there are large carriers. There are not a large carrier that isn't looking at a migration towards Xgs, ten gig. And if you're going to do that, you're going to do that with a virtualized system like the Sdks. So there is activity going on there. Those tend to be longer. Term: We do have one traditional customer down there. There are still ongoing negotiations with that customer, but there is no material change at this point. Great. Thank you for the time. Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Bahadur Nair of MTM Partners. Your line is open. Sorry, I was on mute. I apologize if you've already addressed this. But are you seeing any significant pull in of orders from your customers? No, no, we did at the beginning of the pandemic. So if you think about kind of the end of Q1, we saw an increase in order activity. I think it's at this. At some point in time, I would say that the order rate is reflecting what their demand is. I don't see any real you we do on particular parts. I talked a little bit about the fact that we're still having some supply issues. Most predominantly, it's silicon. But in those cases, we may really try to nail down a forecast with them and get it right. Reach further out, but that's really not the norm. Okay, that's helpful. If I look forward to next year with all these tier one customers, how should we be thinking about your customer concentration? Is it most of the good work that will really come from it? Yeah, so we are adding tier one customers as well, so the good news is that there will really come from it. Yeah, so we are adding tier one customers as well, so the good news is that there will really come from it. Yeah, so we are adding tier one customers as well, so the good news is that there will really come from it. Yeah, so we are adding tier one customers as well, so the good news is that there will really come from it. Yeah, so we are adding tier one customers as well, so the good news is that there will really come from it. MORE TIER ONES TO KINDA SPREAD THE THE FLUCTUATIONS AROUND WITHIN BUT HAVING SAID THAT WE'RE ALSO ADDING MORE TIER ONES SO YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THAT ISSUE WE ARE ADDING TIER THREES AND I USE TIER THREES WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT ALTERNATE CARRIERS OF ALL DIFFERENT TYPES WE'RE HAVING MUNICIPALITIES ON A VERY FAST CLIP I MEAN WE USUALLY HAVE AN INTERNAL ANNOUNCEMENT HERE OR SOMETHING THAT GOES OUT AND WE HAVE A WEEKLY UPDATE HERE AND THERE'S ALWAYS A MUNICIPALITY THAT'S BEING ADDED AND WE'RE ADDING TIER THREES TO THE TRADITIONAL TIER THREES PERIODS AT A VERY QUICK CLIP. I THINK I MENTIONED BEFORE THIRTY SOMETHING ODD CUSTOMERS LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WERE ALTERNATE TYPE CARRIERS SO UM FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND BY THE WAY I MENTIONED OUR WE HAD A DISTRIBUTION PARTNER THAT WAS ACTUALLY A TOP TEN PERCENT C That will be typical going forward because I do believe and those are all being sold. Those are one of our conduits to that alternate care, that municipal space, tier three space so and and utilities. So that base is growing. Now when we get into this time next year it'll still be kind of early in the cycle of some of these winds. But we'll get into this time next year it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really what it's really WELL THOSE TIER ONES COMPARING TO THE GROWTH RATE WITHIN THE TIER THREES I HAVE NO DOUBT WILL BE MORE VERSATILE BUT WE'RE ADDING TIER ONES AT A YOU KNOW A NICE CLIP AS WELL SO BUT WE WILL HAVE MORE CUSTOMERS WHICH WILL HELP IN THAT DIVERSITY AND THEN ONE OTHER THING I JUST WANT TO ADD I MENTIONED BEFORE ATTACH RATES ON OUR S P I E G E A R A N D R G I Z Z Z ARE REALLY GOING WELL WHICH WILL HELP ADD THAT PRODUCTIV It's something we're focused on. That's really helpful. Thanks for the call on that. You know, I think one last question for me is more topical. A big picture view. I think Aetna recently announced that they're going to stop selling their copper-based dsl service. It seems like a secular shift towards fibre as ongoing and it should be you know with all the major tier ones around the world. MIGRATING TOWARDS FIBRE CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR COMPETITIVE POSITIONING IN MINING IN FIBRE IS IT SIMILAR TO COPPER THAT YOU ENJOYED PREVIOUSLY OR IS IT ACTUALLY BETTER I WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS THAT I WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS THAT WELL ONE OF THE HANGOVERS THAT WE HAD COUNTRY WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS REALLY ONE BIG PROGRAM THAT KIND OF WAS COPPER BASED THAT DIED AND THAT CAUSED AN ISSUE AND THE HARDDRIVE REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COPPER VERSUS THE FIBER AND I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST QUARTER AND DEPENDING ON HOW YOU COUNT IT WHERE YOU'RE REALLY SEEING FIBER ECLIPSE COPPER WITHIN OUR REVENUE AND SO TO US THAT'S A BIG MILESTONE AND IT REALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND IT'S REALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND IT'S REALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO MA WE HAVE WORKED WITHIN THE COMPANY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE R AND D SPEND THE R AND D SPEND IS PRED DOMINANTLY FIBER BASED AND HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME SO I'M PROMINENTLY GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE REVENUE KINDA MIMIC WHAT IT IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING INTERNALLY HERE COMPETITIVELY RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN A VERY GOOD POSITION WE HAVE LAUNCHED NEW FLEXIBILITY AND NEW CAPABILITIES IN OUR TOTAL ACCESS FIVE THOUSAND PLATFORM PRODUCT WHICH HAS BEEN CREATED THE SWITCHING CAPABILITY AND WE'RE THE ONLY ONE WELL I SHOULD SAY WE'RE THE ONLY ONE I'VE HEARD OTHER PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON ONE BUT WE ARE SHIPPING A COMBINATION CARD WHICH IS THE X G S TEN GIG AND TWO YOU KNOW TWO AND A HALF GIG WITHIN THE SAME CARD PROFILE WHICH IS UNIQUE IN THAT CUSTOMER BASE AND GETTING A LOT OF TRACTION CAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO OUT AND REPLACE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY DON'T HAV A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS IT'S ACTUALLY NOW OUT IN THE MARKET WE HAVE ACTUALLY SHIFTED IT TO PAYING CUSTOMERS IT IS WHAT HAS BEEN SELECTED BY PRETTY MUCH EVERY TIER THAT WE HAVE WON IN RELATION TO POND AND WE THINK THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT WILL TOUCH IT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE KINDA TRYING TO ARE ACTUALLY REACTING TO IT BUT WE THINK WE HAVE A GOOD HEAD That's greatly appreciated, thank you. Your next question comes from a line of Tinsville of Northland Capital Management. Your line is open. Good morning, I've got a lot of my questions on that last one there, but I will say that actually Nokia made the same comment this quarter with regards to fiber optic equipment. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? 60 MILLION THAT'S A QUARTERLY NUMBER THAT YOU GAVE FOR THE SIZE OF THE TIER THREE BUSINESS. OK. SO WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S INTERESTING. AND THAT'S LARGER THAN FITZGERALD. LIKE I SAID WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE HERE. BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF IMPRESSIVE GROWTH THERE. AND YOU HAD A LOT OF VARIOUS SEGMENTS MOSTLY BY SOME DISTANCE ACTUALLY AND YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY SEEING GOOD GROWTH THERE. It seems to imply something on the order of a, I don't know, thirty percent year over year decline among US tier ones or, you know, other parts of the business that are domestic based. I'm guessing that may be a function of the, you know, the copper programs that you reference, but is that about right? And what does it take to kind of, you know, will it take the new deal coming in to kind of stabilize and make that grow or how are you looking at that part of your business? I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I THINK BASIC AND THAT WAS VERY MUCH A COPPER BASED VECTORED B D S O LUTION THAT THEY'RE ROLLING OUT I THINK I JUST ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION IS THAT MONEY YEAH YEAH PART AND LAST ONE FOR ME IS YOU KNOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL GROWTH NEXT YEAR YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SHOULD THE TIER THREE S CONTINUE TO GROW YOU KNOW SIXTY PERCENT MAYBE THEY COULD KEEP UP With that rate of growth, I assume for planning purposes you model some slowing in that two to three growth rate, despite, you know, all of that ramping up and some other positive drivers. Just, just to begin with, and, you know, can we assume that, from an international standpoint, you expect international revenues to grow faster than domestic next year? That is a really good question. That I I don't have an answer for you today. So it it's that the thing about the tier threes is not just it's let me just say off carriers because it's broader than traditional tier three carriers but the thing about these these carriers is the growth rate through the year has been increasing and I don't see a change in next year so you know you're gonna have two quarters of growth before these you know the the carriers is that the growth rate through the year has been increasing and I don't see a change in next year so you know you're gonna have two quarters of growth before these you know the the carriers is that the growth rate through the year has been increasing and I don't see a change in next year so you know you're gonna have two quarters of growth before these REALLY WE HAVE ONE MAMMOTH TWO ONE IN EUROPE THAT'S GONNA START THAT'S GONNA BE ALL OVER MENTAL AND MUCH MORE EPIC THAN THAT NOW THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER ACTIVITIES GOING ON THERE'S A PROCESS GOING ON IN AUSTRALIA CARRIERS LIKE ORANGE YOU WE ANNOUNCED AN AWARD WORTH LOT OF PHONE ALL THE TELEPHONICA WHICH IS OF COURSE NOT JUST IN EUROPE BUT IN BRAZIL ALL THOSE GOT GOT GOT GOT GOT GOT GOT GOT GOT GOT GOT GOT Processes that are in place or where they're coming towards a decision on. But those will carry through, those are really important. And if you think they don't get rewarded until next year, they're a year away from that. So the real mammoth incremental piece is a new customer for us that's deploying the SGX next year. And it'll just be starting around the half. So I could absolutely envision next year where the tier three's are actually completely eclipsed on a pure growth dollar basis. BUT BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR A FACT YOU WILL HAVE TO GET INTO THE YEAR AND REALLY SEE ARNOFF WILL START AROUND THE TURN OF THE SECOND HALF BUT YOU YOU KNOW REALLY FOR IT TO BE MATERIAL IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME SO YOU THAT JUST BE I DON'T SEE THAT AS THIS HUGE KIND OF WAVE OF THINGS COMING IN THE SECOND HALF NEXT YEAR I THINK IT JUST STARTS AND STARTS TO RAP UP FROM THERE KELLY CARE Someone is speaking on the phone.

TO TURN THE CALL OVER TO ALAN SCHNITZER THANK YOU ABBE GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AS WE SHARED IN OUR PRE-RELEASE LAST WEEK AND AGAIN THIS MORNING WE REPORTED A SMALL NET LOSS FOR THE QUARTER DUE TO A HIGH LEVEL OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND AS WE EXPECTED A LOSS IN OUR NON-FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DAN WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT BOTH SHORTLY OUR UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING INCOME OF $572 MILLION PRE TAX IS UP $254 MILLION OVER THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER BENEFITING FROM SOLID NET EARN PREMIUM AND A 3.5 POINT IMPROVEMENT IN THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO TO A STRONG 91.4% THE PANDEMIC AND RELATED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAD ONLY A MODEST NET IMPACT ON OUR UNDERWRITING RESULTS AS I SHARED IN MY PREPARED REMARKS LAST QUARTER THERE WILL BE COVID-19 RELATED LOSS ACTIVITY BUT THERE WILL BE SOME OFFSETTING DECLINE IN LOSSES DUE TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY SHELTERING IN PLACE <INAUDIBLE> IN THE QUARTER $114 MILLION OF DIRECT LOSSES AND $63 MILLION OF AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS WERE ABOUT OFFSET BY INITIAL ESTIMATES OF FAVORABLE LOSS ACTIVITY MOST OF WHICH IS IN SHORT TAIL LINES GIVEN THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY WE'VE TAKEN A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO RECOGNIZING THE NET IMPACT OF COVID-19 RELATED LOSS ACTIVITY SOME INDUSTRY OBSERVERS WHO SPECULATED ABOUT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL OF INSURED AND INVESTMENT LOSSES ARISING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC WE DON'T DOUBT THE LOSSES WILL BE SIGNIFICANT BUT THEY WON'T BE BORN EVENLY ACROSS INSURERS OUR MANAGEABLE COVID RELATED INSURANCE LOSSES SO FAR THIS YEAR ARE A REFLECTION OF OUR DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO RISK SELECTION AS WELL AS TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND AS WE SHARED WITH YOU IN SOME DETAIL LAST QUARTER WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WITH A SIMILAR REGARD TO BALANCING RISK AND REWARD LAST QUARTER I COMMENTED ON THE POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPACTS THE PANDEMIC MIGHT HAVE IN EACH OF OUR KEY LINES OF BUSINESS I'LL REVIEW THAT AGAIN WITH A QUARTER'S WORTH OF EXPERIENCE IN PERSONAL AUTO WE'VE SEEN A MEANINGFUL DRUNK OFF IN AUTO FREQUENCY ALTHOUGH THAT IS MODERATING AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY PICKS UP THE SAME TIME WE'VE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME OFFSETTING IMPACT IN TERMS OF AUTO SEVERITY DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS COLLISIONS OCCURRING AT HIGHER SPEEDS AND DRIVER DISTRACTION IN WORKERS COMPENSATION COVID RELATED CLAIMS MOSTLY RELATE TO HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS BUT DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR BOOK OF BUSINESS ALSO THE FREQUENCY OF THOSE CLAIMS STABILIZED DURING THE QUARTER WHICH MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTED TO AN IMPROVED SUPPLY OF PPE AND THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY HAVING THE BENEFIT OF MORE EXPERIENCE WITH MANAGING COVID PATIENTS MORE BROADLY BEYOND THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR DATA FOR SOME OF THE STATE WORKERS COMP SYSTEMS SUGGEST THAT THE COVID RELATED CLAIM RATE IS LOW RELATIVE TO THE INFECTION RATE THAT'S LIKELY PARTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FACT THAT THE POPULATION MOST SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY COVID-19 SKEWS OLDER AND IS NOT IN THE WORKFORCE NONETHELESS IN DEVELOPING OUR LOSS ESTIMATES WE'VE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DELAYED REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIM ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECENT SPIKES IN INFECTION RATES AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE LONGER-TERM IMPLICATIONS OF THE DISEASE AS WE ANTICIPATED SOME STATES HAVE EFFECTIVELY EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF WORKERS COMP COVERAGE BY CREATING PRESUMPTIONS OF COMPENSABILITY IN MOST CASES STATES HAVE TAKEN A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH PROTECTING WORKERS APPROPRIATELY BUT NOT UNREASONABLY BURDENING THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM WHERE STATES HAVE ACTED TO EXPAND COMPENSABILITY WE'VE ADJUSTED OUR LOSS ESTIMATES ACCORDINGLY IN TERMS OF NON COVID WORKERS COMP LOSSES WE'VE SEEN THE LOWER VOLUME OF WORKERS COMP CLAIMS AS WORKERS HAVE STAYED HOME THIS WILL ABATE AS PEOPLE GET BACK TO THE WORKPLACE IN ADDITION TO TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT WE HAVE CONTEMPLATED THAT SEVERITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INJURED WORKERS DELAYING TREATMENT DUE TO THE STAY AT HOME WORK ENVIRONMENT HAVING SAID ALL THAT OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT THERE'S A LOW LEVEL OF WORKERS COMP CLAIM ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH ECONOMIC RECESSIONS DURING PERIODS OF ELEVATED UNEMPLOYMENT WORKERS TEND TO BE MORE MOTIVATED TO STAY AT THEIR JOBS AND THE WORKFORCE TENDS TO BE MORE SEASONED IN MANAGEMENT LIABILITY AS WE EXPECTED WE ARE SEEING THE ELEVATED LEVEL OF CLAIM ACTIVITY TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY AND WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO THIS QUARTER IN BOND AND SPECIALTY REFLECTS THAT AS WELL AS OTHER LOSS ACTIVITY AND WE EXPECT THAT THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO WILL CONTINUE TO BE ELEVATED AT THIS LEVEL OR SOMEWHAT HIGHER OVER THE NEAR TERM THIS IS NOT UNLIKE THE EXPERIENCE WE HAD IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS A DECADE AGO NONETHELESS WE EXPECT THE RETURN FROM THIS SEGMENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE HEALTHY TURNING TO THE SURETY BUSINESS WE'VE BEEN PLEASED TO SEE THAT WORK IS CONTINUING ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS HOWEVER THE DEPTH AND DURATION OF STRESS IN THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO BE RISK FACTORS THE SURETY BUSINESS THE LINE WILL ALSO BE IMPACTED BY OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH IN THE BONDED FIRMS AS I SHARED LAST QUARTER OUR HIGH QUALITY SURETY BOOK WAS EFFECTIVELY STRESS TESTED IN THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS AND PERFORMED WELL AND OUR UNDERWRITING APPROACH HAS REMAINED DISCIPLINED SINCE THAT TIME IN THAT REGARD SO FAR WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT HAS CAUSED US TO CHANGE OUR SURETY LOSS ESTIMATES IN TERMS OF BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COVERAGES UNDER COMMERCIAL PROPERTY POLICIES THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF LITIGATION CHALLENGING COVERAGE AS A REMINDER OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF CIVIL AUTHORITY REQUIRE LOSSES TO BE CAUSED BY DIRECT PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO PROPERTY FROM A COVERED CAUSE OF LOSS IN ADDITION OUR STANDARD POLICY FORMS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM A VIRUS A FEW COURT DECISIONS WE'VE SEEN SO FAR ONE IN NEW YORK AND ONE IN MICHIGAN HAVE BOTH UPHELD THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE REQUIREMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19 ON THE LEGISLATIVE FRONT EFFORTS TO RETROACTIVELY EXPAND COVERAGE FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS SEEM TO BE DIMINISHING FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO LIABILITY COVERAGES AS PEOPLE SHELTER IN PLACE WE ARE SEEING FEWER COMMERCIAL AUTO ACCIDENTS AND SLIP AND FALL TYPE CLAIMS ANECDOTALLY WE ARE ALSO SEEING SOME MOVEMENT BY THE PLAINTIFF BAR TO SUBMIT CLAIMS FASTER BUT IT'S TOO SOON TO KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT BENEFIT MIGHT BE WE'RE ALSO ENCOURAGED BY STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED COVID RELATED LIABILITY PROTECTIONS AND SIMILAR EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDERWAY IN OTHER STATES AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE SHOULDN'T LET FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS UNDERMINE THE NATION'S RECOVERY NONETHELESS WE EXPECT THE PLAINTIFF BAR TO CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVE TURNING TO THE QUARTER OF THE TOP LINE WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH OUR PRODUCTION RESULTS EXCLUDING THE AUTO PREMIUM REFUNDS WE PROVIDED TO OUR CUSTOMERS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS GREW BY TWO PERCENT AS THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON INSURED EXPOSURES WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY STRONG RENEWAL RATE CHANGE IN ALL THREE SEGMENTS IN BUSINESS INSURANCE WE ACHIEVED RENEWAL RATE CHANGE OF 7.4% THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE 2013 AND CLOSE TO THE RECORD LEVEL WE ACHIEVED THAT YEAR EXCLUDING WORKERS COMP RENEWAL RATE CHANGE WAS DOUBLE DIGITS IMPORTANTLY RETENTION LEVELS REMAIN STRONG IN BOND AND SPECIALTY INSURANCE NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED BY THREE PERCENT AS OUR DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT LIABILITY BUSINESS ACHIEVED RECORD RENEWAL RATE CHANGE WHILE MAINTAINING STRONG RETENTION IN PERSONAL INSURANCE EXCLUDING THE OTHER PREMIUM REFUNDS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED BY SIX PERCENT DRIVEN BY STRONG RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS IN BOTH AGENCY AUTO AND AGENCY HOMEOWNERS IN OUR AGENCY HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE REMAINS STRONG AT 7.70% AND WE HIT A RECORD FOR NEW BUSINESS LET ME TAKE A MINUTE TO COMMENT ON THE COMMERCIAL RATE ENVIRONMENT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STRUCK THERE- THERE WERE A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY WIDE FACTORS PUTTING UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES NAMELY INCREASED VOLATILITY OF WEATHER RELATED LOSSES INTEREST RATES AT HISTORICAL LOWS AND A GROWING RECOGNITION OF HIGHER LOSS TREND IN THE LIABILITY LINES ALL OF THOSE CONDITIONS PERSIST AND NOW AT ANOTHER QUARTER WITH A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF WEATHER RELATED LOSSES INTEREST RATES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE LOWER FOR LONGER AND WHILE IT HASN'T BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR FOR US FOR REINSURANCE MARKET THAT HAS HARDENED AND ON TOP OF THAT THE PANDEMIC AND RELATED ECONOMIC FALLOUT ADD A SENSE OF INCREMENTAL UNCERTAINTY MAKING THIS FEEL LIKE ONE OF THOSE TIMES NOT UNLIKE IN THE WAKE OF NINE ELEVEN AND HURRICANE KATRINA WHEN THE MARKET RECALIBRATES RISK WITH THAT AS THE BACKGROUND WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE GREAT GAINS AND MANAGE OTHER LEVERAGE OF PROFITABILITY TO IMPROVE THE OUTLOOK FOR RETURNS I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING THAT I COULDN'T BE MORE GRATEFUL TO MY TRAVELERS COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR GRIT AND COMMITMENT TO TAKING CARE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS OUR COMMUNITIES AND EACH OTHER ALSO THE WORK THEY'VE DONE IN RECENT YEARS TO ADVANCE OUR INNOVATION AGENDA HAS EQUIPPED US WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART DIGITAL TOOLS AND OTHER CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WE WERE WELL-PREPARED AND FROM HERE WE'RE WELL POSITIONED FREE FROM FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DISTRACTIONS WE'LL CONTINUE UNINTERRUPTED MANAGING OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTING FOR LONGTERM SUCCESS ENSURE WE'RE CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO SUCCEED THROUGH THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES AND TO BENEFIT FROM THE STRENGTH OF OUR FRANCHISE AS THE ECONOMY RECOVERS AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN THE CALL OVER TO DAN THANK YOU ALAN OUR CORE LOSS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WAS $50 MILLION COMPARED TO CORE INCOME OF $537 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER THE CHANGE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND AS EXPECTED LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE QUARTER THE NET IMPACT RELATED TO COVID-19 IS INCLUDED IN OUR UNDERLYING RESULTS NOT AS PART OF OUR CAT FIGURE AND WAS MODEST MORE ON THAT IN A MINUTE OUR SECOND QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDE $854 MILLION OF PRE-TAX CAT LOSSES COMPARED TO ONLY $367 MILLION IN LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER THIS QUARTER CATS INCLUDES SEVERE STORMS IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS $91 MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO CIVIL UNREST REGARDING OUR PROPERTY AGGREGATE CATASTROPHE XOL TREATY FOR 2020 AS OF JUNE 30TH WE HAVE ACCUMULATED ABOUT $1.40 BILLION OF QUALIFYING LOSSES TOWARD THE AGGREGATE RETENTION OF $1.55 BILLION THE TREATY PROVIDES AGGREGATE COVERAGE OF $280 MILLION PART OF $500 MILLION OF LOSSES OF BOTH THAT $1.55 BILLION RETENTION THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO OF 91.4% WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACTS OF CATS AND PYD IMPROVED BY THREE AND A HALF POINTS COMPARED TO 94.90% IN LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER THE UNDERLYING LOSS RATIO IMPROVED BY MORE THAN FOUR POINTS AND BENEFITED FROM A LOWER LEVEL OF NON-CAT WEATHER LOSSES FAVORABLE FREQUENCY AND PERSONAL AUTO FROM THE SHELTER IN PLACE ENVIRONMENT NET OF RELATED PREMIUM REFUNDS AND THE IMPACT OF EARNED PRICING AND EXCESS OF LOSS TREND THE EXPENSE RATIO OF 31% IS EIGHT TENTHS OF A POINT HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AND ABOVE OUR RECENT RUN RATE THIS CHANGE WAS AS EXPECTED DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN PREMIUMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY ALONG WITH THE PREMIUM REFUNDS TO OUR PERSONAL AUTO CUSTOMERS THE NET IMPACT OF COVID-19 AND ITS RELATED EFFECTS ON THE ECONOMY WERE MODEST IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL SECOND QUARTER UNDERWRITING <INAUDIBLE> OUR TOP LINE WAS RESILIENT EXCLUDING THE PREMIUM REFUNDS AND PERSONAL INSURANCE NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED BY TWO PERCENT DRIVEN BY STRONG RENEWAL RATE CHANGE IN ALL THREE SEGMENTS THAT MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER INSURED EXPOSURES IN TERMS OF OPERATING EXPENSES RESULTS WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY MODEST INCREASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBT AND THE ACCRUAL FOR SUPPLEMENTAL COMMISSIONS THOSE EXPENSE INCREASES HOWEVER WERE ROUGHLY OFFSET BY LOWER EXPENSES IN OTHER CATEGORIES FOR EXAMPLE TRAVEL COSTS WERE DOWN AS OUR EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO WORK PRIMARILY FROM HOME THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS RELATED TO COVID-19 ALSO AFFECTED OUR UNDERLYING LOSSES FOR EXAMPLE LOSSES DIRECTLY RELATED TO COVID-19 TOTALED $114 MILLION PRIMARILY WORKERS COMP AND BUSINESS INSURANCE AND MANAGEMENT LIABILITY LOSSES IN OUR BOND AND SPECIALTY BUSINESS ON THE OTHER HAND WE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN AUTO CLAIMS AS THERE WERE FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TO A LESSER DEGREE RECOGNIZED A BENEFIT REFLECTING FEWER TRADITIONAL WORKERS COMP CLAIMS AS MORE PEOPLE WORK FROM HOME AS YOU HEARD FROM ALAN GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WE TOOK A CAUTIOUS APPROACH IN ESTIMATING THE NET IMPACT OF COVID RELATED LOSSES WE HAVE RECORDED THE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR ALL LOSSES INCURRED THROUGH JUNE 30TH INCLUDING INCURRED LOSSES FOR WHICH CLAIMS HAS NOT YET BEEN REPORTED ALL LOSSES HAVE BEEN RECORDED AT OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE AND THE MAJORITY OF THE COVID-19 RELATED INSURANCE LOSSES WE HAVE BOOKED IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS ARE STILL SITTING IN OUR IBNR RESERVES WE HAVE NOT RECOGNIZED LOSSES OR BENEFITS FROM COVID-19 RELATED INSURED EVENTS THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE QUARTER TAKING A STEP BACK ON A YEAR TO DATE BASIS THE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS EXCLUDING THAT INVESTMENT INCOME FROM COVID-19 AND ITS RELATED EFFECTS IS A NET CHARGE OF ABOUT $50 MILLION PRE-TAX TURNING TO PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN PERSONAL INSURANCE BOTH AUTO AND PROPERTY LOSSES CAME IN BETTER THAN EXPECTED FOR MULTIPLE ACCIDENT YEARS IN BOND AND SPECIALTY INSURANCE WE SAW LARGER LOSSES THAN EXPECTED IN MANAGEMENT LIABILITY RESULTING IN PRIOR YEAR STRENGTHENING OF $33 MILLION LARGELY OFFSETTING THE FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN PERSONAL INSURANCE IN BUSINESS INSURANCE THERE WAS NO NET PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AS BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE IN WORKERS COMP AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE RESULTS IN OUR OTHER CASUALTY BINDS EACH OF THE MOVEMENTS THIS QUARTER WAS RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED TO THE RESERVE BASE AS YOU SAW IN OUR JULY 14TH PRESS RELEASE WE EXPECT TO RECORD SUBROGATION BENEFITS IN OUR THIRD QUARTER PYD OF APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION PRE-TAX RELATED TO PG&E'S SUCCESSFUL EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY ON JULY 1ST AS A REMINDER THIRD QUARTER PYD WILL ALSO INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF OUR ANNUAL ASBESTOS REVIEW AFTER TAX NET INVESTMENT INCOME DECREASED BY 54% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER TO $251 MILLION SOMEWHAT BETTER RESULT THAN WE HAD PREVIEWED IN OUR CALL LAST QUARTER THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY OUR NON-FIXED INCOME RETURNS WHERE RESULTS FOR OUR PRIVATE EQUITY HEDGE FUND AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED TO US ON A ONE QUARTER LAG ACCORDINGLY THE IMPACT OF THE DISRUPTION IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT OCCURRED IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE FIRST QUARTER IMPACTED OUR SECOND QUARTER RESULTS AS THE BROADER MARKETS HAVE RECOVERED IN THE SECOND QUARTER THAT SHOULD AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT BENEFIT OUR NON-FIXED INCOME RESULTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER IT'S WORTH MENTIONING HERE THAT RECOVERIES MAY NOT BE REFLECTED IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY AND HEDGE FUND RESULTS AS QUICKLY AS THE DOWNTURNS WERE GIVEN CONTINUED ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY THE FUND MANAGERS WHO REPORT THEIR RESULTS TO US MAY TAKE A MORE MEASURED APPROACH NOT BE AS QUICK TO WRITE BACK UP THE VALUATIONS THEY JUST MARKED DOWN PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT MAY BE CONTINUED CHALLENGING PROSPECTS FOR THE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS OF THE FUND'S UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS FIXED INCOME RETURNS DECREASED BY $24 MILLION AFTER TAX AS THE BENEFIT FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF INVESTED ASSETS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES AND A MIX CHANGE AS WE CHOSE TO MAINTAIN A SOMEWHAT HIGHER LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND HELD MORE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS THAN IN PRIOR QUARTERS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020 WE EXPECT THAT FIXED INCOME NII WILL DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY 35 TO $40 MILLION AFTER TAX PER QUARTER COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 201 TURNING TO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE QUARTER OF $1.70 BILLION WE'RE AGAIN VERY STRONG ALL OUR CAPITAL RATIOS WERE AT OR BETTER THAN TARGET LEVELS AND WE ENDED THE QUARTER WITHHOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY OF SLIGHTLY MORE THAN $2 BILLION WELL ABOVE OUR TARGET LEVEL RECALL THAT IN APRIL WE PRE-FUNDED AS WE NORMALLY DO $500 MILLION OF DEBT COMING DUE IN NOVEMBER WITH A NEW 30 YEAR $500 MILLION DEBT ISSUANCE AT 2.55% SO OUR HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY IS TEMPORARILY ELEVATED BY THAT AMOUNT INVESTMENT YIELDS DECREASED AS CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTENED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND ACCORDINGLY OUR NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN INCREASED FROM $1.80 BILLION AFTER TAX AS OF MARCH 31ST TO $3.60 BILLION AFTER TAX AT JUNE 30TH ADJUSTED BOOK VALUE PER SHARE WHICH EXCLUDES NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES WAS $92.01 AT QUARTER END DOWN LESS THAN 1% FROM YEAR END AND UP 2% YEAR OVER YEAR WE RETURNED $218 MILLION OF CAPITAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THIS QUARTER VIA DIVIDENDS WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES DURING THE QUARTER AS WE INDICATED IN OUR FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS CALL OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY REMAINS UNCHANGED WITH THE ONGOING ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND WITH HURRICANE SEASON UPON US IT STILL FEELS TO US LIKE HOLDING ONTO A LITTLE MORE CAPITAL IS PREFERABLE TO HOLDING ONTO A LITTLE LESS UNTIL THERE'S MORE CLARITY ON THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY WE MAY BUY BACK SOME SHARES IN THE COMING QUARTERS OR WE MAY CONTINUE TO CHOOSE TO BUY NONE COMING BACK TO RE-INSURANCE FOR A MOMENT LET ME DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO SLIDE 19 OF THE WEBCAST PRESENTATION FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR JULY 1ST RENEWALS THE STRUCTURE OF OUR MAIN CAT REINSURANCE PROGRAM IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WE RENEWED OUR NORTHEAST CAT TREATY EFFECTIVE JULY 1ST SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TERMS AND PRICING THAT WAS UP ONLY SLIGHTLY ON AN EXPOSURE ADJUSTED BASIS OUR CAT BOND LONG POINT RE III IS NOW IN THE THIRD YEAR OF IT'S FOUR YEAR TERM IN THE ANNUAL RESET FOR THE 2020 HURRICANE SEASON THE ATTACHMENT POINT WAS ADJUSTED FROM $1.79 BILLION TO $1.87 BILLION WHILE THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM WAS FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR A MORE COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF OUR CAT REINSURANCE COVERAGE INCLUDING OUR GENERAL CAT AGGREGATE XOL TREATY THAT COVERS AN ACCUMULATION OF CERTAIN PROPERTY LOSSES ARISING FROM MULTIPLE OCCURRENCES IS INCLUDED IN OUR 10Q WHICH WE FILED EARLIER TODAY AND IN OUR 2019 FORM 10K LASTLY LET ME TAKE A MINUTE TO ADDRESS THOUGHTS ON OUR TOP LINE GOING FORWARD LOOKING AT PREMIUM VOLUME WE EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE THE IMPACTS OF ECONOMIC DISRUPTION HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT WE FEEL AND FOR HOW LONG WILL DEPEND ON THE EXTENT AND DURATION OF THE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE EARNED PREMIUM TYPICALLY LAGGED WRITTEN PREMIUM WE EXPECT TO FEEL THE EFFECTS ON AN EARNED BASIS BEYOND THE END OF THE YEAR NOW INSTEAD LAST QUARTER WE DO NOT INTEND TO TAKE DISRUPTIVE ACTION EXPENSE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO WHAT MAY PROVE TO BE A SHORT-TERM IMPACT ON PREMIUM VOLUMES ACCORDINGLY IN COMING QUARTERS THE EXPENSE RATIO WILL LIKELY REMAIN SOMEWHAT ELEVATED COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2019 THROUGH THE EXPECTED IMPACT ON EARNED PREMIUMS NOW I'LL TURN THE CALL OVER TO GREG FOR DISCUSSION OF BUSINESS INSURANCE THANKS DAN LET ME START BY EXPRESSING MY DEEP APPRECIATION TO ALL MY TRAVELERS COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS OUR AGENT AND BROKER PARTNERS FOR CONTINUING TO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS DURING THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AS FOR THE QUARTER'S RESULTS BUSINESS INSURANCE HAD A LOSS FOR THE QUARTER OF $58 MILLION DUE TO LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND HIGHER CATASTROPHE LOSSES AS BOTH ALAN AND DAN DISCUSSED THE COMBINED RATIO OF 107.10% INCLUDED MORE THAN 10 POINTS WITH CATASTROPHE IMPACTED BY BOTH WEATHER RELATED LOSSES AND CIVIL UNREST THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO OF 97% IMPROVED BY 0.4 POINTS REFLECTING A 0.2 POINT IMPROVEMENT IN EACH OF THE UNDERLYING LOSS RATIO AND EXPENSE RATIO THE NET IMPACT OF COVID-19 AND RELATED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WAS MODEST TURNING TO THE TOP LINE NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS WERE 3% LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC DISRUPTION UNINSURED EXPOSURES THANKS TO EXCELLENT EXECUTION BY OUR FIELD ORGANIZATION THESE IMPACTS WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY STRONG RENEWAL RATE DECREASES AND HIGH RETENTION TURNING TO DOMESTIC PRODUCTION WE ACHIEV- ACHIEVED STRONG RENEWAL RATE CHANGE OF 7.40% WHILE RETENTION REMAINED HIGH AT 83% THE RENEWAL RATE CHANGE OF 7.40% WAS UP ALMOST FOUR POINTS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AND MORE THAN A POINT FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR NOT WITHSTANDING THE PERSISTENT DOWNWARD PRESSURE IN WORKERS COMPENSATION PRICES WE CONTINUED TO ACHIEVE HIGHER RATE LEVELS BROADLY ACROSS OUR BOOK AS RATE INCREASES AT ALL LINES OTHER THAN WORKERS COMPENSATION WERE MEANINGFULLY HIGHER DURING THE QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR WE ACHIEVED POSITIVE RATE ON ABOUT 80% OF OUR MIDDLE MARKET ACCOUNTS THIS QUARTER WHICH WAS UP FROM ABOUT TWO THIRDS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR IMPORTANTLY WE'VE ACHIEVED THIS PROGRESS IN A HIGHLY SEGMENTED MANNER AND WITH RETENTION REMAINING STRONG AT THESE RATE LEVELS OUR RATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO EXCEED LOSS TREND EVEN AFTER ABOUT A HALF A POINT INCREASE TO OUR LOSS TREND ASSUMPTION NEW BUSINESS OF $473 MILLION WAS DOWN 10% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER NEW BUSINESS FLOW WAS DOWN WHICH WE ATTRIBUTE LARGELY TO DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC NEW BUSINESS WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON DISCIPLINED RISK SELECTION UNDERWRITING AND PRICING THESE PRODUCTION RESULTS REFLECT SUPERIOR EXECUTION BY OUR FIELD ORGANIZATION IN A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT AS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES IN SELECT RENEWAL RATE CHANGE WAS UP TO 2.10% MAKING THE SIXTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER WHERE RENEWAL RATE WAS HIGHER THAN THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR QUARTER WHILE RETENTION WAS STRONG AT 82% THE HEADWIND FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION PRICING IS MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE SELECT BUSINESS NEW BUSINESS WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVEN BY THE ECONOMIC DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC WHILE THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IS CHALLENGING WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE WELL-POSITIONED AND INVESTING IN THE RIGHT STRATEGIC CAPABILITIES TO PROFITABLY GROW THIS BUSINESS OVER TIME IN MIDDLE MARKET RENEWAL RATE CHANGE WAS UP TO 7.9% WHILE RETENTION REMAINED STRONG AT 86% THE 7.90% WAS UP ALMOST FOUR AND A HALF POINTS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND ONE AND A HALF POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 202 NEW BUSINESS OF $255 MILLION WAS DOWN FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DRIVEN BY BOTH ECONOMIC DISRUPTION AND OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON DISCIPLINED RISK SELECTION UNDERWRITING AND PRICING TO SUM UP WE BELIEVE OUR MEANINGFUL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES INCLUDING OUR STRONG DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS AND OUR TALENT AND EXPERTISE POSITION US WELL TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES AND CONTINUE TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND AGENT AND BROKER PARTNERS WITH THAT I'LL TURN THE CALL OVER TO TOM THANKS GREG BOND AND SPECIALTY DELIVERED SOLID RETURNS AND GROWTH IN THE QUARTER DESPITE THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 AND RELATED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SEGMENT INCOME WAS $72 MILLION A DECREASE OF $102 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AS DAN MENTIONED THE COMBINED RATIO OF 93.80% REFLECTS UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE QUARTER AS COMPARED TO FAVORABLE PYD IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AND A HIGHER UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO OF 88.10% INCREASED 7.1 POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACTS OF HIGHER LOSS ESTIMATES OR MANAGEMENT LIABILITY COVERAGES ABOUT HALF OF WHICH WAS DUE TO COVID-19 AND RELATED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THE REMAINING HALF OF THE INCREASE IS DUE TO A FEW SMALLER DRIVERS SUCH AS ELEVATED CLAIM ACTIVITY UNDER EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY COVERAGES AND RANSOMWARE LOSSES UNDER CYBER POLICIES TURNING TO THE TOP LINE NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS GREW 3% FOR THE QUARTER REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH IN OUR MANAGEMENT LIABILITY AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SURETY PRODUCTION IN OUR DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT LIABILITY BUSINESS WE ARE PLEASED THAT RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE INCREASED TO 7.8% THIS MARCH THE SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER WHERE RPC IS HIGHER THAN THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR CORE AS ALAN NOTED RENEWABLE RATE CHANGE WAS A RECORD FOR THE QUARTER WHILE RETENTION REMAINED AT A HISTORICALLY HIGH 89% SIMILAR TO BUSINESS INSURANCE RPC IN THE QUARTER WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY LOWER INSURED EXPOSURES THESE PRODUCTION RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGY TO PURSUE RATE WHERE NEEDED WHILE MAINTAINING STRONG RETENTION OF OUR HIGH QUALITY PORTFOLIO WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE RATE INCREASES WHERE WARRANTED DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT LIABILITY NEW BUSINESS FOR THE QUARTER DECREASED $13 MILLION REFLECTING THE DISRUPTION ASSO- ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 IN OUR THOUGHTFUL UNDERWRITING IN THIS ELEVATED RISK ENVIRONMENT DOMESTIC SURETY NET PREMIUM NET WRITTEN PREMIUM WAS DOWN $24 MILLION IN THE QUARTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 WHICH SLOWED PUBLIC PROJECT PROCUREMENT AND RELATED BOND DEMAND INTERNATIONAL BSI POSTED STRONG GROWTH IN THE QUARTER WITH RECORD RATE IN OUR UK MANAGEMENT LIABILITY BUSINESS SO BONDED SPECIALTY RESULTS REMAINED RESILIENT DESPITE THE CHALLENGES BROUGHT ON BY COVID-19 THESE RESULTS REFLECT THE EXCELLENT WORK OF OUR AGENTS BROKERS AND EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE ADAPTED TO OPERATING IN NEW WAYS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE LEADING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS WE FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT AND CONTINUE TO DELIVER STRONG RETURNS OVER TIME AND NOW I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MICHAEL TO DISCUSS THE PERSONAL INSURANCE THANKS TOM AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 WAS $10 MILLION DOWN FROM $88 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING GAINS OUR COMBINED RATIO FOR THE QUARTER WAS 101.3% AN INCREASE OF 1.1 POINTS AND A 12 AND A HALF POINT INCREASE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY A 10.6 POINT IMPROVEMENT IN THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO BENEFITED FROM LOWER NON CATASTROPHE WEATHER RELATED LOSSES AND LOWER AUTOMOBILE LOSSES NET OF PREMIUM REFUNDS THE INCREASE OF 2.6 POINTS ON THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REDUCTION IN NET EARNED PREMIUMS RESULTING FROM THE AUTO PREMIUM REFUNDS TURNING TO THE TOP LINE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF PREMIUM REFUNDS OF $216 MILLION NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS GREW SIX PERCENT AGENCY HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS WERE UP AN IMPRESSIVE 13% AND AGENCY AUTOMOBILE NET PREMIUMS WERE UP THREE PERCENT EXCLUDING PREMIUM RE-BONDS AGENCY AUTOMOBILE DELIVERED STRONG RESULTS WITH A COMBINED RATIO OF 85.70% FOR THE QUARTER THE LOSS RATIO IMPROVED OVER 12 POINTS WHILE THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO INCREASED BY ABOUT FOUR POINTS THE INCREASE IN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE PREMIUM REFUNDS I DESCRIBED EARLIER THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO OF 84.20% IMPROVED 9.6 POINTS RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER CONTINUING TO REFLECT IMPROVEMENTS IN FREQUENCY PRIMARILY DUE TO FEWER MILES DRIVEN AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC DATA FROM OUR INTELLIDRIVE AUTO TELEMATICS PROGRAM INDICATES MILES DRIVEN WERE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRE COVID-19 LEVELS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER REACHING A WEEKLY LOW POINT IN A- IN EARLY APRIL AND PARTIALLY REBOUNDING AS THE ECONOMY HAS STARTED TO REOPEN IN RESPONSE TO OUR IMPROVED AUTO LOSS EXPERIENCE WE IMPLEMENTED A STAY AT HOME AUTO PREMIUM CREDIT PROGRAM FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE CUSTOMERS IN THE US THE PROGRAM PROVIDED A 15% PREMIUM REFUND ON APRIL MAY AND JUNE PREMIUMS IN AGENCY HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER THE SECOND QUARTER COMBINED RATIO WAS 113.9% 9.4 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER CATASTROPHES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO HISTORICALLY THE SECOND QUARTER IS OUR HIGHEST CATASTROPHE QUARTER THIS QUARTER WE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT STORM ACTIVITY RESULTING IN 34 POINTS OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES AN INCREASE OF 21 POINTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER WHERE CATASTROPHES WERE RELATIVELY LOW THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO FOR THE QUARTER WAS 81.4% DOWN OVER 11 POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER NON CATASTROPHE WEATHER RELATED LOSSES THE MAJORITY OF THE IMPROVEMENT IS DUE TO ELEVATED NON-CAT WEATHER IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER RELATED LOSSES THIS QUARTER WERE ALSO BETTER THAN OUR ASSUMPTIONS TURNING TO QUARTERLY PRODUCTION OUR DOMESTIC AGENCY RESULTS WERE SOLID DESPITE THE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT RESULTING FROM COVID-19 AND ITS RELATED ECONOMIC IMPACTS OUR RETENTIONS REMAIN STRONG QUOTES AND NEW BUSINESS WERE UP VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AND WE REMAIN PLEASED WITH OUR POLICIES ENFORCED GROWTH AGENCY AUTOMOBILE RETENTION WITH 85% AND NEW BUSINESS INCREASED 7% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE WAS 1.50% AS WE CONTINUE TO MODERATE PRICING GIVEN THE IMPROVED INFORM- PERFORMANCE IN OUR BOOK OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AGENCY HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER DELIVERED ANOTHER VERY STRONG QUARTER WITH RETENTION OF 87% RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE OF 7.70% AND A 17% INCREASE IN NEW BUSINESS AS WE CONTINUE TO SEEK TO IMPROVE RETURNS WHILE GROWING THE BUSINESS HIGHER NEW BUSINESS LEVELS AGAIN BENEFITED FROM THE SUCCESSFUL ROLLOUT OF OUR QUANTUM HOME 2 PRODUCT NOW AVAILABLE IN OVER 40 MARKETS DURING THE QUARTER WE CONTINUED TO DELIVER NEW CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS WE INTRODUCED QUANTUM HOME 2 IN FOUR NEW STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION WE LAUNCHED INTELLIDRIVE 2.0 WHICH ADDS DISTRACTED DRIVING MONITORING TO OUR AUTO TELEMATICS PRODUCT AND DELIVERS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE USER EXPERIENCE AND AFTER REACHING OUR GOAL OF PLANTING 1 MILLION TREES FOR CUSTOMER ENROLLMENT IN PAPERLESS BILLING WE EXTENDED OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH AMERICAN FORESTS TO PLANT ANOTHER 500,000 TREES BY EARTH DAY 202 TO RECAP PERSONAL INSURANCE IS OFF TO A STRONG START IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT I'M PROUD OF OUR TEAM'S EFFORTS TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE WE'RE PRIVILEGED TO SERVE WHILE INVESTING IN THE BUSINESS FOR THE FUTURE NOW I'LL TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO ABBE THANKS MICHAEL BEFORE WE BEGIN Q&A THERE'S ONE TOPIC THAT WE EXPECT MIGHT BE ON PEOPLE'S MINDS SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD KICK OFF Q&A BY ADDRESSING IT SO BEFORE WE OPEN UP THE LINE I'D LIKE TO TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO DAN THANKS ABBE THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION BY INDUSTRY OBSERVERS ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE RECOGNITION OF COVID RELATED LOSSES SO LET ME REITERATE THAT OUR RESERVES REFLECT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE LOSSES INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WE WOULD NOT RECORD A RESERVE FOR A LOSS THAT HAS NOT YET OCCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE USING AUTO CLAIMS AS AN EXAMPLE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE HAVE AN ASSUMPTION AS TO THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS WE WILL SEE OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR AND WHAT THE AVERAGE COST OF THOSE CLAIMS WILL BE BUT WHEN WE REPORT OUR SECOND QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDING OUR BALANCE SHEET LOSS RESERVES AS OF JUNE 30TH THOSE RESERVES DO NOT INCLUDE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR AUTO ACCIDENTS THAT WILL OCCUR AT THANKSGIVING OR ON NEW YEAR'S EVE THOSE WOULD BE FOURTH QUARTER EVENTS AND ACCORDINGLY THEY WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS THIS SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES WHEN WE CONSIDER LOSSES RELATED TO COVID-19 WHILE ONLY SOME LOSSES HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO US SO FAR THE LOSSES WE BOOKED IN BOTH THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER REFLECT OUR ESTIMATES OF THE ULTIMATE AMOUNTS THAT WE'LL PAY FOR ALL LOSSES AND RELATED COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED AS OF JUNE 30TH INCLUDING THOSE FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED A CLAIM IN FACT AS I SAID EARLIER THE MAJORITY OF THE COVID RELATED INSURANCE LOSSES WE HAVE BOOKED THROUGH JUNE 30TH ARE STILL SITTING IN OUR IBNR RESERVES THAT SAID THE PANDEMIC IS CLEARLY NOT OVER AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW INFECTIONS ARE BEING CONFIRMED IN THE UNITED STATES EACH DAY IT IS FORESEEABLE THAT A HEALTHCARE WORKER FOR EXAMPLE WHO TO THIS POINT HAS NOT CONTRACTED COVID-19 WILL BECOME ILL FROM COVID-19 AS A RESULT OF THEIR JOB DUTIES IN DECEMBER BUT AGAIN THAT LOSS ACTIVITY WILL BE INCLUDED IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS WE SIMILARLY WOULD NOT ADVANCE THE RECOGNITION OF ANY CONTINUED FAVORABILITY FROM LOWER FREQUENCY IN NON- COVID WORKERS COMP CLAIMS FINALLY I'LL REMIND YOU THAT ON A YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS SETTING ASIDE NET INVESTMENT INCOME THE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS FROM COVID-19 AND ITS RELATED EFFECTS IS A NET CHARGE OF ABOUT $50 MILLION PRE-TAX AND WITH THAT OPERATOR WE'RE READY TO TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME IF YOU'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE TO WITHDRAW YOUR QUESTION PRESS THE POUND KEY

TO UNDERSTAND I-I-I- IS- DOES THAT MEAN YOU KNOW AND- AND- ALAN YOU GAVE LOTS OF GREAT COMMENTARY ON- ON PRICING DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE CURRENT LEVEL PRICING STILL ISN'T ENOUGH TO EXPAND MARGINS TODAY FOR KINDA HOW WE THINK ABOUT THAT VERSUS THE LEVEL OF CONSERVATISM THAT MIGHT BE BAKED INTO THE- TO THE CURRENT NUMBERS YEAH MICHAEL GOOD MORNING IT'S ALAN AND I'LL- I'LL- I'LL START TO SEE IF I

BASIS EXPANDING MARGINS IS- IS THAT- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT UH IT IS YEAH IT- IT IS I GUESS UH YOU- YOU KNOW ON BUSINESS INTERRUPTION YOU HAD 20 BASIS POINTS OF IMPROVEMENT SO YOU KNOW NOT AS MUCH AS MAYBE ONE WOULD EXPECT IN A LEVEL OF PRICING AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S- THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET MY ARMS AROUND YEAH SO YOU KNOW AS ALWAYS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO IN THE QUARTER AND THAT'S TRUE- TRUE FOR ANY BUSINESS SO YOU'VE GOT- YOU'VE GOT WEATHER SO Y- YEAR OVER YEAR THAT WAS- THAT WAS BETTER AND IN THIS QUARTER SORT OF WITHIN THE NORMAL <INAUDIBLE> WITHIN THE NORMAL LEVEL OF <INAUDIBLE> WE WOULD EXPECT FOR THAT YOU'VE GOT THE EARNED IMPACT OF RATE THAT AS I- AS I SAID ON BOTH THE WRITTEN AND EARNED BASIS RATE IS AHEAD OF LOSS TREND UH WE'VE HAD IMPROVED PERFORMANCES IN SOME BUSINESS YOU GOT SOME- SOME IMPACT OF COVID IT WAS MODEST BUT NOT ZERO UH YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE YEAR OVER YEAR UH IN- THAT SORT OF ONGOING CARRY ON IMPACT OF- OF SOCIAL INFLATION THAT I'LL CALL OLD NEWS WHAT YOU KNOW THE- WHAT WE'VE RECOGNIZED IN PRIOR PERIODS AND THAT CONTINUES TO ROLL THROUGH UM SO YOU KNOW THO- THOSE ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE GIVE- GIVEN THE RELATIVE STABILITY WE'RE NOT GONNA QUANTIFY THE PIECES BUT ESSENTIALLY THOSE ARE THE PIECES OKAY NO THANK YOU THAT- THAT- THAT'S HELPFUL THANKS ALAN UM I GUESS DIDN'T- DIDN'T SEE MENTION UM AND I GUESS THIS IS GOOD NEWS DIDN'T SEE MENTION OF ANYTHING ON THE COMMERCIAL AUTO SIDE FOR- FOR PYD AND SO MAYBE COULD YOU SPEAK TO KINDA THAT PIECE AND DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S BEEN POSSIBLY

MORNING UM I JUST WANTED TO GET A BETTER FEEL FOR JUST YOU KNOW FORGET ABOUT THE NET BENEFIT UH FROM THE COVID JUST FROM THE DIRECT LOSS OF THE LOAN UM OR THE DIRECT IMPACT WHAT WAS THE UH THE HIT

BENEFITS WHAT WAS JUST THE UM THE- THE DIRECT LOSS IMPACT OR DIRECT HIT IMPACT ON- ON THAT NUMBER YEAH RYAN IT'S DAN I- I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA GIVE THE PLUSES AND THE MINUSES BUT WITHIN THE- WITHIN THE WE- WE TOLD YOU THAT THERE WAS 114 MILLION OF- OF DIRECTLY RELATED CHARGES AND WHILE THAT INCLUDED SOME UH SOME CHARGES FOR THE MANAGEMENT LIABILITY COVERAGES IN BOND AND SPECIALTY THE MAJORITY OF WHAT WE TOOK CAME THROUGH BUSINESS INSURANCE OKAY AND THEN IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE BENEFITS THAT WE'RE SEEING I THINK IN THE PRE-ANNOUNCEMENT YOU SAID IT WAS MOSTLY SHORT TAIL LINES UH SO SHOULD WE TAKE THAT TO MEAN I MEAN FIRST OF ALL OUTSIDE OF THE SHORT TAIL LINES ARE YOU SEEING A- ACTUAL TO EXPECTEDS LOOK A LITTLE BIT BETTER IN SOME AREAS IN TERMS OF FREQUENCY AND IS THAT NOT SOMETHING AND IF SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT RECOGNIZING YET YOU'RE- YOU'RE BEING CONSERVATIVE AND WAITING TO SEE IF THAT UH CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE YEAH RYAN DAN AGAIN SO WE ARE FOR SURE SEEING SOME- SOME FAVORABLE INDICATIONS RELATIVE TO WHAT YOU WOULD OTHERWISE EXPECT UH IN- IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH FAVORABILITY TO SIMPLY SAY ZERO IS THE RIGHT REACTION UM BUT AS ALAN SAID IN HIS COMMENTS AND AS I TRIED TO REITERATE IN MINE I THINK WE'VE BEEN VERY CAUTIOUS IN TERMS OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE'D RECOGNIZE ANY GOOD NEWS IN ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE SHORT TAIL LINES BUT THERE'S SOME BECAUSE IT'S- IT'S VERY APPARENT IN THE DATA AND- AND THEN JUST ONE- ONE MORE REAL QUICK UM I WAS I GUESS A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED EXPOSURE GROWTH HELD IN I THINK ESPECIALLY IN SELECT LINES RETENTION HAS ONLY DECLINED MODESTLY YOU KNOW HOW SHOULD WE INTERPRET THAT IS RETENTION IS IT CAPTURING CANCELLATIONS OR IS THAT MODEST DIP YOU KNOW MOSTLY A FUNCTION OF YOU GUYS TAKING MORE REIGN I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INTERPRET THOSE NUMBERS THAT SEEM RELATIVELY MODEST GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MACRO LANDSCAPE YEAH RYAN LET- LET ME THIS IS GREG LET ME TAKE BOTH OF THOSE IN THE ORDER THAT YOU TOOK THEM NUM- NUMBER ONE IN TERMS OF EXPOSURE CHANGE IF YOU'RE LOOKING THAT RELATIVE TO MIDDLE MARKET THAT'S REALLY A PRODUCT MIX UH DYNAMIC IN THE SELECT BUSINESS WE HAVE THE THRUST OF THE PREMIUM IS TWO PRODUCTS CMT AND WORKERS COMP IN THE CMT PRODUCT THE RATING ON THAT HAS DRIVEN MORE OFF THE PROPERTY THAN THE GL AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE UH PRICING AND INFLATIONARY PRESSURE ON THE PROPERTY AND SO THERE'S SOME INFLATIONARY IMPACT THAT THAT IMPACTS ON THE CMT PRODUCT AND SO YOU DON'T SEE AS MUCH OF A DRAG ON EXPOSURE ON SELECT THAT YOU DO ON MIDDLE MARKET WHERE THE GL PRODUCT IS- IS MORE ON A STANDALONE RATED BASIS UH AND THEN THE RETENTION OVERALL UH FOR SELECT YOU KNOW WE- WE CERTAINLY PUT OUR- OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF UH YOU KNOW BUSINESS UH INSOLVENCIES BANKRUPTCIES AND THAT'S ALL INSIDE THE 82% NUMBER THANK YOU YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF MEYER SHIELDS WITH KBW PLEASE GO AHEAD UH GREAT THANKS GREG IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY IN YOUR PREPARED COMMENTS YOU TALKED ABOUT A 60 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN LOSS TREND AND I WAS HOPING YOU COULD FLUSH THAT OUT A LITTLE SURE MEYER YEAH WE- WE LOOK AT LOSS TRENDS EVERY QUARTER IN- IN ACROSS THE FULL PORTFOLIO AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A HEADLINE NUMBER UH WHAT WE DID THIS QUARTER IS WE LOOKED AT YOU KNOW THE IMPACT OF THE- THE NEW ECONOMY THAT WE SEE IN FRONT OF US WE ALSO LOOK AT SOME OF THE SOCIAL UH INFLATION OR LIABILITY DYNAMICS THAT DAN JUST TALKED ABOUT UH WHEN WE ROLL THAT ALL UP IN AGGREGATE WE- WE- WE BELIEVE WE'VE GOT A 50 BASIS POINTS INCREASE IN OUR LOSS TREND IN FRONT OF US THE- THE THING I'D HAD TO THAT MEYER IS THAT- THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE YOU KNOW UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO WE REPORTED FOR THE QUARTER AS- AS IS A- A PIECE OF THAT THAT WOULD BE CATCH UP FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OKAY PERFECT THAT LAST POINT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR UM SECOND QUESTION I GUESS WITH WORKERS COMPENSATION BEING THE MOST VULNERABLE TO <INAUDIBLE> UM DID THAT IMPACT RATE NEED ON THE <INAUDIBLE> SIDE SAY THE QUESTION AGAIN I'M- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND UH I KNOW THAT IN GENERAL WORKERS COMPENSATION PRICING HAS BEEN COMING DOWN BECAUSE INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN GOOD UH BUT WE SEEM TO BE SEEING A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT UM EXPOSURE UNIT HEADWIND AND I'M TRYING TO GET MY ARMS AROUND WHAT THAT IMPLIES FOR INDICATED PRICING YEAH YOU KNOW MEYER THERE'S A HEAVY REGULATORY COMPONENT TO PRICING AS YOU KNOW AND IT TENDS TO BE YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT BACKWARD LOOKING AND IT- AND IT SORT OF FACTORS IN THE OVERALL POSSIBILITY OF THE LINE WHICH IS AS YOU KNOW HAS BEEN- HAS BEEN VERY FAVORABLE OVER THE YEARS AND- AND THAT'LL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE SO YOU KNOW CLEARLY YOU KNOW EXPOSURE WILL BE- WILL BE ONE IMPACT ON PROFITABILITY TODAY WHICH WILL IMPACT PRICING TOMORROW BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO ISOLATE ANY ONE AND- ANY ONE FACTOR AND IT'S IMPACT ON PROFITABILITY BECAUSE YOU KNOW E- EVERYTHING GOES IN YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT YOU START WITH YOUR EXPIRING RATE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW WHAT- WHATEVER THE RATE CHANGE IS AND YOU'VE GOT EXPOSURE CHANGE YOU GOT YOU KNOW LOSS TRENDS THINGS LIKE THAT SO UM IT'S- IT'S DEFINITELY A FACTOR IT'S HARD TO ISOLATE YOU KNOW WHAT THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT IS OKAY UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF ELYSE GREENSPAN WITH WELLS FARGO PLEASE GO AHEAD MORNING ELYSE HI GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME NO WE HEAR YOU NOW HI SORRY THANK YOU UM IN TERMS OF BUSINESS INSURANCE I WAS HOPING FOR THE COVID-19 LOSSES UM AND I RECOGNIZE A RESPONSE FROM AN EARLIER QUESTION MAYBE YOU AREN'T GIVING TO THE LOSS IMPACT IN BUSINESS INSURANCE SPECIFICALLY BY LINE SO COULD YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHERE YOU SAW THE MAJORITY OF YOUR COVID LOSSES THUS IGNORING THE FAVORABLE IMPACT UH IN THE SECOND QUARTER JUST SPECIFICALLY WITHIN BUSINESS INSURANCE YEAH ELYSE SO- SO THAT'S WHAT I HAD TRIED TO DO SO WE TOOK 114 MILLION ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE IN DIRECT- IN DIRECT COVID LOSSES NONE OF THAT WAS IN PERSONAL INSURANCE THERE WAS SOME COMPONENT OF MANAGEMENT LIABILITY WITHIN BOND AND SPECIALTY INSURANCE WHICH TOM DESCRIBED IN GOING THROUGH THEIR COMBINED RATIO BUT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE DOLLARS CAME THROUGH BUSINESS INSURANCE ELYSE ARE YOU ASKING FOR A BREAKDOWN BY PRODUCT LINE YEAH I WAS HOPING BY PRODUCT LINE EVEN IF NOT IN TERMS OF DOLLARS YOU COULD JUST GIVE US A SENSE OF WHICH BUSINESS INSURANCE PRODUCT LINE SAW THE MAJORITY OF YOUR COVID LOSSES YEAH THE LARGEST LINE FOR SURE IS WORKERS COMP UM SOME- SOME PROPERTY LOSSES UH BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY UH AND THEN DRIBS AND DRABS I WOULD SAY IN OTHER LINES BUT THOSE ARE- THOSE ARE THE TWO DRIVERS WITH COMP BY FAR BEING THE LARGEST AND ELYSE I'D POINT YOU TO MY PREPARED COMMENTS WHERE I- WHERE I DID SHARE THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS A MODEST NET IMPACT WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE OFFSETTING ON THE FAVORABLE FREQUENCY ON- ON SOME OF THOSE LINES ALSO OKAY THANKS AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION UM IS MAYBE A FOLLOW UP ON THE PRIOR QUESTION ON WORKERS COMP UM WE'VE HEARD A YOU KNOW A FEW FOLKS OF THE INDUSTRY IT SEEMS LIKE STARTING TO POINT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF COMP IN TERMS OF JUST THE PRICING AND DYNAMICS THERE BUT IF I YOU KNOW GO BACK TO YOUR COMMENTS THROUGHOUT THE CALL IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU GUYS ARE YOU KNOW THINKING THAT THE YOU KNOW RATE DECLINES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THAT BUSINESS ARE YOU KNOW CLOSE TO COMING TO AN END UM SO IF YOU COULD JUST HELP US THINK ABOUT WORKERS COMP IN TERMS OF THE PRICING DYNAMICS THERE AND WHETHER YOU KNOW WE MIGHT HIT AN INFLECTION AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING 2020 PERHAPS YOU KNOW EVEN INTO 2021 AS WELL YEAH E- ELYSE THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION WHEN YOU- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INFORMATION COMING OUT OF THE SOME OF THE RATING BUREAUS AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR OWN YOU KNOW WE- WE WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE SORT OF AT OR NEAR A BOTTOM IN THE WORKERS COMP PRICING OKAY UM THAT'S HELPFUL ONE LAST NUMBERS QUESTION COULD YOU GIVE US UM YOU SAID THAT THEY WERE SMALL NUMBERS BUT IS THERE COULD YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF THE DOLLARS IN TERMS OF THE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN UM GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL MULTI PERIL IN THE QUARTER WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT ELYSE THEY'RE ALL PRETTY MODEST OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE COLOR THANK YOU YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF DAVID <INAUDIBLE> WITH EVERCAR PLEASE GO AHEAD HI THANKS GOOD MORNING UM AND DAN I GUESS I- I YOU KNOW I- I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS UM THAT YOU MADE UH JUST BEFORE THE Q&A BUT I GUESS I'M JUST WONDERING IF- IF YOU COULD GIVE US SOME SENSE OF YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT COVID RELATED ADVERSE IMPACTS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE YEAR UH YOU KNOW JUST LOOKING THROUGH YOUR PORTFOLIO OF EXPOSURES AND THINKING HOW IT MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY COVID EVEN IF THE LOSSES HAVEN'T OCCURRED YET IN THE FIRST HALF AND YOU HAD THE EXPOSURE AND YOU THINK THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THERE COULD BE A LOSS ON IT JUST WONDERING TO GET SOME- SOME THOUGHTS THERE I FIGURED I'D TAKE A SHOT AT THAT DAVID GOOD MORNING IT'S ALAN LET ME START WITH THAT AND IF I MISS ANYTHING I WOULD LIKE DAN TO PICK IT UP WE'RE NOT- WE'RE NOT GOING TO FORECAST FUTURE LOSSES OUR OBLIGATION UNDER GAP IS TO REPORT YOU KNOW THE- THE YOU KNOW INCURRED AND- AND- AND UNREPORTED LOSSES AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE UM IT'S- IT'S HARD TO FORECAST THE FUTURE THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY WE DON'T KNOW THE TRAJECTORY OF THE DISEASE WE DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHEN- WHEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE A VACCINE WE DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY IS AND- AND FRANKLY IT'S YOU KNOW PROBABLY THE- THE UNCERTAINTIES FOR THE ECONOMY THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON UH OF- OF THE PANDEMIC ON- ON US UM BUT I- I- I DO THINK IT'S RELEVANT TO AND IT'S WHY WE POINTED IT OUT A FEW TIMES THAT OUR- OUR NET LOSSES IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR WERE OUR NET CHARGES WERE ABOUT 15 MILLION BUCKS PUTTING ASIDE UH THE INVESTMENT SIDE AND- AND- AND WE'VE YOU KNOW PUT UP THAT NET NUMBER WITH A- WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF <INAUDIBLE> SO I- I CAN'T- I CAN'T GIVE YOU A NUMBER YOU KNOW I TRIED IN MY SORT OF LINE BY LINE REVIEW TO TELL YOU SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT WE THINK ABOUT BUT I YOU KNOW I- I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S- IT'S NOT- IT'S NOT IRRELEVANT TO THAT ASSESSMENT TO THINK ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR OKAY GREAT THAT- THAT'S HELPFUL APPRECIATE THAT UH ALAN AND THEN JUST- JUST ONE MORE SO EXCLUDING WORKERS COMP THE RENEWAL RATE CHANGE SO IT WAS PRETTY CALM YOU SAID DOUBLE- DOUBLE DIGITS WONDERING IF WE COULD GET A FINER POINT PUT ON THAT AND THEN JUST SORT OF HOW THAT COMPARES VERSUS THE LAST FEW QUARTERS UH AND- AND- AND ALSO YOU KNOW SORTA THINKING ABOUT AND I- I THINK DAN UH YOU HAD MENTIONED YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT LOSS TREND OF FIVE PERCENT NOW IN THE NEW UPDATED THINKING AND THAT'S I GUESS WHAT I SHOULD BE COMPARING TO THE 7.40% RENEWAL RATE CHANGE THAT YOU GOT IN THE QUARTER YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE R- IT'S DAN I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT RATE VERSUS TREND AND THAT'S ABOUT THAT'S THE BALLPARK I THINK WE'D SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT TREND WAS AROUND FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT IN VI AND WE'RE TAKING IT UP ABOUT- ABOUT A HALF A POINT UH IN THE CURRENT QUARTER BUT YOU GOTTA LOOK AT THAT IN- IN RELATION TO THE PRICING MOMENTUM UH AS WELL AND I THINK GREG COULD CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THE- THE PRICING MOMENTUM YOU SEE IN- IN THIS QUARTER IS- IS A REFLECTION OF- IS A REFLECTION OF THE STRENGTH OF THE MARKET AND THE CONTINUED NEED FOR RATE YEAH THE ONLY THING I'D ADD THERE TO YOUR POINT YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF COMP ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS WERE POSITIVE UM AND SO YOU KNOW WE- WE FEEL GREAT ABOUT THAT EXECUTION AND- AND MOSTLY THE CHANGES LINE UP WITH WHERE THE RATE NEED IS ALSO OKAY GREAT AND IF- IF I COULD JUST SNEAK ONE MORE IN ON THE- THE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL LIABILITY UH HOPING TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE COLOR IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU SAW IN THE QUARTER UH THAT I GUESS BROUGHT YOU TO MAKE THAT CHANGE BECAUSE I HAD THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW MOST OF THE COURTS WERE CLOSED DURING THE QUARTER I- I WOULD THINK THE PAGE WOULD BE YEAH NOTHING REALLY ACCELERATED DURING THE QUARTER UM OR- OR WAS IT MORE JUST A VIEW OF- OF YOU KNOW OR WAS IT MORE JUST A ONGOING REVIEW THAT RESULTED IN THE CHANGE THERE YEAH IT'S- IT'S MORE THE LATTER AND REMEMBER AS WE'RE DOING RESERVE REVIEWS ESPECIALLY IN LONG TAIL LINES LIKE THOSE YOU'RE- YOU'RE LOOKING MORE BACKWARDS AT- AT YOUR DATA SO THE ACTUAL LOSS ENVIRONMENT OF YOU KNOW MAY AND JUNE WE'RE AWARE OF IT BUT IT'S NOT REALLY YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GATHER ALL THAT DATA AND FULLY FACTOR IT INTO THE RESERVE VIEW THAT YOU'RE MAKING AT THAT TIME SO A LITTLE MORE OF THAT IS STILL BACKWARD LOOKING IN TERMS OF THE WAY THINGS HAD DEVELOPED SAY THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER AND AGAIN AS DAN NOTED- AGAIN AS DAN NOTED IN HIS REMARKS THOSE WERE- THOSE WERE RELATIVELY SMALL MOVEMENTS YEAH GREAT UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF PAUL NEWSOME WITH PIPER SANDLER PLEASE GO AHEAD UH YOU- YOU'VE HIT THE BIG ONES FOR ME BUT UH ONE JUST QUICK ONE UM FROM AN INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE UH DO YOU HAVE EXPECTATIONS THAT WE WOULD SEE INCREASED DEFAULTS AS WELL COME THROUGH AND I GUESS THEY'D BE MOSTLY UNREALIZED UM AND IS THAT SORT OF BOOKED INTO THE INVESTMENT UH EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU GAVE US THIS QUARTER AS WELL UH UH I'M THINKING THE ACTUAL DEFAULTS THAT WE MIGHT SEE FROM THE RECESSION YEAH PAUL IT'S DAN YOU KNOW WE GAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF DETAIL AND DID A FAIR AMOUNT OF COMMENTARY ON YOU KNOW THE CONSTRUCT OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN- IN OUR COMFORT LEVEL WITH YOU KNOW THE- THE WAY WE THOUGHTFULLY INVESTED AND- AND WE'VE GIVEN YOU AN UPDATE OF- OF THAT INVESTMENT DETAIL AGAIN IN THE APPENDIX OF THE WEBCAST PRESENTATION UH THIS QUARTER SO I- I WOULDN'T SAY MORE THAN WE SAID I THINK LAST QUARTER IN TERMS OF FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT THE WAY WE'VE MANAGED RISK ON- ON THE ASSET SIDE OF THE BALANCE SHEET CLEARLY WE'RE AWARE OF AND LOOKING- AND LOOKING AT AND HAVE A REGULAR PROCESS TO ASSESS CREDIT IMPAIRMENT AND DEFAULT RATES AND ALL OF THAT STUFF IS BAKED INTO OUR NUMBERS BUT IT'S REALLY- IT'S REALLY NOT A BIG- BIG IMPACT ON US GIVEN THE THOUGHTFUL INVESTMENT APPROACH IN THE FIRST PLACE HAS UH HAS RATINGS MIGRATION HAD MUCH OF AN IMPACT YET UM IF AT ALL UM ON THE CAPITAL CALCULATIONS FOR YOU GUYS UH NO IT HAS NOT GREAT WELL THANK YOU THANKS PAUL YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF BRIAN <INAUDIBLE> WITH UVS PLEASE GO AHEAD YEAH THANKS JUST TWO QUICK ONES HERE UM FIRST ONE WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS ON THE BI UM WRITTEN PREMIUM THIS QUARTER THE COMP AND CMP I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION BRIAN IT'S DAN MEANING FOR WORKERS LIKE- LIKE REEVALUATING UM LIKE UH LIKE WHAT LIKE <INAUDIBLE> IS ON WORKERS COMP YOU USUALLY DO IT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER BUT WERE THERE ANY KIND OF EARLY ONES WHERE YOU ADJUSTED PREMIUM TO REFLECT WHAT UM WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE FOR THE YEAR YEAH SO- SO I WOULDN'T SAY WE NORMALLY DO IT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO <CROSSTALK> OKAY WE DO IT WHEN THE POLICY PERIOD HAS- HAS ENDED <CROSSTALK> <CROSSTALK> THERE- THERE HAS BEEN SOME AND WE'VE BEEN OPEN TO IT THERE HAD BEEN SOME MORE REQUESTS BY CUSTOMERS TO DO SOME OF THAT MIDTERM BUT ALL OF THAT'S BAKED- MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> ALL OF THAT'S BAKED INTO OUR PRODUCTION STATISTICS AND THE WRITTEN PREMIUM NUMBERS WE REPORTED FOR THE QUARTER BRIAN AND <CROSSTALK> YEAH BREAK OUT THAT ONE PIECE UH OKAY THANKS AND THEN THE SECOND JUST QUICK QUESTION JUST TO UNDERSTAND UM THE 50 BASIS POINTS OF INCREASE IN TREND IN THE BI IS THAT INCLUSIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH RESPECT TO COVID-19 AND MAYBE THE BENEFITS OR ADVERSE STUFF YOU'RE SEEING ON COVID-19 OR IS THAT MORE RELATED TO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH JUST GENERAL KIND OF TORT INFLATION AND SOME OF THE INCREASE YOU SAW IN YOUR GL RESERVES AND YOUR CMP RESERVES UH I THINK WERE- WE CONSIDER EVERYTHING BRIAN IN- IN- INCLUDED IN THERE AND THERE ARE SOME PUTS AND TAKES AND THAT OF THE PUTS AND TAKES WAS A HALF A POINT INCREASE TO THE TREND GREAT AND- AND- JUST TO ON THAT- FOLLOWING ON THAT ALAN YOU MADE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT MAYBE SOME FAVORABLE STUFF HAPPENING IN THE COURT SYSTEM AS FAR AS UM UM SOME YOU KNOW EARLY QUICK SETTLEMENTS BUT IN GENERAL WHAT'S YOUR KIND OF TAKE ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH TORT RIGHT NOW UM AND COULD WE POTENTIALLY SEE ANY INCREASE IN TORT INFLATION YOU KNOW AS A RESULT OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH- WITH COVID-19 YEAH I MEAN I THINK WE- WE CERTAINLY COULD AND- AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE SUCH BIG PROPONENTS OF LIABILITY REFORM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE WE'RE PROTECTING THE NATION'S RECOVERY FROM- FROM THE PANDEMIC UM YOU KNOW I- I- I THINK YOU- YOU HEAR A LOT OF- OF RHETORIC OUT THERE ON THAT TOPIC UM BUT YOU KNOW EVERY- EVERYTHING- EVERYTHING WE SEE AND EVERYTHING WE'RE ANTICIPATING IS IN- IS IN THAT LOSS TREND NUMBER GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION COMING FROM THE LINE OF <UNK> <UNK> WITH JP MORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING SO FIRST I HAD A QUESTION ON JUST THE COMMERCIAL AUTO BUSINESS IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF UM FREQUENCY IS THAT PICKING UP AS TRAFFIC'S BEEN INCREASING RECENTLY AND THEN RELATEDLY JUST YOUR VIEWS ON THE RATE ADEQUACY IN THAT LINE UM GIVEN THAT YOU'VE BEEN RAISING PRICES FOR- FOR AWHILE OR DO YOU THINK RATES NEED TO GO UP FURTHER HI THIS IS- GOOD MORNING THIS IS GREG YEAH WE CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN SOME FAVORABLE FREQUENCY ACTIVITY UM AS THE SHELTER AT HOME HAS TAKEN PLACE CERTAINLY NOT TO THE LEVELS OF PERSONAL INSURANCE UH AND- AND JUST AS A REMINDER IN- IN COMMERCIAL AUTO IT'S A LITTLE UNIQUE AND PERSONAL UH WHERE WE DO HAVE LAY UP CREDITS OR PREMIUM CREDITS WHEN THERE'S LIMITED USE AND SO UM YOU KNOW THERE'S A SLIGHT OFFSET AS WE SEE THAT FREQUENCY WE HAVE MECHANISMS TO GIVE THAT- TO GIVE THAT BACK NOW AS THE ECONOMY IS STARTING TO REOPEN WE'RE SEEING THAT FREQUENCY MODERATE OKAY AND ON THE PERSONAL AUTO SIDE ARE YOU ASSUMING OR EXPECTING ADDITIONAL REFUNDS UM IN THE THIRD QUARTER RESULTS UM SO WE DON'T- WE DON'T HAVE FURTHER REFUNDS PLANNED IN PERSONAL AUTO UH YOU KNOW I THINK- I THINK LIKE MANY WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD AT WHAT RATE ADEQUACY OVER TIME AND LOOKING AT MORE TRADITIONAL MECHANISMS LIKE RATE FILINGS UH TO MAKE SURE THAT RATE'S IN LINE WITH LOSS TREND AND LOSS <INAUDIBLE> IN PERSONAL AUTO THE REFUNDS REALLY WERE A- WERE A MECHANISM TO RESPOND TO ACUTE- AN ACUTE ISSUE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE PANDEMIC IS SORT OF THE WAY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT OKAY AND THEN JUST LASTLY YOU MENTIONED A MAJORITY OF THE COVID LOSSES WERE RELATED TO WORKERS COMP BUT UM YOU DIDN'T REALLY MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND I'M ASSUMING THOSE LOSSES WERE PRETTY MODEST BUT IS THAT MORE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF CLAIM SUBMISSION OR IS IT JUST YOU- YOU HAVE SEEN SUBMISSIONS BUT YOUR VIEW IS THAT THOSE CLAIMS ARE UNINSURED GIVEN THE POLICY LANGUAGE YEAH WE- WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN SOME SUBMISSIONS AND- AND THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW CLAIM ACTIVITY AROUND IT AND- AND EVEN SOME LITIGATION AROUND IT UH AS- AS WE'VE NOTED WE'VE GOT UM PROVISIONS IN OUR POLICIES THAT- THAT WE THINK UM M- MAKE THAT COVERAGE INAPPLICABLE AND- AND SO WE DON'T EXPECT MANY OF THOSE CLAIMS UH A- ACTUALLY TO PAY UP IT'S DAN ONE- ONE RELATED COMMENT TO THAT E- EVEN WHERE WE DON'T EXPECT IT ULTIMATELY TO PAY THE INDEMNITY ON THE LOSS WE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED IN OUR RESERVE THE FACT THAT WE'LL SPEND SOME MONEY DEFENDING AGAINST CLAIMS THAT COME IN FOR- FOR BUSINESS- FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OH OKAY AND- AND ON- ON COVID IS THAT THE LINE WHERE YOU SEE THE MOST UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF CLAIMS GIVEN WHAT HAPPENS ON UH SORT OF IN TERMS OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY OR ARE THERE OTHER LINES WHERE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF CLARITY BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR YOU KNOW I- I DON'T THINK THERE'S A- I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION I MEAN I MEAN CERTAINLY THERE'S SOME BECAUSE THERE'S SOME LITIGATION AND THERE'S ALWAYS UNCERTAINTY WHEN YOU HAVE LITIGATION BUT YOU KNOW WE- WE'VE GOT THE REQUIREMENT FOR DIRECT PHYSICAL DAMAGE WE'VE GOT TWO COURTS THAT HAVE UPHELD THAT SO FAR UM AND- AND WE'VE GOT A SPECIFIC VIRUS EXCLUSION IN OUR STANDARD POLICY FORM SO WE- WE DON'T ACTUALLY SEE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THERE AND WE DON'T EXPECT YOU KNOW THAT TO BE A MATERIAL LOSS CONTRIBUTOR FOR US OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU I WILL NOW TURN- I WILL NOW TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO ABBE FOR CLOSING REMARKS THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING I APPRECIATE IT AS ALWAYS IF THERE'S ANY FOLLOW UP PLEASE UH GET IN TOUCH WITH INVESTOR RELATIONS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS UM BE WELL AND UH

        "model_prediction": "MUSIC PLAYS THEN A MAN SPEAKS At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Miss Abbie Goldsmith, senior vice president of investor relations. Miss Goldsmith, please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter, two thousand and twenty results. We released our press release, financial statement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers dot com under the investor section. Speaking today will be... Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO, Dan Fri, Chief Financial Officer, and our three segment presidents, Greg Teslosky of Business Insurance, Tom Conklin of Bond and Specialty Insurance, and Michael Kline of Personal Insurance, will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end. At the end of the webcast presentation, our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10 Q and 10 K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer. Thank you, Abbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we shared our pre-release. Last week and again this morning, we reported a small net loss for the quarter due to a high level of catastrophe losses. And as we expected, a loss in our non-fixed income investment portfolio. Dan will have more to say about both shortly. Our underlying underwriting income of five hundred and seventy two million dollars pre-tax is up two hundred and fifty four million dollars over the prior year quarter, benefiting from solid net earned premium and a three point five point improvement in the underlying underwriting income. The combined ratio to a strong 91 point 4 percent. The pandemic and related economic conditions have only a modest net impact on our underwriting results. As I shared in my prepared remarks last quarter, there will be COVID nineteen related loss activity, but there will be some offsetting decline in losses due to people across the country sheltering in place. For us in the quarter, a hundred and fourteen million dollars of direct losses and sixty three million dollars of indirect losses. Premium adjustments were about off-set by initial estimates of favorable loss activity, most of which is in short-tail lines. Given the continued uncertainty, we've taken a cautious approach to recognizing the net impact of COVID-19 related loss activity. Some industry observers have speculated about the aggregate level of insured and investment losses arising out of the pandemic. We don't doubt the losses will be significant, but they won't be borne evenly across the industry. Insurers, our manageable COVID-related insurance losses so far this year are a reflection of our disciplined approach to risk selection as well as terms and conditions. And as we shared with you in some detail last quarter, we manage our investment portfolio with a similar regard for balancing risk and return. Last quarter, I commented on the potential future impacts the pandemic might have on each of our key lines of business. I'll review that again with a quarter's worth of experience. In personal auto, we've seen a meaningful drop off in auto frequency, although that is moderating as economic activity picks up. At the same time, we've taken into consideration the potential or some offsetting impact in terms of auto severity due to factors such as collisions occurring at higher speeds and driver distraction in workers' compensation. COVID-related claims mostly relate to health care workers and first responders. The frequency of those claims stabilized during the quarter, which might be attributed to an improved supply of PPE and the healthcare community having the benefit of more experience with managing COVID-19 patients. More broadly, beyond the healthcare sector, data from some of the state workers' comp systems suggest that the COVID-related claim rate is low relative to the infection rate. That's likely partly attributable to the fact that the population most seriously affected by COVID-19 skews older and is not in the workforce. Nevertheless, in developing our loss estimates, we've taken into consideration the potential for the delayed reporting of claims and additional claim activity associated with recent spikes in infection rates as well as uncertainty related to the longer-term implications of the disease. As we anticipated. SOME STATES HAVE EFFECTIVELY EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF WORKERS' COMP COVERAGE BY CREATING PRESUMPTIONS OF COMPENSABILITY. IN MOST CASES, STATES HAVE TAKEN A FAULTY APPROACH, PROTECTING WORKERS APPROPRIATELY BUT NOT UNREASONABLY BURDENING THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION SYSTEM. WHERE STATES HAVE ACTED TO EXPAND COMPENSABILITY, WE HAVE ADJUSTED OUR LOSS ESTIMATES ACCORDINGLY. IN TERMS OF NON-COVID WORKERS' COMP C STAY AT HOME THIS WILL UPDATE AS PEOPLE GET BACK TO THE WORKPLACE IN ADDITION TO TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT WE HAVE CONTEMPLATED THAT SEVERITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INJURED WORKERS DELAYING TREATMENT DUE TO THE STAY AT HOME WORK ENVIRONMENT HAVING SAID ALL THAT OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT THERE IS A LOWER LEVEL OF WORKERS COMP CLAIM ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH ECONOMIC RECESSIONS DURING PERIODS OF ELEVATED UNEMPLOYMENT WORKERS TEND TO BE Motivated to stay at their jobs and the workforce tends to be more seasonal in management liability, as we expected, we are seeing the elevated level of claim activity typically associated with stock market volatility and workforce reductions. The underlying combined ratio this quarter in bond specialty reflects that, as well as other loss activity. And we expect that the underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at this level or somewhat higher over the near term. THIS IS NOT UNLIKE THE EXPERIENCE WE HAD IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS A DECADE AGO NONETHELESS WE EXPECT THE RETURN FROM THIS SEGMENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE HEALTHY TURNING TO THE SHURITY BUSINESS WE HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO SEE THAT WORK IS CONTINUING ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS HOWEVER THE DEPTH AND DURATION OF STRESS IN THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO BE RISK FACTORS OF THE SHURITY BUSINESS THE LINE WILL ALSO BE IMPACTED BY OTHER FACTORS SU As I shared last quarter, our high-quality surety book was effectively stress-tested in the two thousand and eight financial crisis and performed well. Our underwriting approach has remained disciplined since that time. In that regard, so far, we haven't seen anything that has caused us to change our surety loss estimates. In terms of business interruption coverages under commercial property policies, there's a fair amount of litigation challenging coverage. Reminder: Our commercial property insurance policies include business interruption, including as a result of civil authority, which require losses to be caused by direct physical damage to property from a covered cause of loss. In addition, our standard policy forms specifically exclude loss or damage caused by or resulting from a virus. The few court decisions we've seen so far, one in New York and one in Michigan, have both upheld physical damage requirements in commercial property insurance policies. In the context of COVID 19 on the legislative front, efforts to retroactively expand coverage for business interruptions seem to be diminishing. Finally, with respect to liability coverages, as people shelter in place, we are seeing fewer commercial auto accidents and slip and fall type claims. Anecdotally, we are also seeing some movement by the plaintiff's bar to sort of claims faster. But it's too soon to know how significant that benefit is. MIGHT BE WE'RE ALSO ENCOURAGED BY STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED COVID RELATED LIABILITY PROTECTIONS AND SIMILAR EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDER WAY IN OTHER STATES AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE SHOULDN'T LET FRIVOLITOUS LAWSUITS UNDERMINE THE NATION'S RECOVERY NONETHELESS WE EXPECT THE PLANES TO FAR TO CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVE TURNING TO THE QUARTER AND THE TOP LINE WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH OUR PRODUCTION RESULTS EXCLUDING THE AUTO PRE The net written premium grew by two percent as the impact of COVID-19 on insured exposures was more than offset by strong renewal rate changes in all three segments. In business insurance, we achieved renewal rate changes of 7.4 percent, the highest level since 2013 and close to the record level we achieved that year. Excluding Workers' Comp, renewal rate change was double digits. Importantly, retention levels remain strong. In bond specialty insurance, net written premiums increase by three percent as our domestic management liability business achieves a reputable renewal rate change while maintaining strong retention. In personal insurance, excluding the other premium refund, net written premiums increase by six percent driven by strong retention and new business in both agency auto and agency homeowners. In our agency homeowners business, renewal premium change remains. STRONG AT SEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT AND WE HIT A RECORD FOR NEW BUSINESS LET ME TAKE A MINUTE TO COMMENT ON THE COMMERCIAL RATE ENVIRONMENT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STRUCK THERE WERE A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY WIDE FACTORS PUTTING UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES NAMELY INCREASED VOLATILITY OF WEATHER RELATED LOSES INTEREST RATES AT HISTORICAL LOWS AND A GROWING RECOGNITION OF HIGHER LOSS RATES IN THE LIABILITY LINES ALL OF THOSE CONDITIONS PERSIST And now at another quarter with a very high level of weather-related losses, interest rates that are likely to be lower for longer, and while it hasn't been a significant factor for us, a reinsurance market that is hardened. And on top of that, the pandemic and related economic fallout add a sense of incremental uncertainty making the steal like one of those times not unlike the wake of nine eleven in hurricane katrina when the market recalibrates risk. WITH THAT AS THE BACKGROUND WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK GREAT GAINS AND MANAGE OTHER LEVERS OF PROFITABILITY TO IMPROVE THE OUTLET FOR RETURNS I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING THAT I COULDN'T BE MORE GRATEFUL TO MY TRAVELERS COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR GIT AND COMMITMENT TO TAKING CARE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS OUR COMMUNITIES AND EACH OTHER ALSO THE WORK THEY'VE DONE IN RECENT YEARS TO ADVANCE OUR INNOVATION AGENDA HAS EQUIPPED US WITH STATE WELL PREPARED AND FROM HERE WELL POSITIONED FREE FROM FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DISTRACTIONS WILL CONTINUE UNINTERRUPTED MANAGING OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTING FOR LONG TERM SUCCESS IN SHORT WE'RE CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO SUCCEED THROUGH THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES AND TO BENEFIT FROM THE STRENGTH OF OUR FRANCHISE AS THE ECONOMY RECOVERS AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN THE CALL OVER TO DAN THANK YOU ALLAN For the second quarter, it was fifty million dollars compared to core income of five hundred thirty seven million dollars in the prior year quarter. The change resulted primarily from a higher level of catastrophe losses and as expected, lower net investment income for the quarter. The net impact related to COVID nineteen is included in our underlying results, not as part of our cat figure and was modest, more on that in a minute. Our second quarter results include eight hundred million dollars. FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF PRETAX CAT LOSSES COMPARED TO ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER THIS QUARTER'S CATS INCLUDE SEVERE STORMS IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF LOSSES RELATED TO CIVIL UNREST REGARDING OUR PROPERTY AGGREGATE CATASTROPHE X O L TREATY FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WE HAVE ACCUMULATED ABOUT The treaty provides aggregate coverage of two hundred and eighty million dollars, part of five hundred million dollars of losses above that one point five five billion dollar retention. The underlying combined ratio is ninety one point four percent, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, improved by three and a half points compared to ninety four point nine percent in last year's second quarter. The underlying loss ratio improved by more than four points. Weather losses, favorable frequency and personal auto from the shelter in place environment, net of related premium refunds, and the impact of earn pricing in excess of loss trend. The expense ratio of thirty one percent is eight tenths of a point higher than the prior year quarter and above our recent run rate. This change was as expected due to the reduction in premiums associated with the pandemic's impact on the economy along with the premium refunds to our personal auto customers. The net impact of COVID-19 and its related effects on the economy were modest in terms of our overall second quarter underwriting. Our top line was resilient, excluding the premium refunds and personal insurance, net written premiums increased by two percent. Driven by strong renewal rate changes in all three segments that more than offset lower insured exposures. In terms of operating expenses, results were adversely impacted by modest increases in the allowance for bad debt and the accrual for supplemental commissions. Those expense increases, however, were roughly offset by lower expenses in other categories. For example, travel costs were down as our employees continue to work primarily from home. The economic impacts related to COVID-19 also affected our underlying losses. For example, losses directly related to COVID-19 totaled one hundred and fourteen million dollars, primarily workers' compensation and business insurance and management liability losses in our bond and specialty business. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN AUTO CLAIMS AS THERE WERE FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, AND TO A LESSER DEGREE, RECOGNIZED A BENEFIT REFLECTING FEWER TRADITIONAL WORKERS' COMP CLAIMS AS MORE PEOPLE WORK FROM HOME. AS YOU HEARD FROM ALLEN, GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, WE TOOK A CAUTIOUS APPROACH IN ESTIMATING THE NET IMPACT OF COVID-RELATED LOSS Including incurred losses for which claims have not yet been reported, all losses have been recorded at our estimate of ultimate. And the majority of the COVID-19 related insurance losses we have booked in the first and second quarters are still sitting in our ibnr reserves. We have not recognized losses or benefits from COVID-19 related insured events that we anticipate will occur subsequent to the end of the quarter, taking a step back on a year-to-date basis. The impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The results, excluding that investment income from COVID-19 and its related effects, is a net charge of about fifty million dollars pretax. Turning to prior-year reserve development in personal insurance, both auto and property losses came in better than expected for multiple accident years. In bond and specialty insurance, we saw larger losses than expected in management liability, resulting in prior-year strengthening of thirty-three million dollars, largely offsetting the favorable development in personal insurance. In business insurance, there was no net prioritization of reserve development as better than expected loss experience in workers' compensation and commercial property was largely offset by unfavorable results in our other casualty lines. Each of the movements this quarter was relatively small when compared to the reserve base. As you saw in our July 14th press release, we expect to record subrogation benefits and our third quarter PYD of approximately four hundred million dollars pretax related to PG. And E's Successful Emergence from Bankruptcy on July 1st as a Reminder Third Quarter P I D Will Also Include the Results of Our Annual Asbestos Review After Tax Net Investment Income Decreased by Fifty Four Percent from the Prior Year Quarter to Two Hundred Fifty One Million Dollars a Slightly Better Result than We Had Previewed in Our Call Last Quarter the Decrease was Driven by Our Non Fixed Income Returns Where Results for Our Private Equity Hedge Fund and Real Estate Partnership Are generally reported to us on a one quarter lag. Accordingly, the impact of the disruption in global financial markets that occurred in the latter half of the first quarter impacted our second quarter results. As the broader markets have recovered in the second quarter, that should at least to some extent benefit our non-fixed income results in the third quarter. It's worth mentioning here that recoveries may not be reflected in private equity and hedge fund results as quickly as the downturns. Given continued economic uncertainty, fund managers who report their results to us may take a more measured approach and not be as quick to write back up the valuations they just marked down, particularly in light of what may be continued challenging prospects for the earnings and cash flows of the fund's underlying investments. Fixed income returns decreased by 24 million dollars after tax as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by the decline in interest rates and underlying investments. CHANGE AS WE CHOSE TO MAINTAIN A SOMEWHAT HIGHER LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND HELD MORE SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS THAN IN PRIOR QUARTERS FOR THE REMAINDER OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WE EXPECT THAT FIXED INCOME N A I WILL DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AFTER TAX PER QUARTER COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN TURNING INTO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE QUAR CAPITAL RATIOS WERE AT BETTER THAN TARGET LEVELS AND WE ENDED THE QUARTER WITH HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY OF SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS WELL ABOVE OUR TARGET LEVEL. RECALL THAT IN APRIL WE PREEFUNDED AS WE NORMALLY DO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT COMING DUE IN NOVEMBER WITH A NEW THIRTY YEAR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR DET ISSUANCE AT TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT SO OUR HOLDING COMPANY LIQUID SECOND QUARTER AND ACCORDINGLY OUR NET UNDER-REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS INCREASED FROM ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AFTER TAX AS OF MARCH THIRTY FIRST TO THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AFTER TAX AT JUNE THIRTY EIGHTH ADJUSTED BOOK VALUE PER SHARE WHICH EXCLUDES NET UNDER-REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES WAS NINETY TWO DOLLARS AND ONE CENT AT QUARTER END DOWNLESS THAN ONE PERCENT FROM YEAR END AND UP TW We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. As we indicated in our first quarter earnings call, our capital management strategy remains unchanged. With the ongoing economic uncertainty and with hurricane season upon us, it still feels to us like holding onto a little more capital is preferable to holding onto a little less. Until there's more clarity on the state of the economy, we may buy back some shares in the coming quarters or we may continue to choose to buy none. Please direct your attention to slide 19 of the webcast presentation for a summary of our July 1st renewals. The structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior year. We renewed our northeastern cat treaty effective July 1st with substantially similar terms and pricing that was up only slightly on an exposure-adjusted basis. Our cat bond Long Point Re III is now in the third year of its four-year term in the annual reset for the 2020 hurricane season. The attachment point was adjusted from one point seven nine billion dollars to one point eight seven billion dollars while the total cost of the program was flat year over year. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage including our general cat aggregate xl treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our ten q which we filed earlier today and in our two thousand nineteen one ten k lastly, let me take a minute to address our top questions. GOING FORWARD LOOKING AT PREMIUM VOLUME WE EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE THE IMPACTS OF ECONOMIC DISRUPTION HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT WE FEEL AND FOR HOW LONG WILL DEPEND ON THE EXTENT AND DURATION OF THE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE PREMIUM VOLUME TYPICALLY LAGS RIGHT PREMIUM WE EXPECT TO FEEL THE EFFECTS ON AN EARN BASIS BEYOND THE END OF THE YEAR AS ALAN SAID LAST QUARTER WE DO NOT INTEND TO TAKE DISRUP It has been proven to be a short-term impact on premium volumes. Accordingly, in coming quarters, the expense ratio will likely remain somewhat elevated compared to the corresponding periods of two thousand nineteen due to the expected impact on earned premiums. Now, I'll turn a call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance. Thanks, Dan. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to all my travelers colleagues, as well as our agent and broker partners, for continuing to provide exceptional service. To our customers during these unprecedented times. As for the quarter's results, business insurance had a loss for the quarter of fifty eight million dollars due to lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses as both Allan and Dan discussed. The combined ratio of a hundred and seven point one percent included more than ten points of catastrophies impacted by both weather-related losses and civil unrest. The underlying combined ratio of ninety seven percent improved by zero. Twenty-four points reflecting a zero point two point improvement in each of the underlying loss ratio and expense ratio. The net impact of COVID nineteen and related economic conditions was modest. Turning to the top line, net written premiums were three percent lower than the prior year quarter due to the impact of the economic disruption on insured exposures. Thanks to excellent execution by our field organization, these impacts were largely offset. BY STRONG RENEWAL RATE DECREASES AND HIGH RETENTIONS TURNING TO DOMESTIC PRODUCTION WE ACHIEVE STRONG RENEWAL RATE CHANGES OF SEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT WHILE RETENTION REMAINED HIGH AT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT THE RENEWAL RATE CHANGES OF SEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT WAS UP ALMOST FOUR POINTS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AND MORE THAN A POINT FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR NOTWITHSTANDING THE PERSISTENT DOWNWARD PRESSURE IN WORKERS' CO We continued to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines other than workers compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the second quarter of last year. We achieved positive rate on about eighty percent of our middle market accounts this quarter which was up from about two thirds in the second quarter of last year. Importantly, we've achieved this progress in a highly segmented manner and with retention remaining strong. At these rates, At current levels, our rate change continues to exceed lost trend even after about a half point increase to our lost trend assumption. New business of four hundred and seventy three million dollars was down ten percent from the prior year quarter. New business flow was down which we attribute largely to disruption caused by the pandemic. New business was also impacted by our continued focus on disciplined risk selection, underwriting, and pricing. These productions were impacted by our continued focus on disciplined risk selection, underwriting, and pricing. These productions were impacted by our continued focus on disciplined risk selection, underwriting, and pricing. These productions were impacted by our continued focus on disciplined risk selection, underwriting, and pricing. These productions were impacted by our continued focus on disciplined risk selection, underwriting, and pricing. These productions The results reflect superior execution by our field organization in a very challenging environment. As for the individual businesses in select renewal rate change was up to two point one percent making the sixth consecutive quarter where renewal rate was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter while retention was strong at eighty two percent the headwind for workers compensation pricing is most pronounced in the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly driven by the select business new business was down significantly The economic disruption caused by the pandemic while the current environment is challenging we are confident that we are well positioned in investing in the right strategic capabilities that will profitably grow this business over time in the middle market renewal rate change was up to seven point nine percent while retention remained strong at eighty six percent the seven point nine percent was up almost four and a half points from the second quarter of twenty nineteen and one and a half points From the first quarter of two thousand and twenty new business of two hundred and fifty five million dollars was down from the prior year quarter driven by both economic disruption and our continued focus on disciplined risk selection underwriting and pricing to sum up we believe our meaningful competitive advantages including our strong distribution relationships and our talent and expertise position us well to navigate through these uncertain times and continue to serve our customers. Customers and agent and broker partners. With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd. Thanks, Greg. Bonded Specialty delivered solid returns and growth in the quarter despite the impacts of Covid nineteen and related economic conditions. Segment income was seventy two million dollars, a decrease of one hundred and two million dollars from the prior year quarter. As Dan mentioned, the combined ratio of ninety three point eight. 1 PERCENT REFLECTS UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE QUARTER AS COMPARED TO FAVORABLE P Y I D IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AND A HIGHER UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO OF EIGHTY EIGHT POINT ONE PERCENT INCREASED SEVEN POINT ONE POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACTS OF HIGHER LOSS ESTIMATES FOR MANAGEMENT LIABILITY COVERAGES ABOUT HALF OF WHICH Which was due to covid nineteen and related economic conditions the remaining half of the increase is due to a few smaller drivers such as elevated claim activity under employment practices liability coverages and ransomware losses under cyber policies turning to the top line net written premiums grew three percent for the quarter reflecting strong growth in our management liability. International businesses partially offset by lower assurance production in our domestic management liability business. We are pleased that renewal premium change increased to 70.8 percent. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter where our PC is higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. As Alan noted, renewal rate change was a record for the quarter while retention improved. Remained at a historically high 89 percent similar to business insurance. Our PC in the quarter was also impacted by lower insured exposures. These production results demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy to pursue rate where needed while maintaining strong retention of our high-quality portfolio. We will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted. DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT LIABILITY NEW BUSINESS FOR THE QUARTER DECREASED THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS REFLECTING THE DISRUPTION ASSOCIATED WITH COVID NINETEEN IN OUR THOUGHTFUL UNDERWRITING IN THIS ELEVATED RISK ENVIRONMENT DOMESTIC SHIREY NET PREMIUM NET WRITTEN PREMIUM WAS DOWN TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE QUARTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF COVID NINETEEN WHICH SLOWED PUBLIC PROJECT PROCUREMENT AND RELATED BOND DEMAND INTERNATIONAL B S I POSTED STRONG GROWTH IN THE QUARTER WITH RECORD RATE IN OUR U K MANAGEMENT VIABILITY BUSINESSES SO BOND AND SPECIALTY RESULTS REMAIN RESILIENT DESPITE THE CHALLENGES BROUGHT ON BY COVID NINETEEN THESE RESULTS REFLECT THE EXCELLENT WORK OF OUR AGENTS BROKERS AND EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE ADOPTED TO OPERATING IN NEW WAYS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE LEADING PRODUCTS Products and services to our customers. We feel confident about our ability to navigate through this challenging environment and continue to deliver strong returns over time. And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss personal insurance. Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Personal insurance segment income for the second quarter of twenty twenty was ten million dollars down from eighty eight million dollars in the prior year quarter. Driven by a higher level of catastrophe losses and lower net investment income, these impacts were partially offset by an improvement in the underlying underwriting gain. Our combined ratio for the quarter was one hundred and one point three percent, an increase of one point one points as a twelve and a half point increase in catastrophe losses was largely offset by a ten point six point improvement in the underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio benefited from lower non-catastrophe losses. Weather-related losses and lower automobile losses net of premium refunds. The increase of two point six points on the underwriting expense ratio was primarily driven by the reduction in net underwriting premiums resulting from the auto premium refunds. Turning to the top line, excluding the impact of premium refunds of two hundred and sixteen million dollars, net written premiums grew six percent. Agency homeowners and other net written premiums were up an impressive thirteen percent. Agency Automobile Net Premiums were up three percent, excluding premium refunds. Agency Automobile delivered strong results with a combined ratio of 85.7 percent for the quarter. The loss ratio improved over twelve points while the underwriting expense ratio increased by about four points. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio was primarily driven by the impact of the premium refunds I described earlier. The underlying combined ratio. Eighty four point two percent improved nine point six points relative to the prior year quarter continuing to reflect improvements in frequency primarily due to fewer miles driven as a result of the pandemic data from our intel drive auto telematics program indicates miles driven were down significantly from pre-covid nineteen levels during the second quarter and partially rebounded as the economy has started to reopen. In response to our improved auto loss experience, we implemented a stay at home auto premium credit program for personal automobile customers in the US. The program provided a fifteen percent premium refund on April, May, and June premiums. In agency homeowners and others, the second quarter combined ratio was one hundred thirteen point nine percent, nine point four points higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to higher catastrophes. BY A LOWER UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO HISTORICALLY THE SECOND QUARTER IS OUR HIGHEST CATASTROPHE QUARTER THIS QUARTER WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT STORM ACTIVITY RESULTING IN THIRTY FOUR POINTS OF CATASTROPHE LOSS AN INCREASE OF TWENTY ONE POINTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER WHERE CATASTROPHIES WERE RELATIVELY LOW THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO FOR THE QUARTER WAS EIGHTY ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT DOWN OVER ELEVEN POIN We're now dealing with non-catastrophic weather-related losses. The majority of the improvement is due to elevated non-cat weather-related losses this quarter. Non-cat weather-related losses this quarter were also better than our assumptions. Turning to quarterly production, our domestic agency results were solid despite the challenging environment resulting from COVID-19 and its related economic impacts. Our retentions remain strong. Quotes and new business were up. VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AND WE REMAIN PLEASED WITH OUR POLICIES IN FORCE GROWTH AGENCY AUTOMOBILE RETENTION WAS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT AND NEW BUSINESS INCREASED SEVEN PERCENT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE WAS ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT AS WE CONTINUE TO MODERATE PRICING GIVEN THE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN OUR BOOK OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AGENCY HOMEOWNERS ANOTHER DELIVERED ANOTHER VERY STRONG QUARTER WITH RETENTION Seven point seven percent and a seventeen percent increase in new business as we continue to seek to improve returns while growing the business. Higher new business levels again benefited from the successful rollout of our quantum home two point oh product now available in over forty markets. During the quarter, we continued to deliver new capabilities and products to our customers and distribution partners. We introduced quantum home two point oh in four new states including California. In addition, we launched Intel Drive 2.0, which adds distracted driving monitoring to our auto telematics product and delivers significant improvements to the user experience. And after reaching our goal of planting one million trees for customer enrollment in paperless billing, we extended our partnership with American Forests to plant another five hundred thousand trees by Earth Day 2021. To recap, personal insurance is off to a strong start in the first half of the year. Particularly in light of a challenging environment, I'm proud of our team's efforts to continue working together to meet the needs of those we're privileged to serve while investing in the business for the future. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Abbie. Thanks, Michael. Before we begin, there's one topic that we expect might be on people's minds, so we thought we would kick off Q&A by addressing it. So, before we open up the line, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dan. Thanks, Abbie. There's been some discussion by industry observers about the timing of the recognition of COVID-related losses. So, let me reiterate that our reserves reflect our best estimate of ultimate losses incurred as of the balance sheet date. In applying accounting principles, we would not record a reserve for a loss that has not yet occurred as of the balance sheet date. Using auto claims as an example, at the beginning of the year, we have an assumption as to the volume of auto claims. The number of claims we will see over the course of the year and what the average cost of those claims will be. But when we report our second quarter results, including our balance sheet loss reserves as of June thirtieth, those reserves do not include estimated amounts for auto accidents that will occur at Thanksgiving or on New Year's Eve. Those would be fourth quarter events, and accordingly, they will be recognized in our fourth quarter results. This same principle applies when we consider losses related to COVID-19. 19: While only some losses have been reported to us so far, the losses we booked in both the first and second quarter reflect our estimate of the ultimate amounts that will pay for all losses and related costs that have been incurred as of June thirtieth, including those for which we have not yet received a claim. In fact, as I said earlier, the majority of the COVID-related insurance losses we have booked through June thirtieth are still sitting in our insurance reserves. That said, the pandemic is still ongoing, and we will continue to monitor and adjust our reserves as necessary. It is clear that the pandemic is not over and tens of thousands of new infections are being confirmed in the United States each day. It is foreseeable that a healthcare worker who has not contracted COVID-19 will become ill from COVID-19 as a result of their job duties in December. However, that lost activity will be included in our fourth quarter results. Male Speaker: For workers comp clients, finally, I'll remind you that on a year-to-date basis, setting aside net investment income, the impact on our results from COVID nineteen and its related effects is a net charge of about fifty million dollars pretax. And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions.\n\nFemale Speaker: Thank you. At this time, if you'd like to ask a question, press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press pound key. Please wait while we compile the questions. YOUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM LINE OF MICHAEL PHILLIPS BUT MAGGIE AND STANLEY PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THANKS FOR THOSE CLARIFICATIONS DAN THANK YOU LAST COMMENT THAT THAT'S HELPFUL UM I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO GET ARMS AROUND BUSINESS BUSINESS INSURANCE AND AND MARGINS AND PRICING YOU KNOW TRYING TO KIND OF PULL OUT THE EFFECT OF COVID YOU SAID COVID WAS PRETTY MODEST IN A QUARTER PRICING WAS CLEAR 40 BITS OR 20 BITS ON THE LEFT SIDE. SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT IS, IS THAT MEANS YOU KNOW AND ANNALYN GAVE LOTS OF GREAT COMMENTARY ON PRICING. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE CURRENT LEVEL OF PRICING STILL ISN'T ENOUGH TO EXPAND MARGINS TODAY OR KINDA HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT VERSUS THE LEVEL OF CONSERVATISM THAT MIGHT BE BAKED INTO THE CURRENT NUMBERS? At the current levels, the written rate is in excess of the loss rate. So, looking narrowly at those factors, we are in a written basis expanding margins. Is that, is that what you're getting at? Yes, it is. Yes, it is. I guess, in business, you had twenty basis points of improvement. So, you know, not as much as maybe one would expect, given a level of pricing. And so, that's what I'm trying to get my arms around. Yeah, so, you know, as always, there are a number of factors that are driving the underlying combined ratio in, in the quarter, and that's true for any business. So, you've got, you've got weather, so year over year, that was, that was better and, and in this quarter, sort of within the normal range, within the normal level of variability, we would expect for that. You've got the earned impact of rate, that is, as I said, on both the written and earned basis, rate is is ahead of lost trend. We've had improved performance in some businesses. Someone is speaking to a group of people.\n\nMAN: We've got some impact of COVID. It was modest, but not zero. You know, you've got the year-over-year inflation in that sort of ongoing carry-on impact of social inflation that I'll call old news. What you know, that what we've recognized in prior periods and that continues to roll through. So, you know, those are, you know, given the relative stability, we're not gonna quantify the pieces, but essentially those are the pieces. But didn't see mention on and I guess this is good news. Didn't see mention of anything on the commercial auto side for for PYD and so maybe could you speak to kind of that piece and does that mean that there's been possibly some loving off of paid activity that's been part of the part of the concern there michael it's it's dan yet as we had last quarter so we had some movements in PYD some you know some puts and takes some continued good news in comp some continued pressure in the other liability lines there were worse Adjustments in commercial auto and the general liability lines in Sanpete, but as I said in my remarks, relatively modest compared to compared to those reserve bases. From the COVID just from the direct losses alone or the direct impact what was the hit that that had in business interruption on the combined ratio? Impact on that number? Yeah, Ryan, it's Dan. I don't think we're going to give the plusses and the minuses, but within the within the we, we told you that there was a hundred and fourteen million of directly related charges and while that included some some charges for the management liability coverage in bond and specialty, the majority of what we took came through business insurance. And then in terms of thinking about the benefits that we're seeing, I THINK IN THE PRE ANNOUNCEMENT YOU SAID IT WAS MOSTLY SHORT TAIL LINES BUT SHOULD WE TAKE THAT TO ME I MEAN FIRST OF ALL OUTSIDE OF THE SHORT TAIL LINES ARE YOU SEEING ACTUAL TO EXPECTEDS LOOK A LITTLE BETTER IN SOME AREAS IN TERMS OF FREQUENCY AND IS THAT NOTHING THAT IF SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT RECOGNISING YET YOUR YOU'RE BEING CONSERVATIVE AND WAITING TO SEE IF THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE RYAN DAN AGAIN SO WE Some favorable indications relative to what you would otherwise expect in this current environment and when we look at that there was too much favorability to simply say zero is the right reaction but as Alan said in his comments and as I tried to reiterate in mine I think we've been very cautious in terms of the degree to which we'd recognize any good news in anything other than the short tail lines but there's some because it's it's very apparent. Data, and then just one more real quick, um, I was, I guess, a little bit surprised, exposure growth held in, I think, especially in select lines. Retention is only declined modestly. How do we interpret that? Is retention is it capturing cancellations or is that modest dip you know mostly a function of your guys taking more rain? I'm just trying to figure out how to interpret those numbers that seem relatively modest given what's happening in the macro landscape. Yeah, Ryan, let me say, this is Greg. Let me take both of those in the order that you took them. Number one, in terms of exposure change, if you're looking at that relative to middle market, that's really a product mix dynamic. In the select business, we have the thrust of the premium. Two products, CMT and Workers' Comp. And the CMT product, the rating on that is driven more off the property than the G. And so, you know, we're continuing to see pricing and inflationary pressure on the property and so there's some inflationary impact. The impact of the CMP product and so you don't see as much of a drag on exposure on select that you do on middle market where the G L product is more in a standalone rated basis and then the retention overall for select you know that we certainly put our estimate of what we see in terms of business insolvencies and bankruptcies and that's all inside the eighty two percent number. It's good to see Mayor Schultz with K D W, please go ahead. Great, thanks. Greg, if I heard you correctly in your prepared comments, you talked about a fifty basis point increase in loss trend. And I see you hoping you could flush that out a little more. Sure, Mayor. And we, we look at loss trend every quarter, and across the full portfolio. And that's obviously a headline number. What we did this quarter is we looked at the impact of the new economy that we see in front of us. Social Inflation and Liability Dynamics that Dan just talked about when we roll that all up in aggregate, we believe we've got a fifty basis points increase in our loss trend in front of us. The thing i'd add to that, myers, is that, that is reflected in the underlying combined ratio we reported for the quarter, as is a piece of that that would be catch up from the first quarter. A man is speaking in a foreign language. It is difficult to understand what he is saying, but he seems to be discussing something related to work and compensation. He mentions the term \"exposure unit headwind\" at one point, but it is unclear what this refers to. The man's accent is difficult to understand, but he seems to be speaking with a British accent. The regulatory component of pricing, as you know, and it tends to be, you know, a little bit backward looking, and it, and it sort of factors in the overall profitability of the line, which is, as you know, has been has been very favorable over the years. And that will continue to be the case. So, clearly, you know, exposure will be will be one impact on profitability today, which will impact pricing tomorrow, but it's really hard to isolate any one factor in its impact on profitability because, you know, exposure will be will be one impact on profitability today, which will impact pricing tomorrow, but it's really hard to isolate any one factor in its impact on profitability because, you know, exposure will be will be one impact on profitability today, which will impact pr Everything goes in. You've got, you know, you've got, start with your expiring rate, and then you've got, you know, whatever the rate change is, and you've got exposure change, you've got, lost trend, things like that. So, it's, it's definitely a factor. It's hard to isolate, you know, what extent the impact is. Okay, understood. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Elise Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Someone is making a phone call.\n\nWOMAN: Hi, good morning. Could you hear me?\n\nMAN: No, we hear you now.\n\nWOMAN: I'm sorry, thank you. In terms of business insurance, I was hoping for the COVID nineteen losses and I recognize in response to an earlier question, maybe you aren't giving just the loss impacts in business insurance specifically by line. But could you give us a sense of where you saw the majority of losses? Your COVID losses that's ignoring the favorable impact in the second quarter just specifically within business insurance. Yeah, so so that's what I had tried to do. So we took a hundred and fourteen million across the enterprise in direct in direct COVID losses. None of that was in personal insurance. There was some component of management liability within bond and specialty insurance which tom described as going through their combined ratio. BUT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE DOLLARS CAME THROUGH BUSINESS INSURANCE. LISA, ARE YOU ASKING FOR A BREAKDOWN BY BY PRODUCT LINE? YEAH, I WAS HOPING BY PRODUCT LINE, EVEN IF NOT IN TERMS OF DOLLARS, YOU COULD JUST GIVE US A SENSE OF WHICH BUSINESS INSURANCE PRODUCT LINE SAW THE MAJORITY OF YOUR COVID LOSES. THE LARGEST LINE FOR SURE IS WORKERS COMP. SOME, SOME PROPERTY LOSES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. AND THEN DRIBS AND DRABS I WOULD SAY IN OTHER LINES BUT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE TWO DRIVERS WITH COMP BY FAR BEING THE LARGEST AT LEAST I'D POINT YOU TO MY PREPARED COMMENTS WHERE I DID SHARE THAT YOU KNOW THERE WAS A MODEST NET IMPACT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OFFSETTING OF THE FAVORABLE FREQUENCY ON SOME OF THOSE LINES ALSO OH YEAH THANKS AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS MAYBE A FOLLOW-UP ON THE PRIOR QUESTION ON WORKERS COMP ON W IT SEEMS LIKE STARTING TO POINT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF COMP IN TERMS OF JUST THE PRICING DYNAMICS THERE BUT IF I GO BACK TO YOUR COMMENTS THROUGHOUT THE CALL IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU GUYS ARE THINKING THAT THE YOU KNOW RATE DECLINES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THAT BUSINESS ARE YOU KNOW CLOSE TO COMING TO AN END ON IT SO IF YOU COULD JUST HELP US THINK ABOUT WORKFORCE COMP IN TERMS OF THE PRICING DYNAMICS THERE AND WHETHER YOU KNOW Female Speaker: Well, at least that's a great question. When you look at the information coming out of some of the rating bureaus, and when we look at our own, we would say that we are sort of at or near the bottom in workers' compensation. Okay, that's helpful. And one last number question. Could you give us you said there were small numbers, but is there could you give us a sense of the dollars in terms of the adverse development within general liability and commercial multi-peril in the quarter? Someone is speaking in a foreign language. It is difficult to understand what they are saying. Some sense of how you're thinking about COVID-related adverse impacts throughout the rest of the year, just looking through your portfolio of exposures and thinking how it might be affected by COVID, even if the losses haven't occurred yet in the first half and you have the exposure and you think there is a possibility that there could be a loss on it, just wondering to get some some thoughts there. MISS ANYTHING I LIEK DAN TO TAKE IT UP WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE W I have the biggest impact on the pandemic on us. But I do think it's relevant to point out that in the first half of the year, our net losses were about 50 million bucks. And our net charges were about 50 million bucks, putting aside the investment side. And we've, you know, put up that net number with a high degree of caution. So I can't give you a number, you know, I tried in my sort of line by line review to tell you some of the facts. The speaker begins by saying that they think about things that other people don't think about. They then say that they think it's not irrelevant to think about their experience in the first half of the year. The speaker then says that they think it's important to think about renewal rate changes. They then say that they think it's important to exclude workers comp from renewal rate changes. The speaker then says that they think it's important to exclude workers comp from renewal rate changes. The speaker then says that they think it's important to exclude workers comp from renewal rate changes. The speaker then says that they think it's important to exclude workers comp from renewal rate changes.

The speaker then says that they think it's important to exclude workers comp from renewal The audio features a man speaking with a British accent. He is discussing the importance of renewable energy and how it can be used to replace fossil fuels. He notes that renewable energy is currently only a small percentage of the total energy used in the world, but that it has the potential to become a major source of energy in the future. He also notes that renewable energy is often more expensive than fossil fuels, but that the long-term benefits of using renewable energy make it a worthwhile investment. Finally, he concludes by saying that renewable energy is the right way to think about energy in the 21st century. A male voice is speaking in a monotone tone. He is speaking about the current state of the stock market. He mentions that the market has been on an upward trend for the past four and a half years. He also mentions that the market is currently at an all-time high. He also mentions that the market is currently experiencing a high level of volatility. He also mentions that the market is currently experiencing a high level of uncertainty. He also mentions that the market is currently experiencing a high level of risk. He also mentions that the market is currently experiencing a high level of complexity. He also mentions that the market is currently experiencing a high level of interdependence. He also mentions that the market is currently experiencing a high level of globalization. He also mentions that the market is currently experiencing a high level of digitalization. He also mentions that the AND SO YOU KNOW WE FEEL GREAT ABOUT THAT EXECUTION AND MOSTLY THE CHANGES LINE UP WITH WHERE THE RATE NEED IS ALSO OH GREAT AND IF I CAN JUST SNEAK ONE MORE IN ON THE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL LIABILITY HOPEFULLY I GET A LITTLE BIT MORE COLOR IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU SAW IN THE QUARTER THAT I GUESS BROUGHT YOU TO MAKE THAT CHANGE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT MOST OF THE COURTS WERE CLOSED During the quarter, I would think the page would be you know nothing really accelerated during the quarter or was it more just a view of of you know or was it more just an ongoing review that resulted in the change there yeah it's more the latter and remember as we're doing reserve reviews especially in long tail lines like those you're looking more backwards at at your data so the actual lost environment of may and june The audio features a male voice speaking in a monotonous tone. The voice speaks about the importance of being aware of one's surroundings and the potential dangers that may be lurking. The voice also speaks about the importance of being prepared for emergencies and having a plan in place in case of an emergency. The voice concludes by reminding listeners to always be aware of their surroundings and to be prepared for emergencies. Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler, please go ahead.\n\nAh, you've hit the big ones for me, but one just quick one. From an investment perspective, do you have expectations that we would see increased defaults as well, come through? I guess I'm just curious, is that sort of booked into the investment expectations that you gave us this quarter as well? Someone is giving a speech about investment portfolios.\n\nPERSON 1: So, we might see some changes from the recession.\n\nPERSON 2: Yeah, Paul and Dan, you know we gave a fair amount of detail and did a fair amount of commentary on the construct of the investment portfolio and in our comfort level with, you know, the way we thoughtfully invested. And we've given you an update of that investment detail again in the appendix of the webcast presentation this quarter. So, I wouldn't say more than we said I think last quarter in terms of investment detail again in the appendix of the webcast presentation this quarter. A MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY AND THOUGFULLY ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT ON THE ASSET SIDE OF THE BALANCE SHEET, AND HOW THEY ARE AWARE OF CREDIT IMPAIRMENT AND DEFAULT RATES, AND HOW THEY HAVE A REGULAR PROCESS TO ASSESS THESE THINGS, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT A BIG IMPACT ON THEM GIVEN THE THOUGHTFUL INVESTMENT APPROACH IN THE FIRST PLACE. A man and woman are discussing the impact of premium adjustments on the BI written premium this quarter. QUESTION BRIAN: DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE FOR WORKERS LIKE US, LIKE RE-EVALUATING UM, LIKE WHAT EMPLOYMENT POINY STUFF IS ON WORKERS COMP, YOU USUALLY DO IT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER BUT WHERE THERE'S ANY KIND OF, YOU KNOW, EARLY ONES WHERE YOU ADJUSTED PREMIUMS KIND OF TO REFLECT WHAT UM, WHAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE THROUGH THE YEAR? We've been open to it, there's been some written more requests by customers to do some of that mid-term but all of that's baked into our production statistics and the written premium numbers we reported for the quarter, Brian. I don't think we can break out that one piece. Okay, thanks. And then the second quick question, just to understand the fifty basis points of increase in trend in the BI. Is that inclusive of what you're seeing with respect to COVID nineteen and maybe the benefits or adverse stuff you're seeing on COVID nineteen? OR IS THAT MORE RELATED TO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH JUST GENERAL KINDS OF TORT ILLATION AND SOME OF THE INCREASES YOU SAW IN YOUR G L R E S ER V I S A N D Y O U R S E M P R I Z R E S ER V Z IY0 I TH IH1 NG K W EH1 R W IY1 K AH0 N S IH1 D ER0 EH1 V R IY0 TH IH2 NG B R AY1 AH0 N IH1 N K L UW0 D IH0 D IH1 N DH EH1 R AE1 N D DH EH1 R AA1 R S AH1 M sil P UH1 T S What's your kind of take on what's going on with tort right now? Could we potentially see an increase in tort inflation, you know, as a result of what's going on with COVID nineteen? Yeah, I mean, I think we certainly could, and that's one of the reasons why we're such big proponents of liability reform. I think it's important in terms of making sure we're protecting the nation's recovery from from the pandemic. You know, I think you hear a lot of rhetoric out there on that topic. BUT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WE SEE AND EVERYTHING WE'RE ANTICIPATING IS IS IN THAT ROSTER NUMBER GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION COMING FROM THE LINE OF JAMIE BULLER WITH J P MORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING SO FIRST I HAD A QUESTION ON JUST THE COMMERCIAL AUTO BUSINESS IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF FREQUENCY IS THAT PICKING UP AS TRAFFIC HAS BEEN Only one message at a time. Please allow any other responses to complete before sending another message, or wait one minute. I'm sorry, I cannot provide the text version of the audio as the transcript seems to be incomplete and unclear. Can you please provide more context or clarify what you are looking for? Personal auto insurance, you know, I think, like many, we're looking forward at what rate adequacy is over time and looking at more traditional mechanisms like rate filings to make sure that rates are in line with loss ratios and loss costs in personal auto. The reforms really were a mechanism to respond to an acute, an acute issue in the early days of the pandemic, sort of the way we're thinking about it. And then, just lastly, you mentioned a majority of the COVID losses were related to workers' comp. You didn't really mention anything about business interruption, and I'm assuming those losses were pretty modest. But is that more because you haven't seen a lot of claim submissions or is it just your view? You have seen submissions, but your view is that those claims are uninsured given the policy language. Yeah, we've certainly seen some submissions, and there's some activity around it, and even some litigation around it. As we've noted, we've got provisions in our policies that that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that we think that A male voice is speaking in a low monotone voice.

You know, I don't think there's a lot of uncertainty around business interruption. I mean, certainly there's some because there's some litigation, and there's always uncertainty when you have litigation. But you know, we've got the requirement for direct physical damage. We've got two courts that have upheld that so far. And we've got a specific virus exclusion in our standard policy form. So we've got a specific virus exclusion in our standard policy form. We don't actually see a lot of uncertainty there and we don't expect that to be a material loss contributor for us. Thank you. Thank you.

PRESENTATION ACCOMPANYING THIS CALL ARE AVAILABLE IN THE INVESTORS SECTION OF OUR WEBSITE WITH ME TODAY ARE VINCE ANGOTTI OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND DR PAM PALMER OUR CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER BEFORE WE BEGIN I'LL REMIND LISTENERS THAT DURING THIS CALL WE WILL MAKE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE OPERATIONS AND FUTURE RESULTS OF ACELRX PLEASE REFER TO OUR PRESS RELEASES IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY'S PERIODIC CURRENT AND ANNUAL REPORTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS I'LL NOW TURN THE CALL OVER TO VINCE THANK YOU RAFFI AND GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I HOPE YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES ARE REMAINING SAFE AND HEALTHY AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOU JOINING OUR CALL TODAY ON TODAY'S CALL WE'LL DESCRIBE THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE TOWARD ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF ONE ADVANCING THE USE OF DSUVIA THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TWO EXPANDING OUR BUSINESS IN LARGE CUSTOMER CHANNELS THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS THREE DEDICATING OUR INTERNAL SALES TEAM TO THE HOSPITAL AND AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER SETTINGS AND FOUR IN-LICENSING OR ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OBJECTIVES ONE AND TWO ALLOW FOR NEAR TERM GROWTH WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT ACELRX COMMERCIAL INVESTMENT WHILE OBJECTIVES THREE AND FOUR WILL TAKE A BIT MORE TIME BUT ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT RETURN WE'VE MADE SOLID PROGRESS BOTH IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND MORE RECENTLY TOWARDS ACHIEVING THESE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND BUILDING OUR FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH DESPITE THE IMPACTS FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC THIS PROGRESS IS HIGHLIGHTED BY OUR SUCCESSFUL MILESTONE C APPROVAL IN APRIL THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR PURCHASES FROM THE US ARMY AS WELL AS OUR RECENT DISTRIBUTION AND PROMOTION AGREEMENT WITH ZIMMER BIOMET FOR DSUVIA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE PAIN IN ADULTS DURING DENTAL AND ORAL SURGERIES NOW AS MENTIONED ON OUR LAST CALL IN 2Q WE RECEIVED MILESTONE C APPROVAL WITH THE US ARMY FOR DSUVIA'S PLACEMENT IN ALL OF THE US ARMY'S SETS KITS AND OUTFITS OR SKO'S ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURE DEPLOYMENTS THIS APPROVAL WAS THE HIGH CASE AND OUR INTERNAL PROJECTIONS WITH PRELIMINARY EXPECTATIONS AND INITIAL STOCKING ORDERS FROM THE US ARMY SKO'S ALONE WILL APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS WE EXPECT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT INITIAL YEAR ORDERS FOR ARMY SKO'S IN THE THIRD QUARTER AS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS GOING THROUGH ITS BUDGETING PROCESS FOR ITS FISCAL YEAR THAT BEGINS ON OCTOBER FIRST IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PUBLICLY COMMUNICATED A NOTICE OF INTENT TO CONTRACT FOR UP TO 12,200 BOXES OR 122,000 DSUVIA SINGLE DOSE APPLICATORS WHICH WE WILL EXPECT TO BE ORDERED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF THIS YEAR AFTER THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL IS ISSUED AND CLOSED NOW THIS IS IN ADDITION TO ANY SKO PURCHASES WHICH WE EXPECT WILL BEGIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WE ALSO ANTICIPATE DSUVIA TO BE APPROVED ON THE JOINT DEPLOYMENT FORMULARY OR JDF IN THE THIRD QUARTER THIS APPROVAL WILL BE ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE AS IT EXPANDS ACCESS TO DSUVIA THROUGHOUT THE OTHER BRANCHES OF THE MILITARY AND WHILE THE US ARMY REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE EXPECTED DEPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY THERE'S STILL A SIZABLE MARKET FROM THE OTHER MILITARY BRANCHES UPON JDF APPROVAL THE JTF APPROVAL ALSO EXPANDS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PURCHASES THROUGHOUT THE NETWORK OF MILITARY TREATMENT FACILITIES SEVERAL OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED DSUVIA ON FORMULARY ARE USING IT IN VARIOUS TREATMENT SETTINGS THE <UNK> OPPORTUNITY IS ONE STRONG PILLAR THAT WILL SUPPORT DSUVIA SALES GROWTH WHICH IS ATTAINED WITH A SMALL INFRASTRUCTURE OF JUST A FEW ACCOUNT MANAGERS AND IS THEREFORE A PROFITABLE AVENUE FOR GROWTH SIMILARLY WE ANNOUNCED OUR EXCLUSIVE PROMOTION AND DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIP WITH ZIMMER BIOMET FOR DSUVIA AND THE DENTAL AND ORAL SURGERY SPACE OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL SETTING THIS PARTNERSHIP ALLOWS US TO ACCESS THE LARGE DENTAL AND ORAL SURGERY MARKET OF AN ESTIMATED SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION ANNUAL PROCEDURES IMPORTANTLY WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMERCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE ZIMMER BIOMET DENTAL DIVISION IS A LEADER IN THE DENTAL IMPLANT SPACE AND HAS OVER 250 SALES REPRESENTATIVES WITH ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WHO REGULARLY VISIT DENTAL AND ORAL SURGERY CUSTOMERS WHICH SHOULD ACCELERATE DSUVIA'S INTRODUCTION SOMETHING WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE OR OBTAINED WITHOUT AN ENTRENCHED PARTNER IMPORTANTLY THE COVID RESTRICTIONS IN ORAL SURGERY OFFICES HAVE LARGELY BEEN LIFTED ALLOWING ACCESS FOR SALES REPRESENTATIVES SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP AS ZIMMER BIOMET WHO BELIEVES DSUVIA WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH A DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING FROM WHICH DENTAL AND ORAL SURGEONS WILL GREATLY BENEFIT THE TRAINING OF THE ZIMMER BIOMET DENTAL SALES REPRESENTATIVES IS CURRENTLY BEING ORGANIZED IT'LL TAKE TIME TO COVER THE ENTIRE SALES FORCE BUT WE EXPECT SOME INITIAL BENEFITS FROM THIS AGREEMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR AND WE ANTICIPATE SALES TO PICK UP PRIMARILY IN Q1 2021 AS THIS IS THE SECOND PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PILLAR THAT SUPPORTS PROFITABLE REVENUE GROWTH FROM A LARGE SPECIALIZED MARKET WITH A MINIMAL ACELRX INVESTMENT LOOKING FORWARD WE SEE SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES WHERE CUSTOMERS AND LARGE SPECIALTY MARKETS OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND ASC'S CAN BE EDUCATED ON THE BENEFITS OF DSUVIA THROUGH COMPANIES THAT ALREADY HAVE A PRESENCE IN THOSE SPACES EXAMPLES OF SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE PLASTIC SURGERY PROCEDURES FERTILITY PROCEDURES AND AMBULANCE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AND UNLIKE MANY HOSPITAL PRODUCTS SUCH AS ANTI INFECTIVE OR CRITICAL CARE PRODUCTS DSUVIA PROVIDES A DIFFERENT VALUE PROPOSITION AND THAT IT CAN BE BROADLY USED ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTINGS SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS IN THESE SPECIALTY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WILL STRENGTHEN THE SECOND PILLAR AND SUPPORT THE DSUVIA SALES GROWTH WITH MINIMAL ACELRX INVESTMENT OUR EXISTING ACCOUNT MANAGERS REMAIN FOCUSED ON DELIVERING LONG TERM VALUE FROM HOSPITAL AND AMBULATORY SURGERY CUSTOMERS THESE CUSTOMER SEGMENTS OFTEN TAKE LONGER TO PENETRATE THROUGH THE LENGTHY REVIEW PERIODS AND COMPLEXITIES IN PMT SCHEDULING WE WERE SLOWED BY COVID IN THE SECOND QUARTER AS ACCESS TO HOSPITALS AND ASC'S WAS RESTRICTED BY STATES AND INSTITUTIONS EACH OF WHICH MANAGED ACCESS DIFFERENTLY BUT RECENTLY ACCESS HAS IMPROVED VERSUS THE MARCH TO JUNE TIMEFRAME AND WHILE RESTRICTIONS STILL EXIST WE'RE SEEING SOME RECOVERY HIGHLIGHTED BY JULY BEING OUR LARGEST MONTH OF DEMAND BY END USERS TO DATE DURING THIS TIME WE'VE ALSO HAD SOME EXCITING HOSPITAL SYSTEM WINS WHICH WE EXPECT WILL PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AS THEY BEGIN TO PLACE ORDERS AFTER THEY INCORPORATE DSUVIA INTO THEIR PROTOCOLS AND MEDICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS ONE OF THESE WINS WAS A RECENT EXPANSION TO ALL HOSPITALS WITHIN A SYSTEM AFTER INITIALLY BEING APPROVED AT JUST ONE LOCATION AND WITH USE LIMITED TO GENERAL SURGERY AFTER REVIEWING DATA FROM THE INITIAL TRIAL USE OF DSUVIA WHICH ILLUSTRATED BOTH PATIENT AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS THE PMT COMMITTEE RECONVENED AND APPROVED DSUVIA FOR FORMULA SYSTEM WIDE INCLUDING ITS ASSOCIATED ASC'S WITH EXPANDED USE TO ALL SETTINGS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL INCLUDING THE TRAUMA SERVICE THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW WE SEE DSUVIA BEING ADOPTED WE CONTINUALLY HEAR FROM OUR PHYSICIAN CUSTOMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS THEY OBSERVE IN THEIR PATIENTS WITH DSUVIA AND IMPORTANTLY GATHERING THE REAL WORLD DATA IS KEY TO DEMONSTRATING THESE ADVANTAGES TO OTHER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN FACT WE'RE EXCITED THAT DATA PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF THESE BENEFITS WILL BE PUBLISHED SOON INCLUDING ONE MANUSCRIPT THAT WAS RECENTLY ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION IN A PEER REVIEWED ANESTHESIA JOURNAL THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF DISTRIBUTED TO THE HOSPITAL AND THE REDUCTION IN USE OF INTRAVENOUS OPIOIDS AND OTHER MEDICATIONS WILL BE EVIDENT FROM THESE UPCOMING PUBLICATIONS WE EXPECT THIS DATA TO HAVE A FAVORABLE IMPACT COMMERCIALLY AS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WILL FINALLY HAVE RELEVANT REAL WORLD DATA TO ILLUSTRATE WHY DSUVIA SHOULD BE USED OVER SOME CURRENT STANDARDS OF CARE AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE THE ACCEPTANCE OF DSUVIA ON THE FORMULA IS AN EVENTUAL ADOPTION INTO PROTOCOLS IS A PROCESS BUT BASED ON THE REAL WORLD RESULTS FROM HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS USING DSUVIA WHO REMAIN CONFIDENT DSUVIA WILL BECOME A KEY TREATMENT FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE PAIN IN MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTINGS AGAIN CHANGING A STANDARD OF CARE TAKES TIME BUT WE BELIEVE HEALTH CARE PROFE- PROFESSIONALS ARE JUST NOW BEGINNING TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS I'LL NOW HAND OVER THE CALL TO RAFFI TO TAKE YOU THROUGH THE FINANCIALS THANK YOU VINCE WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN PRUDENT WITH OUR CASH AS WE LAUNCH DSUVIA WE ENDED THE SECOND QUARTER WITH $43.7 MILLION IN CASH AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS WHICH REPRESENTS A CHANGE OF $9 MILLION FROM THE LAS- FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 OUR NET CASH OUTFLOW FOR THE QUARTER WAS DRIVEN MAINLY BY OUR $7.3 MILLION OF CASH OPERATING EXPENSES FOR COMBINED R&D AND SG&A EXPENSES EXCLUDING STOCK BASED COMPENSATION OR $8.4 MILLION INCLUDING STOCK COMP THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE QUARTER INCLUDED A NET BENEFIT OF $0.5 MILLION FOR THE FROM THE RECEIPT OF A BREAKUP FEE FROM THE TOUCH OF PHASE ACQUISITION NET OF EXPENSES INCURRED RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION IN THE QUARTER THIS COMPARED TO $11.2 MILLION OF CASH OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 OR $12.5 MILLION INCLUDING STOCK BASED COMPENSATION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION OF $1.9 MILLION IN DSUVIA RELATED COMMERCIALIZATION EXPENSES AND A $1.7 MILLION REDUCTION IN PERSONNEL COSTS WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON INVESTING IN THE AREAS THAT WILL HAVE THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE LAUNCH AND REMAIN PRUDENT IN OUR OVERALL CASH SPENDING REVENUES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 WERE $2.9 MILLION COMPARED TO $0.9 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 APPROXIMATELY $2.6 MILLION OF THE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RECOGNITION OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED REVENUES RELATED TO OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH <UNK> OUR HIGH VOLUME PACKAGING LINE THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE INSTALLED AND OPERATIONAL AT OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURER EARLY NEXT YEAR HAS BEEN DELAYED DUE TO TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS FROM COVID WE HOPE THESE RESTRICTIONS WILL BE EASED LATER THIS YEAR PAVING THE WAY FOR FINAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE EQUIPMENT WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR COST OF PRODUCTION ONCE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IS RUNNING ON THIS LINE TO MEET THE TIMING OF VOLUME DEMANDS FROM THE DOD AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS WE'RE EVALUATING ALTERNATIVES TO ACCELERATE FINAL ACCEPTANCE TESTS FROM THE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REST OF THE YEAR WE ARE EXPECTING AN INITIAL ORDER FROM THE DOD AS INDICATED IN THEIR NOTICE OF INTENT TO CONTRACTS WHICH WILL BE CONVERTED TO AN RFP FOR DSUVIA IN ADDITION AN INITIAL STOCKING ORDER FOR ARMY SETS KITS AND OUTFITS IS EXPECTED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WE HAVE REDUCED OUR 2020 QUARTERLY CASH OPERATING EXPENSES WHICH ARE NOW EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM EIGHT TO $9 MILLION EXCLUDING STOCK BASED COMPENSATION OR NINE TO $10 MILLION INCLUDING STOCK BASED COMPENSATION FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR FINALLY WE REMAIN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR POTENTIAL OUT-LICENSING PARTNER FOR DZUVEO IN EUROPE AND HOPE TO HAVE MORE TO REPORT HERE IN THE COMING MONTHS WE ARE ALSO IN DISCUSSIONS WITH POTENTIAL US COLLABORATION PARTNERS AROUND MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING DSUVIA TO OTHER SPECIALTY MARKETS SUCH AS PLASTIC SURGERY OR FERTILITY SERVICES IN THE US IN ADDITION WE REMAIN IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS ON IN-LICENSING AND ACQUIRING ASSETS THAT ARE COMPLIMENTARY TO OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO THE BUSINESS FINALLY WE ARE STILL EVALUATING THE TIMING OF OUR ZALVISO NDA RESUBMISSION WHICH WE DELAYED PENDING FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM THE FDA REGARDING A POTENTIAL NEW OPIOID PRODUCT APPROVAL FRAMEWORK WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE DETAILS ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THAT LET ME TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO VINCE THANKS RAFFI SO TO SUMMARIZE WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BUILT TWO FOUNDATIONAL PILLARS FOR FURTHER PROFITABLE GROWTH WITH THE DOD AND WITH THE ZIMMER BIOMET DENTAL PARTNERSHIP LEVERAGING THIS SUCCESS WHILE CONTINUING OUR PUSH INTO THE HOSTILE AND ASC MARKETS AS WE'RE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE ECONOMIC AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS OF DSUVIA WITH REAL WORLD DATA THAT WILL GENERATE LONG TERM VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS AS YOU PREVIOUSLY HEARD THE EARLY FEEDBACK FROM THE HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS DOSING DSUVIA IS POSITIVE WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE PUBLICATIONS ABOUT THE DATA SHOWCASING DSUVIA AND THE PERIOPERATIVE SETTING I'D NOW LIKE TO OPEN THE LINE UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE OPERATOR THANK YOU AND WE WILL NOW BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION TO ASK A QUESTION YOU MAY PRESS STAR AND THEN ONE ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE IF YOU'RE USING A SPEAKERPHONE PLEASE PICK UP YOUR HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE KEYS TO WITHDRAW YOUR QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR AND THEN TWO AT THIS TIME WE WILL PAUSE FOR A MOMENT TO ASSEMBLE OUR ROSTER OUR FIRST QUESTION TODAY WILL COME FROM BRANDON FOLKS OF CANTOR FITZGERALD PLEASE GO AHEAD HI THANKS FOR SEEING MY QUESTIONS AND CONGRATULATIONS ON ALL PROGRESS IN THE QUARTER UM JUST THREE FROM ME TODAY UM FIRSTLY COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE ON THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ZIMMER'S DEAL UM I THINK IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN BILLION PROCEDURES HOW MANY OF THOSE PROCEDURE PROCEDURES DO YOU THINK ARE SUITABLE FOR DSUVIA AND THEN CURRENTLY WHERE ARE YOU SEEING USE IN DSUVIA AND ANY NEW AREAS DURING THE QUARTER PLACING ORDERS OR SEEING USE OF THE PRODUCT AND THEN LASTLY UM SORRY I'M I'M GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION UH EVEN I KNOW YOU SORT OF INSINUATED THAT YOU WILL UPDATE US DOWN THE LINE BUT WITH THE RECENT OPIOID APPROVAL UM DOES THIS CHANGE YOUR THINKING ON ZALVISO OR WHAT CAN YOU SAY AT THIS STAGE THANK YOU SO I'M GOING TO HAVE PAM ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE IS THE ZIMMER BIOMET OPPORTUNITY UM JUST IN GENERAL WE SAID ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION PROCEDURES ELIGIBLE FOR DSUVIA BUT PAM CAN MAYBE GIVE EXAMPLES OF WHAT THOSE PROCEDURES ARE SURE YEAH SO THIRD MOLAR EXTRACTIONS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTIONS UH DENTAL IMPLANTS UM YOU KNOW BONE GRAFTING THERE THERE'S A NUMBER OF DENTAL AND ORAL SURGERY PROCEDURES THAT ARE COMMONLY PERFORMED BY UH ORAL SURGEONS AND DENTISTS THAT US- USE IV OPIOIDS AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING TO REPLACE UM IV OPIOIDS IN THAT MARKET BR- BRANDON SO SO ANSWERING DIRECTLY YOUR QUESTION IS ALL OF THOSE SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION PROCEDURES ARE ADDRESSABLE DSUVIA PROCEDURES IT'S NOT ALL DENTAL AND ORAL PROCEDURES THAT'S THE ESTIMATE OF WHAT DSUVIA CAN BE ADDRESSING IN THE SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION BRANDON IF IF I RECALL WAS WHERE IS DSUVIA CURRENTLY DSUVIA CURRENTLY BEING USED AGAIN I'LL DEFER TO PAM AS SHE'S BEEN WORKING WITH VARIOUS SPECIALISTS AROUND THE COUNTRY SU- SURE UH DSUVIA IS BEING USED UH IN UM AMBULATORY SURGERY SETTINGS IT'S BEING USED IN PROCEDURAL SUITES UM ADJACENT TO PER- PHYSICIANS OFFICES IT'S BEING USED IN EMERGENCY ROOMS SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF DSUVIA USE UM IN SHORT TERM SETTINGS ALSO IN UH SOME INTERESTING MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTINGS SUCH AS FERTILITY CLINICS WHICH OFTEN HAVE TO DO UH PAINFUL PROCEDURES AND CURRENTLY USE IV OPIOIDS IN THAT SETTING THEY'RE FINDING DSUVIA TO BE VERY NICE NON-INVASIVE ALTERNATIVE WE ALSO ARE SEEING ORAL SURGERY TYPICALLY AS WELL AS IN ENT PROCEDURES UM SO AGAIN MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTINGS COVERS A WIDE SWATH OF MEDICAL SPECIALTIES AND AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT THEY'VE SEEN THE BENEFITS OF DSUVIA IN EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT AREAS PAM CAN YOU ALSO COMMENT UH BRIEFLY ON HOW YOU'RE SEEING DSUVIA USED IN THE SHORT TERM SETTINGS IN PARTICULAR FOR THE SAME DAY SURGERIES AND THE TIMING OF THE DOSE AND WHY YEAH THE MAJORITY OF UH FOLKS USING DSUVIA NOW ARE GIVING IT A PREOPERATIVE OF ABOUT 15 TO 20 MINUTES PRIOR TO UH INCISION AS THEY KNOW IT TAKES UH 15 MINUTES TO REACH THAT SORT OF THERAPEUTIC CONCENTRATION AND UH 90 TO 95% OF THE TIME THEY'RE USING JUST A SINGLE DOSE UH WE KNOW FROM OUR PK AS WELL AS OUR CLINICAL TRIALS THAT WE GET ABOUT THREE TO FOUR HOURS OF ANALGESIA WITH A SINGLE DOSE AND IN THOSE SETTINGS THAT'S REALLY ALL THEY NEED SO IT'S IT'S LOOKING LIKE A A A VERY NICE REPLACEMENT FOR THE IV INJECTABLE CLEAR OF LIQUID OPIOIDS WITH JUST A SINGLE DOSE AND I REITERATE BEYOND WHAT PAM SAID WE'RE SPENDING OUR TIME AS A COMPANY WITH OUR RESOURCES IN THE SHORT TERM OR THE SAME DAY SURGERY SETTINGS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL ASC'S WHAT PAM MENTIONED BEFORE REGARDING ORAL SURGERY DENTAL SURGERY USE THERE'S PLASTIC SURGERY USE THERE'S FERTILITY CLINIC USE THOSE OTHER USES REALLY HELP REINFORCE OUR STRATEGY BECAUSE THEY'RE LARGE ON THE DIFFUSED AND NOT CENTRALIZED OUR STRATEGY TO PARTNER WITH OTHERS TO PENETRATE THOSE MARKETS EXACTLY AS WE DID WITH ZIMMER BIOMET THAT WAS COMPONENT TWO OF YOUR QUESTION BRANDON I THINK COMPONENT THREE WAS ZALVISO AND PAM YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT ONE AS WELL AS WE'RE CONTINUING TO STUDY THE REGULATORY PARAMETERS YEAH I THINK IT'S STILL EARLY WE'VE NOT REALLY HAD A DEFINITIVE FRAMEWORK FROM UH THE FDA YET ON THEIR EVALUATION OF UH NEW OPIOID PRODUCTS UH IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER UH YOU KNOW ALL THE <UNK> WAS APPROVED UNDER AN OLD FRAMEWORK AND SORT OF GRANDFATHERED IN AND SO WE'RE REALLY WAITING FOR MORE CLARITY FROM THE FDA AND SPECIFICALLY THE DAP DIVISION ON UH ON A SPECIFIED FRAMEWORK TO UH YOU KNOW SORT OF EVALUATE NEW OPIOID SUBMISSIONS THINK THE GOOD NEWS IN THAT APPROVAL IS THAT THEY'RE CLEARLY SEEING AND RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF OPIOIDS IN THESE MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTINGS AND THAT CONTINUES TO GIVE US COMFORT MOVING FORWARD BRANDON I HOPE THAT ANSWERED THE THREE COMPONENTS OF YOUR QUESTION IT DOES DO YOU MIND IF I SNEAK ONE MORE AND I APOLOGIZE YOU JUST UM TRIGGERED SOMETHING ELSE UM JUST IN TERMS OF THE FEEDBACK YOU'VE RECEIVED FROM UH PHYSICIANS USING THE PRODUCT UM IS THE ONSET OF ACTION AND DURATION OF EFFECTS BEING REPORTED IN PRACTICE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEN THAT'S IT FROM ME HOW PROMISE THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY UM THE THE ONSET OF ACTION IS VERY CONSISTENT UM AGAIN THE SUBLINGUAL ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AVOIDS THE FIRST PASS EFFECT THAT YOU MEANING IT DOESN'T GO TO THE STOMACH AND THEN HAVE TO BE ABSORBED AND AND METABOLIZED BY THE LIVER WHICH MAKES IT VERY ERRATIC ONSET ASIDE ORAL OPIOID MEDICATIONS DON'T REALLY WORK QUICKLY OR THAT CONSISTENTLY UM SO FROM A SUBLINGUAL ONSET STANDPOINT IT IS VERY CONSISTENT AND THE DURATION OF ACTION IS INTERESTING IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE-BIT LONGER UM THAN UH YOU KNOW OUR CLINICAL TRIAL WE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF MULTIMODAL ANALGESIA UM WE ARE GOING UP AGAINST PLACEBO YOU TRY TO KEEP THOSE STUDIES QUITE CLEAN SO IN THE REAL WORLD SETTING YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD REPORTS THAT THE DURATION OF ANALGESIA IT CAN EVEN LAST BEYOND UH THE THREE TO FOUR HOURS AND HAS A VERY NICE OFFSET TAIL MEANING THAT IT PROVIDES A VERY COMFORTABLE LEVEL OF ANALGESIA THROUGH EACH DISCHARGE WITH JUST THAT SINGLE DOSE YEAH I THINK THE GENERAL FEEDBACK BEYOND WHAT PAM SAID UM IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY DELIVERING ON THE MESSAGES WE'VE COMMUNICATED THAT ONSET THE DURATION AND AS DOCTORS HAVE MASTERED THEIR ART WITH IT BRINGING IT FORWARD IN THE SHORT TERM SURGERIES AND PROCEDURES HAS BEEN THE ABSOLUTE KEY BRINGING YOUR FORWARD MEANING WHEN THEY DOSE IT AND THEIR TIME TO PK TO THE ACUTE PAIN TO REALLY MAXIMIZE THE PRODUCT AND IT'S REALLY ALIGNED TO USE ONE DOSE WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN THE LARGEST SURPRISE TO ALL OF THEM AND AND AND IF I COULD ADD I THINK ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS WE HEAR ABOUT IS A LACK OF SIDE EFFECTS YOU YOU KNOW I MEAN THE IN THE PACK USING IMPORTANCE UM TIME TO DISCHARGE IS SORT OF A COMPOSITE MEASURE UH YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR ADVERSE EVENTS UNDER CONTROL AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE YOUR PAIN UNDER CONTROL TO BE DISCHARGED SO THE THING THAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU KNOW SORT OF TIME TO PACK YOUR DISCHARGE IS IT REALLY IS A WAY TO LOOK AT BOTH <INAUDIBLE> AND SAFETY AT THE SAME TIME AS WELL AS YOU KNOW MAKING SURE <INAUDIBLE> SAFETY UM YOU'RE PATIENTS INCLUDING YOUR ELDERLY PATIENTS DON'T HAVE ANY COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND THAT'S A HUGE PART SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE HEARING BACK IN SPADES FROM THE CUSTOMERS IS THAT THAT PREOPERATIVE DOSE IS CARRYING THEM THROUGH THE OPERATION THROUGH THE PACU MANY TIMES ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED AT ALL AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DISCHARGE THEM MORE QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE TYPICAL IV INJECTABLE OPIOIDS THAT THEY'RE OFTEN UH SEEING BRANDON VERY HELPFUL HOPE THAT HELPS <CROSSTALK> THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION TODAY WILL COME FROM MICHAEL HIGGINS OF LADENBURG THALMANN PLEASE GO AHEAD UH MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED THANKS THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION TODAY WILL COME FROM EVAN <UNK> OF CREDIT SUISSE PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY GUYS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS UM A FOLLOW UP ON THE ZIMMER BIOMET DEAL WHAT FEEDBACK HAVE YOU GOTTEN FROM DENTISTS REGARDING USING THE PRODUCT IN OFFICE UM ARE THEY COMFORTABLE STORING IT IN KIND OF ALL THE UM NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BY HAVING THE OPIOIDS IN STOCK YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THEY DO USE VARIOUS DRUGS IN THE OFFICE BUT JUST ADDING ANOTHER ONE UM AND THEN KIND OF YOU HAD MENTIONED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ANY THOUGHTS AS TO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR UM IN TERMS OF A TARGET PRODUCT PROFILE OR EVEN MORE BROADLY SPEAKING YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF PATIENT POPULATION HOW SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH SURE WELL <INAUDIBLE> ORAL SURGEONS SO WE'VE NEVER MARKETED TO THEM WE SORT OF RECEIVED A NUMBER OF INBOUND QUERIES WHEN IT FIRST WAS APPROVED BECAUSE THEY SAW THE OBVIOUS BENEFITS UM THEY WE ARE ONLY UH BRAND CERTIFYING AND SUPPLYING IT TO ORAL SURGEONS AND IV SEDATION DENTISTS SO THAT MEANS THEY ALREADY HAVE APPROVAL AND ALREADY HAVE THE LOCKED SEE TO STORAGE AND ALL THE NECESSARY OXYGEN AND MEDICATION TO TREAT RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION DUE TO OPIOIDS SO THESE ARE VERY SAVVY SURGEONS UH WHO ALREADY KNOW HOW TO USE IV OPIOIDS AND THEY CERTAINLY SEE THE ADVANTAGE OF A RAPID ONSET AND EXTENDED DURATION SUBLINGUAL TABLET THAT AVOIDS THEM HAVING TO STOP THEIR PROCEDURE AND REDOSE THEIR IV UM OPIOIDS WHICH THEY TYPICALLY HAVE TO DO MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT A PROCEDURE SO THEY CLEARLY SEE THE BENEFIT AND THAT'S AGAIN WHY UH YOU KNOW ZIMMER SAW THE BENEFIT AS WELL UM THEY KNOW THESE SURGERIES VERY WELL AND THEY KNOW THE BENEFITS THAT DSUVIA CAN USE YEAH EVAN JUST TO JUST TO REITERATE WHY WHY UH GO WITH UH ZIMMER AND AND WE MENTIONED THAT THESE OTHER SPECIALTY MARKETS UM THEY'RE LARGE MARKETS BUT WE DON'T HAVE A LARGE ENOUGH SALESFORCE TO PENETRATE LIKE THESE PARTNERS HAVE UM AA- AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIPS UM THAT THAT THEY'VE BUILT UP UM COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE SO WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE HOSPITAL AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER MARKETS UM WITH THE PARTNERS UH THAT ARE ALREADY IN THESE WE'RE CALLING THEM SPECIALTY MARKETS OR THEIR SPECIALTY FOR US BUT NOT FOR OTHERS BUT WITH PARTNERS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THAT SPACE WITH ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH LARGE SALES FORCES AND THAT LEADS INTO I THINK THE SECOND COMPONENT OF YOUR QUESTION EVAN WHICH WAS TARGET PRODUCT PROFILE AS WE LOOK AT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES MOVING FORWARD SO FOR US THE BIGGEST KEY IS EFFICIENCY UM MEANING OR THE CALL PATTERNS WITHIN THESE MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTINGS WHERE WE CURRENTLY DEPLOY YOUR RESOURCES WE WANT TO KEEP THEM FOCUSED WHERE THEY CURRENTLY ARE SO WHETHER IT'S THE HOSPITAL OR THE ASC OR THE ANESTHESIOLOGISTS UH IN THE OFFICE SUITES ETC WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO TARGET THOSE THE ACTUAL UH THERAPEUTIC AREA IS LESS RELEVANT FOR US UM IT'S MORE OF WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED FOR USE OF THESE PRODUCTS UM ACCOUNT OVERLAP IS CRITICAL AND WILL BE OPPORTUNISTIC ON A MOVING FORWARD UH ONE OF THE COMMON THEMES THROUGH ALL THAT OTHER THAN THE EFFICIENCY IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY LATE TERM OR ALREADY ON THE MARKET UH WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR UH LONG TERM R&D PROJECTS OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS I APPRECIATE THE CALL THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS WILL CONCLUDE OUR QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO TURN THE CONFERENCE BACK OVER VINCE ANGOTTI FOR ANY CLOSING REMARKS THANK YOU OPERATOR AND THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY AND FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF ACELRX WE FEEL WE'RE VERY WELL POSITIONED FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND WE LOOK VERY MUCH FORWARD TO SHARING MORE DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY OCCUR SO PLEASE BE SAFE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO GIVING YOU UPDATES AS THEY HAPPEN THANKS THE CONFERENCE HAS NOW CONCLUDED AND WE THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING TODAY'S PRESENTATION YOU

This approval will be another significant milestone as it expands access to Dusivia throughout the other branches of the military. And while the U S Army represents approximately sixty percent of the expected purchases, the other branches of the military represent approximately forty percent of the expected purchases. DEPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY THERE IS STILL A SIZABLE MARKET FROM THE OTHER MILITARY BRANCHES UPON J D F APPROVAL THE J D F APPROVAL ALSO EXPANDS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PURCHASES THROUGHOUT THE NETWORK OF MILITARY TREATMENT FACILITIES SEVERAL OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED J D F ON FORMULARY AND ARE USING IT IN VARIOUS TREATMENT SETTINGS THE DOD OPPORTUNITY IS ONE STRONG PILLAR THAT WILL SUPPORT J D F SALES GROWTH WHICH IS ACHIEVED WITH A SMALL INFRASTRUCTURE The structure of just a few account managers and is therefore a profitable avenue for growth. Similarly, we announced our exclusive promotion and distribution partnership with Zimmer Biomet for Juvia in the dental and oral surgery space outside the hospital setting. This partnership allows us to access the large dental and oral surgery market of an estimated seven and a half million annual procedures, importantly without additional investments. Our commercial infrastructure Zimmer Biomet Dental Division is a leader in the dental implant space and has over two hundred fifty sales representatives with established relationships who regularly visit dental and oral surgery customers, which should accelerate the introduction of something we could not have done or attained without an entrenched partner. Importantly, the COVID restrictions in oral surgery offices have largely been lifted, allowing access. FOR SALES REPRESENTATIVES: SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF THIS STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP AS IT IS ZYMER BIOMET WHO BELIEVES THAT ZYVIA WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH A DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING FROM WHICH DENTAL AND ORAL SURGEONS WILL GREATLY BENEFIT: THE TRAINING OF THE ZYMER BIOMET DENTAL SALES REPRESENTATIVES IS CURRENTLY BEING ORGANIZED IT WILL TAKE TIME TO COVER THE ENTIRE SALES FORCE BUT WE EXPECT SOME INITIAL BENEFITS FROM ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS THIS IS THE SECOND PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PILLAR THAT SUPPORTS PROFITABLE REVENUE GROWTH FROM A LARGE SPECIALIZED MARKET WITH MINIMAL EXCELER X INVESTMENT LOOKING FORWARD WE SEE SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES WHERE CUSTOMERS IN LARGE SPECIALIZED MARKETS OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND AE SEES CAN BE EDUCATED ON THE BENEFITS OF DUSUVIA THROUGH COMPANIES THAT ALREADY HAVE A PRESENCE IN THOSE SPACES EXAMPLS OF SUCH OPPORTUN Procedures, fertility procedures, and ambulance and other emergency medical services. And unlike many hospital products, such as anti-infectives or critical care products, desferrioxamine provides a different value proposition and that it can be broadly used across many different medically supervised settings. Successful partnerships in these specialty market opportunities will strengthen the second pillar and support desferrioxamine's sales growth with minimal excelerant investment. Our existing account managers remain focused on delivering long-term value from hospital and ambulatory surgery customers. These customer segments often take longer to penetrate due to the lengthy review periods and complexities in p&t scheduling. We were slowed by covid in the second quarter as access to hospitals and aes was restricted by states and institutions each of which managed access differently. But recently access has improved. VERSUS THE MARCH TO JUNE TIME FRAME AND WHILE RESTRICTIONS STILL EXIST WE'RE SEEING SOME RECOVERY HIGHLIGHTED BY JULY BEING OUR LARGEST MONTH OF DEMAND BY END USERS TO DATE DURING THIS TIME WE'VE ALSO HAD SOME EXCITING HOSPITAL SYSTEM WINDS WHICH WE EXPECT WILL PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AS THEY BEGIN TO PLACE ORDERS AFTER THEY INCORPORATE THE SUBVIAN INTO THEIR PROTOCOLS AND MEDICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS ONE OF THESE WINDS WAS A RE AFTER FIRST BEING APPROVED AT JUST ONE LOCATION AND WITH USE LIMITED TO GENERAL SURGERY AFTER REVIEWING DATA FROM THE INITIAL TRIAL USE OF DESVYOVA WHICH ILLUSTRATED BOTH PATIENT AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS THE P N T COMMITTEE RECONVENED AND IMPROVED DESVYOVA FOR FORMULARY SYSTEM WIDE INCLUDING ITS ASSOCIATED A S E S WITH EXPANDED USE TO ALL SETTINGS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL INCLUDING THE TRAUMA SERVICE THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW WE SE WE WILL CONTINUALLY HEAR FROM OUR PHYSICIAN CUSTOMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS THEY OBSERVE IN THEIR PATIENTS WITH DIVYA AND IMPORTANTLY GATHERING THE REAL WORLD DATA IS KEY TO DEMONSTRATING THESE ADVANTAGES TO OTHER HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. IN FACT WE ARE EXCITED THAT DATA PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF THESE BENEFITS WILL BE PUBLISHED SOON INCLUDING ONE MANUSCRIPT THAT WAS RECENTLY ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION IN A PEER REVIEWED ANESTHESIA EVIDENT FROM THESE UPCOMING PUBLICATIONS WE EXPECT THIS DATA TO HAVE A FAVOURABLE IMPACT COMMERCIALLY AS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WILL FINALLY HAVE RELEVANT REAL WORLD DATA TO ILLUSTRATE WHY DUSOVIA SHOULD BE USED OVER SOME CURRENT STANDARDS OF CARE AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE THE ACCEPTANCE OF DUSOVIA ONTO FORMULARIES IS AN EVENTUAL ADOPTION INTO PROTOCOLS AS A PROCESS BUT BASED ON THE REAL WORLD RESULTS FROM SOME HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS USING DUS ACCUTE PAIN AND MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTINGS AGAIN CHANGING A STANDARD OF CARE TAKES TIME BUT WE BELIEVE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ARE JUST NOW BEGINNING TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS I'LL NOW HANDLE THE CALL OVER TO RAFFI TO TAKE YOU THROUGH THE FINANCIALS THANK YOU VINCE WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN P R U D A N T WITH OUR CASH AS WE LAUNCH S U V I A W E EN D E D D THE SECOND QUARTER WITH FORTY THREE POINT SEVEN M I L L I O N D QUARTER OF TWENTY TWO OUR NET CASH OUTFLOW FOR THE QUARTER WAS DRIVEN MAINLY BY OUR SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF CASH OPERATING EXPENSES OR COMBINED R N D AND S G N A EXPENSES EXCLUDING STOCK BASED COMPENSATION OR EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING STOCK COMP. THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE QUARTER INCLUDED A NET BENEFIT OF ZERO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE QUARTER FROM THE RECEIPT OF A BREAKUP Expenses incurred related to the transaction in the quarter this compared to eleven point two million dollars of cash operating expenses in the second quarter of two thousand and nineteen or twelve point five million dollars including stock based compensation the decrease in operating expenses in the second quarter of twenty twenty was primarily due to a reduction of one point nine million dollars in devise related commercialization expenses and a one point seven expense MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN PERSONNEL COSTS WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON INVESTING IN THE AREAS THAT WILL HAVE THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE LAUNCH AND REMAIN PROUD IN OUR OVERALL CASH BUDGET REVENUES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWO WERE TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO ZERO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN APROXIMATELY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF THE REVENUE RECOGNIZ Twenty was attributable to the recognition of previously deferred revenues related to our collaboration agreement with grunenthal our high volume packaging line that is expected to be installed and operational at our contract manufacturer early next year has been delayed due to travel restrictions from covid we hope these restrictions will be eased later this year paving the way for final acceptance of the equipment which will We significantly reduce our cost of production once commercial production is running on this line to meet the timing of volume demands from the D O D as well as commercial customers. We are evaluating alternatives to accelerate final acceptance tests from the equipment manufacturer. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we are expecting an initial order from the D O D as indicated in their notice of intent to contracts which will be. Converted to an rpf for dzusvia in addition an initial stocking order for army sets kits and outfits is expected in the fourth quarter we have reduced our twenty twenty quarterly cash operating expenses which are now expected to range from eight to nine million dollars excluding stock based compensation or nine to ten million dollars including stock based compensation for the rest of the year finally WE REMAIN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR POTENTIAL OUT LICENSING PARTNER FOR DIVUSIO IN EUROPE AND HOPE TO HAVE MORE TO REPORT HERE IN THE COMING MONTHS WE ARE ALSO IN DISCUSSIONS WITH POTENTIAL US COLLABORATION PARTNERS AROUND MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING DIVUSIO TO OTHER SPECIALTY MARKETS SUCH AS PLASTIC SURGERY OR FERTILITY SERVICES IN THE US IN ADDITION WE REMAIN IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS ON IN LICENSING AND ACQUIRING ASSETS THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO BUT WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO THE BUSINESS FINALLY WE ARE STILL EVALUATING THE TIMING OF OUR ZALVINO N D A R E SUBMISSION WHICH WE DELAYED PENDING FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM THE FDA REGARDING A POTENTIAL NEW OPIOID PRODUCT APPROVAL FRAMEWORK WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE DETAILS ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THAT LET ME TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO VINCE Raffy, so to summarize, we have successfully built two foundational pillars for further profitable growth with the D.O.D. and the Zimmer Biomet Dental partnership, leveraging this success while continuing our push into the hospital and A.S.C. markets as we're able to demonstrate the economic and healthcare benefits of Zimmer Biomet with real-world data that will generate long-term value for our shareholders. As you've previously heard, the early feedback from the healthcare practitioners dosing Zimmer Biomet is positive and we look forward to the future. Publications About the Data Showcasing Dissuva in the Perioperative Setting I now like to open the lineup for any questions you might have Operator Thank you and we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star and then one on your touch tone phone if you are using a speaker phone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star and then two at this time we will now FOR A MOMENT TO ASSEMBLE OUR ROSTER OUR FIRST QUESTION TODAY WILL COME FROM BRANDON FOLKS OF CANTER FITZGERALD PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS STEPHEN FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND CONGRATULATIONS ON ALL THE PROGRESS IN THE QUARTER ILL JUST DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ZIMBABWE DEAL I THINK WE COULD JUST ILLABORATE ON THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ZIMBABWE DEAL I THINK WE COULD JUST ILLABORATE ON THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ZIMBABWE DEAL I TH Those procedures do you think are suitable for desvenlafaxine and then currently where are you seeing use in desvenlafaxine and any new areas during the quarter, placing orders or seen use of the product and then lastly, sorry, I'm going to ask a question even and a sort of insinuate that you will appear down the line but with the recent opioid approval does this change your thinking on zolvita or what? CAN YOU SAY AT THIS STAGE. THANK YOU. SO I'M GOING TO HAVE PAM ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. THE FIRST ONE IS THE ZIMMERMAN BIOMED OPPORTUNITY. JUST IN GENERAL WE SAID ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION PROCEDURES ELIGIBLE FOR DISABILITY. BUT PAM, MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE EXAMPLES OF WHAT THOSE PROCEDURES ARE. SURE. YES. SO THIRD MOLAR EXTRACTIONS, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS WISDOM TEETH EXTRACTIONS, DENTAL IMPLANTS YOU THE NUMBER OF DENTAL AND ORAL SURGERY PROCEDURES THAT ARE COMMONLY PERFORMED BY ORAL SURGEONS AND DENTISTS THAT YOU USE IV OPIOIDS AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING TO REPLACE IV OPIOIDS IN THAT MARKET AND BRIAN, SO ANSWERING DIRECTLY YOUR QUESTION IS ALL OF THOSE SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION PROCEDURES ARE ADDRESSABLE DESVYO PROCEDURES. IT'S NOT ALL DENTAL AND ORAL PROCEDURES THAT'S THE ESTIMATE OF WHAT DESVYO CAN BE ADDRESSING THE SECOND COMPONENT The goal was where is Dezuyva currently, Dezuyva currently being used? Again, I'll defer to Pam as she's been working with various specialists around the country. Sure, Dezuyva's being used in ambulatory surgery settings, it's being used in procedural suites, adjacent physician's offices, it's being used in emergency rooms. So we're seeing a lot of Dezuyva use in short-term settings, also some interesting medical-supervised settings. SUCH AS FERTILITY CLINICS WHICH OFTEN HAVE TO DO PAINFUL PROCEDURES AND CURRENTLY USE IVF IN THAT SETTING THEY'RE FINDING DESOVIOUS TO BE A VERY NICE NONINVASIVE ALTERNATIVE WE ALSO SEE ORAL SURGERY TYPICALLY AS WELL AS SOME E N T PROCEDURES SO AGAIN MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTINGS COVERS A WIDE SWAATH OF MEDICAL SPECIALTIES AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT THEY'VE SEEN THE BENEFITS OF DESOVIOUS IN EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT I WOULD ALSO COMMENT BRIEFLY ON HOW YOU'RE SEEING DEXAMETHAZONE USED IN THE SHORT TERM SETTINGS, IN PARTICULAR FOR THE SAME DAY SURGERIES AND THE TIMING OF THE DOSE AND WHY YEAH, THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS USING DEXAMETHAZONE NOW ARE GIVING IT PREOPERATIVELY ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES PRIOR TO INCISION AS THEY KNOW IT TAKES FIFTEEN MINUTES TO REACH THAT SORT OF THERAPEUTIC CONCENTRATION AND NINETY TO NINETY F AY, AS WELL AS OUR CLINICAL TRIALS THAT WE GET ABOUT THREE TO FOUR HOURS OF ANALGESIA WITH A SINGLE DOSE, AND IN THOSE SETTINGS THAT'S REALLY ALL THEY NEED. SO IT'S IT'S LOOKING LIKE A VERY NICE REPLACEMENT FOR THE IV OXYCODONE OF CLEAR LIQUID OPIOIDS WITH JUST A SINGLE DOSE. YEAH, I RADIATE BEYOND WHAT PAM SAID, WE'RE SPENDING OUR TIME AS A COMPANY WITH OUR RESOURCES IN THOSE SHORT TERM OR SAME DAY SURGERY SETTING SURGERY USE, THERE'S PLASTIC SURGERY USE, THERE'S FERTILITY CLINIC USE THOSE OTHER USES REALLY HELP REINFORCE OUR STRATEGY BECAUSE THEY'RE LARGE THEY'RE DIFFUSED THEY'RE NOT CENTRALIZED OUR STRATEGY TO PARTNER WITH OTHERS TO PENETRATE THOSE MARKETS EXACTLY AS WE DID WITH ZYMER BIOMETH THAT WAS COMPONENT TWO OF YOUR QUESTION BRANDY, COMPONENT THREE WAS ZALVISO AND PAM YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT ONE AS WE We've not really had a definitive framework from the FDA yet on their evaluation of new opioid products. It's unclear whether old opioid products were approved under an old framework and sort of grandfathered in. And so we're really waiting for more clarity from the FDA and specifically the FDA's division on on a specified framework to sort of evaluate new opioid submissions. I think the good news is that approval. But they're clearly seeing and recognizing the importance of opioids in these medically supervised settings, and that continues to give us comfort moving forward brandon, i hope that answer to the three components of your question it does, you mind if i sneak one more in and apologize if i trip something out just in terms of the feedback you've received from physicians using the product is the onset of action and duration of effects being reported in practice is the feedback you've received from physicians using the product is the onset of action and duration of effects being reported in practice is the feedback you've received from physicians using the product is the onset of action and duration of effects being reported in practice is the feedback you've received from physicians using the product is the onset of action and duration of effects being reported in practice is the feedback you've received from Similar to what we saw in the clinical trials, and in line with my promise, I will make it happen. Thank you. Absolutely. The onset of action is very consistent. Again, the sublingual route of administration avoids the first pass effect that you meaning it doesn't go to the stomach and then have to be absorbed and and metabolized by the liver which makes it very erratic onset. That's why oral opioid medications don't really work quickly or that consistently. SO FROM A SUBLINGUAL ONSET STANDPOINT IT IS VERY CONSISTENT AND THE DURATION OF ACTION IS INTERESTING IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN YOU KNOW OUR CLINICAL TRIAL WE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF MULTIMODAL ANALGESIA WHEN YOU'RE GOING UP AGAINST PLACEBO YOU TRY TO KEEP THOSE STUDIES QUITE CLEAN SO IN THE REAL WORLD SETTING YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD REPORTS THAT THE DURATION OF ANALGESIA IT CAN EVEN LAST BEYOND THREE TO FOUR HOURS LEVEL OF ANALGESIA THROUGH TO DISCHARGE WITH JUST THAT SINGLE DOSE YEAH I THINK THE GENERAL FEEDBACK BEYOND WHAT PAM SAID IS THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELIVERING ON THE MESSAGES WE'VE COMMUNICATED THAT ON SET THE DURATION AND AS DOCTORS HAVE MASTERED THEIR ART WITH IT BRINGING IT FORWARD IN THE SHORT TERM SURGERIES AND PROCEDURES HAS BEEN THE ABSOLUTE KEY BRINGING IT FORWARD MEANING WHEN THEY DOSE IT AND THEY'RE TYING THE P K TO THE ACUTE PAIN TO REALLY MAXIM It's really allowing you to use one dose which I think has been the largest surprise to all of them and and if i could add i think one of the most remarkable things we hear about is the lack of side effects you know i mean in the pack you the important um time to discharge is sort of a composite measure you have to have your adverse events under control and you also have to have your pain under control to be discharged so the the thing that i love about is you know sort of time to discharge is really There's a way to look at both safety and health at the same time, as well as making sure, when i say safety, your patients, including your elderly patients, don't have any cognitive impairment. And that's a huge part. So one of the things we're hearing back in spades from the customers is that that preoperative dose is carrying them through the operation, through the pack you, many times additional medications are not required at all and they're able to discharge them more quickly because they do not have The side effects from the typical live opioids that they're often seen.\n\nBrandon:\n\nThe side effects from the typical live opioids that they're often seen.\n\nVery hopeful. That helps very much. Thank you.\n\nOur next question today will come from Michael Higgins of ladenburg salmon. Please go ahead.\n\nMy questions have been asked. Thank you.\n\nOur next question today will come from Michael Higgins of ladenburg salmon. Please go ahead. TODAY WILL COME FROM EVAN SEEGER MANN OF CREDIT SUISSE. PLEASE GO AHEAD GUYS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS. UM A FOLLOW UP ON THE ZYMBERMITE DEAL WHAT FEEDBACK HAVE YOU GOT FROM DENTISTS REGARDING USING THE PRODUCT IN OFFICE. ARE THEY COMFORTABLE STORING IT AND KIND OF ALL THE ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BY HAVING THE OPIOIDS IN THE OFFICE. YOU KNOW THAT THEY DO USE VARIOUS DRUGS IN THE OFFICE B Well, any thoughts as to what you're looking for in terms of a target product profile or even more broadly speaking, you know, what type of patient population? How should we be thinking about that? Thank you so much. GIVING IT TO ORAL SURGEONS AND IV SEDATION DENTISTS, SO THAT MEANS THEY ALREADY HAVE APPROVAL AND ALREADY HAVE THE LOCKED TWO STORAGE AND ALL THE NECESSARY OXYGEN AND MEDICATIONS TO TREAT RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION DUE TO OPIOIDS. SO THEY ARE VERY SAVVY SURGEONS WHO ALREADY KNOW HOW TO USE IV OPIOIDS AND THEY CERTAINLY SEE THE ADVANTAGE OF A RAPID ONSET AND EXTENDED DURATION SUBLINGUAL TABLET THAT AVOIDS THEM HAVING TO STOP THEIR PROCEDURE AND Dose their i.v. opioids, which they typically have to do multiple times throughout a procedure. So they clearly see the benefit and that's again why you know zimmer saw the benefit as well. They know these surgeries very well and they know the benefit that it can provide. MARKETS BUT WE DON'T HAVE A LARGE ENOUGH SALES FORCE TO PENETRATE LIKE THESE PARTNERS HAVE AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY'VE BUILT UP COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE. SO WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE HOSPITAL AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER MARKETS WITH THE PARTNERS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THESE WE'RE CALLING THEM SPECIALTY MARKETS THERE SPECIALTY FOR US BUT NOT FOR OTHERS BUT WITH PARTNERS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THAT SPACE WITH ESTABLIS AND THAT LEADS INTO I THINK THE SECOND COMPONENT OF YOUR QUESTION EVAN, WHICH WAS TARGET PRODUCT PROFILE AS WE LOOK AT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES MOVING FORWARD. SO FOR US THE BIGGEST KEY IS EFFICIENCY MEANING OURS IS THE CALL PATTERNS WITHIN THESE MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTINGS WHERE WE CURRENTLY DEPLOY OUR RESOURCES. WE WANT TO KEEP THEM FOCUSED WHERE THEY CURRENTLY ARE. SO IT'S THE HOSPITAL OR THE AFC OR THE ANESTHESIOLOGISTS The therapeutic area is less relevant for us. It's more of where they are located for use of these products. Account overlap is critical and will be opportunistic on a moving forward. One of the common themes through all that, other than the efficiency, is going to be something that's very late term or already on the market. We're not looking for long-term R&D projects. Okay, great. Thank you so much, guys. I appreciate the call. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question and answer session at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Vince Gaudet for any closing remarks. Thank you, operator. And thank you all for joining us today and for your continued support of Excelrax. We feel we're very well positioned for future growth and we look very much forward to sharing more developments as they occur. So please be safe and we look forward to giving you updates as they happen. Best. The conference is now concluded and we thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

CHALLENGES POSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC THIS STARTED WITH A VERY ABRUPT HALT TO CHINESE EXPORTS IN FEBRUARY FOLLOWED BY LOCK-DOWNS IN MARCH AND A DELIBERATE PACE OF DAY-TO-DAY RECOVERY THANKS TO OUR DEDICATED COLLEAGUES AT A SEAMLESS TRANSITION OF APPROXIMATELY 45,000 STAFF TO HOME OFFICE IN A MATTER OF DAYS OUR CUSTOMERS FACED NO DEGRADATION OF SERVICE QUALITY DESPITE EXTRAORDINARY VOLATILITY AND DEMAND FOR ESSENTIAL GOODS THIS CULMINATED IN SUBSTANTIAL MARKET SHARE GAINS ACROSS ALL TRANSACTIONAL BUSINESS UNITS FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE IN QUARTER TWO IS A TESTAMENT TO OUR FLEXIBLE ASSET-LIGHT BUSINESS MODEL AND OUR EFFORTS TO OPTIMALLY VARIABILIZE A MEANINGFUL PORTION OF OUR SHORT-TERM FIXED COST AND LOOKING AT THOSE FOUR KEY FIGURES THAT ARE IN FRONT

ESPECIALLY AT CHINA STARTED TO UH PICK UP STRONGLY AS OF JUNE LAST QUARTER AIR LOGISTICS AN EBIT OF CHF181 MILLION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED WHICH IS 4% HIGHER THAN PREVIOUS YEAR BASED ON A HIGH DEMAND FOR CRISIS GOODS BUT ALSO A DEMAND FOR SPECIAL SOLUTIONS SUCH AS UH SEA AND AIR VOLUMES WHICH MORE THAN TRIPLED IN QUARTER TWO 202 ROAD LOGISTICS ENDED THE FIRST SEMESTER WITH AN EBIT OF CHF26 MILLION ALL NETWORKS WERE MAINTAINED AND EUROPE NOW IS SLOWLY RECOVERING WHILE THE AMERICAS ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AND CONTRACT LOGISTICS ENDED THE FIRST SEMESTER WITH AN EBIT OF CHF45 MILLION 21% BELOW PREVIOUS YEAR UM SEEING A HIGH DEMAND OF ESSENTIAL GOODS AND UH ANSWERING THE GROSS PROFIT DECLINE WITH STRICT COST MANAGEMENT ALMOST MATCHING THE GROSS PROFIT DEVELOPMENT ON SLIDE SIX WE WILL DISCUSS BRIEFLY THE VOLUME DEVELOPMENT IN SEA LOGISTICS AND AIR LOGISTICS PLEASE LET ME START WITH SEA LOGISTICS FIRST WE HAVE A PRONOUNCED EFFORT UH IN SEA LOGISTICS ESPECIALLY ON MAINTAINING OUR OWN NETWORKS UH IN SEA LOGISTICS ESPECIALLY ON MAINTAINING OUR OWN NETWORK CAPACITY WHICH YIELDED IN SIGNIFICANT MARKET SHARE GAINS ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS BUT ESPECIALLY IN PHARMA AND REEFER AND THE E-COMMERCE SEGMENT THE CARGO MIX I MENTIONED THAT BEFORE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SME VOLUME AND THIS IS A HIGHER YIELDING AS WE HAVE MENTIONED IN SOME OF OUR PREVIOUS CALLS THE MARKET DEMAND IS CONTINUOUSLY RECOVERING OVER THE COURSE OF QUARTER TWO BUT IT'S STILL BELOW PREVIOUS YEAR LET MAY GIVE YOU SOME UH HINTS ON HOW MARKET UH HOW OH SORRY HOW OUR VOLUME DEVELOPED UH MONTHS BY MONTHS IN QUARTER TWO WE SAW APRIL WAS A 15% ONE-FIVE PERCENT VOLUME DECREASE BUT GAINING MARKET SHARE ENDED OUR VOLUMES IN MAY BY ONLY MINUS 12% AND THE JUNE VOLUMES ALREADY SHOWED A MINUS 8% VOLUME DECREASE SO GRADUALLY WE SEE VOLUMES PICKING UP AGAIN BUT STILL LOWER THAN PREVIOUS YEAR IN TOTAL WE SHIPPED 217,000 TEU LESS IN OUR NETWORKS UH WHICH RESULTED INTO UM 11.70% REDUCTION IN QUARTER TWO AND A 9.10% REDUCTION IN VOLUMES FOR THE FIRST SEMESTER 2020 FOR SEA LOGISTICS AIR LOGISTICS SAW A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DEMAND FOR DRY CARGO AND PERISHABLES AND BOTH ARE LOWER YIELDING AS YOU KNOW A STRONG DEMAND FOR ESSENTIAL GOODS WHICH WERE HIGHER YIELDING AND UH MAINLY PRODUCED OR OPERATED IN A CHARTER UH OR OR VIA CHARTER BUSINESS UH BECAUSE THE RECOVERY UH OF BELLY IS NOT EXPECTED UH TO SEE OR SHOW SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS BEFORE QUARTER FOUR IS HERE THE SOARING DEMAND FOR SEA AND AIR SOLUTIONS AND ALSO A MONTHLY DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS RATHER STABLE BY MINUS 23 TO MINUS 20% APRIL TO JUNE IN TOTAL THE FIRST SEMESTER A REDUCTION IN VOLUME OF MINUS 15.5% HOW DOES THIS TRANSLATE NOW INTO THE UNIT PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS UNITS AND PLEASE FOLLOW ME ON SLIDE SEVEN FIRST SEA

SLOWLY RECOVERING WHILE THE VOLUMES IN AMERICA STAY AT A LOW AND VERY LOW LEVEL AT THE MOMENT THIS IS TRUE BO- FOR BOTH INTERMODAL AS WELL AS UM TRUCK BROKERAGE WE HAVE SEEN SLIDE 12 NOW WE HAVE SEEN A FASTER MASSIVE DETERIORATION OF VOLUMES IN EUROPE AT THE START OF QUARTER TWO AND I THINK WE MENTIONED THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE HAD OUR QUARTER ONE ANALYST CALL WITH YOU UH AND THE ORDER OF THE UH THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HAS BEEN HIGHER THAN 50% VOLUME REDUCTIONS BUT THAT WAS TRUE FOR TWO THREE WEEKS ONLY AND WE SEE A STEADY VOLUME RECOVERY STEP-BY-STEP ESPECIALLY IN DOMESTIC UH TRANSPORTS IN EUROPE AT THE MOMENT US FOLLOWED UH WITH A SHARP VOLUME DECLINE END OF APRIL UH AND ESPECIALLY INTERMODAL MORE OR LESS COLLAPSED AND UM WE SEE A STEADY RECOVERY UH IN JUNE UH SINCE JUNE IN EUROPE AND A

BEEN ABLE TO ROLL THIS OUT UM EVEN UH IN A IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS IN MANY ASIAN COUNTRIES AND WE SEE THE VOLUME SOARING IN ON THAT PLATFORM AT THE MOMENT WHILE EBIT UH WAS UH 42% BELOW PREVIOUS YEAR WE GENERATED A POSITIVE EBIT OF CHF26 MILLION AND IN OUR BEST CASE SCENARIO UH WE WOULD NOT HAVE UM EXPECTED A UH A POSITIVE QUARTER TWO IN ROAD LOGISTICS GIVEN THE CHARACTER OF OUR NETWORKS SO WE ARE VERY PROUD OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED HERE UH CONQUE- COUNTERING UM UH VOLUME REDUCTIONS WITH COST MEASURES SLIDE 13 CONTRACT LOGISTICS AND AS I SAY CONTRACT LOGISTICS SHOWED HIGH RESILIENCE AND IT SHOWED TWO FACES THE UGLY FACE IF I MAY SAY SO <LAUGH> UH WAS INDUSTRIES THAT CLEARLY WERE DOWNTRADING AUTOMOTIVE AND INDUSTRIAL TO NAME TWO AND UH WE HAD COMPLETE SHUTDOWNS UH BY CUSTOMERS AND SOMETIMES BY GOVERNMENTS IN THOSE INDUSTRIES FOR TWO THREE FOUR SIX UP TO EIGHT WEEKS UH AND UH SOME OF THE VOLUMES HAVE NOT RECOVERED EVEN TO A SIZABLE UM UM UH LEVEL AGAIN THAN PRIOR TO THE CRISIS AND THERE WAS A COUPLE OF NICE FACES THAT WE SAW OR UP TRADING INDUSTRIES THE PHARMA AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY UP TRADING INDUSTRIES THE PHARMA AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY THE INDUSTRY FOR ESSENTIAL GOODS WHICH IS PACKAGED FOOD AND UH FOOD AND AND CONSUMABLES AND ALSO E-COMMERCE AND HERE THE VOLUMES WERE WELL ABOVE SEASONAL PEAKS AND WE HAD EXTRA SHIFTS THAT WE HAD TO INTRODUCE ESPECIALLY ON THE WEEKENDS TO COPE WITH THE SOARING AND SPIKING DEMAND 90% OR UP TO 85% TO 90% OF OUR SITES REMAINED OPEN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CRISIS AND CURRENTLY WE ONLY HAVE 12 SITES THAT ARE STILL CLOSED OUT OF MORE THAN 600 SITES GLOBALLY SO WE SEE A CLEAR UH UH CONFIRMATION THAT 50% OF OUR SOLUTION PORTFOLIO IS RELATED TO ESSENTIAL GOODS AND THIS DEMAND HAS NEVER STOPPED OR HAS NEVER BEEN REDUCED SOME DETAILS ON THE CONTRACT LOGISTICS BUSINESS UNIT ON SLIDE 14 UM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COVID-19 SOPS OUR OPERATING PROCEDURES ACROSS ALL OPERATION WERE INTRODUCED BUT THEY ALSO ADDED A LOT OF COST AND A LOT OF EFFICIENCIES WHILE WE WERE DOING EVERYTHING TO PROTECT OUR STAFF UM WE LOST CLEARLY EFFICIENCIES UH CLEANING DISINFECTION BETWEEN SHIFTS NO OVERLAP OF SHIFTS ANYMORE SEGREGATION OF WORKFLOW BETWEEN SHIFTS LED TO A LOWER PRODUCTIVITY UH AND HIGHER COST OBVIOUSLY BUT THE EXCELLENT UH THE EXCELLENT COST MANAGEMENT UH THAT UH CONTRACT LOGISTICS INTRODUCED IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE CRISIS BECOMING ONE UH SO AS OF FEBRUARY UM CLEARLY SHOWED PROGRESS AND WE WERE EXCLUDING THE PRESSURE FROM UM THE UH EXCHANGE RATE UH WE WERE ABLE TO UH COUNTER THE TOP LINE REVENUE PRESSURE UH WITH COST MEASURES ALMOST ENTIRELY AND AND UH THERE IS A FOR FOR SUCH A HUGE BUSINESS UNIT EMPLOYING SO MANY PEOPLE THAT'S A A HUGE EFFORT AND A GREAT RESULT UM SO THE HIGH PORTION IN OUR SOLUTION PORTFOLIO OF UH ESSENTIAL GOODS SHORT HIGH RESILIENCE AND UH THE LEASE THAT'S LARGELY BACKED BY CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS BACK-TO-BACK SO WE HAVE MORE THAN 50% OF OUR SITES ARE SO-CALLED DEDICATED SITES SO WE WERE NOT EXPOSED TO TO AN OVER-PROPORTIONATE LEASE UH WITHOUT ANY ACTIVITY IN TOO MANY SITES NEVERTHELESS UM UH WE WE SAW A DEVELOPMENT END OF QUARTER ONE AND EARLY QUARTER TWO BUT IF YOU LOOK INTO THE FIGURES UM THE UH OVERALL PERFORMANCE UH INCLUDING THE FX EFFECT UH IT'S UH ONLY 11.3% UH LOWER NET TURN OVER AND IN EBIT UM ALMOST ON THE LEVEL OF PREVIOUS YEAR QUARTER TWO AND UH HAVING SAID SO I AM HAPPY TO HAND OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MARKUS UH TO LEAD YOU TO THROUGH THE KEY FINANCIAL FIGURES THANK YOU VERY MUCH DETLEF WELCOME TO ALL PARTICIPANTS ALSO FROM MY SIDE A VERY SPECIAL SECOND QUARTER INDEED UH A TIME THAT WAS CHARACTERIZED BY UNUSUAL BUSINESS PATTERN I THINK UH WE HAD QUITE SOME OPPOSITE FOCUS UH ON OR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT FOCUS ON UH IN THE BUSINESS UNITS AIRFREIGHT CAN BE UH UH CAN BE DESCRIBED BY JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN UH UH AT TIMES WHERE OUR CUSTOMERS AS MUCH AS ON THE CARRIER SIDE I THINK A LOT OF UH CREATIVITY WAS BEING REQUIRED UH TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN ON THE OTHER SIDE AS DETLEF MENTIONED IN CONTRACT LOGISTICS CLEAR FOCUS ON UH ON UH COST CONTAINMENT AND COST MANAGEMENT SO A LOT OF TIMES WE HAVE BEEN UH CONFRONTED WITH THE FACT THAT TRADITIONAL KPIS KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS HAD BEEN NOT EXTREMELY HELPFUL UH WE NEEDED TO LOOK DIFFERENTLY AT THE BUSINESS BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL SITUATION BUT AND UH I WANT TO LEAD YOU ON TO PAGE NUMBER 16 I THINK THE RESULT ULTIMATELY WAS A QUITE GOOD ONE AND UH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE OF IMPACT WITH UH SUCH A UNUSUAL BUSINESS CAN HAPPEN IS UH WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE GROSS PROFIT DEVELOPMENT FROM THE SE- FROM THE FIRST AND TO SECOND QUARTER TO COMPARED TO LAST YEAR WE HAVE ACTUALLY LOST IN THE SECOND QUARTER CHF265 MILLION GROSS PROFIT COMPARED TO LAST YEAR THAT IS THREE AND A HALF TIMES MORE THAN IN THE FIRST QUARTER HOWEVER ON AN EBITDA LEVEL WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN AT THE SAME EVEN BETTER LEVEL THE THAN COMPARED TO UH UH TO THE FIRST QUARTER SO WE ONLY IF YOU LIKE STILL A BIG NUMBER BUT THIS QUARTER SO WE ONLY IF YOU LIKE STILL A BIG NUMBER BUT ONLY HAVE A REDUCTION IN EBITDA OF CHF30 MILLION OUT OF A GROSS PROFIT REDUCTION OF 26 SO THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF UH THE COST CONTAINED AND THE COST MANAGEMENT IN BETWEEN THAT I THINK UH UH YOU CAN YOU CAN APPRECIATE WAS UH WAS QUITE A PIECE OF HARD WORK TO UH TO GET THAT DONE UM GOING FURTHER DOWN IN THE UH P&L OF COURSE ON AN EBITDA LEVEL YES WE ARE UH AROUND 18% BEHIND LAST YEAR ON A HALF-YEAR BASIS SO 90 MILLION NINE-ZERO UM OF WHICH AND THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE JUST THE FACT OF AROUND 20 MILLION ARE COMING OUT OF UH OUT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE SO CHF70 MILLION FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE UH REDU- REDUCTION VERSUS LAST YEAR SO IN RELATIVE TERMS I BELIEVE THE SECOND QUARTER AND THAT'S ALSO VERY APPARENT WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST QUARTER UM PAGE NUMBER 17 LET'S TALK ABOUT UH AIR AND SEAFREIGHT IN THAT CONTEXT THE ETOUCH UH UH PROJECT AND THE AUTOMATION INITIATIVES BEHIND THAT WE HAVE PRESENTED THE POTENTIAL OF THE UH ETOUCH INITIATIVES IN IN COMMERCIAL TERMS AT OUR FULL YEAR 2019 PRESENTATION SO WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY AN UPDATE WHERE WE STAND UH IT'S NOT THE NEW ASSESSMENT OF UH VALUES IT'S JUST UH AN UPDATE ON PROGRESS AND I THINK UH YOU CAN APPRECIATE WE HAVE UH SET THE BASELINE IN MANY UH AREAS IN AIRFREIGHT AND OUR OPERATING SYSTEM AIRLOG IS UH IS UH FULLY ROLLED OUT IN 2019 WHICH IS A PREREQUISITE FOR MANY OF THE ETOUCH UH INITIATIVES NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MANY OF THOSE AND YOU CAN SEE DESPITE THE FACT THAT Q2 HAS BEEN A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT TO PUT THROUGH UH UH PROJECTS BUT WE HAVE CONTINUED TO DRIVE UH ETOUCH INITIATIVES AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD PROGRESS AT LEAST IN ONE OF THE FIVE CORE UH AREAS THE ONE THAT IS CUSTOMER BOOKING AND ORDER ENTRY UM I THINK THE MESSAGE HERE IS YES DO NOT EXTEND UH EXPECT ANY MIRACLES RIGHT NOW IN A CURRENT SITUATION WITH UH STILL OVER A GOOD THREE MONTHS PEOPLE ARE WORKING PARTIALLY FROM HOME UH PARTIALLY JUST WHAT I SAID TRYING TO KEEP UP SERVICE IN AN IN AN EXCELLENT MANNER BUT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE A SLIGHT DELAY THE MESSAGE THAT I WANT TO GIVE YOU HERE IS ETOUCH IS ON TRACK PAGE NUMBER 18 BALANCE SHEET UM I'M ONLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT UH UH THREE FOUR COMPONENTS OF COURSE SOME OF THEM HOUSEKEEPING FIRST ONE TRADE RECEIVABLES BIGGEST UH UH ITEM UH ON THE BALANCE SHEET 3-POINT UH 2 3.3 BILLION UH BY THE END OF JUNE UH 2020 COMPARED TO 3.6 BILLION UH NOT SURPRISINGLY AGAIN UH UH HERE WE WE SEE A POSITION WHERE BUSINESS VOLUME UH UH HAS REDUCED SLIGHTLY AND YOU KNOW IT'S A FUNCTION BASICALLY OF RATES AND AND VOLUME AND OF COURSE A CURRENCY IMPACT ALSO ON THAT UH ON THAT POSITION THAT IS REDUCING THE OVERALL DEMAND SECONDLY AND UM ARGUABLY MORE IMPORTANT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS I THINK OUR BALANCE SHEET IS STRONG WITH A WITH A GROSS CASH POSITION HERE OF UH NEARLY 1.2 BILLION UH TRANSLATED INTO NET CASH OF AROUND 760 MILLION UH WHICH COMPARES TO ROUGHLY 900 MILLION RESPECTIVELY 480 MILLION BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER 202 SO UM SIMPLE TERMS A VERY GOOD UH UH DEVELOPMENT IN UH CASH GENERATION UM IN LIGHT I THINK OF THE DECISION AND YOU HAVE READ IT IN THE UH IN THE NEWS TODAY IN LIGHT OF THE DECISION TO PROPOSE THE DISTRIBUTION UH OF A DIVIDEND TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF FOR SWISS FRANC UH WE HAVE CALCULATED A PRO FORMA NET CASH POSITION AT THAT POINT IN TIME AND THAT WOULD STILL BE POSITIVE WITH 280 MILLION UM JUST AS A HOUSEKEEPING TOPIC HERE UH YOU'RE AWARE THAT UH WE HAVE A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AVAILABLE TO US WHICH IS ENTIRELY UNDRAWN SO NOTHING HAS BEEN USED SO FAR IN THE EXTENT UH OR AT THE FRAME OF 750 MILLION UM COMING BACK TO UH THE NEXT ITEM ON THE BALANCE SHEET UH ASSET HELD FOR SALE ALSO HERE INFORMATION PURPOSES THIS IS THE VALUE UH THAT WE HAVE UH OR OR THAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE BUSINESS THAT WE HAVE SIGNED A CONTRACT OF DIVESTMENTS WITH THE XPO YOU CAN SEE A VERY UH TRANSPARENT ASSET HELD FOR SALE YOU CAN SEE A VERY UH TRANSPARENT ASSET HELD FOR SALE 400 MILLION LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ASSETS HELD FOR SALE 30 SO THE NET ASSET VALUE UH OF THAT BUSINESS TO BE CARVED OUT IS AROUND 100 MILLION EQUITY RATIO I'M SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY CALCULATED THAT YOURSELF UH FROM DECEMBER 23.6% AN INCREASE TO 25.9% SO I THINK UH THE SOLIDITY OF THE BALANCE SHEET IS ALSO IN THESE ROUGH TIMES AND UNUSUAL TIMES A BENEFIT UH NEVERTHELESS BALANCE SHEET IS ONE THING CASH IS CASH IS KING UM SO MAIN TOPIC CASH UH GOING UH SWIFTLY TO PAGE NUMBER 1 UM OPERATIONAL CASH FLOW YOU CAN SEE THAT HERE IN THE FIRST HALF 2020 AT AROUND 804 MILLION SIMILAR LEVEL THAN LAST YEAR UH WITH WITH AROUND 800 872 MILLION UM HOWEVER WHEN WE GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND LOOK AT THE TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT SITUATION WE HAVE AN INCREASE ON THE CASH BALANCE OF AROUND 666 MILLION BE REMINDED AT THAT POINT IN TIME UM THAT INCLUDED LAST YEAR A DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO THE AMOUNT OF 720 MILLION SO COMPARATIVELY AT SIMILAR LEVEL FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION UH UH REALLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT VERY RESILIENT THE FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION ALSO IN THE SECOND QUARTER SO I'M TALKING SECOND QUARTER NOT HALF YEAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 227 MILLION WHICH COMPARES TO 223 MILLION SO UH LET'S TALK ABOUT CRISIS OR A NON-CRISIS FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION HAS BEEN UH AT THE VERY SAME LEVEL AS AS UH AS LAST YEAR UM EXCLUDING SOME OF THE DISPOSALS AND THIS GIVES YOU A BIT OF AN IDEA ON HOW MUCH EXTRAORDINARY UH UH COMPONENTS ARE IN THERE EXCLUDING THE DISPOSALS THE UNDERLYING FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WAS STILL 22 SO THE THE THE THE SWING THAT WE TALKED TO YOU TO UH UH UH DISPOSALS IS UM UH A VERY NEGLIGIBLE I THINK 6 MILLION OUT OF THE FREE CASH FLOW UM FOR EVERYBODY WHO RUNS SOME OF THE MODELS I THINK YOU CAN SEE HERE FROM THE INVESTING ACTIVITIES UM THE CROSS CAPEX THE RUN RATES OR THE CAPEX THAT WE SPEND INTO THE BUSINESS IS CURRENTLY AIMING AT AROUND 200 MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WHICH IS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WE HAD IT SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS UM SOME OF THE SOME OF THE DRIVERS OF COURSE IS UH THE CONTRACT LOGISTICS DISPOSAL OF THE OF THE UH OF PART OF THE UK BUSINESS AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ALSO VERY DILIGENTLY WORKING ON THE USAGE OF UH LONG-TERM LEASES ACCORDING TO IFRS 16 RATHER THAN UH UH OUTRIGHT PURCHASES UM LOOKING AT THE PATTERN IN TIME SO THE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE FREE CASH FLOW I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CURVES UNDER PAGE 19 ON THE RIGHT SIDE UH THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT UH UH SHOULD LOOK DIFFERENTLY AT LEAST IN THE IN THE THIRD QUARTER THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR AGAIN BE REMINDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WE HAD SOME EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT IN 201 SO WE SHOULD EXPECT A MORE UH UH EVEN UH DEVELOPMENT INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER ALSO FOR 202 GOING TO PAGE NUMBER 20 AND I ONLY TOUCHED UH THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE QUICKLY ON THE BALANCE SHEET UM WHEN I WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THE BALANCE SHEET HERE YOU SEE TRADE RECEIVABLES UH HAVE DECREASED UH UH OVER A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BY AROUND 400 MILLION REASONS THAT I MENTIONED ALREADY UH TRADE PAYABLES ARE AROUND 260 MILLION SO OUR NET WORKING CAPITAL IS DOWN AROUND 146 MILLION UM WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT OUR KPIS AND DSOS AND DPOS WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP ESPECIALLY ON THE DSO SIDES DAYS OF SALES OUTSTANDING UH A NUMBER AROUND UH 54 5 SO WE HAVE A DEVIATION OF 0.4 DAYS UH MANY UH QUESTIONS COMING ALONG OUR AWAY OBVIOUSLY IN UH IS THERE PRESSURE FROM CUSTOMERS ON EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS YES THERE IS UH VERY CLEAR YES THERE IS BUT UH I THINK UM UH WE WILL SEE MORE PRESSURE COMING INTO THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER UH WE ARE WE ARE HOLDING UP UH UH QUITE WELL I THINK UH SERVICE IS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS TO UH TO MAINTAIN UH UH THE DSOS AT THE SAME TIME I THINK UH OUR FOCUS MOVES TOWARDS THE RISK PROFILE BEHIND THE COUNTERPARTIES UH I DO EXPECT I DO EXPECT GOING FORWARD FOR THE NEXT TWO TO THREE QUARTERS UH UM AN INCREASE IN THE RISK TWO TO THREE QUARTERS UH UM AN INCREASE IN THE RISK PROFILE ON COUNTERPARTY RISKS UM SO NOTHING BAD HAPPENED SO FAR I WANT TO UNDERLINE THAT IT'S UH IT'S UH UH UH NO UH NO BIG UM UH UH DEFAULTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE PRESSURE IS ALSO HERE UH GETTING HIGHER UH UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AND MAYBE INTO THE FIRST HALF YEAR 202 UM RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED UH PAGE NUMBER 2 PAGE NUMBER 21 UM YOU SEE THAT LITTLE INFLECTION POINT THAT WE HAD HERE UH UH FROM 60% UP TO 66 6 AND I THINK THAT WAS A THAT WAS A GOOD SIGN SO NOW WE SEE A LITTLE BIT THE THE THE THE COVID-19 EFFECTS UH UH THAT HAD THAT PUSHES DOWN TO 62% AGAIN UH VERY CLEAR AND I JUST WROTE IT FOR FOR UH FOR CLARITY JUST DECIDED UH UH THE SUDDEN DECREASE OF UH THE PROFITABILITY THAT WE HAVE SEEN ALSO ON THE P&L ON A VERY SIMILAR ASSET BASE UH IS UH OBVIOUSLY MATHEMATICALLY LEADING TO A BIT OF UM UH A BIT OF AN UH A COMPRESSION ON THIS ONE HOWEVER FROM A TARGET PERSPECTIVE WE MAINTAIN OUR FINANCIAL OUR FINANCIAL UH UH UH TARGETS UH WITH AROUND 70% RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED THAT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE UM THE GOOD NEWS AND AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THE EXPECTED ALSO FROM SOME OF YOU NEWS UH IS ON THE NEXT PAGE PAGE NUMBER 2 UM UH DIVIDEND PROPOSAL JUST TO PUT ALSO SOME UH CLARITY AROUND CONVERSATIONS WE HAD OVER THE LAST YEARS UH YOU KNOW THAT WE NEVER HAD A FORMAL WRITTEN DIVIDEND POLICY UH UH AS IT IS UH UH ALL DECISION MAKING POWER REMAINS UH WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY UM THAT HAVING SAID THE ACTUAL PAYOUT RATIO IN THE RECENT YEARS WAS ALWAYS CONSISTENT WITH UH ALSO OUR VERBAL COMMUNICATION TO A DISTRIBUTION UH OF AROUND 75% OF THE UH NET PROFIT AFTER TAX UM UH CLEARLY UH NOW THE BOD'S UH PROPOSAL IS BASED ON UH ON UH UH THE ASSESSMENT OF THE MARKET CONDITIONS AND ALSO THE UH GROUP'S UH PERFORMANCE AND LIKELY ONGOING PERFORMANCE AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE UH THE PROPOSAL TO THE ANNUAL OR THE THE EXTRAORDINARY UH GENERAL MEETING UH ON SEPTEMBER 2 WILL BE TO PAY OUT A DIVIDEND OF UH CHF4 FINANCIAL TARGETS AND THE LAST SLIDE FROM UH FROM UH MY PRESENTATION UH I THINK UH UH YOU SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE UH THE GROUP FINANCIAL TARGETS CONVERSION RATE 11% TO 16% I THINK EVERYBODY'S CLEAR ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS ETOUCH UH RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED I JUST UH SPOKE ABOUT IT I THINK WHEN WE COME BACK TO UH REGULAR PROFITABILITY BASED ON OUR ASSET BASE 70% IS UH IS IN REACH WORKING CAPITAL INTENSITY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT FIRST WORKING CAPITAL INTENSITY UH CURRENTLY AT 3.9% AND UH YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED I HAVE INTENTIONALLY UH UH WIDENED A LITTLE BIT THE CORRIDOR FROM UH TOP END 4.50% TO 5% UH UH FOR A SIMPLE REASON BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IS ANTICIPATING A REFLECTION OF PRESSURE ON COUNTERPARTY RISK AND POTENTIAL DSOS FOR THE NEXT FOUR QUARTERS UM TAX RATE UH TAX RATE I THINK UH VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THIS ONE IT'S A HOUSEKEEPING TOPIC UM FOR YOU ALSO TO UH UPDATE ON YOUR MODELS UH WE EXPECT A GROUP UH UH EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF AROUND 24% TO 26% UP FROM AROUND 24 TO 25 AS PER OUR LATEST COMMUNICATION THIS IS JUST REFLECTING THE CURRENT SHIFT IN THE BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX SO JUST THAT YOU'RE NOT SURPRISED ON YOUR MODELS UM RIGHT SIDE THE FOUR BUSINESS UNITS YOU SEE THE FIRST LINE OUR OUR ACTUAL PERFORMANCE IN VOLUMES BUT UH UNDERNEATH THE THE PART THAT EVERYBODY WAS REALLY WAITING FOR THAT IS THE UPDATE ON THE MARKET EXPECTATIONS FOR 2020 AND THE OUTLOOK AND UH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I THINK WE'RE IN LINE WITH MANY OF OUR PEERS UH WE ARE NOT GIVING ANY UM YOU KNOW THE UH I THINK THE PERFORMANCE THAT THE GROUP HAS SHOWN SO FAR GIVES US A CERTAIN CONFIDENCE IN OUR ABILITY ALSO TO MANAGE THROUGH WHAT WE BELIEVE IS GOING TO STILL BE A VOLATILE AND HIGHLY UNCER- WE BELIEVE IS GOING TO STILL BE A VOLATILE AND HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MARKET ALSO FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND AS THE MARKET OUTLOOK REMAINS EXTREMELY UNCERTAIN TO US AS WELL WE OFFER AGAIN NO EXPLICIT UH FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR THE GROUP NOR UH VOLUME GUIDANCE UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR VERY SORRY FOR THAT BUT AT THE CURRENT STAGE YOU WILL HAVE TO OR WE WILL ALL HAVE TO LIVE WITH GUESS WORKING AND A BIT OF UH COLOR OF WHAT WE SAID ON OUR PAST PERFORMANCE UH WITH THAT LITTLE LACK OF OUTLOOK UH I WILL HAND OVER TO UH DETLEF AND UH THANK YOU MARKUS AND THE LACK OF OUTLOOK MAYBE MARKS THE WHOLE YEAR BECAUSE IN THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE TO FLY ON SITE THAT IS THE SAYING WE HAVE AS FAR AS WE CAN LOOK AHEAD WE UH INITIATE MEASURES AND ACTIVITIES AND UH THE REST IS AGILITY ADAPTIVITY TO A SITUATION THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY PREDICT ON SLIDE 24 I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF REMARKS LOGISTICS IS AND WILL STAY PEOPLE'S BUSINESS EVEN IN A MORE AND MORE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT AND WE HAVE EMBARKED ON THIS ROUTE OUR ROADMAP 2022 WHICH STARTED IN 2018 AND WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT ROADMAP ROADMAP DEPLOYMENT PLANS CUSTOMER TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS HAS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT WE HAVE EMBARKED ON THE RIGHT STRATEGY WE STAYED FULLY OPERATIONAL THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS AND CONTINUE SERVING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH OUR HIGH QUALITY SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND I WOULD HEARTILY LIKE TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMITMENT AND PASSION AND TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THEIR TRUST AND LOYALTY THANK YOU WITHOUT YOU THE FIRST SEMESTER WOULD HAVE LOOKED DIFFERENTLY AND THAT'S THE ENERGY AND PASSION OF THE BEST LOGISTICS TEAM IN OUR INDUSTRY AND HAVING SAID SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAND OVER BACK TO SANDRA TO OPEN Q&A WE WILL NOW BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION ANYONE WHO WISHES TO ASK A QUESTION MAY PRESS STAR AND ONE ON THEIR TOUCH-TONE TELEPHONE YOU WILL HEAR A TONE TO CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE ENTERED A QUEUE IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE QUESTION QUEUE YOU MAY PRESS STAR AND TWO PARTICIPANTS ARE REQUESTED TO USE ONLY HANDSETS WHILE ASKING A QUESTION ANYONE WHO HAS A QUESTION MAY PRESS STAR AND ONE AT THIS TIME THE FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM DANIEL ROESKA FROM SANFORD BERNSTEIN PLEASE GO AHEAD GENTS GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR TAKING THE QUESTION THREE IF I MAY UM COULD YOU ELABORATE WHAT IS ENABLING THE MARKET SHARE GAME ESPECIALLY DURING A CRISIS LIKE THIS ONE IN YOUR VIEW AND KIND OF WHO'S LOSING IT UM AND THEN HOW MUCH OF THAT MARKET SHARE GAIN WILL YOU BE ABLE TO RETAIN KIND OF AS THINGS MOVE MORE BACK TO NORMAL UM YOU ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR COST REDUCTION EFFORTS AND IN TODAY'S REPORT YOU SHOWED ABOUT 87,000 EMPLOYEES DOWN FROM ABOUT 98 UM LAST YEAR AT THE SAME POINT NOW HOW MUCH OF THAT DECREASED KINDA LE- LET'S CALL IT A ROUGH 10,000 EMPLOYEES IS DRIVEN BY THE TEMPORARY FURLOUGH PROGRAMS AND HOW MUCH DUE TO ACTUAL SUSTAINABLE REDUCTIONS THAT THEN WILL BENEFIT YOU KIND OF AS YOU RAMP BACK UP AND UM TYING THIS ALSO TO ETOUCH UM BACK AT THE FINANCIAL YEAR LOGS YOU TALKED ABOUT 20 MILLION ANNUALIZED SAVINGS SO FAR UM ANY INDICATION ON HOW THIS HAS PROGRESSED IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND UM YOU KNOW DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE AUTOMATION WILL ENABLE YOU TO KEEP STAFF NUMBERS LOWER AS VOLUMES GO BACK UP OR HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT KIND OF REALLY DRIVING ETOUCH THROUGH THE BUSINESS THANKS THANKS DANNY LET ME ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS LET ME START WITH THE LATTER ONE BECAUSE WE HAVE UH ALLUDED TO THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES IT'S NOT ABOUT STAFF REDUCTION ETOUCH IS ENABLING US TO DO MORE BUSINESS AND TO DRIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS OR GROWTH IN BUSINESS SEGMENTS WITH A TRADITIONALLY LOWER MARGIN BUT WITH THE HIGH CONVERSION RATE STILL VERY ATTRACTIVE TO US AND THAT IS ETOUCH UM MARKET SHARE GAINS UH WE HAVE MENTIONED THAT UH WE WERE ABLE TO GAIN MARKET SHARE BECAUSE WE CHANGED THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION INTO ADDRESSING ACTIVELY CUSTOMERS UM AFTER EASTER SO WE WERE ENGAGED WITH ALL EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND UM POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS TARGET CUSTOMERS AS WE CALL THEM AND WE HAD INTERACTION VIRTUALLY WITH ALL OF THEM COUPLE OF TIMES THROUGHOUT THE WEEK AND MONTHS AND WE WANT BUSINESS WE WANT BUSINESS WITHOUT HAVING MET THE CUSTOMER PHYSICALLY AND UH WE WERE WINNING BUSINESS BECAUSE WE WERE OPERATIONAL AND MANY OF OUR MID-SIZED AND SMALLER COMPETITORS WHO ARE NOT OPERAT- OF OUR MID-SIZED AND SMALLER COMPETITORS WHO ARE NOT OPERATIONAL THEY STRUGGLED TO KEEP OPERATIONS UP AND RUNNING SO THAT ALSO WOULD ALLUDE TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION WHO LOST THE LOWER PART OF THE PYRAMID IS THE ONE THAT IS UNDER HIGHEST PRESSURE TECHNOLOGY CONNECTIVITY UH AND ALSO UH FUNCTIONABILITY OF OPERATING SYSTEMS IS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR MANY OF THEM AND ESPECIALLY IN A UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION THAT WE ALL WENT THROUGH WORLDWIDE OVER THE LAST THREE FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS UM THAT PROVED TO BE A BIG RISK AND A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T OVERCOME ANY OF THOSE DEFICIENCIES BY JUST CALLING SOMEONE OR GOING SOMEWHERE YOU HAD TO PROVE YOUR SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY ARE WORKING UM HOW MUCH CAN WE RETAIN I WOULD SAY WE WE WE CONVINCE OUR CUSTOMERS BY QUALITY WE DON'T CONVINCE BY PRICE WE ARE A QUALITY SURPRI- UH UH SUPPLIER AND THE CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE MADE THE EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR IN THE PAST IN GENERAL THEY STAY WITH US WE HAVE A LOT OF CUSTOMERS THAT WE RETAIN BECAUSE OF OUR HIGH QUALITY SERVICE AND THAT'S PART OF OUR ROADMAP 2022 UH STRATEGY CUSTOMER EXCELLENCE IT UH IS AT THE CENTER OF ALL THE TOPICS WE DO WE DON'T WANT TO WIN TRANSACTIONAL BUSINESS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF WINNING IT FOR AND OPERATING IT FOR ONE TWO OR THREE MONTHS WE WANT CUSTOMERS TO STAY WITH US AND SEE HOW MUCH OF OUR SOLUTION PORTFOLIO CAN GENERATE BENEFITS FOR THEM COST REDUCTION EFFORTS UM I THINK UM WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF EFFORTS UH WITH ALL THE PROGRAMS UH THAT ARE IN PLACE BUT NOT ONLY UH WE HAVE OPTIMIZED UH OUR WORKFORCE UH WE HAVE UH REDUCED CAPACITY WHERE REQUIRED BUT WE SHIFTED CAPACITY TO THOSE OPERATIONS SOMETIMES IN THE SAME CITY OR EVEN THE SAME WAREHOUSE WHERE DEMAND SPIKED SO THERE IS NO RULE WE HAVE ONLY A FEW TEMPORARY LABOR UH I THINK IT'S 2,000 A BIT MORE THAN 2,000 TEMP LABOR LESS THAN WE HAD A YEAR AGO UH AND THIS IS UH DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT THAT WE SEE MUCH HIGHER DEMAND STILL IN SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL GOODS UH SEGMENTS ESPECIALLY UH PHARMA HEALTHCARE AND UM E-COMMERCE AND THIS IS FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW SUSTAINABLE VOLUME THIS WILL STAY SO IN UH IN DIFFERENT WORDS DANIEL I WOULD SAY WE MADE A ORGANIC GROWTH EXPERIENCE COMPRESSED IN FIVE MONTHS MAYBE OR FOUR MONTHS THAT WE USUALLY WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH AND OUR CUSTOMERS IN A PERIOD OF 18 MONTHS AND I WOULD SAY THAT IS TO A LARGE EXTENT UH STICKY AND STAYS AND WILL NOT BE REVERSED RIGHT THANKS THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM SATHISH SIVAKUMAR FROM CITIGROUP PLEASE GO AHEAD UH YES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON DETLEF AND MARKUS THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS UH FIRSTLY COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE ON VOLUME TRENDS THROUGH THE QUARTER FROM SMES WHICH MARKETS ARE ACTUALLY SEEING WEAKNESS VERSUS THE RELATIVE STRENGTH SECONDLY IN 2019 ON YOUR SG&A EXPENSE WAS AROUND CHF445 MILLION SO COULD YOU PLEASE UPDATE ON THE CURRENT RUN RATE ON SG&A FINALLY UH WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR WORKFORCE RETURN RATE FROM REMOTE WORKING ACROSS THE MARKETS CAN YOU REPEAT THE LAST QUESTION PLEASE I I DIDN'T GET IT UH IN TERMS LIKE UH IN TERMS OF- YEAH WORKFORCE UH RETURNING BACK TO OFFICE UH WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR RETURN RATE SO FAR ACROSS KEY MARKETS OKAY SO VOLUME TRENDS UM WHICH MARKETS SAW AS YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PANDEMIC STARTED MID OF JANUARY ALREADY IN IN ASIA AND USUALLY THIS IS NOT AN SME MARKET OR WE ARE WE WE HAVE A MUCH HIGHER PORTION OF UH OF BLUE CHIP CUSTOMERS THERE BUT IN EUROPE UH IT'S MAINLY THE SME CUSTOMERS THAT DROPPED OUT OF BUSINESS VERY FAST UH AND THE RECOVERY IS STARTING OR HAS STARTED NOW IN JUNE I WOULD SAY SO THE FIRST SIGN OF A RECOVERY OF SME CUSTOMERS UH HAS BEEN SEEN IN JUNE IN EUROPE AND PARTLY IN IN OTHER MARKETS BUT MAINLY IN EUROPE AND UM THIS THIS WILL TAKE TIME IT WILL NOT COME OVERNIGHT UM AT THE MOMENT THE PANDEMIC UH IS IS HITTING THE AMERICAS AND UH WE SEE THAT UH WE ARE UH HAVE STILL VOLUMES THAT ARE DOWN AND NOT RECOVERING BUT HERE UH I WOULD SAY IT HAS BOTTOMED OUT SO WE ARE MORE POSITIVE UH TODAY THAN WE WERE THREE MONTHS AGO WHEN WE DISCUSSED THE QUARTER ONE RESULTS UM I WOULD SAY UM DESPITE REGIONAL AND LOCAL SETBACKS UM THIS PA- REGIONAL AND LOCAL SETBACKS UM THE PANDEMIC IS NOT OVER BUT WE HAVE ALL MANAGED AND UNDERSTOOD HOW TO HANDLE IT AND GOVERNMENTS HAVE INITIATED UH ENOUGH PROTECTIVE UH HEALTH MEASURES UH IN ORDER TO SECURE THE PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM CONTINUE CONSUMING UM THE SGE RUN RATE UH IT HAS A LOT OF COMPONENTS UM <LAUGH> AND UH IT STARTS WITH TRAVEL FOR EXAMPLE I DO NOT EXPECT TRAVEL TO COME BACK THIS YEAR TO SAY THIS CLEARLY INTERCONTINENT- NENTAL TRAVEL I WOULD NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANY OF THE FLIGHTS INTERCONTINENTAL RISK KUEHNE + NAGEL STUFF ON IT UH BEFORE SEPTEMBER IF AT ALL AND AND THEN WE HAVE MADE SUCH A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE ON WINNING NEW CUSTOMERS UH AND AND AND UH UH SUCH A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE WITH WINNING CUSTOMERS AND SO ON UH ONLINE AND VIRTUAL ONLY THAT UH YOU COULD SAY EVERY SECOND TRIP CAN BE SPARED IN GENERAL MOVING FORWARD AND THEN WE HAVE A CURRENCY EFFECT HERE AS WELL THERE'S A A CURRENCY EFFECT IN SGE UM BECAUSE UH WE TRANSLATE EVERYTHING INTO INTO HARD CURRENCY SWISS FRANC AND AND THAT HAS AN EFFECT IN ITSELF AS WELL I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS OKAY YEAH THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM DAVID KERSTENS FROM JEFFERIES PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON UH GENTLEMEN UH THREE QUESTIONS PLEASE FROM MY SIDE FIRST ON UH ON SEA LOGISTICS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE UH VOLUME DEVELOPMENT UH IS UH IS BETTER THAN EXPECTED AS THE QUARTER PROGRESSED I WAS WONDERING DID YOU SEE A NOTAB- NOTICEABLE IMPACT FROM A SHIFT FROM FROM AIR TO SEAFREIGHT DUE TO THE LACK OF CAPACITY IN IN AIRFREIGHT THEN SECONDLY IN IN AIR LOGISTICS YOU YOU BENEFITED FROM I THINK IN CONSTANT CURRENCY A 34% UH HIGH YIELD AND NOW WITH UH THE AIRFREIGHT MARKET STARTING TO NORMALIZE AGAIN WOULD YOU EXPECT THAT THAT AIRFREIGHT YIELD ALSO NORMALIZES BACK TO THE RANGE THAT YOU INDICATED IN YOUR PRESENTATION OF 70 TO CHF85 PER PER HUNDRED KILOGRAM OR DO YOU EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO TO DO TO DO BETTER THAN THIS RANGE AND THEN FINALLY ON ON ROAD LOGISTICS I THINK THE ORGANIC REVENUE WAS DOWN 20% IN THE UH SECOND QUARTER BUT THAT'S A MIX OF OF EUROPE AND AND NORTH AMERICA CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME COLOR ON HOW WEAK NORTH AMERICA REALLY WAS AND WITH A DECREASE OF 20% DOES IT STILL IMPLY THAT YOU GAINED MARKET SHARE IN THE SECOND QUARTER BECAUSE OF THINGS SOME OF YOUR PEERS REFER TO THE MARKET DOWN ONLY 15% IN THE SECOND QUARTER THANKS VERY MUCH SURE DAVID SO LET ME ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS UM SEA LOGISTICS UM YES WE HAD A BETTER VOLUME DEVELOPMENT THAN EXPECTED UH BUT UH ANY SHIFT FROM AIR TO SEA IS INSIGNIFICANT FOR SEA SORRY FOR SAYING SO YEAH ONE FREIGHTER HAS 100 HAS 100 KILOS AND UH UH 100 TONS AND UH WE ARE TALKING ABOUT I DON'T KNOW UH SIX EIGHT CONTAINERS UH SO IT'S A DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODEL YOU CAN'T COMPARE IT BUT WHAT WE SAW IS AND THAT IS A GOOD COMBINATION I MENTIONED IT IS THE AIR-SEA COMBINATION YEAH SO YEAH YOU GO INTO DUBAI VIA SEA AND THEN YOU GO INTO FINAL DISTRIBUTION EVEN TO SOUTH AMERICA VIA AIR AND THIS COMBINATION UH THIS SOLUTION UM IS IN IN LIGHT OF THE LACKING SUPPLY SIDE OF FREIGHTER CAPACITY ESPECIALLY IN CHINA UH GOT A LOT OF UH TAILWIND AND UH I MENTIONED THAT UH OUR VOLUMES HERE SPIKED UH MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE NORMAL VOLUME THAT WE SEE SO THIS COMBINATION SHOWED A CERTAIN UH PROGRESS AIR LOGISTICS UM I THINK I MENTIONED THAT DURING THE PRESENTATION WE EXPECT ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND SEMESTER THAT UH HIGHER YIELD WAS A VERY SPECIAL OR WAS WAS A RESULT OF A VERY SPECIAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND SITUATION IN QUARTER TWO AND THAT THE NORMALIZED YIELD OF 70 TO CHF85 PER HUNDRED KILO UH WILL COME IN OR WILL KICK IN UH AGAIN GRADUALLY NOT OVERNIGHT AND NOT UH ON A ON A FINGERTIP BUT UH GRADUALLY UM ROAD LOGISTICS UM I THINK UH OUR COMPS ARE UH WE WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT FIGURES IN THE MARKET AND NOT BEING ABLE TO PREDICT EVEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED OR DESCRIBED REALLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS UM UH I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO ALL ALL OF US HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH UH LET LET ME DESCRIBE A A SITUATION THAT WE EXPERIENCED IN EUROPE AND THEN I COME TO THE US UM EUROPE WE HAVE VOLUME REDUCTIONS OF 50 60% WITHIN WEEKS THIS HAPPENED IN THE FIRST ONE TWO THREE WEEKS IN APRIL BUT THEN THIS BOTTOMED OUT AND THE RECOVERY GRADUALLY STARTED ALREADY UH AS OF MAY SO THE FIGURE YOU SEE IS AN AVERAGE FIGURE UH AS OF MAY SO THE FIGURE YOU SEE IS AN AVERAGE FIGURE OF A VOLUME DEVELOPMENT THAT HAD A LOT OF UH SLUMPS AND SPIKES AND A LOT OF OF SHIFTS UH OVER THE LAST WEEK AT THE MOMENT I OR WE ALL BELIEVE THAT THE VOLUMES ARE GRADUALLY COMING BACK AND THEY STAY IT'S NOT A ONE-TIME SHOT AND IN THE US I THINK WE ARE STILL ON A VERY LOW LEVEL BUT AS I MENTIONED IT HAS BOTTOMED OUT SO LONG STORY SHORT IT WAS A DISASTER AND IT'S RECOVERING OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM SAM BLAND FROM JPMORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD UH AFTERNOON UH CAN I ASK I THINK THREE QUESTIONS PLEASE THE FIRST ONE IS ON THE UH SEAFREIGHT CONVERSION RATE THAT'S HELD UP UM PRETTY WELL BUT I GUESS THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH YOU KNOW THERE WASN'T ANY BENEFIT FROM ETOUCH IN THAT SEGMENT SO JUST BE INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW DID YOU DO ANY SORT OF COST SAVINGS PROGRAMS IN SEAFREIGHT OR WHAT WHAT HELPED THE UH CONVERSION RATE IN THE QUARTER UM SECOND QUESTION IS ON I THINK THERE WAS 57 MILLION OF UH EMPLOYEE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN THE QUARTER COULD YOU JUST TALK ABOUT ROUGHLY WHICH WHICH DIVISIONS THAT CAME IN WAS IT MOSTLY IN CONTRACT LOGISTICS UM AND COULD YOU SEE THAT SUPPORT BE WITHDRAWN UM BEFORE THE MARKET RECOVERED BACK UP TO NORMAL RATES SO THERE'S BASICALLY A LAG UM AND AND YOUR YOUR PROFITABILITY IS IMPACTED BY THAT UH AND THE LAST QUESTION WILL JUST BE AN UPDATE ON UM ON M&A PLANS OBVIOUSLY YOU PAID THE DIVIDEND IT SHOULD BE READ INTO THAT THAT UM ANY M&A AMBITIONS ARE A BIT A BIT LESS IN THE SHORT RUN OR OR YOU STILL GOT PLENTY OF TIME NOW TO LOOK AT THAT THANK YOU OKAY SAM UH BY THE WAY GUYS YOU CAN ALSO ASK LESS THAN THREE QUESTION IT'S NOT A STANDARD ROUTINE THAT YOU HAVE TO ASK THREE QUESTIONS ONLY AS UH AS UH AS ASSORTED TO YOU SO SEE UH WE HAVE COST SAVINGS IN PLACE AND THERE'S NO ETOUCH YET BECAUSE AS MENTIONED MANY TIMES THE PREREQUISITE IS THE FULLY DEPLOYED NEW TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CALLED SEALOG UH AS A BASIS FOR RUNNING SEA LOGIST- UH UH ETOUCH ACTIVITIES IN SEA LOGISTICS THE GOVERNMENT UH PROGRAMS THAT YOU ALLUDE TO UH 80 85% IS RELATED TO CONTRACT LOGISTICS BUT PEOPLE WERE OUT OF WORK SO AS UH VOLUMES ARE COMING BACK ALSO IN THE NORMAL OPERATION PEOPLE ARE IN EMPLOYMENT AND WE PAY THEM SO THAT'S NOT THE POINT WE AVOIDED TO LAY OFF PEOPLE WHICH IS BENEFICIAL FOR OUR STAFF AND ALSO FOR UH FOR THE GOVERNMENT UH RELATED TO THIS SO THE BUSINESS THE OPERATIONAL RUN RATE OF CONTRACT LOGISTICS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY STRONG ALTHOUGH RESTRUCTURING MEASURES SHOWED THE DESIRED EFFECTS AND WE WILL SEE IN THE SECOND SEMESTER WHEN THINGS ARE CLEANING UP MORE AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE QUARTER FOUR FIGURES HOW STRONG CONTRACT LOGISTICS WILL WILL PHOENIX LIKE COME BACK OUT OF UH ALL THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES AND YOUR QUESTION RELATED TO M&A AMBITION I'M A BIT SURPRISED BECAUSE OUR UM PROPOSAL DIVIDEND PROPOSAL HAS NOT CHANGED TO THE ONE THAT WE MADE PRIOR TO COVID-19 SO WHEN WE POSTED OUR ANNUAL RESULTS 2019 THERE WAS A DIVIDEND PROPOSAL OF CHF4 PER SHARE AND CAUTIOUS AS WE ARE WE POSTPONED A DECISION ON THIS AND DID NOT DECIDE ON A DIVIDEND GIVEN THE UNSECURITY AND PREDICTABILITY OF THE PANDEMIC AND NOW AS WE SEE THAT CASH FLOW IS STRONG AND WE WEATHERED THE SITUATION STRONGLY UH WE ARE WE ARE UH IN A SITUATION THAT UH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECIDED TO PROPOSE FOR THE UH GENER- UH TO PROPOSE THE SAME DIVIDEND AGAIN FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OUR M&A AMBITION AMBITION OUR M&A STRATEGY HAS NOT CHANGED AT ALL BUT PHYSICAL BEATINGS IN ASIA ARE RESTRICTED AT THE MOMENT SO WHATEVER WE DO IS BASED ON UH VIDEO CALLS OKAY UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MARK MCVICAR FROM BARCLAYS PLEASE GO AHEAD HELLO MARK MARK HELLO HELLO YOU WERE SHOCKED WHY I SAID LESS THAN THREE QUESTIONS MARK YEAH NO PLEASE GO AHEAD <LAUGH> <CROSSTALK> BUT BASED ON ON THAT I WANT TO GET OFF TO TWO QUESTIONS YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO HEAR OKAY WE- VERY GOOD <LAUGH> JUST JUST FOR VARIETY REALLY SO JUST JUST TO COME BACK ON UM ON THE AIRFREIGHT AND CAPACITY QUESTION COULD YOU GIVE US A SENSE FOR HOW MUCH OF YOUR AIRFREIGHT IN Q2 WENT IN FREIGHTERS RATHER THAN UH BELLY HOLD AND AND DO YOU SEE THAT CHANGING SIGNIFICANTLY IN CERTAINLY IN Q3 AND MAYBE EVEN INTO Q4 BECAUSE MY SENSE IS THAT YOU KNOW THE AIRLINES ARE BRINGING BACK Q4 BECAUSE MY SENSE IS THAT YOU KNOW THE AIRLINES ARE BRINGING BACK UH CAPACITY BUT MUCH MORE OF IT IS SHORT AND MEDIUM HAUL UM RATHER THAN THE LONG HAUL STUFF WHICH IS TYPICALLY WHAT YOU USE EXACTLY SO WHATEVER BELLY COMES BACK AT THE MOMENT UH IT'S SHORT AND MEDIUM HAUL AND THAT DOESN'T HELP US I MEAN UH USUALLY THAT IS NOT WHERE WE WHERE WE UH UH TRANSACT THE MAJORITY OF OUR BUSINESS YEAH SO I WOULD EXPECT IN THE SECOND SEMESTER UH 60 TO 70% OF ALL VOLUME TO BE TRANSPORTED WITH FREIGHTERS MAIN DECK CAPACITY YEAH AND UH BELLY WILL NOT RECOVER TOO SOON I WOULD SAY IT WILL TAKE MAYBE TWO YEARS UH THAT WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT UH NETWORK UH ACTIVITY WHICH ALLOWS FOR UH BELLY UH USING BELLY CAPACITY AGAIN YEAH UM- YEAH AND I AND I AND I SUPPOSED THAT- AND AND THAT IS THAT IS NOT YEAH GO AHEAD SORRY THE THE THE 60 TO 70% THAT YOU THINK IS GOING TO GO IN PHASES IN THE SECOND HALF WHEN COMPARED TO WHAT 90 95% IN Q2 BECAUSE THERE WAS SO LITTLE BELLY CAPACITY AROUND YEAH I I I'M NOT SURE SO THIS THIS IS NO SO- THE NO NO UH MARK I'M I'M NOT SURE END OF THIS YEAR WE WILL HAVE 60 TO 70% UH OF THE BELLY CAPACITY THAT SHOULD BE BACK OH OKAY BUT WE WILL STILL RELY WE WILL STILL RELY ON FREIGHTER CAPACITY TO A MAJOR MAJOR EXTENT AND THAT WILL GRADUALLY TRANSFORM OR OR CHANGE THROUGHOUT QUARTER THREE AND QUARTER FOUR SO WE ARE TALKING END OF THE YEAR WHILE THAT'S AT THE MO- AT THE MOMENT I THINK IT'S 90% IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN OR QUARTER EARLY QUARTER TWO MIDDLE OF QUARTER TWO THE MAJORITY ALMOST ALL IS FREIGHTER CAPACITY SO WE HAVE A LOT OF UM UH BELLY STILL IN NORTH AMERICA OR THE AMERICAS WHICH CAN BE USED UH AND WE USE PARTIALLY UH BELLY CAPACITY FOR PERISHABLES UH OUT OF UH AFRICAN COUNTRIES YEAH SO SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE GP NORMALIZING OR COMING BACK TOWARDS THE THE LONGER TERM RANGE THAT'S MUCH MORE THAN MIX BECAUSE I GUESS THE LIKE-FOR-LIKE GP FROM USING A FREIGHTER ISN'T GOING TO BE DIFFERENT IN AUGUST THAN IT WAS IN APRIL PARTICULARLY RIGHT ABSOLUTELY YEAH YEAH IT'S THE MIX CLEARLY YEAH OKAY AND AND THE THE THE SECOND QUESTION A STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE COULD YOU JUST REMIND US WHERE YOU STAND ON SORT OF CREDIT INSURANCE ON THE UM ON ON DEBT JUST HOW MUCH YOU USE IT THANKS MARK THAT I ALSO GOT A QUESTION ONCE SO UH VERY GOOD- YEY <LAUGH> NO CREDIT INSURANCE UH UH A VERY INTERESTING TOPIC RIGHT NOW UH AND WITHOUT UH DISCLOSING TOO MUCH DETAILS YOU KNOW THAT WE WORK WITH THE THE TWO MAIN CREDIT ISSUERS UH ON A GLOBAL BASIS THERE ARE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS GOING ON RIGHT NOW UM I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT INSURERS HAVE ALL THE SIMILAR PATTERNS OF OBVIOUSLY WHEN A WHEN A BUSINESS GOES WELL THERE'S A LOT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AVAILABLE WHEN BUSINESS GOES NOT SO WELL IT GOES DOWN VERY QUICKLY BUT WE ARE WE ARE HAVING A GOOD PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM AND UH AND WE TRY TO MANAGE AS MUCH UH COVERAGE AS POSSIBLE AS I SAID IN MY PRESENTATION UNTIL NOW NO SIGNIFICANT UH UH DEFAULTS OR FALL-OUTS OR UH BANKRUPTCIES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT HOWEVER THERE IS UH YOU KNOW THE HORIZON IS A BIT DARKER THAN WHAT IT USUALLY LOOKS LIKE SO THERE'S A LOT OF CAUTION AS GOING FORWARD UM HOW MUCH WE PAY YOU CAN SEE THAT OF THE OF THE ANNUAL UH REPORT WE PAY EVERY YEAR AROUND 3.5 MILLION TO 4 MILLION ON INSURANCE PREMIUM UH I THINK THAT IS GIVEN OUR SALES LEDGER OF UH MORE THAN 3 BILLION A REASONABLE NUMBER WHEN YOU UH UH ASSUME THAT AROUND 70% OF THAT IS BEING UH COVERED YEAH AND AND BUT BUT BROADLY AS YOU GO INTO THE SECOND HALF YOUR LEVEL OF COVER IS UNCHANGED YEAH MM OUR LEVEL OF COVER IS UH ON A TOTAL NUMBER PROBABLY UNCHANGED UH WHEN YOU LOOK INTO SOME OF THE INDUSTRIES UH IT MAY VARY LIKE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE REDUCED A LITTLE BIT SOME INDUSTRIES WILL BE INCREASED BUT OVERALL THE RATES PROFILE IS SHIFTING WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES BUT OVERALL REMAINS VERY STABLE OKAY LOVELY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH YEAH YOU'RE WELCOME THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM GLYNN NEIL FROM CREDIT SUISSE PLEASE GO AHEAD UM HELLO UM SO NEI- NEIL FROM CREDIT SUISSE HI UH IF I CAN ASK FIRST THE UH UH ANOTHER QUESTION OF MARKUS IF UH- AH IF THAT WORKS UH TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY <LAUGH> MARKUS IF UH- AH TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY <LAUGH> YEAH THANKS NEIL MUCH APPRECIATED YEAH MY PLEASURE AND AND THEN I'LL HAVE ONE FOR DETLEF TOO IF I MAY AH UM KEEP KEEP IT TO TWO SO SO THE FIRST ONE MARKUS YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY UM SPENT SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT WORKING CAPITAL AND INCREASING RISK TO SOME OF YOUR SME CUSTOMERS JUST WONDERING UH AS IT PERTAINS TO SEAFREIGHT UH AND THE NEGATIVE MIX EFFECT ON GP PER TEU UH AS YOU PLAN BEYOND 2020 DO YOU PLAN FOR A SMALLER PROPORTION OF SMES RELATIVE TO NORMAL OR HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND UH AS IT RELATES TO GP PER TEU OVER THE MEDIUM TERM UM AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION AND I GUESS IT COULD BE FOR EITHER OF YOU JUST FOLLOWING ON FROM THE AIRLOG COMMENTS ON HOW IT'S EVOLVING AND OBVIOUSLY SEALOG IS TO COME HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO YOUR M&A AMBITIONS THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY OUTLINED UH TO AN EXTENT OF THE FULL YEAR I GUESS ON ONE HAND OPTIMIZATION OF THOSE TWO TMSS MIGHT BE IDEAL BEFORE ANY MAJOR TRANSACTION BUT IS THAT THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT IT OR OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL ULTIMATELY TAKE CARE OF ITSELF IF YOU FIND THE RIGHT DEAL IN ADVANCE OKAY MAYBE NEIL I'LL TAKE THE LATTER QUESTION IF YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND UM FIRST OF ALL WE CONCENTRATE ON OUR OWN BUSINESS AND OPTIMIZING OUR OWN BUSINESS BASED ON AIRLOG AND FOLLOWED BY SEALOG UH AND THE ETOUCH ABILITY OF THAT BUSINESS UH MAKE ETOUCH HAPPEN AND AND WE MAKE PROGRESS HERE WE'RE UH IN IN AIRLOG LOGISTICS AS WE AS WE HAVE UH PRONOUNCED UM M&A IS INDEPENDENT OF THIS THIS NEEDS CULTURAL FIT WE ARE LOOKING FOR ACCESS TO CERTAIN ASIAN CUSTOMERS UH A SOLUTIONING THAT IS NOT YET PART OF OUR OWN SOLUTIONING MAYBE SO THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER CRITERIA AND YES UH IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO TRANSFER A ACQUISITION DIRECTLY ON SEALOG TO TO NAME THIS THEN ON OUR CURRENT LEGACY SYSTEM BUT IF THAT WOULD BE NEEDED WE CAN DO SO AS WELL I MEAN WE HAVE PROVEN THAT THIS IS NOT A BIG EXERCISE FOR US UH SO THAT IS NOT A CRITERIA THAT WOULD INFLUENCE OUR M&A APPROACH OR UH DELAY ANY M&A IT'S MORE UM GETTING ACQUAINTED TO THOSE HA- I MEAN UH UH TARGETS AND ALSO BUILDING UP A BASIS OF TRUST AND THAT NEEDS PHYSICAL PERSONAL MEETINGS AND YOU CAN'T DO THIS VIA VIA VIA VIDEO CALLS WE ALSO WE ALWAYS SAID WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THIS BECAUSE THERE WERE RUMORS IN THE MARKET WE ALWAYS SAID IT'S A TWO YEARS EXERCISE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT UH BUT WE MAKE PROGRESS WE NEVER STOPPED WE DIDN'T CHANGE APPROACH SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I'M QUITE CONFIDENT THAT EVENTUALLY UH WE WILL BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE THE RIGHT OR THE RIGHT ACQUISITIONS UM SO NEIL THEN UH ON THE FIRST QUESTION I I THINK IT'S INTERESTING ANGLE THAT YOU COME FROM ON THE WORKING CAPITAL AND THE RISK PROFILE TO THE SME UH I I THINK WE SEE NOW THE SMES VOLUMES COMING DOWN IN THE DIFF- IN THE SECOND QUARTER JUST FOR A SIMPLE REASON BECAUSE MOST OF THE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN UH DUE TO THE CURFEWS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN JUST SHUT UH UH UH THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY REOPEN AGAIN SO I THINK UH WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IN SEAFREIGHT IS THAT TEMPORARILY THERE IS GOING TO BE UM A A SHIFT IN MIX AWAY FROM THE SME BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S IT'S EVEN GOING TO BE A BIGGER PORTION YOU KNOW UH WE HAVE AN EXTREMELY WHE- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AT THE MARKET SHARE IT'S A VERY SMALL MARKET SHARE WE COVER RIGHT NOW SO UH IT'S IT'S AN ABSOLUTE ATTRACTIVE AND WE'RE TOTALLY COMMITTED AS YOU KNOW IN OUR CUSTOMER BASE TO THE SME CUSTOMER THE THIS IS THIS IS OUR BACKBONE OF OUR OPERATION RIGHT UM UH UH THERE IS STILL A A MASSIVE POTENTIAL TO GROW IN A IN IN THE IN A VERY PROFITABLE MARKET IN THE SME SO UM HOW THE MARGIN IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE UH UH I I THINK ALSO HERE THERE IS A TIME THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT FOR THE NORMALIZATION BUT THERE THERE IS NO SYSTEMIC UH STRUCTURAL REASON WHY THE MARGIN FOR SME SHOULD HAVE UH UH SHOULD UH SHOULD BE LOWER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST SO I THINK UH UH RIGHTFULLY SO UH UH OUR OUR BACKBONE SME CUSTOMER BASE WE WILL EVEN GET A BIGGER PORTION OF THAT AND THE PROFITABILITY IS GOING TO BE RUN EXACTLY IF NOT ABOVE THE LEVEL THAT WE HAD UNTIL NOW UNDERSTOOD MANY THANKS BOTH OF YOU THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM FRANS HOYER FROM HANDELSBANKEN PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON UM ALSO A QUESTION REGARDING UH THE MIX SHIFT IN SEA TOWARDS SME UM COULD YOU COULD YOU TRY AND UM DESCRIBE HOW MUCH OF A SHIFT IN THE MIX YOU SAW AND WHAT WAS THE EFFECT ON THE YIELD THAT YOU SAW IN THE SEA BUSINESS I THINK THOSE DETAILS WE WILL NOT DISCLOSE UH BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE SMB SME BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN THE MAJORITY OF THE SMB SME BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEIR OPERATIONS THEIR BUSINESS MODELS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AT LEAST FOR FOUR SIX WEEKS AND THAT HAS CAUSED THE REDUCTION SO UM BUT WE SEE THEM GRADUALLY COMING BACK BUT AS MARKUS SAID BEFORE SOME OF THEM DO NOT COME BACK AT ALL BECAUSE THEIR BASIS THEIR THEIR THEIR FINANCIAL SAVVINESS IS NOT GIVEN YEAH UH AND SME IS EVERYTHING BE CAREFUL NOW IT'S UH IT'S ALSO VERY NICHE PRODUCTS UH THAT HAS NOT SEEN AN INCREASE IN DEMAND AT THE MOMENT YEAH WHETHER YOU HAVE HAND PAINTED TILES UH THAT ARE PRODUCED IN NORTHERN ITALY AND THE DEMAND IS COMING BACK NOW IN DENMARK FOR EXAMPLE IT'S A RATHER QUESTIONABLE FRONT AND AND THAT IS MAYBE HOW YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT MM BUT EVENTUALLY THAT WILL COME BACK AND OUR BUSINESS IS AND WE ARE STRONG IN SME BUSINESS OUR BUSINESS IS UH SKEWED UH TOWARDS SMES SO THAT GIVES YOU A BIT OF A FLAVOR IT IT'S A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND NOT OF A UM HOW SHOULD I SAY CONSCIOUS MIX DECISION NO I UNDERSTAND OKAY AND THE SECOND QUESTION FINAL QUESTION IS AROUND THE M&A MARKET AND WHETHER UH THE TROUB- I MEAN YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE WINNING MARKET GAINING MARKET SHARES AND THOSE THAT ARE LOSING IT ARE TYPICALLY THE SMALL OR MID-SIZED UH UM COMPETITORS UH THAT ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES ON THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT CONNECTIVITY AND SO ON AND AND YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT THE UM CREDIT RISKS UH ESCALATING SO THERE MIGHT BE AN AN UPTICK IN THE M&A OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU SEE UH MAYBE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT YEAH WE MONITOR THE MARKET FOR MANY YEARS AND UH WE ARE WE ARE ACTIVE IN THE MARKET AND AS YOU KNOW BUT NOT EVERYTHING THAT LOOKS SHINY IS OF INTEREST FOR US AND AND THAT MAYBE WE WE TO FULFILL OUR STRATEGIC TARGETS AND TO CONTINUE OUR GROWTH PATHS THAT WE HAVE EMBARKED ON MANY YEARS AGO UH WE DON'T NEED M&A WHAT WE WE HAVE DEFINED TARGETS WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE WITH AN M&A APPROACH AND IF WE FIND TARGETS THAT ARE UM FULFILLING THOSE UH REQUIREMENTS WE WILL BE ACTI- WE WILL BECOME ACTIVE AND IF NOT WE DON'T SO AND FOR US THE MARKET HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED AT THE MOMENT UH AND WE NEVER UH LOOKED AT WE ALWAYS LOOKED AT TARGETS UH ALSO IN THE PAST THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR WITH THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IN THEIR GEOGRAPHY GEOGRAPHY OR IN THEIR SOLUTIONING UH WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A RESTRUCTURING CASE THAT'S NOT OUR BUSINESS NOW OKAY UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANKS FRANS THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM CHRISTIAN OBST FROM BAADER BANK PLEASE GO AHEAD UM YES HELLO I HAVE SOME SMALL TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ONE IS UH CONCERNING THE DECISION CONCERNING CAPEX OR LONG-TERM LEASES SO WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION OF RIGHT OF UH DEPRECIATION OF RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS FROM TWO HUNDRED UH THIRTY-SEVEN TO TWO HUNDRED FIF- UH FIFTY-FOUR UH MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER UH THIS YEAR AND UH SO WHAT IS THE THE THE TRIGGER FOR A DECISION GOING FOR CAPEX OR FOR LONG-TERM LEASES AND HOW IS THE CURRENT MARKET FOR LONG-TERM LEASES UH DEVELOPING ALSO WHAT IS THE MAIN TRIGGER FOR ANY DECISION IN EITHER WAY SECOND ONE IS UH YOU ARE TALKING AND OF COURSE THERE IS DSO PRESSURE UH ARE YOU CURRENTLY SUPPORTING SOME OF YOUR CUSTOMERS UH SO FOR LONGER PAYMENT TERMS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO KEEP THEM INTO YOUR NETWORK AND THE LAST ONE IS UH CAN YOU GIVE US A GUIDANCE FOR ANY KIND OF INCOME FROM DISPOSALS IN THE SECOND HALF THANK YOU UH WELL CHRISTIAN RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS UH I I I THINK YOUR QUESTION HAS UH TWO ANSWERS THE FIRST ONE IS UH WHAT IS THE DECISION MAKING UH REASONS TO IT AND THE SECOND ONE IS WHAT IS UH THE INCREASE UH IN THE SECOND QUARTER UH THERE ARE THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT REASONS TO THAT UH THE MAYBE THE MORE TECHNICAL FIRST YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE UH THE ASSET HELD FOR SALE RELATED TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE BUSINESS IN THE UK WHICH ALSO INCLUDES RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND AS PER THE IFRS STANDARDS YOU HAVE TO STOP DEPRECIATIONS UH UH AT THE POINT OF SIGNING AND THEN UH KEEP THAT FROZEN IF YOU LIKE UNTIL UH THE POINT OF CLOSING THAT IS THE THAT IS THE SIMPLE REASON WHY YOU HAVE THE VARIANCES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND CONTINUE TO HAVE UNTIL CLOSING HAS BEEN UH UH HAS BEEN EXECUTED SO THAT IS THE TECHNICAL PART THEN THE THE QUESTION AROUND UH UH WHAT MAKES US UH DECIDING INTO ONE OR THE OTHER BRAND UH UH WHAT MAKES US UH DECIDING INTO ONE OR THE OTHER PAYS UM MAIN UH MAIN AND MOST IMPORTANT PIECE TO IT IS UH IS THAT BECAUSE WE TALK MOST OF IT OF LOCATIONS RIGHT OF UH OF CONTRACT LOGISTICS FACILITIES RIGHT MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> SO WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE PERSPECTIVE OF THAT CONTRACT LOGISTICS FACILITY IS THAT A FACILITY THAT IS AN OPERATIONAL OPTIMAL POSITION THEN UH THEN OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO KEEP OUR FLEXIBILITY MOST OF THE TIME BACK TO BACK WITH CUSTOMERS WHERE WE SAY WE HAVE A FIVE OR I DON'T KNOW A 10 YEARS CUSTOMER CONTRACT UH YOU KNOW I'M JUST MAKING AN EXAMPLE AND WE MATCH THAT WITH OUR LEASE COMMITMENTS IT'S FLEXIBILITY THAT IS THAT IS UH THAT IS DRIVING OUR ASSET LIFE BUSINESS MODEL RIGHT SO UH IF YOU ASK US YOU KNOW THEN UH EACH ANSWER IS GOING TO BE THE MORE FLEXIBLE THE BETTER WE ONLY MAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS WHERE LO- WHERE LOCATIONS DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED QUALITY OF FACILITY I GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE A FEW YEARS BACK WE WERE INVESTING INTO A PHARMA HUB IN SINGAPORE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SUCH PHARMA UH UH SPACE AVAILABLE RIGHT SO WITH A COUPLE OF UPS AND DOWNS UH YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IT UH IT IT IT BECAME A VERY UH A VERY GOOD DECISION YOU KNOW AT THE IN THE IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES TO HAVE THAT SPACE AVAILABLE SO BUT UH THIS IS REALLY THE EXCEPTION WHERE THERE IS A GOOD REASON WHY TO INVEST OUR OWN MONEY IN IN IN ALL THE OTHER CASES UH UH A LEASE UH UH AGREEMENT BACK TO BACK WITH THE CUSTOMER WILL BE PREFERABLE DSO SECOND QUESTION DSO WE NEVER SELL ON PAYMENT TERMS WE DON'T THIS IS IRRESPECTIVELY OF ANY UH PRESSURE DEMAND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE SELL BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY GOOD SERVICE WE ARE FULLY OPERATIONAL WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET WE ARE NOT WE ARE NOT SELLING ON TERMS OKAY THAT'S CLEAR AND THE LAST ONE I DIDN'T WRITE DOWN THE LAST ONE CAN YOU- <CROSSTALK> INCOME FROM DISPOSALS YEAH OH INCOME FROM DISPOSALS IN THE FIRST HALF NO IN THE SECOND HALF OH SECOND HALF IN THE SECOND HALF UH IT UH IT WILL BE UH WE HAVE A SECOND UM UM WE HAVE ALL THE EFFE- UH A SECOND REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO IS OUT FOR SALE I DO NOT EXPECT MATERIAL UH UH IMPACT ON THE P&L OUT OF THAT SO IT'S GOING TO BE LESS THAN 10 MILLION OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MUNEEBA KAYANI FROM BANK OF AMERICA PLEASE GO AHEAD HI UM OKAY IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO UH QUANTIFY THE BENEFIT FROM YOUR PERISHABLES IN AIR UH GP INTO TEU AS WELL AS THE UH IMPACT ON VOLUMES FROM LOWER PERISHABLES AND SO AS THAT NORMALIZES HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IT IN IN 3Q AND AND THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR UM AND THEN SECONDLY WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN FROM THE DIGITAL FORWARDERS UH UH DURING THE COVID CRISIS AND HAVE YOU SEEN A HIGHER OR LOWER PRESENCE FROM THEM DURING THE CRISIS <CROSSTALK> OKAY LET ME LET ME ANSWER YOUR QUESTION <LAUGH> OKAY OKAY UH THE THE THE LATTER QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHAT DIGITAL FORWARDERS ARE UH BUT UH I WOULD BELIEVE OUR DIGITAL SOLUTIONS GOT A LOT OF PICKUP UH DURING THE CRISIS WE HAVE NOT SEEN MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS IN GENERAL BEING ACTIVE OR AGGRESSIVE IN THE MARKET I WOULD SAY A HANDFUL HAVE BEEN THE REST SOMEHOW DISAPPEARED AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING SO UM I WILL NOT UH NAME ANY AND I WILL NOT UH GIVE ANY COMMENTS ON ON SINGLE FORWARDERS UM THE QUANTIFICATION OF THE BENEFITS FROM PERISHABLES FIRST OF ALL PERISHABLE IS A A LOW UH LOW MARGIN UH BUSINESS AND WE HAD UH LESS PERISHABLES UH UH ONE THIRD LESS APPROXIMATELY VOLUME ONE THIRD LESS PERISHABLES IN THE FIRST SEMESTER THAT LED TO THE CARGO MIX TO A HIGHER YIELD INDEPENDENT ON WHETHER CHARTER WAS AVAILABLE OR REQUIRED OR THE RATES SPIKED OR NOT UM WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PERISHABLE VOLUME COMES BACK GRADUALLY IN THE SECOND SEMESTER AND THERE'S THUS THE MIX WOULD REINSTATE UM WITH A LOWER YIELD SO THE 70 TO 85 UH SWISS FRANCS PER HUNDRED KILO UH WILL BECOME UH UH A REALITY ALSO ALL UH BECAUSE OF THE CARGO MIX IT WAS ONE THIRD OF OUR TOTAL VOLUME BEING BEING UH PERISHABLE I HOPE THAT HELPS I HOPE THAT HELPS THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME THE LAST QUESTION COMES FROM SEBASTIAN VOGEL FROM UBS PLEASE GO AHEAD HELLO I GOT TWO QUESTIONS UH THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE ON A CONTRACT LOGISTICS YOU MENTIONED THERE YOUR COST UH EXPENSES CAME DOWN QUITE A FAIR BIT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU CAN ADD MORE GRANULARITY HOW THE DIFFERENT COST ITEMS I.E PERSONAL COSTS AND THE OTHER ONE SG&A HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DEVELOPMENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND UM UH THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IF I CALCULATED CORRECTLY YOUR CONVERSION RATIO IN PARTICULAR IN ASIA WAS QUITE HIGH IN THE SECOND QUARTER UH IS THAT MAINLY A FUNCTION OF THE TRANSPORT MODE EXPOSURE OF THAT REGION SO SEBASTIAN FIRST OF ALL UH WE DON'T LOOK AT CONVERSION RATES PER REGION BECAUSE UH IT DEPENDS ON THE TERMS OUR CUSTOMERS APPLY ON WHERE TO UH YOU KNOW INVOICE AND AND PAY UH TRANSPORT BILLS UH SO IT'S SKEWED BE CAREFUL UM WE HAVE A WE HAVE A UH PROFIT SHARING MODELS OR THAT IS WITHIN OR INTERNALLY BETWEEN REGIONS SO THAT WILL NOT REALLY HELP UM CONVERSION RATE FOR SURE IS INFLUENCED BY UH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DIFFERENT BUSINESS UNITS AND YES IN QUARTER TWO UH AIRFREIGHT OR AIR LOGISTICS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL UM THE UH AND THE QUESTION ON CONTRACT LOGISTICS AND COST DEVELOPMENT THE MAJORITY OF THE COST IS PEOPLE COLLEAGUES AND UH THE SECOND COST FACTOR IS LEASE I GAVE AN ANSWER ON THE LEASE ALREADY BECAUSE UH 50% OR A BIT MORE OF OUR UH CONTRACTS ARE ALL BACK TO BACK UH DEDICATED WITH SINGLE CUSTOMER SO THE FIXED COST COVERAGE IS USUALLY PART OF OUR CONTRACTS UH SO THAT IS NOT AN EXPOSURE AND THE REST IS UH CAPACITY AND WE BREEZED UM WITH THE VOLUME VERY WELL YES WE DID NOT HAVE A MASS LAYOFF AND WE STATED SO MANY TIMES IT'S NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE SAID THIS WOULD BE AN A SITUATION THAT WOULD THAT IS LIMITED BY TIME YOU KNOW UH IT WOULD NOT UH END UP IN A IN A PERMANENT SITUATION AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE SEE MANY OF THE OPERATIONS ARE BACK I MENTIONED THAT ONLY 12 OPERATIONS OUT OF MORE THAN 600 CONTRACT LOGISTICS SITES ARE STILL LOCKED DOWN AND 11 OUT OF THEM ARE IN ONE COUNTRY BECAUSE SOME INFRASTRUCTURES HAVE NOT OPENED YET AND THE REST IS FULLY OPERATIONAL OR HAS STARTED TO BECOME OPERATIONAL AGAIN UH MAYBE NOT A THREE-SHIFT OPERATION OR WEEKEND SHIFTS UH BUT IF YOU LOOK INTO CHINA AND CHINA IS MAYBE A UM WE CAN LEARN FROM CHINA OR ASIA BECAUSE THEY WENT THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC VERY EARLY AND AND GRADUALLY UH WE HAVE FULL EMPLOYMENT IN OUR OPERATIONS IN CHINA UH WE HAVE UH ADDITIONAL SHIFTS INTRODUCED IN OUR LINE FEEDING AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION LINE UH SERVICES SPARE PARTS SERVICES AND WE SEE UH INCREASING AND STRONG DEMAND FOR A LOT OF GOODS UH OUT OF CHINA AND UH THEREFORE UH WE SEE THAT A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS UH START PICKING UP IN VOLUME AGAIN IS IS THIS VTWO OR WHATEVER UH LET'S UH FORGET IT UH BUT IT'S NOT AS FAST AS WE THOUGHT BUT THE SLUMP WAS NOT AS UH SEVERE AS WE ANTICIPATED BEFORE BUT SO I HOPE THAT HELPS TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT'S UM PERSONAL COST IS THE MAIN FACTOR AND WE ARE ALMOST IN FULL EMPLOYMENT AGAIN IN CONTRACT LOGISTICS THAT MEANS WE HAVE GROSS PROFIT RELATED TO THAT ACTIVITY AND UH THE REST IS LEASE COST AND UH OUR IDLE CAPACITY HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY UH WE ARE BELOW 3% IN IDLE CAPACITY THAT'S UH A A LEADING INDICATOR IN OUR INDUSTRY PERFECT THANK YOU SEBASTIAN GENTLEMEN THAT WAS THE LAST QUESTION THANK YOU SANDRA LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LOGISTICS IS PEOPLE BUSINESS AND WE ARE PROUD OF OUR PEOPLE THEY HAVE MANAGED THIS CRISIS EXTREMELY WELL UH AND WE ARE UH HONORED BY OUR CUSTOMERS THEIR LOYALTY AND THEIR UH BUSINESS THAT THEY AWARDED TO US DURING THE LAST ESPECIALLY LAST QUARTER UM WE WILL SEE HOW WE PROGRESS OVER THE NEXT QUARTER QUARTER THREE AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU UH AGAIN UH MIDDLE OF OCTOBER AND IN THE MEANTIME STAY HEALTHY UH DON'T TRAVEL TOO MUCH UH DON'T UH FORGET TO USE MASKS BECAUSE WE NEED YOU AS END CONSUMERS LIKE MILLIONS AND TRI- UH BILLIONS OF OTHERS BECAUSE END CONSUMERS DRIVE OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND WE WANT TO SEE A STRONG QUARTER THREE UM WHEN WE TALK NEXT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TALK TO YOU AGAIN SOON HAVE A NICE SUMMER BYE-BYE AND TALK TO YOU AGAIN SOON HAVE A NICE SUMMER BYE-BYE LADIES AND

You can register for questions at any time by pressing star and one on your telephone. For operator assistance, please press star and zero. The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAND OVER TO DR. DETLEV DREFTSCHER, CEO OF KUNER NAGLE. PLEASE GO AHEAD, SIR THANK YOU, SANDERA. GOOD MORNING, GOOD AFTERNOON, AND GOOD EVENING TO ALL OF YOU AND WELCOME TO THE ANALYST CONFERENCE ON THE SEMI-ANNUAL HALF YEAR TWENTY TWENTY RESULTS OF KUNER NAGLE INTERNATIONAL AG. OUR CEO, MARCUS BLANKA, AND I WELCOME YOU FROM SANNY, SWITZERLAND. WE PUBLISHED OUR HALF YEAR Respective slide deck earlier today, and as always, let's get started on slide three. Over the first year, over the first half of the year, the Kuen Nagel Group successfully managed to deliver excellent service for customers in the face of unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This started with the very abrupt halt to Chinese exports in February, followed by lockdowns in March. AND A DELIBERATE PACE OF DAY TO DAY RECOVERY THANKS TO OUR DEDICATED COLLEAGUES AND A SEAMLESS TRANSITION OF APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND STAFF TO HOME OFFICE IN A MATTER OF DAYS OUR CUSTOMERS FACED NO DEGRADATION OF SERVICE QUALITY DESPITE EXTRAORDINARY VOLATILITY AND DEMAND FOR ESSENTIAL GOODS THIS CULMINATED IN SUBSTANTIAL MARKET SHARE GAINS ACROSS ALL TRANSACTIONAL BUSINESS UNITS FROM A HOME OFFICE From a financial perspective, the group's performance in Q2 is a testament to our flexible asset-light business model and our efforts to optimally variabilize a meaningful portion of our short-term fixed costs. And looking at those four key figures that are in front of you, you will see that the net turnover decreased by seven point five percent heavily impacted by an effect of five point nine percent versus previous year gross profit. The EBIT went down by nine point one percent and the ebit by eighteen percent down to four hundred nineteen million Swiss francs in the first half of twenty twenty earnings per share landed at two point five eight Swiss francs per share. Please follow me on the next slide slide four with a couple of details on the group and the business units group earnings for the period of the first six months. We were at 399 million Swiss francs and we generated a strong free cash flow of 398 million Swiss francs. Looking at the four business units, let's start with sea logistics. We have seen an EBIT of one hundred sixty-seven million Swiss francs which were twenty-eight percent below previous year as a result of a shifting cargo mix, less S&E volumes, and a positive reefer and pharma development. Also, the demand for rail solutions, especially in China, started to pick up strongly as of June last quarter. Air logistics, an e-bid of one hundred eighty-one million Swiss francs has been achieved, which is four percent higher than the previous year based on a high demand for crisis goods but also a demand for special solutions such as sea and air volumes which more than tripled. Quarter two twenty twenty road logistics ended the first semester with an ebit of twenty six million Swiss francs all networks were maintained and europe now is slowly recovering while the americas are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic and contract logistics ended the first semester with an ebit of forty five million Swiss francs twenty one percent below previous year seeing an ebit of forty five million Swiss francs twenty one percent below previous year seeing an ebit of forty five million Swiss francs twenty one percent below previous year seeing an ebit of forty five million Swiss francs twenty one percent below previous year seeing an ebit of forty five million Swiss francs twenty one percent below previous year seeing an ebit of forty five million Swiss francs twenty one percent below previous year seeing an ebit of forty five million Swiss francs twenty one percent below previous year seeing an ebit of forty five million Swiss The high demand of essential goods and answering the gross profit decline with strict cost management almost matching the gross profit development on slide six we will discuss briefly the volume development in sea logistics and air logistics. Please let me start with sea logistics first. We have a pronounced effort in sea logistics especially on maintaining the high demand of essential goods and answering the gross profit decline with strict cost management. Almost matching the gross profit development on slide six we will discuss briefly the volume development in sea logistics and air logistics. Please let me start with sea logistics first. We have a pronounced effort in sea logistics especially on maintaining the high demand of essential goods and answering the gross profit decline with strict cost management. Almost matching the gross profit development on slide six we will discuss briefly the volume development in sea logistics and air logistics. Please let me start with sea logistics Maintaining our own networks in sea logistics, especially in maintaining our own network capacity which yields significant market share gains across all segments, but especially in farmer and reefer and the e-commerce segment. The cargo mix I mentioned before showed a significantly lower SEM volume and this is a higher yielding as we have mentioned in some of our previous calls. The market demand. As continuously recovering over the course of quarter two but it's still below previous year. Let me give you some hints on how market, sorry, how our volume developed months by months in quarter two. We saw April was a fifteen percent, one five percent volume decrease but gaining market share ended our volumes in May by only minus twelve percent and the June volumes already showed a minus eight percent. The volume decrease so gradually that we see volumes picking up again, but still lower than the previous year. In total, we shipped two hundred and seventeen thousand tonnes less in our networks, which resulted in an eleven point seven percent reduction in quarter two and a nine point one percent reduction in volumes for the first semester twenty twenty for sea logistics. Air logistics saw a significantly lower demand for dry cargo and perishables and both are lower yielding as you know. A strong demand for essential goods which were higher yielding and mainly produced or operated in a charter or via a charter business because the recovery of belly is not expected to see or show significant effects before quarter. FOR THIS YEAR A SOARING DEMAND FOR SEA AND AIR SOLUTIONS AND ALSO A MONTHLY DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS RATHER STABLE BY MINUS TWENTY THREE TO MINUS TWENTY PERCENT APRIL TO JUNE IN TOTAL THE FIRST SEMESTER A REDUCTION IN VOLUME OF MINUS FIFTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT HOW DOES THIS TRANSLATE NOW INTO THE UNIT PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS UNITS AND PLEASE Follow me on slide seven first, see logistics. Mentioned this already two times. Now for the third time, carbon mixes lower sme volumes, volume gains in farma e-commerce and reverse. And a stable margin development per unit in constant currency. On the next slide, slide eight, you see the details of the development. The gross profit mix is the driver of the unit profitability. And was an x effect of a currency effect. Six percent, minus six percent on the unit basis you have or you see a constant development or a constant margin per toy per tu in quarter two this year all cost measures were in tact and including the tailwind from fx or from currency we saw a reduction in the cost level per unit as well. The ebit per tu is well below our normal ebit per tu, but this includes also headwind from currency of six percent. So in total, we are at the lower end of the range that we usually pursue the eighty to a hundred swiss francs tu ebit per tu but it's recovering and we also see some seasonal effects kicking in. We are very Focusing, especially in sea logistics, on excellent customer service and we have one significant business which already related or resulted in less volume reductions than one might have expected from the market development. And quarter two has been stronger and improving month by month with regards to both volume margin and profitability. Air logistics the general cargo volume declined significantly. I will comment on this on the next slide and the demand for higher yielding crisis goods has soared. The market demand has been much weaker in quarter two as anticipated. We have to say the regular dry cargo or the general cargo that we transport, especially in the belly capacity has been down by minus forty to minus fifty percent. AND THIS HAS BEEN OFFSET BY CRISIS VOLUMES ESSENTIAL GOODS BUT NOT ONLY CRISIS VOLUMES ESSENTIAL GOODS BUT NOT ONLY P I E BUT ALSO PACKAGED FOOD PACKAGED FOOD AS WELL AS E COMMERCE VOLUMES WENT INTO THAT SEGMENT PERISHABLES WERE DOWN IN APRIL AND MAY BUT A RECOVERY STARTED ALREADY IN JUNE AND WE ALSO SEE HARDBOUNDS OR GENERAL CARGO COMINGS BACK STEP BY STEP AS OF JUNE THIS YEAR WE HAD A SPIKE IN CHARTER BUSINESS WHILE BALLEY WAS NOT EXISTING WHICH LED TO UNIT FIGURES THAT ARE SKEWED BY A DIFFERENT WAY OF PRODUCING AIR LOGISTICS AND OUR UNIT YEARS, AS YOU CAN SEE, IS CLEARLY ABOVE OUR NORMAL RANGE OF SEVENTY TO EIGHTY FIVE SWISS FRANCS PER HUNDRED KILOMETER I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're trying to say. Could you please rephrase that more clearly? We have seen efficiency kicking in into that segment. Slide 11, a short overview on road logistics. Europe is slowly recovering while the volumes in America stay at a low and very low level at the moment. This is true for both intermodal as well as truck brokerage. We have seen slide twelve now. We have seen a fast and massive deterioration. The reduction of volumes in Europe at the start of quarter two and I think we mentioned that when we when we had our quarter one analyst call with you and the order of the order of magnitude has been higher than fifty percent volume reductions but that was true for two three weeks only and we see a steady volume recovery step by step especially in domestic transports in Europe at the moment. I followed with a sharp volume decline end of April and especially intermodal more or less collapsed. And we see a steady recovery in June since June in Europe and a stabilization stabilization on a low level in the US at the moment. International and cross-border which is the higher yielding business those transports are still lagging but also here we see volumes coming back. ALL OUR NETWORKS HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED AND WE ARE READY TO DEAL WITH THE CARGO KICKING IN AND IN SOME MARKETS I WILL NOT SAY THE GEOGRAPHY WE HAVE EVEN HAD TO REJECT CERTAIN VOLUMES BECAUSE OUR NETWORKS WERE FILLED AGAIN IN JUNE THAT'S TRUE FOR DOMESTIC TRANSPORTS WE SAW A VERY STRONG GROWTH IN BOOKINGS ON OUR DIGITAL ROAD PLATFORM The platform called etrade now and we have been able to roll this out even in a virtual environment over the last couple of months in many Asian countries and we see the volume soaring in on that platform at the moment while etrade was 42% below previous year we generated a positive etrade of 26 million Swiss francs and in our hour. In the best case scenario, we would not have expected a positive quarter two in logistics given the character of our networks. So we are very proud of what has been achieved here, countering volume reductions with cost measures. Slide thirteen, contract logistics. And I have to say, contract logistics showed high resilience and it showed two faces. This ugly phase, if I may say so, was industries that clearly were downtrading, automotive and industrial, to name two. And we had complete shutdowns by customers and sometimes by governments in those industries for two, three, four, six up to eight weeks and some of the volumes have not recovered even to a sizable level. LEVEL AGAIN THAN PRIOR TO THE CRISIS AND THERE WAS A COUPLE OF NICE FACES THAT WE SAW OVER UPTRADING INDUSTRIES THE FARMER AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY UPTRADING INDUSTRIES THE FARMER AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY THE INDUSTRY FOR ESSENTIAL GOODS WHICH IS PACKAGED FOOD AND FOOD AND CONSUMABLES AND ALSO E-COMMERCE AND HERE THE VOLUMES WERE WELL ABOVE SEASONAL PEAKS AND WE HAD EXTRA SHIFTS THAT WE HAD TO INTRODUCE Especially on the weekends to cope with the soaring and spiking demand ninety percent or up to eighty five to ninety percent of our sites remained open throughout the whole crisis and currently we only have twelve sites that are still closed out of more than six hundred sites globally so we see a clear confirmation that fifty percent of our solution portfolio is related to Essential goods and this demand has never stopped or has never been reduced. Some details on the contract logistics business unit on slide fourteen the implementation of the COVID nineteen sops or operating procedures across all operations were introduced but they also added a lot of costs and a lot of inefficiencies while we were doing everything to protect our staff. WE LOST CLEARLY EFFICIENCIES CLEANING DISINFECTING BETWEEN SHIFTS NO OVERLAP OF SHIFTS ANY MORE SEGREGATION OF WORKFLOW BETWEEN SHIFTS LED TO A LOWER PRODUCTIVITY AND HIGHER COSTS OBVIOUSLY BUT THE EXCELLENT THE EXCELLENT COST MANAGEMENT THAT CONTRACT LOGISTICS INTRODUCED IMMEDIATELY WAS THE CRISIS BECOMING ONE SO AS OF FEBRUARY WE CLEARLY SHOWED PROGRESS AND WE WE WERE EXCLUDING THE PRESSURE FROM THE EXCHANGE RATE WE WERE ABLE TO COUNTER THE TOP LINE REVENUE PRESSURE WITH COST MEASURES ALMOST ENTIRELY AND AND THAT IS A FOCUS FOR SUCH A HUGE BUSINESS UNIT EMPLOYING SO MANY PEOPLE THAT'S A HUGE EFFORT AND A GREAT RESULT SO THE HIGH PORTION IN OUR SOLUTION PORTFOLIO OF ESSENTIAL GOODS High resilience and the lease that largely backed by contracts with customers back to back, so we have more than 50% of our sites are so-called dedicated sites so we were not exposed to an over-proportionate lease without any activity in too many sites nevertheless we we saw a development end of quarter one and early quarter two but if you look into the figures the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the figures are the All performance including DVX effects is only eleven point three percent lower net turnover and in ebit almost on the level of previous year quarter two and having said so I am happy to hand over to my colleague Marcus to lead you through the key financial figures. Thank you very much that leads welcome to all participants also from my side. A very special second quarter indeed. A time that was characterized by unusual business patterns. I think we had quite some opposite focus on or business management focus on in the business units. Air freight can be can be described by just make it happen times where customers as much as on the carrier side I think a lot of Creativity was being required to make things happen on the other side as Nedeljkovic mentioned in the context of logistics, a clear focus on cost containment and cost management. So a lot of times we have been confronted with the fact that traditional KPIs, key performance indicators, have not been extremely helpful. We needed to look differently at the business because it was a very special situation. BUT AND I WANT TO LEAD YOU TO THE PAGE NUMBER SIXTEEN I THINK THE RESULT ULTIMATELY WAS A QUITE GOOD ONE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE OF IMPACT WHAT SUCH AN UNUSUAL BUSINESS CAN HAPPEN IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GROSS PROFIT DEVELOPMENT FROM THE SET FROM THE FIRST AND THE SECOND QUARTER TO COMPARE TO LAST YEAR WE HAVE ACTUALLY LOST IN THE SECOND QUARTER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION GROSS PROFIT COMPARED TO LAST YEAR THAT IS TWO AND A HAL More than in the first quarter. However, on an EBITDA level, we actually have been at the same even better level than compared to the first quarter. So we only, if you like, still a big number, but this quarter. So we only, if you like, still a big number, but only had a reduction in EBITDA of thirty million out of a cross-profit reduction of two hundred and sixty-five. So there's quite a lot of the decline. COST CONTAINED AND COST MANAGEMENT IN BETWEEN THAT I THINK YOU CAN YOU CAN APPRECIATE WAS WAS QUITE A PIECE OF HARD WORK TO TO GET THAT DONE GOING FURTHER DOWN IN THE P N L OF COURSE ON AN E B T LEVEL YES WE ARE ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT BEHIND LAST YEAR ON A HALF YEAR BASIS SO NINETY MILLION NINE ZERO OF WHICH THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE JUST THE FACTS OF AROUND TWENTY MILLION MILLION ARE COMING OUT OF OUT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE. SO SEVENTY MILLION FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE REDUCE REDUCTION VERSUS LAST YEAR. SO IN RELATIVE TERMS I BELIEVE THE SECOND QUARTER AND THAT'S ALSO VERY APPARENT WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST QUARTER. ON PAGE NUMBER SEVENTEEN, LET'S TALK ABOUT AIRE AND SEA FREIGHT IN THAT CONTEXT. THE E-TOUCH PROJECT. AUTOMATION INITIATIVES BEHIND THAT WE HAVE PRESENTED THE POTENTIAL OF THE E-TOUCH INITIATIVES IN IN COMMERCIAL TERMS AT OUR FULL YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN PRESENTATION. SO WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY AN UPDATE WHERE WE STAND IT'S NOT A NEW ASSESSMENT OF VALUES, IT'S JUST AN UPDATE ON PROGRESS AND I THINK YOU CAN APPRECIATE WE HAVE SET THE BASIS IN MANY AREAS IN ERFRAID. AND OUR OPERATING SYSTEM AIRLOCK IS FULLY ROLLING OUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHICH IS A PRECURSOR FOR MANY OF THE EYE TOUCH INITIATIVES. NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MANY OF THOSE AND YOU CAN SEE DESPITE THE FACT THAT Q TWO HAD BEEN A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT TO PUT THROUGH PROJECTS BUT WE HAVE CONTINUED TO DRIVE EYE TOUCH INITIATIVES AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD PROGRESS AT LEAST IN ONE YEAR Of the five core areas, the one that is customer booking and order entry, and I think the message here is, yes, do not expect any miracles right now in the current situation with still over a good three months people working partially from home, partially just as I said, trying to keep up service in an in an excellent manner. But some of these projects have a slight delay. The message that I want to give you here is, E-touch is on track. Page number eighteen, balance sheet. I'm only going to talk about three four components of course, some of them housekeeping. First one, trade receivables, biggest item on the balance sheet, three point two three point three billion by the end of june twenty twenty, compared to three point six billion not surprisingly again here. A position where business volume has reduced slightly and you know it's a function basically of rates and volume and of course a currency impact also on that on that position that is reducing the overall amount. Secondly, and arguably more important, cash and cash equivalent. I think our balance sheet is strong with a gross cash position here of nearly one point two billion. Translated into net cash of around seven hundred sixty million which compares to roughly nine hundred million respectively four hundred eighteen million by the end of the first quarter twenty twenty so simple terms a very good development in cash generation in light of the decision you have read in the news today in light of the decision to propose the distribution of a dividend to the shareholders of four. SWITZERLAND: WE HAVE CALCULATED A PERFORMANCE NET CASH POSITION AT THAT POINT IN TIME AND THAT WOULD STILL BE POSITIVE WITH TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION JUST AS A HOUSEKEEPING TOPIC HERE YOU'RE AWARE THAT WE HAVE A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AVAILABLE TO US WHICH IS ENTIRELY UNDRAWN SO NOTHING HAS BEEN USED SO FAR IN THE EXTENT OR AT THE FRAME OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION COMING BACK TO YOU The next item on the balance sheet is asset held for sale. Also here are information purposes. This is the value that we have or that is the scope of the business that we have signed a contract of divestment with XPO. You can see here a very transparent asset held for sale. So you can see here very transparent asset held for sale. Four hundred million liabilities associated with these asset held for sale. So the next item on the balance sheet is asset held for sale. Also here are information purposes. This is the value that we have or that is the scope of the business that we have signed a contract of divestment with XPO. You can see here a very transparent asset held for sale. So you can see here very transparent asset held for sale. Four hundred million liabilities associated with these asset held for sale. So the next item on the balance sheet is asset held for sale. Also The asset value of that business to be carved out is around a hundred million. Equity ratio, I'm sure you have already calculated that yourself. From December, twenty-three point six percent, an increase to twenty-five point nine percent. So, I think the solidity of the balance sheet is also in these rough times and unusual times a benefit. Nevertheless, balance sheet is one thing, cash is king. SO MAIN TOPIC CASH GOING SWIFTLY TO PAGE NUMBER NINETEEN OPERATIONAL CASH FLOW YOU CAN SEE THAT HERE IN THE FIRST HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY AT AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION SIMILAR LEVEL THAN LAST YEAR WITH WITH AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MILLION HOWEVER WHEN WE GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND LOOK AT THE TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT SITUATION WE HAVE AN INCREASE ON THE CASH BALANCE OF Around six hundred sixty-six million be reminded at that point in time that included last year a dividend payment to the amount of seven hundred twenty million so comparably at similar level free cash flow generation really what we are looking at very resilient a free cash flow generation also in the second quarter so i'm talking second quarter not half year in the second quarter of two hundred twenty-seven million which It compares to two hundred twenty three million. So let's talk about crisis or non-crisis. Free cash flow generation has been at the very same level as as as last year. Excluding some of the disposals and this gives you a bit of an idea on how much extraordinary components are in there. Excluding the disposals the underlying free cash flow for the second quarter was still two hundred twenty one. So the swing that we've seen. Talking about disposals is a very neglectable, I think, six million out of the free cash flow. For everybody who runs some of the models, I think you can see here from the investing activities the cross cap ex, the run rate or the cap ex that we spend into the business is currently aiming at around two hundred million on an annual basis which is which is significantly lower. FOR THAN WE HAD IT SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SOME OF THE SOME OF THE DRIVERS OF COURSE IS THE CONTRACT LOGISTICS DISPOSAL OF THE OF THE OF PART OF THE UK BUSINESS AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO VERY DILIGENTLY WORKING ON THE USAGE OF A LONG TERM LEASES ACCORDING TO AIREXPRESS SIXTEEN RATHER THAN OUTRIGHT PURCHASES LOOKING AT THE PATTERN IN TIME SO THE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE FREE CASH I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CURVES ON THE PAGE NINETEEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD LOOK DIFFERENTLY AT LEAST IN THE THIRD QUARTER THAN IT DID LAST YEAR AGAIN BE REMINDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WE HAD SOME EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO WE SHOULD EXPECT A MORE EVEN DEVELOPMENT INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER ALSO FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO Touched the accounts receivable quickly on the balance sheet. When I went to talk about the balance sheet, here you see trade receivables have decreased over year over year by around four hundred million. The reasons that I mentioned already trade payables around two hundred and sixty million, so our net working capital is down around one hundred and forty six million. What's more important, our KPIs on DSOs and DPOs, we were able to do it. To keep, especially on the D-I-S-O-S side, days of sales outstanding a number around fifty-four, fifty-five. So we have a deviation of zero point four days. Many questions coming along our way, obviously, in is there pressure from customers on extended payment terms? Yes, there is, very clear, yes, there is. And I think we will see more pressure coming in the third and fourth quarter. We are, we are holding on to it. I think service is one of the important arguments to maintain the DSOs. At the same time, I think our focus moves towards the risk profile behind the counterparties. I do expect, I do expect going forward for the next two to three quarters an increase in the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk profile on the risk Counterparty risks. So nothing bad has happened so far. I want to underline that. It's it's it's no no no big defaults or anything like that. But I would expect that the pressure is also here getting higher until the end of the year and maybe into the first half of the year twenty twenty one return on capital employed page number twenty one. PAGE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN: YOU SEE THAT LITTLE INFLECTION POINT THAT WE HAD HERE FROM SIXTY PERCENT UP TO SIXTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN AND I THINK THAT WAS THAT WAS A GOOD SIGN. SO NOW WE SEE A LITTLE BIT THE COVID NINETEEN EFFECT THAT IT THAT THAT PUSHES IT DOWN TO SIXTY TWO PERCENT AGAIN VERY CLEAR AND I JUST ROTED IT FOR FOR FOR CLEARITY JUST BESIDE IT THE SUDDEN DECREASE OF THE PROFITABILITY THAT WE HAVE SEEN ALSO ON THE PN The state is obviously mathematically leading to a bit of an compression on this one. However, from a target perspective, we maintain our financial, our financial targets with around seventy percent return on capital employed that should be possible. The good news and at the same time, I think the expected also from some of you news is on the next slide. Page Number 22: Dividend Proposal Just to put also some clarity around conversations we had over the last years you know that we never had a formal written dividend policy as it is all decision-making power remains with the board of directors and the general assembly that having said the actual pay-out ratio in the recent years was always consistent. Distant with also our verbal communication to a distribution of around seventy five percent of the net profit after tax. Clearly now the BOD's proposal is based on the assessment of the market conditions and also the groups performance and likely ongoing performance. And as you can see here the assessment of the market conditions and also the groups performance and likely ongoing performance. And as you can see here the assessment of the market conditions and also the groups performance and likely ongoing performance. And as you can see here the assessment of the market conditions and also the groups performance and likely ongoing performance. And as you can see here the assessment of the market conditions and also the groups performance and likely ongoing performance. And as you can see here the assessment of the market conditions and also the groups performance and likely ongoing performance. And as you can see here the assessment of the market PROPOSAL TO THE ANNUAL OR EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING ON SEPTEMBER SECOND WILL BE TO PAY OUT A DIVIDEND OF FOUR SWISS FRANCS FINANCIAL TARGETS AND LAST SLIDE FROM MY PRESENTATION I THINK YOU SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE THE GROUP FINANCIAL TARGETS CONVERSION RATE ELEVEN TO SIXTEEN PERCENT I THINK EVERYBODY IS CLEAR ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS E-TOUCH RETURN ON CAPITAL Employed, I just spoke about it. I think when we come back to regular profitability based on our asset base, seventy percent is in reach. Working capital intensity, I want to talk about that first. Working capital intensity currently is at three point nine percent. And you might have noticed, I have intentionally widened a little bit the corridor from top end four and a half percent to five percent. FOR A SIMPLE REASON BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IS ANTICIPATING A REFLECTION OF PRESSURE ON COMPETITOR RISK AND POTENTIAL DSOs FOR THE NEXT FOUR QUARTERS TAX RATE TAX RATE I THINK VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THIS ONE THIS IS A HOUSEKEEPING TOPIC WE EXPECT A GROUP Effective tax rate of around 24 to 26 percent up from around 24 to 25 as per our latest communication. This is just reflecting the current shifts in the business and geographic mix. So just that you are not surprised on your models. Right side, the four business units, you see the first line, our actual performance in volumes. But underneath, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the part, the EVERYBODY WAS REALLY WAITING FOR THAT IS THE UPDATE ON THE MARKET EXPECTATIONS FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND THE OUTLOOK AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE THINK WE ARE IN LINE WITH MANY OF OUR PEERS WE ARE NOT GIVING ANY YOU KNOW THE I THINK THE PERFORMANCE THAT THE GROUP HAS SHOWN SO FAR GIVES US A CERTAIN CONFIDENCE IN OUR ABILITY ALSO TO MANAGE THROUGH WHAT WE BELIEVE IS GONNA STILL BE A VOLATILE AND HIGHLY UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT The market is going to still be volatile and highly uncertain for the rest of the year. As the market outlook remains extremely uncertain to us as well, we offer again no explicit financial guidance for the group nor volume guidance until the end of the year. We are very sorry for that, but at the current stage, you will have to live with guest working and a bit of a fact. COLOR OF WHAT WE SAID ON OUR PAST PERFORMANCE WITH THAT LITTLE LACK OF OUTLOOK I WILL HAND OVER TO DANTLEV AND THANK YOU MARCUS AND THE LACK OF OUTLOOK MAYBE MARKS THE WHOLE YEAR BECAUSE IN THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE TO FLY ON SITE THAT IS THE SAYING WE HAVE AS FAR AS WE CAN LOOK AHEAD WE INITIATE MEASURES AND ACTIVITIES AND THE REST AGILITY ADAPTIVITY TO A SITUATION THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY PREDICT ON SLIDE TWENTY FOUR I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF REMARKS LOGISTICS IS IS AND WILL STAY PEOPLE'S BUSINESS EVEN IN A MORE AND MORE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT AND WE HAVE EMBARKED ON THIS ROADMAP TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT ROADMAP DEPLOYMENT BLENDS CUSTOMER TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE LAST SIX MONTHS HAVE CLEARLY SHOWN THAT WE HAVE EMBARKED ON THE RIGHT STRATEGY WE STAYED FULLY OPERATIONAL THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS AND CONTINUED SERVING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH OUR HIGH QUALITY SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND I WOULD HARTILY LIKE TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMITMENT AND PASSION AND TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THEIR TRUST AND LOYALTY THANK YOU What would the first semester have looked like without you? That's the energy and passion of the best logistics team in our industry. And having said that, I would like to hand over back to Sandra to open Q and A.\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. Anyone who wishes to ask a question may press star one on the touch tone phone. You will hear a tone to confirm that you have entered the queue. If you wish to remove yourself from the question queue, you may press star two. STAR AND TWO PARTICIPANTS ARE REQUIRED TO USE ONLY HANDS AS WELL AS ASKING A QUESTION ANYONE WHO HAS A QUESTION MAY PRESS STAR AND ONE AT THIS TIME THE FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM DANIEL RUSHKA FROM SANFORD BURNHAM PLEASE GO AHEAD JEANS GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR TAKING THE QUESTIONS THREE FIVE MINUTES COULD YOU ELABORATE WHAT IS ENABLING THE MARKET SHARE GAIN ESPECIALLY DURING A CRISIS LIKE THIS ONE IN YOUR VIEW AND KIND OF WHO' Kind of as things move more back to normal, you also talked a little bit about your cost reduction efforts. And in today's report, you showed about eighty seven thousand employees down from about ninety eight last year at the same point. Now, how much of that decrease, kind of let's call it a rough ten thousand employees, is driven by the temporary furlough programs and how much due to actual sustainable reductions that then will benefit you kind of as you ramp back up? AND TYING THIS ALSO TO ETOUCH BACK AT THE FINANCIAL YEAR RESULTS YOU TALKED ABOUT TWENTY MILLION ANNUAL LIFE SAVINGS SO FAR ANY INDICATION ON HOW THIS HAS PROGRESSED IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE AUTOMATION WILL ENABLE YOU TO KEEP STAFF NUMBERS LOWER AS VOLUMES GO BACK UP OR ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT KIND OF REALLY DRIVING ETOUCH THROUGH THE BUSINESS THANKS DANIELLE LET ME KNOW Those questions, let me start with the latter one because we have alluded to that a couple of times. It's not about staff reduction. E-touch is enabling us to do more business and to drive business segments or growth in business segments with a traditionally lower margin but with a high conversion rate. Still, very attractive to us. That is e-touch market chair gains. We have mentioned that we were able to gain market share because we changed. THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION INTO ADDRESSING ACTIVELY CUSTOMERS AFTER EASTER. SO WE WERE ENGAGED WITH ALL EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, TARGET CUSTOMERS AS WE CALL THEM AND WE HAD INTERACTION VIRTUALLY WITH ALL OF THEM A COUPLE OF TIMES THROUGHOUT THE WEEK AND MONTHS AND WE WON BUSINESS. WE WON BUSINESS WITHOUT HAVING MET THE CUSTOMER FISICALLY AND WE WERE WINNING BUSINESS BECAUSE WE WERE OPERATIONAL AND Many of our mid-sized and smaller competitors were not operational of our mid-sized and smaller competitors were not operational. They struggled to keep operations up and running. So that also would allude to answering your question who lost the lower part of the pyramid is the one that is under highest pressure technology connectivity and also functionality of operating systems is a big challenge. FOR MANY OF THEM AND ESPECIALLY IN A UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION THAT WE ALL WENT THROUGH WORLDWIDE OVER THE LAST THREE OR FIVE MONTHS THAT PROVED TO BE A BIG RISK AND A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T OVERCOME ANY OF THOSE DEFICIENCIES BY JUST CALLING SOMEONE OR GOING SOMEWHERE YOU HAD TO PROVE YOUR SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY ARE WORKING HOW MUCH CAN WE RETAIN? I WOULD SAY WE WE CONVINCE OUR CUSTOMERS BY QUALITY. WE D We are a quality supplier and the customers that have made the experience over the last six months or in the past, in general, they stay with us. We have a lot of customers that we retain because of our high quality service. And that's part of our roadmap twenty twenty two strategy. Customer excellence is at the center of all the topics we do. We don't want to win transactional business just for the sake of winning it or operating it for one, two, or three months. WE WANT CUSTOMERS TO STAY WITH US AND SEE HOW MUCH OF OUR SOLUTION PORTFOLIO CAN GENERATE BENEFITS FOR THEM COST REDUCTION EFFORTS I THINK WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF EFFORTS WITH ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE BUT NOT ONLY WE HAVE OPTIUMIZED OUR WORKFORCE WE HAVE REDUCED CAPACITY VERY QUICKLY BUT WE SHIFTED CAPACITY TO THOSE OPERATIONS SOMETIMES IN THIS SAME CITY OR EVEN THE SAME WAREHOUSE WHERE DEMAND SPIKED SO THERE IS NO RULE. WE HAVE ONLY A FEW TEMPORARY LABOR I THINK IT'S TWO THOUSAND A BIT MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND TEMPORARY LABOR LESS THAN WE HAD A YEAR AGO AND THIS IS DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT THAT WE SEE MUCH HIGHER DEMAND STILL IN SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL GOODS SEGMENTS SPECIALLY FARMACHEER SKILLS AND ECOMMERCE AND THIS FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IS SUSTAINABLE THIS WILL STAY. SO IN A DIFFERENT WORDS DANIEL I WOULD SAY WE MADE A ORGANIC GROWTH EXPERIENCE COMPRESSED IN FIVE MONTHS MAYBE OR FOUR MONTHS THAT WE USUALLY WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH IN OUR CUSTOMERS IN A PERIOD OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND I WOULD SAY THAT IS TO A LARGE EXTENT STICKY AND STAYS AND WILL NOT BE REVERSED THANKS THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM SATYA SIVA KUMAR FROM CITY GROUP. PLEASE GO AHEAD. YEAH, THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, THAT'S LUKE MARTIN. THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS. I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS. FIRSTLY, COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE ON VOLUME TRENDS THROUGH THE QUARTER FROM SMEs WHICH MARKETS ARE ACTUALLY SEEING WEAKNESS VERSUS THE RELATIVE STRENGTH? SECONDLY, IN TWENTY NINETEEN, ON YOUR S D N A EXPENSES Can you please update on the current run rate on SGNA? Finally, what has been your workforce retention rate from remote working across key markets? Can you repeat the last question, please? I didn't hear it. In terms of workforce returning back to office, what has been the retention rate so far across key markets? YOUNG TRENDS WHICH MARKETS SO IT AS YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PANDEMIC STARTED MID OF JANUARY ALREADY IN IN ASIA AND USUALLY THIS IS NOT AN SME MARKET OR WE ARE WE HAVE A MUCH HIGHER PORTION OF OF BLUE CHIP CUSTOMERS THERE BUT IN EUROPE IT'S MAINLY THE SME CUSTOMERS THAT DROPPED OUT OF BUSINESS VERY FAST AND THE RECOVERY IS STARTING NOW IN JUNE I WOULD SAY SO THE FIRST SIGN OF A RECOVERY OF SME CUSTOMERS THERE HAS BEEN SEEN IN JUNE IN EUROPE AND PARTLY IN OTHER MARKETS BUT MAINLY IN EUROPE AND THIS THIS WILL TAKE TIME IT WILL NOT COME OVERNIGHT AT THE MOMENT THE PANDEMIC IS HITTING THE AMERICAS AND WE SEE THAT WE ARE HAVE STILL VOLUMES THAT ARE DOWN AND NOT RECOVERING BUT HERE I WOULD SAY IT HAS BOTTOMED OUT SO WE ARE MORE POSITIVE TODAY THAN WE WERE THREE MONTHS AGO MONTHS AGO WHEN WE DISCUSSED THE QUARTER ONE RESULTS I WOULD SAY DESPITE REGIONAL AND LOCAL SETBACKS DESPITE REGIONAL AND LOCAL SETBACKS THE PANDEMIC IS NOT OVER BUT WE HAVE ALL MANAGED AND UNDERSTOOD HOW TO HANDLE IT AND GOVERNMENTS HAVE INITIATED ENOUGH PROTECTIVE HEALTH MEASURES IN ORDER TO SECURE THE PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM CONTINUE Assuming the SG E run rate has a lot of components and it starts with travel, for example, I do not expect travel to come back this year to say this clearly. Intercontinental travel, I would not expect to see any of the flights intercontinental with Qantas stuff on it before September, if at all. And then we have made such a positive experience on winning. NEW CUSTOMERS AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS. THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM DAVID KERSON FROM JEFFERSONS PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. GREAT AFTERNOON GENTLEMEN THREE QUESTIONS PLEASE FOR MY SIDE FIRST ON ON SEA LOGISTICS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE VOLUME DEVELOPMENT IS IS BETTER THAN EXPECTED AS THE QUARTER PROGRESSED I WAS WONDERING DID YOU SEE A NOTICEABLE IMPACT FROM A SHIFT FROM FROM AIR TO SEAFREIGHT DUE TO THE LACK OF CAPACITY IN AIR FREIGHT THEN SECONDLY IN AIR LOGISTICS YOU YOU BENEFITED FROM I THINK IN CONSTANT CURRENCY A THIRTY FOUR PERCENT HIGHER YIELD AND NOW WITH THE AIR FREIGHT MARKET STARTING TO NORMALIZE AGAIN WHICH YOU EXPECTED THAT AIR FREIGHT YIELD ALSO NORMALIZES BACK TO THE RANGE THAT YOU INDICATED IN YOUR PRESENTATION OF SEVENTY TWO EIGHTY FIVE FRANCS PER HUNDRED KILOGRAM OR DO YOU EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO Finally, on logistics, I think the organic revenue was down twenty percent in the second quarter, but that's a mix of Europe and North America. Coca-Cola provides some color on how weak North America really was and a decrease of twenty percent. Does that still imply that you gained market share in the second quarter? Because I think some of your peers refer to the market down only fifteen percent in the second quarter. Thank you very much. Yes, we had a better volume development than expected. But any shift from air to sea is insignificant for sea. Sorry for saying so. One frighter has a hundred has one hundred kilos and a hundred tons and we are talking about I don't know six eight containers. It's a different business model. You can't compare it. But what we saw and that is a good combination. I mentioned that is the air sea combination. SO YEAH YOU GO INTO DUBAI VIA SEA AND THEN YOU GO INTO FINAL DISTRIBUTION EVEN TO SOUTH AMERICA VIA AIR. AND THIS COMBINATION THIS SOLUTION IS IN LIGHT OF THE LACKING SUPPLY SITE OF FREIGHTER CAPACITY ESPECIALLY IN CHINA GOT A LOT OF TAIL WIND AND I MENTIONED THAT OUR VOLUMES HERE SPIKED MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE NORMAL VOLUME THAT WE SEE. SO THIS COMBINATION SHOWED A CERTAIN PROGRESS. Air logistics, I think I mentioned that during the presentation. We expect, especially in the second semester, that the higher yields was a very special or was a result of a very special supply and demand situation in quarter two and that the normalized yields of seventy to eighty five Swiss francs per hundred kilo will come in or will kick in again, not overnight and not on a fingertip but gradually. ROAD LOGISTICS I THINK OUR COMS ARE WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT FIGURES IN THE MARKET AND NOT BEING ABLE TO PREDICT EVEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED OR DESCRIBE REALLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO ALL OF US HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL LET ME DESCRIBE A SITUATION THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN EUROPE AND THEN I COME TO THE U S EUROPE WE HAVE VOLUME REDUCTIONS OF FIFTY SIXTY PERCENT AND WITHIN WEEKS THIS HAPPENED IN THE FIRST ONE TO THREE WEEKS IN APRIL BUT THEN THIS BOTTOMED OUT AND A RECOVERY GRADUALLY STARTED ALREADY AS OF MAY SO THE FIGURE YOU SEE IS AN EVERGREEN FIGURE AS OF MAY SO THE FIGURE YOU SEE IS AN EVERGREEN FIGURE OF A VOLUME DEVELOPMENT THAT HAD A LOT OF SLUMPS AND SPIKES AND A LOT OF SHIFTS OVER THE LAST WEEKS AT THE MOMENT I WE ALL BELIEVE THAT THE VOLUMES ARE GRADUALLY CLEARING UP Coming back and they stay, it's not a one-time shot. And in the US, I think we are still on a very low level, but as I mentioned, it has bottomed out. So, long story short, it was a disaster and it's recovering. Okay, great. Thank you very much. You're welcome. The next question, comes from Sam Land, from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. FIRST ONE IS ON THE SEAFREIGHT CONVERSION RATE THAT'S HELD UP PRETTY WELL BUT I GUESS THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH THERE WASN'T ANY BENEFIT FROM E-TOUCH IN THAT SEGMENT. SO JUST BE INTERESTED IN DID YOU DO ANY SPECIFIC COST SAVINGS PROGRAMS IN SEAFREIGHT OR WHAT HELPED THE CONVERSION RATE IN THE QUARTER SECOND QUESTION IS ON I THINK THERE WAS FIFTY SEVEN MILLION OF EMPLOYEE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN THE QUARTER COULD YOU JUST TALK ABO And could you see that support be withdrawn before the market recovers back up to normal rates, so that there's basically a lag and your profitability is impacted by that? And the last question would just be an update on on mna funds. You've obviously paid the dividend, should we read into that that any mna ambitions are a bit less in the short run or you've still got plenty of firepower to look at that? Thank you. THERE ARE THREE QUESTIONS. IT'S NOT A STANDARD ROUTINE THAT YOU HAVE TO ASK THREE QUESTIONS ONLY AS A AS A SHORT HINT TO YOU. SO SEE WE HAVE COST SAVINGS IN PLACE AND THERE'S NO E-TOUCH YET BECAUSE AS MENTIONED MANY TIMES, THE PRE-REQUISITES IS THE FULLY DEPLOYED NEW TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CALLED LOCAL AS A BASIS FOR RUNNING SE LOGISTICS E-TOUCH ACTIVITIES IN SE LOGISTICS THE GOVERNMENT APPROVED Programs that you allude to, 80, 85 percent is related to contract logistics, but people were out of work. So, as volumes are coming back, also in the normal operation, people are an employment and we pay them. So, that's not the point. We avoided to lay off people which is beneficial for our staff and also for the government related to this. So, the busyness, the operational run rate of contract logistics has been extremely strong. All the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the restructuring, all the Residues showed the desired effects and we will see in the second semester when things are cleaning up more and more, especially in the quarter four figures how strong contract logistics will will phoenix like come back out of all the restructuring activities and your question related to an ambitious, I'm a bit surprised because our proposal, vivid proposal has not changed to the one that we made prior to covid nineteen so. WHEN WE POSTED OUR ANNUAL RESULTS TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THERE WAS A DIVIDEND PROPOSAL OF FORCE MAJEURE FRANK'S PER SHARE AND CAUTIOUS AS WE ARE WE POSTPONED A DECISION ON THIS AND DID NOT DECIDE ON A DIVIDEND GIVEN THE UNSECURITY AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE PANDEMIC AND NOW AS WE SEE THAT CASH FLOW IS STRONG AND WE BREATHE THE SITUATION STRONGLY WE ARE WE ARE IN A SITUATION THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECIDED TO PROPOSE FOR THE THE DIV AH, GENERAL, TO PROPOSE THE SAME DIVIDEND AGAIN FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. OUR M E N A N A M B I SH I O N, A M B I SH I O N, O U R M E N A N A S T R A T E J IY AH HAS N AA1 T CH EY1 N JH D AE1 T AO1 L B AH1 T F IH1 Z IH0 K AH0 L B IY1 T IH0 NG Z sil IH1 N sil EY1 ZH AH0 sil AA1 R R IH0 S T R IH1 K T IH0 D AE1 T DH AH0 M OW1 M AH0 N T S OW1 I'm sorry, could you please rephrase your request? Could you give us a sense for how much of your air freight in Q2 went in freighters rather than bellyhold and and do you see that changing significantly in certainly in Q3 and maybe even into Q4 because my sense is that the airlines are bringing back in Q4 because my sense is that the airlines are bringing back capacity but much more of it is short and medium haul rather than the long haul stuff which is typically what you see. What is it? Exactly. So whatever valley comes back at the moment, it's short and medium hall and that doesn't help us. I mean, usually that is not where we where we entrust the majority of our business, yeah. So I would expect in the second semester sixty to seventy percent of our volume to be transported with freight's main deck capacity. BUT BELLEY WILL NOT RECOVER TOO SOON. I WOULD SAY IT WILL TAKE MAYBE TWO YEARS THAT WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT NETWORK ACTIVITY WHICH ALLOWS FOR BELLEY USING BELLEY CAPACITY AGAIN YEAH YEAH I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YE Belly Capacity Around? Yeah, I'm not sure. So, this, this is, no, I'm not sure. So, this, this is, no, no, Mark, I'm not sure. End of this year, we will have sixty to seventy percent of the belly capacity that should be back. But we will still rely we will still rely ON FREIGHT CAPACITY TO A MAJOR MAJOR EXTENT AND THAT WILL GRADUALLY TRANSFORM OR CHANGE THROUGHOUT QUARTER THREE AND QUARTER FOUR. SO WE ARE TALKING END OF THE YEAR WHERE THAT AT THE MOMENT I THINK IT'S NINETY PERCENT, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, OR A QUARTER EARLY QUARTER TWO, MIDDLE OF QUARTER TWO, THE MAJORITY ALMOST ALL IS FREIGHT CAPACITY. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF VEHICLES STILL IN NORTH AMERICA OR THE AMERICAS WHICH C Used and we use partly a berth capacity for perishables out of African countries. Yeah. So, so when you talk about the G.P. normalizing or coming back towards the longer-term range, that's much more the mix. I guess the likelier G.P. from using a freighter is gonna be different in August than it was in April, particularly. Absolutely. It's the mix, clearly. BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER B Credit insurers on a global basis. A lot of conversations are going on right now. And I don't want to say that insurers have all the similar patterns of obviously when when business goes well, there's a lot of insurance coverage available. When business doesn't go so well, it goes down very quickly. But we are we are having a good partnership with them and we try to manage as much coverage as possible. As I said in my presentation, until now, no significant DEFECTS OR FALLOUTS OR BANKRUPTCIES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT HOWEVER THERE IS YOU KNOW THE HORIZON IS A BIT DARKER THAN WHAT IT USUALLY LOOKS LIKE SO THERE'S A LOT OF CAUTION THAT'S GOING FORWARD HOW MUCH WE PAY YOU CAN SEE THAT OUT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT WE PAY EVERY YEAR AROUND THREE AND A HALF TO FOUR MILLION ON INSURANCE PREMIUMS I THINK THAT IS GIVEN OUR SALES LEADERSHIP OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION A REASONABLE NUMBER WHEN YOU A It's around seventy percent of that is being covered yeah and and but but broadly as you go into the second half your level of cover is unchanged yeah our level of cover is on a total number probably unchanged when you look into some of the industries it may vary like aerospace industry might actually be reduced a little bit some industries will be increased but overall the risk profile is shifting within The next question comes from Glynne Neil from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hello. Hello. Thank you both very much. The overall remains very stable. Okay. Lovely. Thank you. You're welcome. The next question comes from an unidentified person. Please go ahead. Hello. Hello. So, Neil, from Credit Suisse, if I could ask first, another question of Marcus, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, if that works, MY PLEASURE AND THEN I'LL HAVE ONE FOR DEATH LATER TOO IF I MAY KEEP IT TO TWO SO THE FIRST ONE MARCUS YOU OBVIOUSLY SPENT SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT WORKING CAPITAL AND INCREASING RISK TO SOME OF YOUR S E M E CUSTOMERS JUST WONDERING AS IT PERTAINS TO SEA FREIGHT AND THE NEGATIVE MIX EFFECT ON G P P ER TOY AS YOU PLAN BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY DO YOU PLAN FOR A SMALLER PROPORTION OF S E M E RELATIVE TO NORMAL OR HOW DO YOU THIN In as it relates to gp per toy over the medium term and then the second question and i guess it could be for either of you just following on from the erlog comments on how it's evolving and obviously sea log is to come how relevant is this to your m and a ambitions that you obviously outlined to an extent the full year i guess on one hand optimization of those two tms might be ideal before any major transaction but is that the way you think about it Is that something that will ultimately take care of itself if you find the right deal in advance? Okay, maybe Neil, I take the latter question. If you, if you don't mind. First of all, we concentrate on our own business and optimizing our own business based on air log and followed by sea log and the etouchability of that business make etouch happen. And we make progress here. We are in in air log logistics as we have been pronounced. I understand that M&A is independent of this. This needs cultural fit. We're looking for access to certain Asian customers. A solutioning that is not yet part of our own solutioning, maybe. So there are a lot of other criteria. And yes, it would be much easier to transfer a acquisition directly on Slack to name this than on our current legacy system. But if that would be needed, we can do so as well. I mean, we have proven that we can. BUT THIS IS NOT A BIG EXERCISE FOR US AND SO THAT IS NOT A CRITERIA THAT WOULD INFLUENCE OUR M N A APPROACH OR DELAY ANY M N A IT'S MORE UM GETTING ACQUAINTED INTO THOSE SPECIFIC TARGETS AND ALSO BUILDING UP A BASIS OF TRUST AND THAT NEEDS PHYSICAL PERSONAL MEETINGS AND YOU CAN'T DO THIS VIA VIA VIA VIDEO CALLS YOU ALSO WE ALWAYS SAID WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THIS BECAUSE THERE WERE RUMORS IN THE MARKET WE ALWAYS SAID IT'S TWO Y BUT WE MAKE PROGRESS. WE NEVER STOPPED. WE DIDN'T CHANGE APPROACH. SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW, I'M QUITE CONFIDENT THAT EVENTUALLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE THE RIGHT OR THE RIGHT ACQUISITIONS. SO NIEL, THEN, ON THE FIRST QUESTION, I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU COME FROM THE WORKING CAPITAL AND THE RISK PROFILE TO THE SME. I THINK WE SEE NOW THAT SME'S VOLUMES COMING DOWN IN THE SECOND QUARTER JUST FOR A CURFEW HAS BEEN HAVE BEEN JUST SHUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT REOPENS AGAIN. SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN SEYFREED IS THAT TEMPORARILY THERE IS GOING TO BE A SHIFT IN MIX AWAY FROM THE ESM. BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY IT IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER PORTION. WELL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MARKET SHARE IT'S A VERY SMALL MARKET SHARE WE COVER RIGHT NOW. SO IT'S IT's an absolute attractive and we're totally committed as you know in our customer base to two This is our backbone of our operation, right? There is still a massive potential to grow in in in a very profitable market in the sme so how the margin is going to look like, i think also here, there is a time that we need to look at for the normalization, but there, there is no systemic, structural reason why the margin for sme should have a It should be lower than it has been in the past. So, I think rightfully so, our, our backbone, sme customer base, we will even get a bigger portion of that, and the profitability is going to be run exactly, if not above the level that we had until now. GOOD AFTERNOON ALSO A QUESTION REGARDING THE MIX SHIFT IN C TOWARDS S E M B COULD YOU COULD YOU TRY AND DESCRIBE HOW MUCH OF A SHIFT IN THE MIX YOU SAW AND WHAT WAS THE EFFECT ON THE YIELD THAT YOU SAW IN THE C BUSINESS I THINK THOSE DETAILS WE WERE NOT DISCLOSED BUT THE MINORITY OF THE S E M B S E M B BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN THE MINORITY OF THE S E M B BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN THE MINORITY OF THE S E M B BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN THE MINOR E-S-E business has not been able to sustain their operations, their business models throughout the pandemic at least for four or six weeks and that has caused the reduction so but we see them gradually coming back. But as Marcus said before, some of them do not come back at all because their base is there, their their financial severity is not given and E-S-E is everything, be careful, it's also very niche product. But that has not seen an increase in demand at the moment. Whether you have hand-painted tiles that are produced in Northern Italy and the demand is coming back now in Denmark, for example, is a rather questionable point. And that is maybe how you should think about it. But eventually, that will come back. And our business is, and we are strong in SME business. Our business is it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND NOT OF A HOW DO YOU SEE A CONSCIOUS MIX DECISION? SO I UNDERSTAND OK. AND THE SECOND QUESTION, FINAL QUESTION IS AROUND THE EMN MARKET AND WHETHER THE TRUMP I MEAN YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE WINNING MARKETS, GAINING MARKET SHARES AND THOSE THAT ARE LOOSING IT ARE TYPICALLY THE SMALLER MID-SIZED COMPETITORS THAT ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES ON THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT, CONNECTIVITY AND SO ON. AND AND YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT CREDIT RISKS ESCALATING. SO THERE MIGHT BE AN AN OPTICK IN THE E M N A O PPORTUNITIES THAT YOU SEE MAYBE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT WE MONITOR THE MARKET FOR MANY YEARS AND WE ARE WE ARE ACTIVE IN THE MARKET AS YOU KNOW BUT NOT EVERYTHING THAT LOOKS SHINY IS OF INTEREST TO US AND THAT MAYBE WE TO FULFILL OUR STRATEGIC TARGETS AND TO CONTINUE OUR OBJECTIVES GROWTH PASS THAT WE HAVE EMBARKED ON MANY YEARS AGO WE DON'T NEED MNA WHAT WE WE HAVE DEFINED TARGETS WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE WITH AN MNA APPROACH AND IF WE FIND TARGETS THAT ARE FULFILLING THOSE REQUIREMENTS WE WILL BE ACTIVE WE WILL BECOME ACTIVE AND IF NOT WE DON'T SO AND FOR US THE MARKET HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED AT THE MOMENT AND WE NEVER LOOKED AT IT WE ALWAYS LOOKED AT IT Targets also in the past that were successful in their with their business model in their geography geography or in their solutioning. We are not looking for a restructuring case. That's not our business. Okay. Understood. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next question comes from christian ops from bank of america. Please go ahead. Yes, hello. I have some more technical questions. So one is concerning the decision concerning capex. LONG TERM LEASES SO WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION OF RIGHT OF DEPRECIATION OF USED ASSETS FROM TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MILLION IN A SECOND QUARTER THIS YEAR AND SO WHAT IS THE TRIGGER FOR A DECISION GOING FOR CAPEX OR FOR LONG TERM LEASES AND HOW IS THE CURRENT MARKET FOR LONG TERM LEASES DEVELOPING? OR SO WHAT DOES THE MAIN TRIGGER FOR ANY DECISION IN EITHER WAY SECOND ONE IS YOU ARE TALKING AND OF COURSE THERE IS DSO PRESSURE ARE YOU CURRENTLY SUPPORTING SOME OF YOUR CUSTOMERS SO FOR LONGER PAYMENT TERMS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO KEEP THEM INTO YOUR NETWORK AND THE LAST ONE IS CAN YOU GIVE US A GUIDANCE FOR ANY KIND OF INCOME FROM DISPOSALS IN THE SECOND HALF THANK YOU I THINK YOUR QUESTION HAS TWO ANSWERS. THE FIRST ONE IS WHAT IS THE DECISION-MAKING REASONS TO IT AND THE SECOND ONE IS WHAT IS THE INCREASE IN THE SECOND PORTION THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT REASONS THAT THERE MAY BE A MORE TECHNICAL FIRST YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE ASSET HELD FOR SALE RELATED TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE BUSINESS IN THE UK WHICH ALSO Includes right of use assets and as per the iofrs standards you have to stop depreciations at the point of signing and then keep that frozen if you like until the point of closing that is the that is a simple reason why you have the variations in the second quarter and continue to have until closing has been has been executed so that is the technical part then the question around what is what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the question around what is the technical part then the Makes us deciding into one or the other parent what makes us deciding into one or the other pace and main main and most important piece to it is that because we talk most of it of locations, right of of contract logistics facilities so what is the what is the perspective of that contract logistics facility is that a facility that is an operational optimal position then then obviously we WE WANT TO KEEP OUR FLEXIBILITY MOST OF THE TIME BACK TO BACK WITH CUSTOMERS WHERE WE SAY WE HAVE A FIVE OR I DON'T KNOW TEN YEARS CUSTOMER CONTRACT YOU KNOW I'M JUST MAKING AN EXAMPLE AND WE MATCH THAT WITH OUR LEAST COMMITMENTS IT'S FLEXIBILITY THAT IS THAT IS THAT IS DRIVING OUR ASSET LIGHT BUSINESS MODEL RIGHT SO IF YOU ASK US YOU KNOW EACH ANSWER IS GONNA BE THE MORE FLEXIBLE THE BETTER WE ONLY MAKE INVESTMENTS TO Situations where locations do not provide the required quality of facility. I give you one example a few years back. We were investing into a pharma hub in singapore because there was no such pharma space available, right? So with a couple of ups and downs, you know, right now, it it became a very good decision, you know, in the in the current circumstances to have that space available. So but this is really the exception where there is a good quality facility. REASON WHY TO INVEST OUR OWN MONEY IN IN IN ALL THE OTHER CASES A LEASE AGREEMENT BACK TO BACK WITH THE CUSTOMER WILL BE PREFERABLE DSO SECOND QUESTION DSO WE NEVER SELL ON PAYMENT TERMS WE DON'T THIS IS IRRELEVANTLY OF ANY PRESSURE DEMAND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE SELL BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY GOOD SERVICE WE ARE FULLY OPERATIONAL WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET WE ARE NOT WE ARE NOT SELLING ON TERMS I didn't write down the last one, can you make it long form and include income from disposals? Oh, income from disposals, in the first half? No, in the second half? Oh, in the second half. I will be we have a second real estate portfolio that is out for sale. I do not expect material impact on the pnl out of that. So it's going to be less than ten million. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. The next question comes from Manabu Kakayanagi from the Bank of America. Please go ahead. WELL AS THE IMPACT ON VOLUMES FROM A LOWER PERISHABLES SO AS THAT NORMALIZES HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IT IN THREE QUEUES AND THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND THEN SECOND RULE WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN FROM THE DIGITAL FORWARDERS DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC AND HAVE YOU SEEN A HYBRID OR MORE PRESENCE FROM THEM DURING THE CRISIS Money. Okay, let me answer your question. The latter question. I don't know what digital forwards are. But I would believe our digital solutions got a lot of pickup during the crisis. We have not seen many of our competitors in general being active or aggressive in the market. I would say a handful have been. The rest somehow disappeared and I'm not exaggerating. So. I will not name any and I will not give any comments on on single forwarders. The quantification of the benefits from perishables. First of all, perishables is a low low-margin business, and we had less perishables one-third less approximately volume, one-third less perishables in the first semester. That led to the cargo mix to a higher yield, independent order. Whether charter was available or required or the rate spiked or not we believe that this perishable volume comes back gradually in the second semester and thus the mix would reinstate with a lower yield. So the seventy to eighty five Swiss francs per hundred kilo will become a reality also because of the cargo mix. The volume being being perishable. I hope that helps. I hope that helps. Thank you. You're welcome. The last question comes from Sebastian Fogle from Ubisoft. Please go ahead. Hello, I've got two questions. The first one will be on contract logistics. You mentioned there your cost, your expenses came down quite a bit. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. Can you add more granularity on how the different cost items, i.e. personal costs and the other one, SGA, have contributed to this development in the second quarter? And the other question I have, if I calculated correctly, your conversion ratio, particularly in Asia, was quite high in the second quarter. Is that mainly a function of the transport mode exposure of that region?\n\nSo, Ravi, first of all, we don't look at conversion rates per region because it depends on the transport mode exposure of that region. Terms our customers apply on where to you know, invoice and pay transport bills. So it's skewed, be careful. We have a, we have a profit-sharing model, so that is within or internally between regions. So that will not really help. The conversion rate, for sure, is influenced by the performance of the different business units. And yes, in quarter two, air freight or air logistics has been extremely successful. The question on contract logistics and cost development, the majority of the cost is people, colleagues and the second cost factor is lease. I gave an answer on the lease already, because 50% or a bit more of our contracts are all back to back, we dedicated it with single customer, so the fixed cost coverage is usually part of our contracts, so that is not an exposure and the rest is capacity and we breed it. Eased with the volume very well. Yes, we did not have a mass layoff. We stated so many times, it's not necessary because from the beginning of the pandemic, we said this would be in a situation that would that is limited by time. It would not end up in a permanent situation and that is exactly what we see. Many of the operations are back. I mentioned that only twelve operations out of more than six hundred contracts excites us. Still locked down and eleven out of them are in one country because some infrastructures have not opened yet. And the rest is fully operational or has started to become operational again. Maybe not a three-shift operation, but a weekend shift. But if you look into China and China is maybe a we can learn from China or Asia because they went through this pandemic very early and and gradually we have full employment in our own country. Operations in China we have additional shifts introduced in our line feeding automotive production line services spare parts services and we see an increasing and strong demand for a lot of goods out of China and therefore we see that a lot of our customers start picking up in volume again is is this v t w o or whatever letter of our customers start picking up in volume again is is this v t w o or whatever letter of our customers start picking up in volume again is is this v t w o or whatever letter of our customers start picking up in volume again is is this v t w o or whatever letter of our customers start picking up in volume again is is this v t w o or whatever letter of our customers start picking up in volume again is is this v t w o or whatever letter of our customers start picking up in volume again is is this v t w o or whatever BUT IT'S NOT AS FAST AS WE THOUGHT BUT THIS SLUMP WAS NOT AS SEVERE AS WE ANTICIPATED BEFORE. SO I HOPE THAT HELPS TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT'S PERSONAL COST IS THE MAIN FACTOR AND WE ARE ALMOST IN FULL EMPLOYMENT AGAIN IN CONTRACT LOGISTICS THAT MEANS WE HAVE A GROSS PROFIT RELATED TO THAT ACTIVITY AND THE REST IS LEASE COST AND OUR IDLE CAPACITY HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY WE ARE BELOW THREE PERCENT IN IDLE CAPACITY THAT'S A LEADING INDICATOR IN OUR INDUSTRY THANK YOU SEBASTIANA GENTLEMEN THAT WAS THE LAST QUESTION THANK YOU ZANDRA LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LOGISTICS IS PEOPLE BUSINESS AND WE ARE PROUD OF OUR PEOPLE THEY HAVE MANAGED THIS CRISIS EXTREMELY WELL AND WE ARE HONOURED BY OUR CUSTOMERS Of their loyalty and their business that they awarded to us during the last, especially last quarter. We will see how we progress over the next quarter, quarter three, and we are looking forward to talking to you again in the middle of October. And in the meantime, stay healthy, don't travel too much, don't forget to use masks because we need you as end consumers like millions and billions of others. Because end consumers drive our business model and we want to see a strong quarter three when we talk next. Thank you very much and talk to you again soon. Have a nice summer. Bye. And talk to you again soon. Have a nice summer. Bye."

MINUTES AND THEN WE WILL OPEN A Q&A SESSION DURING WHICH WE WILL TRY AS ALWAYS TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WELL AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND NOW I WILL HAND THE FLOOR TO THE PRESIDENT MR ANTONIO LLARDEN GOOD MORNING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY I'M ACCOMPANIED AT THIS CONFERENCE BY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MARCELINO OREJA SECRETARY GENERAL RAFAEL PIQUERAS CFO BORJA GARCIA-ALARCON AND THE INVESTOR RELATIONS TEAM BY HIS MANAGER MR ANTONIO VELAZQUEZ-GAZTELU AND CESAR GARCIA DEL RIO WE ARE HOLDING THIS MEETING WITH MASKS SO I DO APOLOGIZE FOR YOU SINCE YOU CANNOT HEAR US CORRECTLY BUT I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR US AND FOLLOW US CORRECTLY WE HELD THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING BARELY A MONTH AGO REVIEW THE MOST RELEVANT ISSUES ON THE PROGRESS OF THE COMPANY AND DURING WHICH WE EXPLAINED HOW WE ARE FACING THE SITUATION STEMMING FROM THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC THE CONCLUSIONS ARE CLEAR WE'VE RESISTED WELL IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE PRESENTING TODAY REFLECT THIS RESILIENCE AS WE ARE IN THE EQUATOR OF THE YEAR LET ME BRIEFLY REMIND YOU THE OBJECTIVES FOR THE YEAR I WILL ALSO MAKE A SUMMARY OF THE PROJECTS OVER THE COMPANY IN THE FIELD OF DECARBONIZATION AND OUR COMMITMENT TO THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND FINALLY I WILL DO AN OVERVIEW OF OUR DIVIDEND POLICY AS WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC OUR PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE TO PROTECT THE SAFETY HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF OUR PROFESSIONALS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE WITH FULL NORMALITY THE SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE FOR SECURITY THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY DURING THESE TROUBLED MONTHS ENAGAS HAS RESISTED WELL VERY WELL AND THIS RESISTANCE HAS BEEN POSSIBLE BECAUSE AMONG ALL THE THINGS WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A RIGOROUS CONTINGENCY PLAN EVEN BEFORE THE DECLARATION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AS I WAS I ALSO EXPLAINED BACK IN TIME WHEN WE DID THE RESULTS OF A PRESENTATION OF THE FIRST QUARTER THIS PLAN HAS BEEN IT'S BEEN VERY EFFICIENT AND THANKS TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION THE GAS SYSTEM IS OPERATING WITH FULL NORMALITY I WILL NOT DWELL ON THE SECURITY MEASURES THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED IN FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE I ALREADY EXPLAINED THEM AT THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING AND ALSO IN THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION OF RESULTS OF THE FIRST QUARTER BUT I DO WANT TO STRESS THAT WE ARE STILL APPLYING THE MAXIMUM PRUDENCE AND PREVENTION WITH A VERY DETAILED FOLLOW-UP TO MINIMIZE RISKS OF CONTAGION AMONG OUR PROFESSIONALS AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE LEVEL LET ME THAT THE SPANISH GAS SYSTEM HAS WORKED AND CONTINUES TO WORK UH NORMALLY DESPITE THE ADVERSE CONDITIONS WITHOUT INCIDENTS NEITHER RELY NEITHER LABOR-RELATED TECHNICAL OPERATIONAL WITH 100% PERCENT AVAILABILITY 24 HOURS A DAY EVERY DAY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR THE PRODUCTION OF THE REGAS PLANTS HAS INCREASED BY 17% COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF LAST YEAR 2019 ALSO IN SPAIN WE HAVE UH UNLOADED A TOTAL OF 126 LNG SHIPS THAT IS AN INCREASE OF 12.5% WITH REGARD TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR FOR THIS MONTH OF JULY FOR THE TOTAL OF THE MONTH OF THE MONTH UP TO 31ST DECEMBER WE ARE EXPECTING 24 21 UNLOADS THE CONTRACTED CAPACITY OF NATURAL GAS STORAGE IS OR ALSO AT A HISTORICAL RECORD NEARLY 12,000 KILOMETERS OF GAS PIPELINES AND COMPRESSION STATIONS HAVE OPERATED AT FULL TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY ALSO OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE WORKED AND CONTINUE TO WORK TO GUARANTEE THE SERVICES AND THE ENERGY SUPPLY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH GAS OPERATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT AND ALL OF THEM HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTINGENCY PLANS OF WHICH FURTHER DETAILS WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE PRESENTATION THIS RESISTANT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THIS YEAR WHICH ARE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE EXPECTED AND ARE EVEN SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN OUR EXPECTATIONS LET ME COMMENT RAPIDLY THE FIGURES THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT WE'VE OBTAINED PROFIT AFTER TAX OF 236.3 MILLION EUROS WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF 9.4% UH COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 MAINLY THIS IS IS THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE NONRECURRING FINANCIAL PROFIT AMOUNTING 18.4 MILLION EUROS AND THAT IS DUE TO THE EXCHANGE RATE DIFFERENCE GENERATED BY THE PURCHASE OF DOLLARS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE PHASE TWO OF TALLGRASS WHICH I ALREADY MENTIONED IN Q1 I I DO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE WITH THE MASK AND THE GLASSES I CANNOT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SPEAK AND TO CONTINUE THE RESULT OF OUR AFFILIATES AMOUNTED TO 76.2 MILLION EUROS THE NEGA THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE COVID EFFECTS ON THE REGULATED BUSINESS TOTALED 6.4 MILLION EUROS IN THE RCS WE ALSO HAVE A HIGH LIQUIDITY POSITION AND WE DO MAINTAIN A SOLID FINANCIAL STRUCTURE WITHOUT UM SIGNIFICANT MATURITY UH DEBTS DEBTS MATURITY UNTIL ' 22 AND WITH MORE THAN 80% OF OUR DEBT AT FIXED RATE LET ME REMIND YOU THAT OUR RATING AGENCIES STANDARD & POOR'S AND FITCH CONFIRMED BACK IN TIME THE RATING OF ENAGAS AT BBB+ WITH A STABLE PERSPECTIVE THAT IS IN LINE WITH OTHER SIMILAR COMPANIES AND EUROPEAN TSOS AS EXPLAINED IN THE PRESENTATION OF Q1 THE COMPANY HAS INTENSIFIED THE CONTROL PLAN AND SAVINGS IN FINANCIAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES AVOIDING EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY ACTIVE ESSENTIAL FOR THE ACTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT I DO APOLOGIZE BUT I HAVE TO TAKE OFF MY GLASSES OR THE MASK BECAUSE I CANNOT READ THE CURRENT SITUATION FOR 2020 MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS VERY CAUTIOUS IF IN FUTURE PROJECTIONS IN THE SECOND QUARTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SITUATION OF UNCERTAINTY GENERATED BY COVID-19 AND IN LINE WITH INTERNATIONAL RECOMMENDATION OF THE REGULATOR EUROPEAN SECURITIES AND MARKETS AUTHORITY ENAGAS HAS CARRIED OUT AN IMPAIRMENT TEST ON ITS MAIN INVESTMENTS THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH IAS 36 THIS ANALYSIS WAS VALIDATED BY AN INDEPENDENT EXPERT WHICH IS DUFF AND PHELPS THE CONCLUSION OF THIS ANALYSIS REDO REVIEWED ALSO BY OUR AUDITOR IS THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO MAKE ANY CORRECTION TO THE VALUE OF THIS INVESTMENT IN ENAGAS IN ENAGAS' BALANCE SHEET THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS ALLOWS US TO CONSIDER THAT WE DO CAN MAINTAIN THE OBJECTIVES AND COMMITMENTS ESTABLISHED FOR THIS YEAR 2020 ESTIMATING THE NET PROFIT AT 440 MILLION EUROS WE ALSO MAINTAIN OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS' REMUNERATION WITH AN INCREASE IN THE DIVIDEND OF 5% WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WAS PAID IN 2019 AND I WILL PAUSE ON THIS POL UH ON THIS POINT LATER <FOREIGN> REGARDING THE CHANGES IN DEMAND AND FOR NATURAL GAS I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE CONVENTIONAL ASPECT BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF INDUSTRY AND CONSUMPTION YOU KNOW THAT DEMAND FOR GAS FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION DEPENDS ON OTHER FACTORS REALLY SUCH AS THE AVAILABILITY OF RENEWABLE ENERGY WATER GAS ET CETERA IN ANY CASE YOU CAN ACCESS PERMANENT DETAIL INFORMATION ON THESE FLUCTUATIONS IN GAS DEMAND ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE T- TO KNOW THE EVOLUTION OF THE DEMAND CONVENTIONAL DEMAND AS I SAID IN APRIL AT THE STRICTEST MOMENT OF CONFINEMENT STOOD AT APPROXIMATELY 76% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR ' 19 2019 SINCE THEN A PROGRESSIVE RECOVERY HAS OCCURRED AND TODAY WE ARE ALREADY AROUND 92% IF WE COMPARE IT WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019 WE HOPE THAT THIS RECOVERY IN DEMAND WILL BE CONSOLIDATED SLOWLY PROGRESSIVELY IN THE SECOND SEMESTER BECAUSE THIS WILL BE A GOOD REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT THE INDUSTRIAL FABRIC OF OUR COUNTRY IS ALSO RECOVERING IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL AFFILIATES TALL GRASS IN THESE HALF YEARLY RESULTS AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE CRISIS CAUSED BY COVID-19 IS HAVING A GLOBAL IMPACT WE HAVE INCORPORATED AS YOU SEE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OUR MAIN AFFILIATES ESPECIALLY THE NORTH AMERICAN COMPANY TALLGRASS ENERGY ALLOW ME TO REMIND YOU YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT THAT ON 17TH OF APRIL WE CEASED TO EXTEND OUR INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY OBTAINING 30.2% OF THE SHAREHOLDING SO IN THIS PRESENTATION AND I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY MARKET IN THESE LAST FEW MONTHS LIKE PRICE PERFORMANCE DEMAND DATA CURRENT SITUATION AND FUTURE PROJECTS IN THE CASE OF UH TAP THE PROJECT IS PROGRESSING AS PLANNED AND THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN 96.4% IMPLEMENTED IT IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR YESTERDAY A VERY CONCRETE TECHNICAL PIECE OF NEWS OF TAP IS THAT THE LAST WELDING OF THE LAST PIPE WAS OCCURRED WAS WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE PIPELINE THAT IS LINKED IN ITALY TO THE HIGH-PRESSURE UM GRADE OF SNAM SO THAT'S A GOOD NEWS ACTUALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOUTH PERU GAS PIPELINE I UPDATE THIS SITUATION THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN ICSID IS FOLLOWING THE NORMAL COURSE ON JULY 19 THE PERUVIAN STATE FILED ITS DEFENSE AND CURRENTLY OUR INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ADVISERS ARE WORKING ON THE NEXT STEPS TO FOLLOW ACCORDING TO THIS ARBITRATION CALENDAR AS YOU KNOW IN RELATION TO PERU ON JULY 15 10 DAYS AGO ONE WEEK AGO A NEW PRIME MINISTER WAS APPOINTED IN PERU MR PEDRO CATERIANO AND SEVERAL MINISTERS WERE REPLACED INCLUDING THE MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND MINES AT ENAGAS WE MAINTAIN OUR WILLINGNESS TO REACH AN AMICABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE PERUVIAN STATE IN ORDER TO END THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURE AFTER REVIEWING THE MAIN TOPICS OF THE SEMESTER AND I'M WILL DISCUSS ON OUR COMMITMENT ON DE-CARBONATION DE-CARBONIZATION I'M SORRY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS PRESENTED THE COMMUNICATION HYDROGEN STRATEGY FOR CLIMATE-NEUTRAL EUROPE TWO WEEKS AGO WHICH INCLUDES INVESTMENT OF BETWEEN 188,000 MILLION EUROS AND 400,000 MILLION EUROS IN RENEWABLE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION CAPACITY UNTIL 2050 THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT IS WORKING ON THE SAME LINE TO HAVE HYDROGEN ROAD MAPS AND BIOGAS AND STORAGE STRATEGY IN THE SECOND SEMESTER OF LAST YEAR UH LAST WEEK THE ECOLOGIC TRANSITION MINISTRY AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGE MINISTRY LAUNCHED THE DECARBONIZATION STRATEGY AT THE LONG TERM AT ENAGAS WE HAVE ARE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING I'M SORRY IN PROPOSING SPECIFIC MEASURES AND PRIOR PUBLIC CONSULTATION OF THESE ROADMAPS PROMOTED AS I WAS SAYING BY THE MINISTRY OF ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION AND DEMOGRAPHICS CHALLENGE PRESIDED OVER BY VICE PRESIDENT TERESA RIBERA IN THE CASE OF EUROPEAN LEVEL TOGETHER WITH TSOS COMING FROM NINE MEMBER STATES WE PRESENTED ON JULY 17 A REPORT IN BRUSSELS CALLED EUROPEAN HYDROGEN BACKBONE PLAN TO DEVELOP AS SPECIFIC HYDROGEN TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IN EUROPE ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT WHICH IS A FAST REFLECTION REPORT ON THESE MATTERS EXISTING GAS INFRASTRUCTURES CAN BE ADOPTED TO TRANSPORT HYDROGEN AT AN AFFORDABLE COST WITHOUT ANY KIND OF RELEVANT TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AS FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS IN THE FIELD OF HYDROGEN AS WE SAID IN THE FIRST QUARTER WE ARE WORKING ON THE GREEN CRANE PROJECT WITH OTHER COMPANIES ESPECIALLY SNAM WHICH AIMS AT DEVELOPING A HYDROGEN CORRIDOR FROM SOUTHERN EUROPE TO THE NORTH WHICH WAS PRESENTED IN BRUSSELS AS A CANDIDATE FOR A PROJECT OF COMMON EUROPEAN INTEREST IT INCLUDES A SERIES OF INITIATIVES THAT WILL BE LATER STUDIED THAT WILL ALLOW COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN EUROPE TO BE POSITIONED AS BENCHMARKS IN THE GENERATION OF GREEN HYDROGEN THESE PROJECT WILL ALLOW US TO DECARBONIZE MORE SECTORS TO STRENGTHEN THE EUROPEAN ENERGY SYSTEM AND TO POSITION SPAIN AS A GATEWAY FOR HYDROGEN IN EUROPE WITH EXISTING STORAGE AND TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN BUILT IN A DIGIT IN ADDITION TO HYDROGEN WE'RE WORKING ON OTHER SPECIFIC PROJECTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO DECARBONIZATION PROMOTING THE USE OF LNG AS FUEL UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS AREA A FEW WEEKS AGO THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL SUPPORT ENAGAS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF 16 LNG VEHICLE SUPPORT POINTS BIOGAS AND HYDROGEN WITHIN THE ECONET PROJECT ALSO A FEW DAYS AGO THE EUROPEAN UNION GRANTED THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE SUBSIDY REQUESTED FOR TWO SPECIFIC SUPPLY LNG TO SHIPS PROJECTS BUNKERING IN BARCELONA AND ALGECIRAS IN THE SOUTH IN SOUTHERN SPAIN I MENTIONED THESE SPECIFIC PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY DEMONSTRATE ACCORDING TO US THE SUPPORT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE ROLE OF LNG BUT ALSO OTHER GASES AND RENEWABLE GASES IN THE DECARBONIZATION OF TRANSPORT SUB SECTORS ESPECIALLY MARITIME TRANSPORT IN THIS PRESENTATION YOU CAN SEE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE COMPANY IN THE FIELD OF SUSTAINABILITY AND I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONCE AGAIN THE COMMITMENT OF EACH AND EVERY ENAGAS PROFESSIONAL TO SUSTAINABILITY IN ITS BROADEST SENSE I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THE FIGURES THAT WE UH PROVIDE YOU WITH THE RESULTS PRESENTATION IN FEBRUARY BUT ENAGAS HAS A PLAN TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS WITH THE MILESTONES IN 2030 2040 THAT WILL CULMINATE IN 5020 WITH THE NEUTRALIZATION OF CARBON ZERO CARBON SO WE CONTINUE WITH THIS PLAN OBVIOUSLY AND BEFORE FINISHING MY SPEECH I WANT TO PAUSE BEFORE ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES WHICH IS OUR COMMITMENT TO SHAREHOLDER REMUNERATION I REMIND YOU THAT THESE TIMES MANY COMPANIES WERE NOT ABLE TO FACE THEIR COMMITMENTS AND MEET THEIR COMMITMENT I REMIND YOU THAT AT THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING HELD ON JUNE 30 THE PAYMENT OF A COMPLIMENTARY DIVIDEND PLAN WAS APPROVED FOR 2019 OF 0.96 EUROS PER SHARE WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 9 AND W- WHICH IS IN LINE WITH OUR ANNUAL DIVIDEND COMMITMENT IN 2019 OF 1.60 EUROS PER SHARE AS I HAVE MENTIONED THE RESULT OF STRESS TEST AND THE IMPAIRMENT TEST PERFORMED BY THE COMPANY IN THIS CLIMATE OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY ENABLE US TO REAFFIRM WITH THE INFORMATION WE HAVE NOW OUR DIVIDEND COMMITMENT FOR 2020 OF 1.68 EUROS PER SHARE WHICH WOULD PRESENT AN INCREASE OF 5% AND TO MAINTAIN OUR ANNOUNCED DIVIDEND POLICY FOR 2020 2026 TO CONCLUDE ONCE AGAIN IN A CONTEXT IN WHICH UNCERTAINTY IS THE ONLY CERTAINTY THE COMPANY IS CLEAR ABOUT ITS PRIORITIES WE HAVE RESISTED THESE AGITATED FIRST FEW MONTHS AND THE RESULTS THAT WERE PRESENTED TODAY ARE A REFLECTION OF THIS WITH THE DATA THAT WE HAVE TODAY WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN ALL OF OUR COMMITMENTS FOR 2020 AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON NEW FUTURE PROJECTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS NOW PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK THE TEAM WE'LL ENDEAVOR TO ANSWER TO THEM AS FULLY AS WE CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WANT TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE DIAL DASH ONE ON YOUR PHONE TO CANCEL PUSH DASH TIP FIRST QUESTION JAVIER SUAREZ OF COMING FROM MEDIOBANCA MR SUAREZ YOU HAVE THE FLOOR GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THREE QUESTIONS FIRST ON HYDROGEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS PRESENTED ITS STRATEGY INTO 2050 AND IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HYDROGEN SHOULD HAVE A RELEVANT ROLE IN THE EFFORT TO DECARBONIZE ECONOMY BY 2050 THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS NEW STRATEGY AT EUROPEAN AND SPANISH LEVEL FOR HYDROGEN IS A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE FOR THE PROFILE OF THE COMPANY IS IT IS IT A GAME CHANGER FOR ENAGAS SHOULD ENAGAS CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PLAN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND DEREGULATING AND GOVERNMENT AND ENTITIES AND INVESTORS SHOULD THEY SEE ENAGAS WITH DIFFERENT EYES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE FACTS THAT IT WOULD BE A NETWORK TO TRANSPORT A COMMODITY THAT IS GOING TO IMMEDIATELY REDUCE E- EMISSIONS SECOND QUESTION TALLGRASS IN THE UNITED STATES DO YOU SEE ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DIFFICULTIES OR THE POSSIBLE DIFFICULTIES OF GAS AND OIL OFF-TAKERS IN THE UNITED STATES CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT YOU SEE OPERATIONALLY BECAUSE THESE HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT MONTHS FOR THESE COMPANIES AND THE THIRD QUESTION IS COULD YOU GIVE US AN ESTIMATE ON THE GAS CONSUMPTION IN SPAIN FOR 2020 AS A WHOLE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR JAVIER SUAREZ FROM MEDIOBANCA FIRST QUESTION YES WE START WITH OUR OPINION WE DO CONSIDER THAT THE TRANSITION ENERGY TRANSITION PROCESS THAT ALL THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND THE EU AS SUCH HAVE ON THE TABLE WILL NOT BE DONE IF WE DON'T CONTRIBUTE IN A TWOFOLD WITH RENEWABLE GASES SOMETHING THAT UNTIL NOW HAS ALMOST NO WEIGHT HYDROGEN BIOGAS ET CETERA AND EVEN DECARBONIZATION PROCESS IN SUB SECTORS WHERE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ELECTRIFY LNG THERE PLAYS A ROLE AND I WAS SAYING A TWOFOLD BECAUSE THE OTHER CONTRIBUTION IS THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT THE STORAGE AND TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURES FOR GAS IN EUROPE ARE VERY GOOD TO MAINTAIN THE ROLE OF GAS IN THE TRANSITION PROCESS NOT EVERYBODY CONSIDERS IS GOING TO BE KEY BUT ALSO IN ORDER TO SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR THIS HYDROGEN DEVELOPMENT AND FOR RENEWABLE GASES PROJECTS WE'RE CONVINCED ABOUT THAT AND IN THE FIRST DOCUMENTS ISSUED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION THEY STATE THAT THEY DO BELIEVE THAT THAT THE TSOS WILL PLAY A RELEVANT ROLE IN THIS FIELD AND THE CONTACTS THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH THE MINISTRY OF ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION ALLOW US TO THINK THAT ONCE WE SEE ALL THE PUBLIC OPINION PROCESSES ARE OVER AND PUBLIC CONSULTATION ARE OVER WE WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE THERE AND FURTHERMORE WE DO WANT TO PLAY THAT ROLE SO FOR THE TIME BEING AS YOU'VE SEEN WE'RE DEVELOPING SOME MINOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS AND MOST OF THEM WE CAN CALL THEM PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROJECTS THAT IS POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE TRANSPORT HYDROGEN AND DECARBONIZE AND HONESTLY I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR TSO ROLE AND NOT ONLY OURS BUT OTHER THE ROLE OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE COMING YEARS WILL CHANGE SLIGHTLY FROM BEING ONLY LIMITED TO THESE TRANSPORT AND STORAGE OF NATURAL GAS TSOS IN EUROPE OR AT LEAST THE ONES WITH THIS AIM IN MIND WILL DO ALL THIS AND ALSO WE WILL COMPLIMENT THAT ROLE WITH UM UH AMONGST OTHER ACTORS AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH HYDROGEN DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW AND I CAN NOT AND NO ONE CAN TELL YOU SPECIFIC FIGURES AND TIMELINES THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE ANY IMMEDIATE PROCESS THIS IS GOING TO TAKE TIME IN THE COMING TWO THREE OR FOUR YEARS THIS WILL DEVELOP AND WE WILL START TO HAVE WELL I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU WE HAVE ALREADY A FEW PROJECTS AND SOME WITH THE SUPPORT FROM THE EA EU BUT THEY ARE SMALL PROJECTS SO I THINK THAT IN THE COMING TWO THREE FOUR YEARS AS I WAS SAYING WE WILL SEE HOW A GENERAL MAP OF ACTIVITY IN THIS FIELD W- WILL BE OUTLINED AND ALSO WE WILL ALSO SEE A CALENDAR AND THEN WE WILL HAVE TO ADAPT OF COURSE TO THE INSTRUCTIONS UH ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMISSION OR THE PARLIAMENT BUT I CAN CLEARLY TELL YOU THAT ENAGAS IS WILLING TO COLLABORATE WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS SINCE QUITE SOME TIME WE'RE ALREADY WORKING ON IT SO I CONCLUDE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR SUCH A LONG ANSWER I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR ROLE AS A TSO AS UH THE THE ROLE OF OTHER TSOS WILL CHANGE IN A POSITIVE SENSE IN THE COMING YEARS PROBABLY HAVING NEW TASKS TO UNDERTAKE SECOND QUESTION I'VE GOT THE CF UH CFO HE'S WEARING GLASSES READING GLASSES AND HIS MASK AND HE'S GOT THE SAME PROBLEM HE'S TAKING OUT HE'S TAKING OUT HIS MASK AND HE WILL ANSWER THANK YOU PRESIDENT THANK YOU ALL GOOD MORNING JAVIER LET ME ANSWER FOUR RELEVANT POINTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRESENTATION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS STRESSED IN HIS PRESENTATION FIRST WE SEE A RECOVERY OF OIL AND GAS PRICES AND RECOVERY IN THE PRODUCTION IN THE RELEVANT BASINS FOR THE OIL AND GAS TRANSPORT IN TALLGRASS SECOND TRANSPORTED VOLUMES ACCORDING TO JULY FIGURES AND THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE COMPANY FOR AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER WE SEE THAT THE TRANSPORT WILL BE IN LINE WITH THE VOLUMES TRANSPORTED PRE- COVID THREE AS IT'S BEEN EXPLAINED IN THE PRESENTATION AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE'VE FINISHED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CHEYENNE CONNECTOR AND THE CHEYENNE HUB AND THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PIECE FOR GETTING THE WEST TO EAST SECTION FROM ROCKY AND THEREFORE MEETING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE BUDGET MAYBE AS A FOURTH POINT BEFORE GOING TO THE FIGURES LET ME CONFIRM THAT TALL GRASS IS AN ASSET THAT HAS TO BEHAVE WITH LIMITED SENSITIVITY TO THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE U.S. MARKET THAT AS YOU KNOW HAS BEEN UNDER MUCH STRESS SO WITH THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF TODAY THE FREE CASH FLOW FOR TALLGRASS FOR THE YEAR-END TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE $170 MILLION AND HAVING INVESTED IN THE CHEYENNE CONNECTOR AND IN CHEYENNE HUB GIVES US A NET DEBT DEBT RATIO 4.1 × THE PAYMENT OF THE DIVIDEND 114 MILLION EUROS IS A RATIO OF NET DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO OF AROUND 4.5 4.6 × THIS IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE LIQUIDITY POSITION OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS HIGHER THAN $1 BILLION AND AS THE COMPANY HAS NO RELEVANT MATURITIES UNTIL 2022 AND THAT IS FULLY ALIGNED WITH THE LONG-TERM MODEL WITH THE CAPEX INVESTMENT INCLUDED AS WE'VE EXPLAINED IN OTHER OCCASIONS CAPEX THAT BECOMES EBITDA AT A MULTIPLE OF SIX TIMES EBITDA AND THAT NET DEBT RATIO IS THE ONE I WAS TELLING YOU IT'S IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT WITH INFORMATION WE HAVE NOW WE HAVE NO CHANGES WHATSOEVER IN THE DIVIDENDS ANNOUNCED FOR 2020 ' 26 NEITHER IN THE YIELD OF THE INVESTMENT COMMUNICATED TO THE MARKET AND AS A SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY THIS IS FULLY IN LINE WITH THE LONG-TERM MODEL WE HAVE SAID WHEN WE ACQUIRED TALLGRASS AND WHEN WE SHARED THIS INFORMATION WITH THE MARKET THANK YOU BORJA AND LET ANSWER THE THIRD QUESTION BY JAVIER SUAREZ CONSUMPTION AS WE'VE SAID WITH REGARDS TO INDUSTRIAL CONSUMPTION THE CONSUMPTION THAT WE CALL FOR OF THE CONVENTIONAL MARKET WE TOUCHED BOTTOM APRIL 76% OF THE DEMAND COMPARED TO LAST YEAR I'VE GIVEN YOU THE FIGURE OF RIGHT NOW 92 BUT IF WE COULD SEE THE EVOLUTION OF THE 26 27 DAYS OF JULY OF THIS YEAR THE DEMAND CONVENTIONAL DEMAND WOULD BE AT 93 THEREFORE FROM NOW UNTIL THE YEAR-END WE DO THINK THAT THESE CONVENTIONAL DEMAND MIGHT LITTLE BY LITTLE THIS WILL NOT BE ON A SUDDEN BASIS BUT IT WILL EVOLVE TOWARDS FULL NORMALITY BUT BEING CAUTIOUS AS WE WANT TO BE WE'VE DONE ALL OUR FORECASTS IN BUDGET ET CETERA WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A DECREASE OF THE TOTAL DEMAND IN ALL LINES OF 10% FOR THE YEAR A DECREASE OF 10% IN ORDER TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE BUT OF COURSE WE DO SEE THAT THE CONVENTIONAL DEMAND IN ALMOST ALL THE SECTORS EXCEPT FOR ONE SERVICES BUT IN THE OTHER 12 SECTORS IN WHICH WE DIVIDE COMMERCIALLY SPEAKING THIS DEMAND THEY ARE AT A V SHAPE OF RECOVERY WHICH IS QUITE CLEAR AND THE AVERAGE WOULD BE AT 92% 93% SO TODAY WE'RE MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN WE PRESENTED THE FIRST QUARTER WE WERE SUFFERING THE FULL IMPACT OF THE DECREASE IN THE DEMAND AND WE DIDN'T WE WEREN'T EVEN CERTAIN THAT WE WOULD REACH ROCK BOTTOM WE'VE REACHED THAT BOTTOM AND WE ARE NOT OUR FIGURES OF THE DEMAND THAT I DARE TO SAY THAT ARE QUITE NORMAL BECAUSE I THINK THAT LAST YEAR WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL YEAR WITH REGARDS TO GAS DEMAND AND THEREFORE COMPARING TO LAST YEAR IS VERY STRICT IF WE CAN PUT IT THIS WAY SO WE'RE OPTIMISTIC WITH BEING CAUTIOUS AS I ALWAYS SAY BECAUSE WE'RE LIVING A CONTEXT OF A GREAT UNCERTAINTY BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT GAS DEMAND INDUSTRIAL GAS DEMAND AND ALL ITS BY-PRODUCTS TANKERS ET CETERA ET CETERA IS GOING IS BEHAVING WELL AND EVEN TANKERS RIGHT NOW TANKERS ARE ABOVE THE CONSUMPTION OF LAST YEAR THOUGH IT'S WEIGHT IN THE TOTAL LOAD OF THE INDUSTRIAL DEMAND IS SMALL WELL I THINK WE HAVE REPLIED TO ALL THE ALL THE THREE QUESTIONS THAT MR SUAREZ ASKED SPANISH THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM ALBERTO GANDOLFI FROM GOLDMAN SACHS MR GANDOLFI YOU HAVE THE FLOOR GOOD MORNING C- COMING FROM GOLDMAN SACHS IT WAS A LITTLE BIT CUT OFF SO THREE QUICK QUESTIONS AT TALLGRASS COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THE GAINS EBITDA NET BENEFITS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR AND PROBABLY YOU CAN EXPLAIN THE WORD WHAT WAS THE EVOLUTION COMPARED TO LAST YEAR THE SECOND QUESTION IS THERE ARE MANY ITEMS AND THE AFFILIATES THAT MOVE AROUND SO COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE OF 76 MILLION FOR THE FIRST HALF BUT THE BIGGER CONTRIBUTION OF TALLGRASS FOR THE SECOND PART THE SITUATION WOULD BE IMPROVED AND HYDROGEN AGAIN I'M SORRY TO REPEAT THAT BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN WE WILL BE BENEFITING FROM THESE INVESTMENTS BUT THE EUROPEAN STRATEGY CLEARLY STATES THAT THEIR STRATEGY IS UP UNTIL 2024 AND THEN ANOTHER STRATEGY FOR AFTER 2024 SO WOULD IT BE REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT BY 2024 FROM NOW TO 2024 WE WILL BE WE WILL HAVE MORE VISIBILITY ON THIS TOPIC ARE WE GOING TO INVEST MORE IN HYDROGEN AS A REGULATED ASSET IN SPAIN WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO THINK THAT THIS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASE DIVIDENDS AFTER 2024 THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MR GANDOLFI I THINK THE TWO FIRST QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED BY MR BORJA GARCIA-ALARCON AND I'LL RESPOND TO YOUR THIRD QUESTION BORJA YOU HAVE THE FLOOR THANK YOU GOOD MORNING ALBERTO THE CONTRIBUTION FOR EQUIVALENCE FOR THE ENTIRE YEARS BEFORE THE PURCHASE BASE ALLOCATION A GUIDANCE OF 186 MILLION EUROS THAT COULD BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS OF THAT YEAR 74 MILLION FOR THE FIRST PART AND 110 FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WE NEED TO INDICATE THAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF TALLGRASS IS DIFFERENT SO THE CONTRIBUTION FOR THE FIRST SEMESTER IS 3.8 MILLION EUROS SECOND 53.4 MILLION EUROS SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO FROM A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW IS EXPLAINED BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRIBUTION OF NET INCOME OF TALLGRASS FOR THE FIRST HALF AND THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE SECOND SEMESTER BECAUSE THE SEC THE FIRST SEMESTER BEFORE THE APB WAS $22 MILLION FOR THE SECOND WILL BE 555 MILLION EUROS THIS IS DUE TO THE RECRUDING OF REX AS FORESEEN ONCE CHEYENNE CONNECTOR WAS IMPLEMENTED SECONDLY THE DEBTS IN TERMS OF THAT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BUT THERE'S AN IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENT PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF TRANSFERRING U.S. GAAP BY TALLGRASS ACCOUNTS TO IRFS IRFS WHICH IS THE REAL ESTATE TAX IS PAID IN JANUARY AND THEN U.S. GAAP IS DONE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO FOR THE FIRST HALF THE IMPACT WAS NEGATIVE DUE TO THE $3.1 MILLION DIFFERENCE AND THE SECOND HALF THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE POSITIVE $16.2 MILLION WHICH UH WHICH IS EXPLAINED BY THE FACT OF CHANGING UH THE RESULTS AND MOVING FROM 3.8 TO 53.4 SO JUST TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE EBITDA ALBERTO WAS ASKING ABOUT THIS WE HAVE AN EXPECTED EBITDA OF $800 MILLION A BDI OF $300 MILLION FINANCIAL EXPENSES EXPENSES OF ONE $181 UH MILLION AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR $65 MILLION MULTIPLIED BY EXCHANGE RATES IS $250 MILLION THAT I SAID AT THE BEGINNING THAT WAS THAT WERE NECESSARY TO BUILD UP ALL THIS THANK YOU ABOUT BORJA ALBERTO IN TERMS OF THE THIRD QUESTION WE THINK THAT WE HAVE TO SAY THINGS ORDERLY FROM NOW TO THE END OF THE YEAR WE WILL HAVE THAT ROADMAP OF RENEWABLE GAS AND HYDROGEN THIS IS WHAT THE ECOLOGICAL ECOLOGY TRANSITION MINISTRY SET TO US IN TERMS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION P- PLANS I DON'T DARE GIVING YOU DATES BUT BETWEEN ' 21 ' 22 THERE'S IMPORTANT PAPER LAUNCHED BY THE COMMISSION WILL HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TOUCHED ABOUT BY STAKEHOLDERS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ET CETERA SO WE WILL HAVE PROBABLY A BIGGER ROADMAP MANY TSOS AS I SAID BEFORE ARE WORKING AT THE EUROPEAN HYDROGEN BACKBONE PLAN AND WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER FOR THAT I THINK BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND UP UNTIL THE END OF 2022 THE ROADMAPS WILL BE CLEAR I BELIEVE AT THE SAME TIME ALL THE TSOS ARE THINKING TO COME UP WITH A CONCRETE PROJECT WHICH WILL NOT HAVE A HIGH INVESTMENT ECONOMIC IMPACT BUT THESE ARE A PROOF-OF-PROJECT CONCEPT PURCHASE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO GENERATE HYDROGEN PRACTICALLY OR RENEWABLE GAS HOW THEY ARE TRANSPORTED WHO ARE END USERS ET CETERA THIS IS IMPORTANT ALL THE HYDROGEN ROADMAP SHOULD BE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ENERGY TRANSITION PLAN WHICH MEANS THAT CHANGES CANNOT HAPPEN UPSTREAM AND THE MIDSTREAM WITHOUT HAVING CLEAR IN MIND WHO ARE THE END USERS IT IS MEANINGLESS FOR US TO SAY I'M GOING TO GENERATE HYDROGEN AT A SPECIFIC POINT AND WHO'S GOING TO CONSUME THIS WELL I DON'T KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND EACH COUNTRY IS TRYING TO DO MEANING HAVING THINGS ORDERLY IMPLEMENTED MEANING WE WILL BE PART OF THE CHAIN BUT SOMEONE HAS TO BE AT THE END OF THE CHAIN SAYING I NEED AND I WANT THIS HYDROGEN FOR CONSUMPTION SO BETWEEN 2020 2022 ' 23 AND PROBABLY 23 WE WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT CONCRETE PROJECTS WITH END USERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THAT AND COMPANIES LIKE ENAGAS ARE REALLY INTO THAT PROVIDING YOU WITH FIGURES AS I WAS SAYING AT THE BEGINNING IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO DO NOW I HOPE THAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR BECAUSE THE ROADMAP WILL BE PREPARED WE WILL HAVE A CALENDAR AND THE VOLUME OF PROJECTS AND MIND BUT IN EUROPE I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 2022 AT LEAST SO WE CAN HAVE A CONCRETE WORKING PLAN THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN SPAIN WHEN IN SPAIN WHEN THE GAS ENERGY PLAN WAS PRODUCED THIS PLANNING WAS DISCUSSED BETWEEN 20 THE YEAR 2020 AND 2001 I'M SORRY IN 2002 THE FIRST CONCRETE DOCUMENT OF STRATEGIC PLAN WAS PRODUCED IN SPAIN AT THAT TIME FOR GAS AND THAT PLAN WAS STARTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED PRACTICALLY IN 2005 2006 ENAGAS CAME UP WITH A FIRST STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT OF THIS HELP PLAN IN MARCH 2007 SO BETWEEN THE APPROVAL IN 2002 AND THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION FIVE YEARS ELAPSED IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE BECAUSE AUTHORIZATIONS WERE REQUIRED APPROVAL WERE REQUIRED WAS REQUIRED ET CETERA IN THE CASE OF HYDROGEN THINGS ARE GOING TO BE QUICKER PROBABLY BUT THIS KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES A DEADLINE WHICH IS MORE OR LESS LONG FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION IF SOME YEARS AGO IF YOU WOULD ASK ME IF WE WOULD HAVE A PAPER FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION FROM NOW TO 2050 AND SAYING WILL WE HAVE A HYDROGEN ROADMAP IN THE NEXT MONTH IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME THIS TWO YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE SAID I DON'T KNOW NOW I CAN TELL YOU YES IT IS HARD THOUGH TO TELL YOU WHEN THE PROJECT CALENDAR WILL BE CREATED ESPECIALLY THE RULES OF THE GAME TO KNOW WHO WANTS HYDROGEN THE SPEED OF EACH COUNTRY IT IS NOT LIKELY FOR ALL THE COUNTRIES TO DO THE SAME TIME THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME WE'LL HAVE TO SEE I DON'T WANT TO ELABORATE ON ON THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS SO THANK YOU MR GANDOLFI FOR YOUR QUESTION SPANISH THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION WILL BE DONE BY JOSE RUIZ FROM BARCLAYS YOU HAVE THE FLOOR GOOD MORNING FROM BARCLAY'S THREE QUESTIONS FIRST COULD YOU CLARIFY IMPACT OF 12.3 MILLION POSITIVE IN THE GASODUCTO SUR WHERE DO THEY COME FROM IN SECOND QUARTER SECONDLY AFTER HEARING YOU ABOUT TALLGRASS THERE IS A PLAN FOR COST REDUCTION MISSING I THINK BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT'S A PROJECT FOR GROWTH I JUST WANTED TO FOR YOU TO CONFIRM THIS POINT IF YOU COULD OF COURSE AND THIRDLY AND GETTING BACK TO HYDROGEN I WANTED TO KNOW IF WITHIN THAT ROADMAP THERE IS AN INITIATIVE OF HAVE YOU HEARD OF ANY INITIATIVE ON THE SIDE OF THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO CREATE A HUB IT IS SOMETHING WHICH IS QUITE IN FASHION AND PORTUGAL THE NETHERLANDS AND THE U.K. HAVE ALREADY PRESENTED THEIR INITIATIVES THANK YOU SPANISH THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOSE JAVIER RUIZ THE FIRST TWO THE QUESTIONS WILL BE REPLIED BY BORJA BORJA GARCIA-ALARCON YOU HAVE THE FLOOR THANK YOU PRESIDENT JOSE JAVIER GSP TWO IMPACTS FIRST A NONRECURRING EXPENSE IN 2019 AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DELAY THAT WE INTRODUCED IN THE ACCOUNTS WAITING FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE ARBITRATION TO BE ISSUED IN 2022 INSTEAD OF 2021 THAT REPRESENTS THE NEXT AN EXPENSE THIS YEAR WE DON'T HAVE THAT EFFECT BUT WE HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT BECAUSE WE GET CLOSER TO 2022 DATE THAT WE HAVEN'T CHANGED SO THE ADDITION TO THOSE TWO IMPACTS ARE THE 12 MILLION EUROS THAT APPEAR IN THE P&L AND AS FOR TG THE EFFORTS IN IN OPERATIONAL EXPENSES AND EFFICIENCY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS FIGURES I'VE PROVIDED THANK YOU BORJA AS FAR AS HYDROGEN IS CONCERNED YES WE HAVE PRESENTED IN TWO DIFFERENT LINES ALWAYS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT WE'VE ALREADY EXPLAINED IT EXPLAINED IT IN THE GREEN CRANE AND EVEN WITH SNAM AND OTHER COMPANIES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POSSIBLE HUB FOR THE SOUTH OF EUROPE CONNECTED ON THE SIDE OF ENAGAS BUT ALSO ON SNAM'S SIDE WITH THE NORTH OF AFRICA SO THAT'S A POSSIBLE HUB IS PERFECTLY OUTLINED THERE THAT COULD BE USEFUL OF COURSE WHEN THE ROADMAP IN SPAIN IS OVER WE WILL SEE THE POSSIBILITY FOR OUR COUNTRY FROM DIFFERENT STANCES TOGETHER WITH PORTUGAL OF COURSE WILL BE PART OF THIS HUB AND AT THE SAME TIME LET US NOT FORGET THAT IT IS VERY POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST STEPS TO USE HYDROGEN IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITHIN THE ENERGY TRANSITION PLAN MOST OF THEM WILL HAVE INITIAL PROJECT THAT WILL BE INTERNAL P- PER COUNTRY IT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING BEFORE WE MIGHT HAVE A PLACE WITH SOMEONE OR WITH WE HAVE WHICH WILL BE THE FINAL USER USERS OF THIS HYDROGEN AND THEN THERE ARE COUNTRIES COMPANIES SUCH AS OURS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE WILLING TO COLLABORATE IN THESE PROJECTS SO THE IDEA OF MOVING BETWEEN COUNTRIES WILL TAKE PLACE THAT'S FOR SURE WE'RE JUST DOING OUR ANALYSIS BUT I'M ALMOST FULLY CONVINCED THAT THE FIRST PROJECTS WILL BE OF IF WE CAN PUT IT THIS WAY OF A NATIONAL NATURE PER COUNTRY IN VERY SPECIFIC POINTS LOCATIONS AND KNOWING THAT THERE'S AN END USER OR END USERS THAT ARE THERE ALREADY WILLING TO IMMEDIATELY RECEIVE THAT HYDROGEN OR THAT RENEWABLE GAS AND I THINK JOSE JAVIER WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COVER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS YES LET'S UM MOVE NOW TO THE UH QUESTIONS IN ENGLISH THIS QUESTION WILL COME FROM HARRY WYBURD OF BANK OF AMERICA PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN HI M- MORNING EVERYONE IT'S HARRY WYBURD FROM FROM BANK OF AMERICA AND SO THREE THREE QUESTIONS FROM UH ME PLEASE SO FIRSTLY JUST FOCUSING ON THE DOMESTIC BUSINESS YOU MENTIONED THIS UH A PRETTY SMALL 6.4 MILLION UM IMPACT UH IN THE FIRST HALF I WONDERED IF YOU COULD UM LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK THE FULL YEAR IMPACT OF UM VOLUME DECLINE WILL BE ON REGULATED REVENUES ON THE DOMESTIC BUSINESS AND THEN IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY I THINK UNDER THE NEW REGULATION THE RCS IN FUTURE YEARS OUT TO 2026 UH WAS ACTUALLY BASED ON THE RCS UH THIS YEAR IF I'VE UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY SO I WONDERED COULD YOU CONFIRM THAT THAT UNDERSTANDING IS CORRECT AND WOULD THAT MEAN IF THE RCS WAS LOWER THIS YEAR THAT THAT WOULD HAVE A UH A KNOCK-ON EFFECTS ON FUTURE YEARS AS WELL UH OR HAVE I MISUNDERSTOOD SOMETHING UH THERE AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION JUST ON ON YOUR AFFILIATES OVERALL I JUST WONDERED IF YOU COULD REMIND US HOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR AFFILIATE INCOME IS IN US DOLLARS I BELIEVE MOST OF IT IS DOLLARIZED OBVIOUSLY THE THE DOLLAR'S WEAKENED SOMEWHAT UM OVER THERE WERE THE LAST FEW WEEKS SO I'M JUST INTERESTED TO GET A REMINDER OF HOW MUCH IS IN DOLLARS AND AND THEN THIRDLY UH I'M AFRAID IT'S A IT'S AN OBLIGATORY UH HYDROGEN QUESTION BUT A A SPECIFIC ONE I THINK IN THE IN THE UM HYDROGEN BACKBONE REPORT UH YOU AND THE YOUR TSO COLLEAGUES QUANTIFIED THE TOTAL CAPEX SPEND UH AT AT A MIDPOINT OF ABOUT 40 BILLION EUROS UP TO 2040 IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IF IF I JUST EYEBALL THE MAP THAT YOU UH PUBLISHED IN THE IN THE SLIDES UH TODAY I THINK IS ON SLIDE 26 IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ROUGHLY SOMEWHERE AROUND A THIRD OF THE OF THE SIZE OF THE NETWORK JUST BY VERY APPROXIMATE UM GUESS DO YOU THINK THAT'S A FAIR GUESS AT WHAT YOUR SHARE OF THE 40 BILLION SPEND UM WOULD BE MANY THANKS OKAY THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR QUESTION THE TWO FIRST QUESTION THE CFO WILL GIVE YOU A DETAILED UH ANSWER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT CONCERNING RCS THE MERGED IMPACT IS EXPECTED AT $22 MILLION AND NET $17 MILLION AND FOR ' 21 ' 26 ACCORDING TO YOUR QUESTION THE NET IMPACT IN THE P&L ACCOUNT AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS 9 MILLION EUROS ON AVERAGE PER ANNUM AND CONCERNING THE CONTRIBUTION OF AFFILIATES FOR THE EQUIVALENT UH 90% 25% IS IN DOLLARS BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT QUINTERO TSP TALLGRASS TGP ALTAMIRA AND THEY ARE ALL DOLLARIZED AS YOU MENTIONED SO THE UH PERCENTAGE OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF DOLLARS TO THE P&L ACCOUNT IS QUITE HIGH THANK YOU BORJA AND TO CONCLUDE WITH THE HYDROGEN QUESTION IN OUR BACKBONE PLAN DOCUMENT INVESTMENT FIGURES ARE GIVEN 20 OR 60 BILLION FOR IN FOR FOR THE ENTIRETY OF EUROPE THE DOCUMENT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS A FIRST UH REFLECTION IS A DRAFT IT'S NOT UH AN INVESTMENT DETAILED PLAN BUT FROM A TECHNIC FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW WE SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THAT IN EUROPE AS A WHOLE AND IN SPAIN THE INFRA THE GAS INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK IS PERFECTLY FEASIBLE FOR IT TO TRANSPORT HYDROGEN WITH SOME NUANCES REGULATORY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS MUST BE SORTED OUT IN TERMS OF THE BLENDING SO THE UH PERCENTAGE OF HYDROGEN CAN BE USED IN ONE UH GRID M- MIXED WITH LNG THIS IS THE FIRST PHASE THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HISTORICALLY HAVE DIFFERENT TECHNICAL STANDARDS SOME UH STRICTLY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO SOME PART OF THE GRID WHERE HYDROGENS WILL BE USED AND IN THIS AT THIS POINT TECHNICAL MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR COMPRESSOR STATIONS FOR EXAMPLE AN INVESTMENT IS NECESSARY WE NEED TO SEE IF SECTIONS OF THE NETWORK WILL TRANSPORT ONLY HYDROGEN OR OR THEY TRANSPORT A BLENDED MORE INVESTMENTS PROBABLY ARE NECESSARY FOR REACHING A CONSUMPTION POINT OR A GENERATION POINT BUT THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL HAS NOT BEING INCLUDED IN THE PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED NOR HAVE THEM BE THEY'VE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE UH NATIONAL ROAD MAPS WE HAVE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF HOW RENEWABLE GAS WILL BE USED THE SECOND POINT IS A CALENDAR WITH SOME OBLIGATIONS THAT COUNTRIES IMPOSE THEMSELVES AND THE THIRD STEP IS TO SEE WHAT DOES WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED OR IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE ROAD MAP THIS IS WHERE WE ARE NOW AT NOW THE INVESTMENT FIGURES GIVEN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE A BROAD MARGIN BECAUSE THEY REACH 2050 SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S NOT EASY FOR US TO GIVE A FINAL FIGURE NOW AND BY HEART I CAN TELL YOU THE EUROPEAN UNION IS TALKING ABOUT ONE MILLION TONNES OF HYDROGEN IN 2050 WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THIS FIGURE IS EXPECTED OR IS HIGHER OR LOWER AND WE NEED TO SEE WHAT EACH COUNTRY IS GONNA DO BUT THIS WILL BE WILL HAVE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ENERGY ROAD MAP CHOSEN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE TO AT LEAST REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH GENERATORS TRANSPORTERS AND END CONSUMERS OF HYDROGEN OR RENEWABLE GAS WITHOUT WHICH TRANSITION WILL NEVER HAPPEN VERY LIKELY LIKE I SAID BEFORE THIS WILL COME OUT INITIALLY FROM PROJECTS WE ARE NOW P- PROMOTING NOW WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS COME TOGETHER TASTE STAKEHOLDERS COME TOGETHER SO IT'S A SPECIFIC PROJECT IN A SPECIFIC REGION WITH THE SPECIFIC CALENDARS IN MY PRESENTATION I MENTIONED SOME OF THEM OR A FEW OF THEM AND IN THE NEAR FUTURE GOVERNMENTS WILL SET ANNUAL CALENDARS FOR PROJECTS WE COULD ELABORATE ON THAT BUT I KNOW THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS LET'S GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION NOW THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR QUESTION OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM JAMES BRAND FROM DEUTSCHE BANK PLEASE GO AHEAD ALRIGHT GOOD MORNING UH THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS I I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON TALLGRASS AND THEN A FOLLOW-UP ON HYDROGEN SO ON TALLGRASS YOU GAVE QUITE CLEAR GUIDANCE FOR THIS YEAR WHICH I THINK ASSUMING I HEARD THE NUMBERS CORRECTLY UH CAME CAME DOWN TO 56 TO 57 MILLION OF PRE- PPA NET INCOME I WAS WONDERING WHETHER YOU COULD UH GIVE SOME EXPECTATIONS FOR THE NEXT YEAR JUST SO WE CAN GET A FEEL FOR HOW SOME OF THOSE POSITIVES THAT ARE COMING THROUGH IN H2 MIGHT LOOK IN IN A MORE NORMAL UH YEAR AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS I I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU FELT THE BIGGEST RISK WAS ON ON TALLGRASS IN IN THE SLIDES YOU HAD SOME VOLUME EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MAIN BASINS THAT THAT YOU'RE IN THAT LOOKED BROADLY THAT UH VOLUMES HAD COME DOWN A BIT BUT OVERALL WOODS WOULD RECOVER UM A LITTLE BIT UM AND PARTICULARLY IN A IN A COUPLE OF THE BASINS AND YOU'D START TO SEE SOME SOME GROWTH AGAIN IS WHAT IS THE MAIN RISK THAT OIL PRICES STAY LOW AND AND AND THAT GROWTH JUST DOESN'T COME THROUGH AND YOU SEE CONTRACTING PRESSURE AND I WAS WITHIN THAT UH IS THERE A PARTICULAR POINT OF OIL PRICES THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD START TO MAKE YOU A BIT MORE CONCERNED IF THEY STAYED AT 40 OR MAYBE THEY HAVE TO DROP UH MORE BUT UM APPRECIATE THOSE A FEW SUB QUESTIONS WITHIN THAT BUT JUST UH AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU THINK THE BIGGEST RISKS ARE FOR TALLGRASS AND THEN THE FOLLOW-UP AND HYDROGEN I MEAN I APPRECIATE THE LAST ANSWER UM AROUND UNCERTAINTIES AROUND THE COST AND POTENTIALLY MAYBE NOT HAVING TO SPEND THAT MUCH ON ON THE NETWORK TO ENABLE IT FOR HYDROGEN IS IS THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT THEN IF IT DOES COME THROUGH ADDING NEW PARTS TO THE PIPELINE NETWORK TO CONNECT TOP RENEWABLE CLUSTERS IF THAT'S DIRECT THE DIRECTION THAT WE THAT WE GO THROUGH IS THAT IS THAT THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY OF HYDROGEN IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO START TO EXTEND THE NETWORK SOME CONTEXT ON THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST THANK YOU WELL SPANISH WELL THANK YOU I THINK THAT CFO WILL ANSWER THE WHOLE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'VE UH RAISED WITH QUITE SOME DETAIL THANK YOU PRESIDENT THE CONTRIBUTION OF TALLGRASS YES TO THE POINT OF THE COMBINATION BETWEEN PPA 2020 WILL BE 56 MILLION EUROS AS WE SAID BEFORE THAT WILL STABILIZE AND EVEN GROW IN THE FUTURE AT AROUND 100 MILLION EUROS BEFORE PPA AND AFTER PPA THAT FIGURE WILL BE AROUND 60 MILLION WITH REGARDS TO LONG-TERM RISKS FOR TALLGRASS IN THE MODEL THE HIGHEST RISK WELL NOT RISK THE MILE THE BIGGEST MILESTONE IS MEETING THE CAPEX OBJECTIVES TO BUILD EBITDAS THAT WE EXPECT FOR 2024 ' 25 AND ' 26 IN THIS SENSE MAYBE THE CURRENT SITUATION SHOWS THAT THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT COMPETE THAT WON'T EVOLVE SO WE'VE GOT GOOD OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY FOR NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SPECIFIC BUT THERE ARE GOOD FORECASTS BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S THE MAIN RISK FOR THE FUTURE YES AS BORJA WAS SAYING THE INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR TALLGRASS WE HAVE WHEN WE FOLLOW IS GOOD BUT THE NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET IN THE WORLD MARKET HAVE REPRESENTED A SMALL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WHICH IS THE ONE THAT THE CEO AND BORJA WERE TALKING ABOUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE ARE NEW P- POSSIBLE P- PROJECTS NEW PROJECTS THAT WILL COMPETE WELL THEY HAVE DISAPPEARED BECAUSE OF THE MARKET SITUATION AND THAT PROVIDES A CLEAR ADVANTAGE TO THE ACTORS THAT ARE SUDDENLY INSTALLED TO JUST TALLGRASS ACTORS THAT HAVE GOT AS YOU VERY WELL KNOW AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR CONTRACTS THAT ARE INSURED SO TALLGRASS IS SELLING THAT LINE THEY HAVE FORESEEN TO MAKE THE MOST IN THE FUTURE OF OF THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY APPEAR WITH MINOR INVESTMENTS THAT WON'T BE STARTING FROM SCRATCH INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THAT ENTAILS MORE PROJECTS OF PERMITS ET CETERA BUT THEY WILL USE A VERY WIDESPREAD NETWORK AND THAT WHICH IS ALREADY PRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES THEY WILL USE THAT AND WITH UH NOT BIG INVESTMENTS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO NEW MARKETS SO IN THAT SENSE OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK IN TELLING THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIVITY FOR TALLGRASS WITH THE FIGURES WE HAVE AS INTERESTING AND WE DO RELY ON THAT LEG I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE GOT MORE QUESTIONS I'M TOLD THAT THERE ARE NO MORE QUESTIONS OH YES YES YES SORRY I DO APOLOGIZE THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS SO LET'S GIVE THE FLOOR TO THE NEXT QUESTIONS THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM OLIVIER VAN DOOSSELAERE FROM EXANE PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN YES GOOD MORNING AND AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING UH FOR TAKING OUR QUESTIONS UH I JUST HAVE TWO ON MY SIDE FIRST ONE IS GONNA BE ON ON THE GUIDANCE DO YOU STILL STICK TO THE 440 MILLION TO 4% YEAR-ON-YEAR GROWTH UH BUT REALLY YOU'VE DONE 9% IN H1 MAYBE WITH SOME ONE-OFFS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND FOR H2 YOU EXPECT ACTUALLY A BIG STEP UP FROM THE CONTRIBUTION FROM TALLGRASS SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THE GUIDANCE SEEMS TO BE PARTICULARLY CAUTIOUS FOR FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN THE SECOND ONE APOLOGIES BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY YOUR YOUR 10TH QUESTION ON ON HYDROGEN UM BUT UM IT IT LOOKS LIKE BY 2030 THE BIGGEST FIRST PART OF DEMAND WILL ACTUALLY JUST BE THE BLENDING OF HYDROGEN IN THE TRANSPORT AND THE NATURAL GAS MIX I THINK UH THE DOCUMENTS ARE TALKING A POTENTIAL 10% TO TO 20% OF OF HYDROGEN BEING MIXED IN THE IN THE TOTAL BLEND SNAM FOR EXAMPLE I THINK HAS ALREADY MENTIONED THAT FOR THEM THERE'S PROBABLY AROUND ONE THIRD OF THEIR NETWORK THAT WOULD ACTUALLY NEED UPGRADE UM TO BE ABLE TO COPE WITH UM WITH THE CHEMICAL UH AND PHYSICAL UM IMPLICATIONS OF THAT LEVEL OF HYDROGEN IN THE NETWORK HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE STATE OF YOUR NETWORK AND CAN YOU GIVE US A FEEL IN TERMS OF THE POSSIBLE NEED FOR FOR REPLACEMENTS OR UPGRADING OF YOUR NETWORK THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE SUCH A LEVEL OF HYDROGEN AND THEN COULD YOU ALSO TELL US IF WE SEE SOME ACCELERATED REPLACEMENTS OF YOUR BIKE IN ORDER FOR UM HYDROGEN TO BE ABLE TO FUEL THROUGH YOUR NETWORK AND BETTER IF THAT SHOULD BE ACTUALLY BOOKED ON YOUR SIDE AS AS AS AS CAPEX OR OR WILL THAT ACTUALLY BE EXPENSED AS AS OPEX UNDER YOUR CURRENT REGULATION OKAY MR VAN DOOSSELAERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE GUIDANCE THE CFO WILL GIVE YOU DETAILED INFORMATION OR PRECISE INFORMATION BORJA THANK YOU PRESIDENT OLIVIER WE KEEP THE GUIDANCE 440 MILLION THE BEHAVIOR WAS A LITTLE BETTER THAN EXPECTED BUT THE FACING THE ENTIRE DEVOLUTION OF THE UH MARKET THE UH FORECAST FOR THE YEAR IS 440 AND WE ARE TRUSTING ENOUGH IN THIS AND THERE'S IN TERMS OF THE SECOND QUESTION THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS GOING GO TO DWELL ON THEM MARCELINO YOU HAVE THE FLOOR YEAH WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT NETWORK APART FROM THE THE PIPELINE ACCEPTS 20 10 20% OF HYDROGEN WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND TO GENERATE 20% OF HYDROGEN OR NATURAL GAS THAT IS CONSUMED IN SPAIN NOW AS AN HYDROGEN A GREAT DEAL OF INVESTMENTS WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THE GENERATION OF THIS HYDROGEN WE ARE FAR FROM UH BEING REAL NOW AND WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS IN OUR UNIT AND WE ARE IMPLEMENTING STUDYING THAT AND IF WE THINK ABOUT 2035 2040 HAVING 100% PERCENT HYDROGEN UH NETWORK WE WILL HAVE SOME OF THE GAS THE PIPELINES THAT EXIST TODAY BUT NEW WILL HAVE TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT AND IMPLEMENTED THE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENT FOR THE NETWORK OR THE PIPELINE TO UM COPE WITH THE 20% OF HYDROGEN WE ARE FAR FROM THIS BEING TRUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SPANISH LET US MOVE ON TO THE LAST QUESTION OUR LAST QUESTION WILL COME FROM ANTONELLA BIANCHESSI FROM CITI PLEASE GO AHEAD YES HELLO UM JUST MOST OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED BUT UH I JUST WANTED TO COME BACK ON HYDROGEN YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT I FOUND EXTREMELY INTERESTING THAT YOU WILL START YOUR INVESTMENTS AND WHEN THERE WILL BE AN OFF-TAKER FOR YOUR HYDROGEN UH POTENTIAL SO I WONDER CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF THE TIMING I MEAN I THINK THAT THE MESSAGE IS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL INTERCONNECTION WHICH ARE NOT FULLY REGULATED WILL HAVE TO BE CONTRACTED BEFORE YOU WILL UH COMMIT ON INVESTMENT UM THEN YOU THINK THIS WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY SPANISH THANK YOU ANTONELLA LET ME REPLY THERE ARE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT ARE UNDER THE SAME UMBRELLA FIRST THE INVESTMENT IN OUR NETWORKS I'M TALKING ABOUT ENAGAS BUT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT OF ANY OTHER TSO IN EUROPE SO INVESTMENTS WILL BE DONE IN WILL DEPEND FULLY ON THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WE MAY RECEIVE FROM THE REGULATORS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID THAT THE USE OR MORE OR LESS HYDROGEN BLENDED WITH LA NATURAL GAS WAS IT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE SINCE THE BEGINNING WELL THAT DEP DEPEND ON THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND NORMS THAT ARE QUITE SIMPLE THIS IS NOT COMPLEX BUT IT WILL BE THE REGULATORS THE ONES THAT WILL SAY YES I WANT THAT IN SPAIN OR IN THAT FRANCE OR THAT IN ITALY WE HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF HYDROGEN WITHIN THE UH NATURAL GAS FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME THERE TECHNICALLY SPEAKING WE PERFECTLY KNOW WHAT'S THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO DO AND VERY PROBABLY THEY WILL BE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL BE REGULATED BY THE REGULATOR THIS AS A GENERAL RESPONSE THEN THE USE OF HYDROGEN SPECIFICALLY FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS NOT SO MUCH TO HAVE A GENERAL BLEND IN A IN THE GRID DEPENDS ON IF THERE ARE OFF-TAKERS COMPANIES CLIENTS THAT WANT TO USE THIS HYDROGEN AND THAT THEY CAN GET THIS HYDROGEN TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY SUCH AS FUEL FOR THEIR EQUIPMENTS OR WHATEVER THESE PROJECTS WILL HAVE TO STEM FROM THESE ROAD MAPS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE'VE GOT A SPECIFIC PROJECT TO GENERATE TRANSPORT AND USE HYDROGEN IN THE BALEARIC ISLANDS AND THAT'S A SPECIFIC PROJECT IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE OFF-TAKER WILL BE A UH A UH A COMPANY TRANSPORTING PASSENGERS AND THAT IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE THAT THAT DOESN'T NEED SPECIFIC REGULATION BUT USING IN THE SPANISH GRID OR THE FRENCH OR THE ITALIAN GRID PART OF UH OF HYDROGEN AS BLENDED WITH NATURAL GAS TO AMONG OTHER THINGS TO REDUCE THE CO2 EMISSIONS THAT WILL REQUIRE FROM A TECHNICAL REGULATIONS WHERE WE ARE INVOLVED OF COURSE THE MINISTRY IS INVOLVED AND THE MINISTRY HAS ASKED OUR OPINION ABOUT WHAT ARE THE TECHNICAL MEASURES THAT WE WILL HAVE WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THIS CALENDAR TO BE USED RENEWABLE GASES THAT'S WORK IN PROCESS UNDER PROCESS UNDER PROGRESS BUT AS OF JULY WE DON'T HAVE MORE DETAILS AS I WAS REPLYING TO A SIMILAR QUESTION BEFORE I THINK THAT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND THE END OF 2021 OR 2022 I THINK THAT THIS MAP THIS TECHNICAL REGULATORY MAP WILL BE FULLY FINISHED IN EUROPE AND IN PARALLEL WE WILL SEE SPECIFIC PROJECTS APPEARING AND THANK YOU ANTONELLA THERE ARE NO MORE QUESTIONS I'VE I'M TOLD SO APART FROM THE MINOR PROBLEMS OF THE MASK AND THE READING GLASSES <LAUGH> I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REPLY TO YOUR QUESTIONS UH WE DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE INTEREST ON THE COMPANY AND THE THE RELATION INVESTORS RELATIONS TEAM IF YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION WILL GIVE YOU DETAILED INFORMATION IF YOU REQUIRE IT FROM THEM THANK YOU SPANISH SO WITH THOSE THIS CONFERENCE ON THE FIRST SEMESTER 2020 RESULTS OF ENAGAS THANK YOU",

And finally, I will do an overview of our dividend policy. As we've been telling you since the beginning of the pandemic, our priorities have been and continue to be to protect the safety, health, and well-being of our professionals and their families and to continue to provide with the highest quality. FINALITY THE SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE FOR SECURITY THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY DURING THESE TROUBLED MONTHS A GAS HAS RESISTED WELL VERY WELL AND THIS RESISTANCE HAS BEEN POSSIBLE BECAUSE AMONG OTHER THINGS WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A RIGOROUS CONTINGENCY PLAN EVEN BEFORE THE DECLARATION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AS WAS ALSO EXPLAINED BACK IN TIME WHEN WE DID THE RESULTS OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY PRESENTATION OF THE FIRST QUARTER THIS PLAN HAS BEEN ITS BEING VERY EFFICIENT THANKS TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION THE GAS SYSTEM IS OPERATING WITH FULL NORMALITY I WILL NOT WELL ON THE SECURITY MEASURES THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED IN FOUR PEOPLE BECAUSE I ALREADY EXPLAINED THEM AT THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS MEETING AND ALSO IN THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION OF RESULTS OF THE FIRST QUARTER BUT I DO WANT TO STRESS THAT WE ARE STILL APPLYING THE MAXIMUM PRUDENCE Prevention with a very detailed follow-up to minimize risks of contagion among our professionals at infrastructure level let me say that the spanish gas system has worked and continues to work normally despite the adverse conditions without incidents, neither labor-related technical or operational with hundred percent availability twenty-four hours a day every day. In the first half of the year, the production of the rig gas plants has increased by seventeen percent compared to the first six months of last year. Also, in Spain, we have unloaded a total of one hundred twenty six lng ships that is an increase of twelve point five percent with regards to the same period of the previous year for these months of july. FOR THE TOTAL OF THE MONTH AND OF THE MONTH UNTIL TWENTY THIRD DECEMBER WE ARE EXPECTING TWENTY FOUR TWENTY ONE UNDERLOADS THE CONTRACTED CAPACITY OF NATIONAL GAS STORAGE IS OR ALSO AT ITS HISTORICAL RECORD NEARLY TWELVE THOUSAND KILOMETERS OF GAS PIPELINES AND COMPRESSION STATIONS HAVE OPERATED AT FULL TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY ALSO OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES Countries have worked and continue to work to guarantee the services and the energy supply in the countries in which gas operations are carried out. And all of them have also implemented their respective contingency plans of which further details will be provided in the presentation. This resistance has been shown in the results obtained in the first six months of this year which are... are in line with what we expected and are even slightly better than our expectations. let me comment rapidly the figures that are more important we've obtained profit after tax of two hundred thirty six point three million euros which is an increase of nine point four percent compared to the first six months of twenty nineteen mainly this is because this is a consequence of the non-recurring financial profit Amounting eighteen point four million euros and that is due to the exchange rate difference generated by the purchase of dollars for the acquisition of the phase two of tall grass which i already mentioned in hue one i do apologize because with the mask and the glasses i cannot it's difficult for me to speak and to continue the results of our affiliates amounted to seventy six point two million euros the gain the negative impact of our affiliates amounted to seventy six point two million euros the gain the negative impact of our affiliates amounted to seventy six point two million euros the gain the negative impact of our affiliates amounted to seventy six point two million euros the gain the negative impact of our affiliates amounted to seventy six point two million euros the gain the negative impact of our affiliates amounted to seventy six point two million eu The covid effects on the regulated business totaled six point four million euros in the rcs. we also have a high liquidity position and we do maintain a solid financial structure without far significant maturities until twenty two and with more than eighty percent of our debt at fixed rates. Let me remind you that our rating agencies, standard & poor's and moody's, confirmed back in time the rating of enagás at triple b plus with a stable perspective. that is in line with other similar companies and european tso's. as explained in the presentation of q one, the company has intensified the control plan and save things in financial and operating expenses, avoiding any rating downgrade. Anything that is not essential in order to maintain business continuity, activities, and employment. i do apologize, but i have to take off my glasses or the mask because i cannot read the current situation for twenty twenty means that we have to be very cautious, very cautious in future projections in the second quarter. And taking into account the situation of uncertainty generated by covid nineteen, and in line with the international recommendation of the regulator, european securities and markets authority, eni has carried out an impairment test on its main investments that, in accordance with ias thirty six, this analysis has validated by an independent expert which is duff and phelps. The conclusion of this analysis, reviewed also by our auditor, is that it is not necessary to make any correction to the value of these investments in Anadarko's balance sheet. The results of this analysis allow us to consider that we do can maintain the objectives and commitments established for this year twenty twenty estimating the net profit at four hundred and forty million euros. We also maintain our commitment to our shareholders' remuneration with an increase in the dividend of five percent with respect to what was paid in twenty nineteen and i will pause on this point on this point later. and i will focus on the conventional aspect because it is the most representative of the performance of industry and consumption you know the demand for gas for electricity generation depends on the conventional aspect because it is the most representative of the performance of industry and consumption you know the demand for gas for electricity generation depends on the conventional aspect because it is the most representative of the performance of industry and consumption you know the demand for gas for electricity generation depends on the conventional aspect because it is the most representative of the performance of industry and consumption you know the demand for gas for electricity generation depends on the conventional aspect because it is the most representative of the performance of industry and consumption you know the RELATED TO OTHER FACTORS REALLY SUCH AS THE AVAILABILITY OF RENEWABLE ENERGY WATER GAS ET CETERA IN ANY CASE YOU CAN ACCESS PERMANENT DETAILED INFORMATION ON THESE FLUCTUATIONS IN GAS DEMAND ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE TO KNOW THE EVOLUTION OF THE DEMAND CONVENTIONAL DEMAND AS I SAID IN APRIL AT THE STRICTEST MOMENT OF CONFINEMENT STUDIED AT ABOUT SEVENTY SIX PERCENT COMPARED To the same period last year nineteen twenty nineteen since then a progressive recovery has occurred and today we are already around ninety two percent if we compare it with the same period in twenty nineteen we hope that this recovery in demand will be consolidated slowly progressively in the second semester because this will be a good reflection of the fact that That the industrial fabric of our country is also recovering in terms of international affiliates tall grass and these have half yearly results and taking into account that the crisis caused by covid nineteen is having a global impact we have incorporated as you see detailed information on our main affiliates especially the north american company tall grass energy let me to remind you you are aware of that that on Seventeen of April we ceased to extend our investment in the company obtaining thirty point two percent of the shareholding so in this presentation and i'm not going to repeat everything you have extensive information on the performance of the north american energy market in these last few months like price performance demand data current situation and future projects in the case of a p the project is progressing AS PLANNED AND IT HAS ALREADY BEEN NINETY SIX PERCENT IMPLEMENTED IT IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE DURING THE LAST WATER OF THIS YEAR YESTERDAY A VERY CONCRETE TECHNICAL PIECE OF NEWS OF T A P I IS THAT THE LAST WELDING OF THE LAST PIPE WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE PIPE LINE THAT IS LINKED IN ITALY TO THE HIGH PRESSURE Great news actually with respect to the southern peru gas pipeline i update the situation the arbitration proceeding commenced in i c s i d is following the normal course on july nineteenth the peruvian state filed its defense and currently our international legal advisers are working on the next steps to follow According to this arbitration calendar, as you know, in relation to Peru, on July 15, ten days ago, one week ago, a new prime minister was appointed in Peru, Mr. Pedro Cateriano, and several ministers were replaced, including the ministry of energy and mines at Energas. We maintain our willingness to reach an amicable agreement with the Peruvian state in order to And the abatement procedure after reviewing the main topics of the semester and we will discuss on our commitment on decarbonization decarbonization, sorry, the european commission has presented their communication a hydrogen strategy for climate neutral europe two weeks ago which includes investments of between one hundred and eighty thousand million euros and four hundred thousand million euros in renewable hydrogen production. Capacity until twenty fifty the spanish government is working on the same line to have hydrogen rope mats and bio gas and storage strategy in the second semester of last year last week the ecologic transition ministry and demographic challenge ministry launched the decarbonization In the long term, at aden-agaz, we have actively participated planning, i'm sorry, in proposing specific measures in prior public consultation of these road maps promoted, as it was saying, by the ministry of ecological transition and demographic challenge presided over by vice president teresa may in the case of a european level together with tso's coming FROM NINE MEMBER STATES WE PRESENTED ON JULY SEVENTEENTH A REPORT IN BRUSSELS CALLED EUROPEAN HYDROGEN BACKBONE PLAN TO DEVELOP A SPECIFIC HYDROGEN TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IN EUROPE ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT WHICH IS A FIRST REFLECTION REPORT ON THIS MATTERS EXISTING GAS INFRASTRUCTURES CAN BE ADAPTED TO TRANSPORT HYDROGEN AT AN AFFORDABLE COST WITHOUT ANY KIND OF A relevant technical problem as for specific projects in the field of hydrogen as we said in the first quarter we are working on the green crane project with other companies especially snam which aims at developing a hydrogen corridor from southern europe to the north which was presented in brazil as a candidate for a project of common european interest it includes Includes a series of initiatives that will be later studied that will allow countries of southern europe to be positioned as benchmarks in the generation of green hydrogen. These projects will allow us to decarbonize more sectors to strengthen the european energy system and to position spain as a gateway for hydrogen in europe with existing storage and transport infrastructure that have already been built. In addition to hydrogen, we are working on other specific projects to contribute to decarbonization, promoting the use of l n g as fuel under specific circumstances. In this area, a few weeks ago, the European Union has announced that it will support natural gas in the development of sixteen l n g vehicle support points by gas and hydrogen within the eco-net. Project also a few days ago the european union granted the full amount of the subsidy requested for two specific supply l n g to ships projects bunkering in barcelona and algeciras in the south in southern spain i mention these specific projects because they demonstrate according to us the support of the european union for the role of l n g but also other gases AND RENEWABLE GASES IN THE DECARBONIZATION OF TRANSPORT SECTORS ESPECIALLY MARITIME TRANSPORTS IN THIS PRESENTATION YOU CAN SEE THE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS TO THE COMPANY IN THE FIELDS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONCE AGAIN THE COMMITMENT OF EACH AND EVERY ANEGAS PROFESSIONAL TO SUSTAINABILITY IN ITS BROADEST SENSE I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THE FIGURES THAT WE They provide you with a results presentation in february but enagás has a plan to reduce co2 emissions with the milestones in twenty thirty twenty forty that will culminate in fifty twenty with the neutral emission of carbon zero carbon so we continue with this plan obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pause before one of our priorities which is obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pause before one of our priorities which is obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pause before one of our priorities which is obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pause before one of our priorities which is obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pause before one of our priorities which is obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pause before one of our priorities which is obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pause before one of our priorities which is obviously and before finishing IS OUR COMMITMENT TO SHAREHOLDER REMINERATION I REMIND YOU THAT THIS TIMES MANY COMPANIES WERE NOT ABLE TO FACE THEIR COMMITMENTS AND MET THEIR COMMITMENTS I REMIND YOU THAT AT THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS MEETING HELD ON JUNE THIRTIETH THE PAYMENT OF A COMPLEMENTARY DIVIDEND A PLAN WAS APPROVED FOR TWENTY NINETEEN OF A ZERO DOT NINE Twenty six euros per share which became effective on july ninth and which is in line with our annual dividend commitment in twenty nineteen of one point sixty euros per share as i have mentioned the result of stress test and the impairment test performed by the company in this climate of great uncertainty enable us to reaffirm with the information we have now our dividend commitment for twenty nineteen.

President, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to ask a question, please dial dash one on your phone to cancel, push dash two. first question, javier suarez of coming from medibanka. javier, mister suarez, you have the floor. good morning, everyone. three questions first on hydrogen The government has presented its strategy until 2025, and it seems clear that hydrogen should have a relevant role in the effort to decarbonize economy by 2025. The question for you is, do you believe that this new strategy at European and Spanish level for hydrogen is a substantial change for the profile of the company? Is it a game changer? Should Enagás Change its business plan as a consequence of this opportunity and the regulating and governing entities and investors should they see any gas with different eyes as a consequence of these facts that is it would be a network to transport a commodity that is going to majorly reduce emissions second question talgass in the united states do you see any negative impact as a consequence of this third question talgass in the united states do you see any negative impact as a consequence of this third question talgass in the united states do you see any negative impact as a consequence of this third question talgass in the united states do you see any negative impact as a consequence of this third question talgass in the united states do you see any negative impact as a consequence of this third question talgass in the united states do you see any negative impact as a consequence of this third question OR THE POSSIBLE DIFFICULTIES OF GAS AND OIL OFF TAKERS IN UNITED STATES. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT YOU SEE OPERATIONALLY BECAUSE THESE HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT MONTHS FOR THESE COMPANIES. AND THE THIRD QUESTION IS COULD YOU GIVE US AN ESTIMATE ON THE GAS CONSUMPTION IN SPAIN FOR TWENTY TWENTY AS A HOLE THANK YOU JUST A MOMENT PLEASE. Thank you very much, mr. javier suarez from medio banca. first question, yes, we start with our opinion. we do consider that the transition energy process that all the european countries and the e u such have on the table will not be done if we don't contribute In a twofold with renewable gases, something that until now had almost no weight, hydrogen, biogas, et cetera and even decarbonization processes in subsectors where it will be difficult to electrify and lng there plays a role and i was saying a twofold because the other contribution is that we're seeing that the storage and transport infrastructures are GAS IN EUROPE ARE VERY GOOD TO MAINTAIN THE ROLE OF GAS IN THE TRANSITION PROCESS THAT EVERYBODY CONSIDERS IS GOING TO BE KEY BUT ALSO IN ORDER TO SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR THESE HYDROGEN DEVELOPMENTS AND FOR RENEWABLE GAS PROJECTS WERE CONVINCED ABOUT THAT THAT THE T S O S WILL PLAY A RELEVANT ROLE IN THIS FIELD AND THE CONTACTS THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH THE MINISTRY OF ECOLOGICAL TRANSITION ALLOW US TO THINK THAT ONCE WE SEE ALL THE PUBLIC OPINION PROCESSES ARE OVER AND PUBLIC CONSULTATION IS OVER WE WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE THERE AND FURTHERMORE WE DO WANT TO PLAY THAT ROLE SO FOR THE TIME BEING AS YOU'VE SEEN WE'RE DEVELOPING SOME MINOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS IN MOST OF THEM WE CAN CALL Them a proof of concept projects that is possible to produce, transport, a hydrogen and decarbonize and honestly i do believe that our tso role and not only ours but other the role of other countries in the coming years will change slightly from being only limited to these transport and storage of natural gas tso's in europe at least THE ONES WITH THIS AIM IN MIND WILL DO ALL THIS AND ALSO WE WILL COMPLEMENT THAT ROLE WITH AHM MOST ACTORS IN EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH HYDROGEN DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW AND I CAN'T NOT AND NO ONE CAN TELL YOU SPECIFIC FIGURES AND TIMELINES THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE AN IMMEDIATE PROCESS THIS IS GOING TO TAKE TIME IN THE COMING TWO THREE OR FOUR YEARS THIS WILL DEVELOP AND WE WILL START TO HAVE WELL I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU WE HAVE ALREADY A FEW PROJECTS AND SOME WITH THE SUPPORT FROM THE E A E U BUT THEY ARE SMALL PROJECTS SO I THINK THAT IN THE COMING TWO THREE FOUR YEARS AS I WAS SAYING WE WILL SEE HOW A GENERAL MAP OF ACTIVITY IN THIS FIELD WILL BE OUTLINED AND ALSO WE WILL ALSO SEE A CALENDAR AND THAT ADOPT, OF COURSE, TO THE INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMISSION OR THE PARLIAMENT BUT I CAN CLEARLY TELL YOU THAT ANEGAS IS WILLING TO COLLABORATE WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS SINCE QUITE SOME TIME WE'RE ALREADY WORKING ON IT SO I CONCLUDE AND I PARDON MY SUCH A LONG ANSWER I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR ROLE AS A T S OH AS IT'S THE ROLE OF OTHER T S OH those will change in a positive sense in the coming years probably having new tasks to undertake second question i've got the cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo cfo Good morning, javier. Let me answer four relevant points that are included in the presentation that the president has stressed in his presentation. First, we see a recovery of oil and gas prices and a recovery in the production in the relevant basins for oil and gas transport in tolghar. Second, transported volumes according to july figures and the prospects. The company for august or september we see that the transport will be in line with the volumes transported pre-covid three as it's been explaining the presentation it's very important we've finished the construction of the chayenne connector and the chayenne hub and this is a fundamental piece for re getting the west to east section from rocky and therefore meeting the objectives BUDGET MAYBE AS A FOURTH POINT BEFORE GOING TO THE FIGURES LET ME CONFIRM THAT TOLL GRASS IS AN ASSET THAT HAS BEHAVED WITH LIMITED SENSITIVITY TO THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE US MARKET THAT AS YOU KNOW HAS BEEN UNDER MUCH STRESS SO WITH THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF TODAY THE FREE CASH FLOW FOR TOLL GRASS FOR THE YEAR END TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND HAVING INVESTED IN THE CHINA CONNECTOR AND CHINA HUB It gives us a net debt to equity ratio of four point one times the payment of the expected dividend one hundred fourteen million euros is a ratio of net debt to ebitda ratio of around four point five four point six times this is compatible with the liquidity position of the company which is higher than one billion dollars and as the company has no relevant maturities until twenty twenty two and that is fully in line. With a long-term model with the capex investment included, as we've explained in other occasions, capex that becomes abita, a multiple of six times abita, and that debt-to-equity ratio is the one i was telling you. it's important to stress that with the information we have now, we have no changes whatsoever in the dividends announced for twenty twenty twenty six. neither in the yield of the investment communicated to the market. and as a summary of the description of the business of the company, this is fully in line. WITH THE LONG-TERM MODEL WE HAVE SET WHEN WE ACQUIRED TOLL GLASS AND WHEN WE SHARED THIS INFORMATION WITH THE MARKET THANK YOU BORJA LET ME ANSWER THE THIRD QUESTION BY JAVIER SWAYER CONSUMPTION AS WE'VE SAID WITH REGARDS TO INDUSTRIAL CONSUMPTION THE CONSUMPTION THAT WE CALL FOR OF THE CONVENTIONAL MARKET WE TOUCHED BOTTOM IN APRIL SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE DEMAND COMPARED TO LAST YEAR I've given you the figure of right now ninety two but if we could see the evolution of the twenty six twenty seven days of july of this year the demand conventional demand would be at ninety three therefore from now until the year end we do think that these conventional demands might little by little this will not be on a sudden basis but it will evolve towards FULL NORMALITY, BUT BEING CAUTIOUS AS WE WANT TO BE WE'VE DONE ALL OUR FORECASTS IN BUDGET ET CETERA WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A DECREASE OF THE TOTAL DEMAND IN ALL LINES A DECREASE OF TEN PERCENT FOR THE YEAR A DECREASE OF TEN PERCENT IN ORDER TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE BUT OF COURSE WE DO SEE THAT THE CONVENTIONAL DEMAND IN ALMOST ALL THE SECTORS HAS SET FOR ONE SERVICES BUT IN THE OTHER TWELVE SECTORS IN WHICH WE DIVIDE COMMERCIALLY SPEAKING THIS DEMAND THEY ARE AT A VIEW SHAPE OF RECOVERY WHICH IS QUITE CLEAR AND THE AVERAGE WOULD BE AT NINETY TWO NINETY THREE PERCENT SO TODAY WE'RE MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN WE PRESENTED THE FIRST QUARTER WE WERE IN SUFFERING THE FULL IMPACT OF THE DECREASE IN THE DEMAND AND WE DIDN'T Weren't even certain that we would reach rock bottom we've reached that bottom and we are not figures of the demand that i dare to say are quite normal because i think that last year was an exceptional year with regards to gas demand and therefore comparing to last year is very strict if we can put it that way. So we're optimistic with being cautious as i always say because we're living in a context of great uncertainty. But i do believe that Gas demand, industrial gas demand, and all its byproducts, and tankers, et cetera, is going, is behaving well. And even tankers, right now, tankers are above the consumption of last year, though its weight in the total of the industrial demand is small. Well, i think we have replied to all the, all the three questions that mister swire asked. Thank you. QUESTION COMES FROM ALBERTO GANDALF FROM GOLDMAN SACHS MISTER GANDALF YOU HAVE THE FLOOR GOOD MORNING COMMING FROM GOLDMAN SACHS IT WAS A LITTLE BIT CUT OFF SO THREE QUICK QUESTIONS AT TOLGRASS CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE GAINS ABITA NET BENEFITS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR And probably you can explain the what was the evolution compared to last year. The second question is there are many items in the affiliates that move around. So, could you please explain the difference of seventy six million for the first half, but the bigger contribution of tallgrass for the second part. The situation would be improved. And hydrogen again, I'm sorry to repeat that. BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN WE WILL BE BENEFITING FROM THESE INVESTMENTS. BUT THE EUROPEAN STRATEGY CLEARLY STATES THAT THE STRATEGY IS UP UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THEN ANOTHER STRATEGY FOR AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. SO WOULD IT BE REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FROM NOW TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WE WILL HAVE MORE VISIBILITY ON THIS TOPIC? ARE WE GOING TO INVEST MORE IN HYDROGEN AS A REGULATED ASSET IN SPAIN WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO THINK THAT THIS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASE DIVIDENDS AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH A N D W E A S T ER S T A L S T HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Thank you, mr. gandalfi. i think the two first questions will be answered by mr. borga garcia arcon. and i'll respond to your third question, borga, you have the floor. thank you. good morning, alberto. the contribution for equivalent for the entire years. FOR THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION GUIDANCE OF ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX MILLION YUROS THAT COULD BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS OF THE YEAR SEVENTY FOUR MILLION FOR THE FIRST PART AND ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WE NEED TO INDICATE THAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF CHILDREN IS DIFFERENT SO THE CONTRIBUTION FOR THE FIRST SEMESTER IS THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION YUROS, SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR FIFTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION YUROS So the difference between these two from a business point of view is explained because the difference between the contribution of net income of tall grass for the first half and the difference with the second semester because the sec the first semester before the abp was twenty two million dollars for the second will be five five million euros this is due to the re Recruiting of rex as foreseen, once chien connector was implemented, secondly the debt, in terms of debt, there's no difference, but this is an important adjustment produced as a result of transferring u s. g. a. tall grass accounts to i r f s i r f s, which is the real estate tax, is paid in january and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, The newest gab is done throughout the year. so for the first half, the impact was negative due to the three point one million dollars difference. and the second half, the impact is going to be positive. sixteen point two million dollars which is explained by the fact of changing the result and moving from three point eight to fifty three point four. SO JUST TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE ABITA ALBERTO WAS ASKING ABOUT THIS WE HAVE AN EXPECTED ABITA OF EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A B D I I OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FINANCIAL EXPENSES OF ONE POINT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS MULTIPLIED BY EXCHANGE RATE IS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT I SAID AT THE BEGINNING THAT WASN'T THAT WERE NECESSARY TO BUILD UP ALL THIS THANK YOU BORJA ALBERTO IN TERMS OF THE THIRD QUESTION WE THINK THAT WE HAVE TO SAY THINGS ORDERLY FROM NOW TO THE END OF THE YEAR WE WILL HAVE THE ROADMAP OF RENEWABLE GAS AND HYDROGEN THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE Ecological ecology transition ministry said to us. in terms of the european union plant i don't dare giving you dates but between twenty one twenty two this important paper launched by the commission will have been discussed thought about by stakeholders the european parliament et cetera so we will have probably a bigger Roadmap many tso's as i said before are working at the european hydrogen backbone plan and we're working together for that i think by the end of this year and up until the end of twenty twenty two the roadmap will be clear i believe at the same time all the tso's are thinking to come up with a concrete project which will not have a high Investment, economic impact but these are a proof of concept practice that will allow us to generate hydrogen practically or renewable gas how it are transported who are end users, et cetera. This is important all the hydrogen roadmap should be in the framework of the energy transition plan which means that changes cannot happen upstream. I mean and midstream without having clear in mind who are the end users it is meaningless for us to say i'm going to generate hydrogen at a specific point and who's going to consume this well i don't know obviously this is what the european union and each country is trying to do meaning having things orderly implemented meaning we will be part of the chain but someone has to be at the end Of the chain saying i need and i want this hydrogen for consumption. so between twenty twenty twenty twenty three and probably twenty three we will be able to implement concrete projects with end users that are interested in that and companies like enagaz are really into that providing you with figures as i was saying at the beginning is impossible for us to do now i I HOPE THAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR BECAUSE THE ROADMAP WILL BE PREPARED WE WILL HAVE A CALENDAR AND A VOLUME OF PROJECTS IN MIND BUT IN EUROPE I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO AT LEAST SO WE CAN HAVE A CONCRETE WORKING PLAN THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN SPAIN WHEN IN SPAIN THE GAS ENERGY PLAN WAS PRODUCED This planning was discussed between twenty the year and twenty and twenty one. i'm sorry. in two thousand and two, the first concrete document of our strategic plan was produced in spain at that time for gas. and that plan was started to be implemented practically in two thousand and five to two thousand and six. enagás came up with the first strategic plan. PLAN FOR THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT OF THIS AL PLAN IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN SO BETWEEN THE APPROVAL IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION FIVE YEARS ELAPSED IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE BECAUSE AUTHORIZATIONS WERE REQUIRED APPROVAL WAS REQUIRED WAS REQUIRED ET CETERA IN THE CASE OF VITRIOL THINGS ARE GOING TO BE QUICKER PROBABLY BUT THIS KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES A DEADLINE WHICH IS MORE OR LESS LONG FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION IF SOME YEARS AGO IF YOU WOULD ASK ME IF WE WOULD HAVE A PAPER FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION FROM NOW TO TWENTY FIFTY AND SAYING WILL WE HAVE A HYDROGEN ROAD MAP IN THE NEXT MONTH IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME THIS TWO YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE SAID I DON'T KNOW NOW I CAN TELL YOU YES IT IS HARD THOUGH TO DO THAT Tell you when the project calendar will be created especially the rules of the game to know who wants hydrogen the speed of each country it is not likely for all the countries to do the same time the same thing at the same time we'll have to see i don't want to elaborate on on this because i have another more questions so thank you mr. gondolfi for your question thank you next question will be done by jose luis from barclays thank you next question will be done by jose luis from barclays thank you next question will be done by jose luis from barclays thank you next question will be done by jose luis from barclays thank you next question will be done by jose luis from barclays thank you next question will be done by jose luis from barclays thank you next question will be done by You have the floor good morning louis gavreau from berkeley's three questions first could you clarify impact of twelve point three million positive in the gdp of south africa where do they come from in second quarter secondly after hearing you about toll roads where do they come from FOR US THERE IS A PLAN FOR COST REDUCTION MISSING I THINK BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT'S A PROJECT FOR GROWTH I JUST WANTED TO FOR YOU TO CONFIRM THIS POINT IF YOU COULD OF COURSE AND THIRDLY AND GETTING BACK TO HYDROGEN I WANTED TO KNOW IF WITHIN THAT ROADMAP THERE IS AN INITIATIVE OF HAVE YOU HEARD OF ANY INITIATIVE ON THE SITE OF THE SPAINISH GIRL To create a hub it is something which is quite in fashion and portugal the netherlands and the u k have already presented their initiatives thank you Sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? By borja garcía larkin you have the floor thank you president jose javier gsp two impacts first an unrecurring expense in twenty nineteen as a consequence of the delay that we introduced in the accounts waiting for the resolution of the arbitration to be issued in twenty twenty two that represents an expense this year we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we don't have that effect but we WE HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT BECAUSE WE GET CLOSER TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO DATE THAT WE HAVEN'T CHANGED. SO THE ADDITION OF THOSE TWO ENDPACKS ARE THE TWELVE MILLION YUROS THAT APPEAR IN THE P N L AND AS FOR T G E, THE EFFORTS IN OPERATIONAL EXPENSES AND EFFICIENCY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS FIGURES I'VE PROVIDED THANK YOU MORGAN AS FOR HYDROGEN IS CONCERNED YES WE HAVE PRESENTED IN ALWAYS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT WE'VE ALREADY EXPLAINED IT EXPLAINED IT IN THE GREEN PAPER AND EVEN WITH SNAM AND OTHER COMPANIES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POSSIBLE HUB FOR THE SOUTH OF EUROPE CONNECTED ON THE SITE OF EINAGAS BUT ALSO ON SNAM'S SITE WITH THE NORTH OF AFRICA. SO THAT'S A POSSIBLE HUB IS PERFECTLY OUTLINED THERE THAT COULD BE USEFUL OF COURSE WHEN THE EYE The roadmap in spain is over. we will see the possibility for our country from different stances together with portugal of course will be part of this hub and at the same time let us not forget that it is very possible for the first steps to use hydrogen in the different countries within the energy transition plan most of them will have initial projects that will be part of this hub and at the same time let us not forget that it is very possible for the first steps to use hydrogen in the different countries within the energy transition plan most of them will have initial projects that will be part of this hub and at the same time let us not forget that it is very possible for the first steps to use hydrogen in the different countries within the energy transition plan most of them will have initial projects that will be part of this hub and at the same time let us not forget that it is very possible for the first It'll be internal per country. it's what i was saying before. the there we might have a place with someone or some of which will be the final user or users of this hydrogen and that there are countries such as ours and other companies that are willing to collaborate in these projects. so the idea of moving between countries will take place. that's for sure. we're just doing our analysis. but i am Almost fully convinced that the first projects will be of a if we can put it this way of national nature per country in very specific points locations and knowing that there's an end user or end users that are there already willing to immediately receive that hydrogen or that renewable gas and i think joseph we have been able to cover your questions thank you if there are more questions Yes, let's move now to the questions in English. IN THE FIRST HALF I WONDERED IF YOU COULD LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK THE FULL YEAR IMPACTS OF VOLUME DECLINE WILL BE ON REGULATED REVENUES ON THE DOMESTIC BUSINESS AND THEN IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY I THINK UNDER THE NEW REGULATION THE R C S IN FUTURE YEARS OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX WAS ACTUALLY BASED ON THE R C S THIS YEAR IF I HAVE UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY SO I WONDERED IF YOU COULD CONFIRM THAT THAT UNDERSTANDING IS CORRECT AND lower this year that that would have a a knock on effects on future years as well or have i misunderstood something there and then the second question just on your affiliates overall i just wondered if you could remind us what percentage of your affiliate income is in u s dollars i believe most of it is dollarized obviously the dollars weaken somewhat over the last few weeks so just interested to get a reminder of how much is in dollars and then thirdly I'm afraid it's a it's an obligatory hydrogen question but a specific one i think in the in the hydrogen backbone report you and the your tso colleagues quantified the total capex spend at a midpoint of about forty billion euros up to twenty forty if i remember correctly if if i just eyeball the map that you published in the in the slides today i think it's on the slides today i think it's on the slides today i think it's on the slides today i think it's on the slides today i think it's on the slides today i think it's on the slides today i think it's on the slides today i think it's on the slides today i think it's on the slides today i think it's on the slides Twenty six it looks like you're roughly somewhere around a third of the size of the network just by a very approximate guess do you think that's a fair guess at what your share of the forty billion spend would be any thanks R AE1 S T AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 ZH AH0 L Y UW1 Z I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Can you please provide more context or clarify your question? sir, for your question, the two first question, the cfo will give you a detailed answer. thank you, mister president. concerning erc s, the brut impact is expected at twenty two million dollars and net seventeen million dollars. and for twenty one twenty six, according to your question, the net impact in the pnl. ACCOUNT AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS NINE MILLION EUROS ON AVERAGE PER ANNUM AND CONCERNING THE CONTRIBUTION OF AFFILIATES FOR THE EQUIVALENT NINETY PERCENT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS IN DOLLARS BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KINETERO T S P T A LGRASSA T G P I A L T A M A R A T AH AND THEY ARE ALL DOLLARIZED AS YOU MENTIONED SO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF DOLLARS TO THE P N L Account is quite high thank you borja and to conclude with the hydrogen question in our backbone plan document investment figures are given twenty twenty or sixty billion for the entirety of europe the document we are talking about now is a first reflection is a draft it's not an investment detail plan but technically from a technical point of view we should bear in mind that in europe As a whole, and in Spain, the infrastructure of the gas network is perfectly feasible for it to transport hydrogen with some nuances. Regulatory technical questions must be sorted out in terms of the blending. So the percentage of hydrogen can be used in one grid mixed with LNG. This is the first phase. The different countries historically have different technical standards. Some strictly technical questions are related to some part of the grid where hydrogen will be used. and in this, at this point, technical measures should be taken for compressor stations, for example, and investments are necessary. we need to see if sections of the network will transport only hydrogen or if they transport a blend. MORE INVESTMENTS PROBABLY ARE NECESSARY FOR REACHING A CONSUMPTION POINT OR A GENERATION POINT. BUT THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED NOR HAVE THEY BEEN INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL ROAD MAPS. WE HAVE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF HOW RENEWABLE GAS WILL BE USED. THE SECOND POINT IS A CALENDAR WITH SOME OBLIGATIONS THAT COUNTRIES IMPOSE THEMSELVES AND THE THIRD STEP IS TO SEE WHAT DOES WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED OR IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE ROUTE MAP THIS IS WHERE WE ARE NOW AT NOW THE INVESTMENT FIGURES GIVEN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE A BROAD MARTIN BECAUSE THEY REACH TWENTY FIFTY SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S NOT EASY FOR US TO DO GIVE A FINAL FIGURE NOW AND BY HEART I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS TALKING ABOUT ONE MILLION TONS OF HYDROGEN IN TWENTY FIFTY WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THIS FIGURE IS RESPECTED OR IS HIGHER OR LOWER AND WE NEED TO SEE WHAT EACH COUNTRY IS GOING TO DO BUT THIS WILL BE WILL HAVE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ENERGY ROADMAP CHOSEN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS TO At least reach an agreement with generators, transporters, and consumers of hydrogen or renewable gas without which transition will never happen very likely like i said before this will come out initially from projects we are now promoting now with other companies and all the stakeholders come together so it's a Specific project in a specific region with specific calendars in my presentation i mentioned some of them or a few of them and in a near future governments will set annual calendars for projects we could elaborate on that but i know there are more questions let's go to the next question now thank you sir for your question our next question will come from james brand from deutschebank please go ahead Mike, high good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple of questions on Torgau and then a follow-up on hydrogen. So, on Torgau, you gave quite clear guidance for this year, which i think is assuming i had the numbers correctly, came down to fifty six to fifty seven million of pre ppa net income. I'm wondering whether you could give some expectations for the next year just so we can get a feel for how it's going. Some of those positives that are coming through in age two might look in a more normal year and then the second question is i'm wondering what you felt the biggest risk was on on tall grass in in the slides you had some volume expectations for the main basins that you're in that looked broadly that volumes had come down a bit but overall would recover a little bit particularly In a couple of the basins and you'd start to see some, some growth again. It's what it's the main risk that oil prices stay low and and that growth just doesn't come through and you see contracting pressure. And as within that, is there a particular point of oil prices that would be it would start to make you a bit more concerned if they stayed at forty or maybe they have to drop more. But i think there were a few sub questions within that, but just an idea of what you think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company think the company The risks are a photographs and then a follow up on hydrogen. I mean, i appreciate the last answer around uncertainties around the cost and potentially not having spent that much on the network to enable it for hydrogen. Is it the biggest investment then if it does come through adding new parts to the pipeline network to connect our renewable clusters, if that's the direction that we go through, is that the biggest investment that if it does come through adding new parts to the pipeline network to connect our renewable clusters, if that's the direction that we go through, is that the biggest investment that if it does come through adding new parts to the pipeline network to connect our renewable clusters, if that's the direction that we go through, is that the biggest investment that if it does come through adding new parts to the pipeline network to connect our renewable clusters Opportunity of hygiene, if you actually have to start to extend the network some context on that would be of interest. thank you. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? Foe will answer the whole of the questions that you've raised with quite some detail. thank you, president. the contribution of tolgras, yes, to the confederation of ppa twenty twenty will be fifty six million euros, as we said before. that will stabilize and even grow in the future at around one hundred million euros before ppa and after ppa, that figure will be around sixty million with regards It starts to long-term risks for toll roads in the model, the highest risk, well, not risk, the my biggest milestone is meeting the capex objectives to build a bit dast that we expect for twenty twenty four, twenty five and twenty six in this sense, maybe the current situation it shows that there are projects that compete that won't evolve, so we've got good opportunities within the company for now. We don't have anything specific, but there are good forecasts. but on the other side, that's the main risk for the future. yes, as borja was saying, the investment and development plan now for tourism, as we have, is good. but the negative circumstances of the north american market and the world market have represented a small A competitive advantage that is the one that the ceo and burke were talking about a we were talking about together because there are new possible projects new projects that will compete well they have disappeared because of the market situation and that provides a clear advantage to the actors that are suddenly installed such as tall grass actors that have got as you very well know An important part of their contracts that are insured so tall grass is following that line they have foreseen to make the most in the future of the of the new opportunities that may appear with minor investments that won't be starting from scratch investments because that entails more projects of permits and et cetera but they will use a very wide spread network that is already ready. PRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES THEY WILL USE THAT AND WITH AH NOT BIG INVESTMENTS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER NEW MARKETS. SO IN THAT SENSE, OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK IN TELLING THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIVITY FOR TOLL ROADS WITH THE FIGURES WE HAVE IS INTERESTING AND WE DO RELY ON THAT LEG. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE GOT MORE QUESTIONS Questions? Yes, yes, yes, I do apologize. There are more questions. So, let's give the floor to the next question. Thank you. Our next question comes from Olivia Van Dusen from Exxon. Please go ahead. Your line is open. BUT ILLY YOU'VE DONE NINE PERCENT IN H ONE MAYBE WITH SOME ONE OF THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AT THE START OF THE YEAR AND FOR H TWO YOU EXPECT ACTUALLY A BIG STEP FORWARD FROM THE CONTRIBUTION FROM TOLGRAF SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD INDICATE WHETHER YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THE GUIDANCE SEEMS TO BE PARTICULARLY COHESIVE FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN A SECOND ONE APOLOGIES BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY YOUR TENTH QUESTION ON HYDROGEN BUT IT LOOKS IN THE TRANSPORTED NATURAL GAS MIX I THINK DEVELOPMENTS ARE TALKING AT A POTENTIAL TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT OF HYDROGEN BEING MIXED IN THE TOTAL BLEND SMITH FOR EXAMPLE I THINK HAS ALREADY MENTIONED THAT FOR THEM THERE'S PROBABLY AROUND ONE THIRD OF THEIR NETWORK THAT WOULD ACTUALLY NEED UPGRADES TO BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THAT LEVEL OF HYDROGEN IN THE NETWORK HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE STATE OF Of your network and can you give us a feel in terms of the possible needs for for replacements or upgrades of your network that might be necessary for you to be able to handle such a level of hydrogen and can you also tell us if we see some accelerated replacements of your pipes in order for hydrogen to be able to flow through your network better if that should actually be booked on your side as as as capex or would that actually be expensed as opex under your current regulation BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BU I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? Thank you, president olivier. we keep the guidance at four hundred and forty million. the behavior was a little better than expected. but the forecast for the year is four hundred and forty million. and we are trusted enough in this. in terms of the second question, the chief executive NECESSARY TO DWELL ON THEM MARCELINO YOU HAVE THE FLOOR YEAH WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT NETWORK PART FROM THAT THAT THE PIPELINE ACCEPTS TWENTY TEN TWENTY PERCENT OF HYDROGEN WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND TO GENERATE TWENTY PERCENT OF HYDROGEN OR NATURAL GAS THAT IS CONSUMED IN SPAIN NOW AS AN HYDROGEN A GREAT DEAL OF INVESTMENTS WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THE GENERATION OF THIS HYDROGEN WE ARE FAR FROM BEING REAL NOW AND WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS IN OUR UNIT AND WE ARE IMPLEMENTING, STARTING THAT. AND IF WE THINK ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE, TWENTY THIRTY FOUR HAVING A HUNDRED PERCENT HYDROGEN NETWORK, WE WILL HAVE SOME OF THE BIBLE LINES THAT EXIST TODAY BUT NEW WILL HAVE TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT AND IMPLEMENTED There is a necessary improvement for the network or the pipeline to cope with twenty percent of hydrogen. We are far from this being true. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, let us move on to the last question. Our last question will come from Antonella B and Jessey from City. Please go ahead. Yes, hello. Just that most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to come back on that. You said something that i found extremely interesting that you will start your investment only and when there will be an off-taker for your hydrogen potential. So i wonder, can you give us an idea of the timing? I mean, i think that the message is that international interconnection which are not fully regulated will have to be contracted before you will commit on investment. Then you think this would be a possibility. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? Thank you antonella let me reply there are different elements that are under the same umbrella first the investments in our networks i'm talking about enagás but you can think about of any other tso in europe so investments will be done in will depend fully on the instructions that we may receive from the regulators for example It's already been said, but the use or more or less hydrogen blended with helium natural gas, which is something that can be done since the beginning, well, that did depend on the technical specifications and norms that are quite simple. This is not complex, but it will be the regulators, the ones that will say yes, I want that in Spain or in France or that in Italy. We have a higher percentage of hydrogen within the natural gas. For a certain amount of time there technically speaking we perfectly know what's the investments that we have to do and very probably they will be investments that will be regulated by the regulator this as a general response then the use of hydrogen specifically for specific projects not so much to have a general blend in the grid depends on if there are off takers companies Clients that want to use this hydrogen and that they can get this hydrogen to generate electricity such as fuel for their equipment or whatever these projects will have to stem from these roadmaps we're talking about in order to give you an example we've got a specific project to generate transport and use hydrogen in the balearic islands and that's a specific project to generate transport and use hydrogen in the balearic islands and that's a specific project to generate transport and use hydrogen in the balearic islands and that's a specific project to generate transport and use hydrogen in the balearic islands and that's a specific project to generate transport and use hydrogen in the balearic islands and that's a specific project to generate transport and use hydrogen in the balearic islands and that's a specific project Project in which the ultimate off taker will be a company transporting passengers and that is a clear example that doesn't need specific regulation but using in the spanish grid or the french or the italian grid part of a of hydrogen as blended with natural gas to among other things to reduce the c02 POSITIONS THAT WILL REQUIRE FROM TECHNICAL REGULATIONS WHERE WE ARE INVOLVED OF COURSE THE MINISTRY IS INVOLVED AND THE MINISTRY HAS ASKED OUR OPINION ABOUT WHAT ARE THE TECHNICAL MEASURES THAT WE WILL HAVE WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THIS CALENDAR TO BE USED RENEWABLE GASES THAT'S WORK IN PROGRESS UNDER PROCESS UNDER PROGRESS BUT AS OF JULY WE DON'T HAVE MORE DETAILS AS I WAS REPLYING TO A SIMILAR QUESTION BEFORE I THINK THAT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWENTY TWO I THINK THAT THIS MAP THIS TECHNICAL REGULATORY MAP WILL BE FULLY CONSIDERED FINISHED IN EUROPE IN IMPERIAL WE WILL SEE SPECIFIC PROJECTS APPEARING AND THANK YOU ANTONIA THERE ARE NO MORE QUESTIONS I'VE TOLD SO Apart from the minor problems of the mask and the reading glasses, i think that we've been able to reply to your questions. we do want to thank you for the interest on the company and the relators, the relators investors relations team. if you need more information, we'll give you detailed information. if you're required from them. thank you. so we close these conferences on the first semester, twenty twenty results of enagás. thank you. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?"

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Q3 NET SALES DECREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY 21% TO $115 MILLION AFTER EXITING A VERY DIFFICULT SECOND QUARTER WE SAW GOOD MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT THE THIRD QUARTER AS RETAIL OUTLETS CONTINUED TO REOPEN AND ALLOW A MORE NORMAL IN-STORE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE THAT BEING SAID THE RESIDUAL EFFECTS OF COVID-19 COMBINED WITH THE DELAY OF THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW APPLE DEVICES WHICH PUSH SOME WHICH PUSHED SOME ORDERS INTO Q4 MADE IT A DIFFICULT YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARE OVERALL WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE MOMENTUM AND SELL-THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS WE SAW IN RETAIL WHICH ENABLED US TO INCREASE SALES BY ALMOST 50% ON A CONSECUTIVE QUARTER BASIS FROM $77 MILLION TO 115 MILLION Q3 GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO 33% THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PITS AND TAKES THAT IMPACTED GROSS PROFIT DURING THE QUARTER INCLUDING A BENEFIT FROM NET LOWER DUTY RATES AND EXPECTED DUTY REFUNDS WHICH I'LL DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL IN A SECOND THIS BENEFIT WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPEDITED AIRFREIGHT AND INCREASED AIRFREIGHT RATES UM ALONG WITH THE SALE OF EXCESS INVENTORY OF MARGINS THAT WERE LOWER THAN OUR HISTORICALLY AVERAGES ON THE SUBJECTS OF DUTY REFUNDS IN EARLY AUGUST WE RECEIVED AN EXCLUSION NOTICE THAT DUTIES PAID ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED FROM CHINA STARTING IN LATE 2018 MAY BE SUBJECT TO REFUND WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR CUSTOMS BROKER TO BEGIN SUBMITTING REFUND DOCUMENTATION TO US CUSTOMS THIS WORK IS ONGOING AND GIVEN THE VO- THE VOLUME OF IMPORTS FROM CHINA SINCE LATE 2018 WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE FOURTH QUARTER BASED ON THE WORK

MARGIN DURING THE QUARTER AS I MENTIONED THERE IS STILL QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO DO LEFT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER TO COMPLETE OUR REMAINING REFUND SUBMISSIONS AND I'LL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON ANY ADDITIONAL REFUND UPSIDE ON OUR NEXT CALL Q3 OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED 29% OR APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION COMPARED TO LAST YEAR THE DECREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE VARIOUS COST CUTTING MEASURES WE IMPLEMENTED AS A RESULT OF THE EXPECTED COVID-9- COVID-19 IMPACTS ON DEMAND OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE'VE MADE THE CONSCIOUS DECISION TO BRING SOME INDIVIDUALS BACK FROM FURLOUGH TO SUPPORT FOURTH QUARTER PRODUCT LAUNCHES AND CUSTOMER CARE BUT WE CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON ALL SPEND TO ENSURE WE NAVIGATE OUR WAY THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT TIME Q3 ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS $15 MILLION VERSUS 21 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD THE DECLINE VERSUS LAST YEAR IS LINKED TO DECREASED SALES AND A REDUCTION IN OVERALL GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE REASONS I MENTIONED THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET BY THE DECREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES THAT I JUST DISCUSSED TURNING TO THE BALANCE SHEET COMPARED TO A YEAR AGO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DECREASED 33% TO $91 MILLION DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN SALES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD HOWEVER OR DSOS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 87 DAYS TO 73 DAYS THE QUALITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES REMAINS VERY GOOD INVENTORY WAS 80 MILLION COMPARED TO $94 MILLIONS AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER WE TOOK THE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO INVENTORY AS WE CLOSELY MONITORED RETAIL SELL-THROUGH CUSTOMER FORECASTS AND CUSTOMER INVENTORY LEVELS TO ENSURE WE DIDN'T OVEREXTEND ON INVENTORY PURCHASING AS A RESULT WE DID INCUR SOME INCREMENTAL EXPEDITED AIRFREIGHT CHARGES DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER AS RETAIL SELL-THROUGH IMPROVED AT THIS POINT WE WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE OUR PURCHASING FORECAST BUT WE'LL CONTINUE TO PLAN CONSERVATIVELY DUE TO THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DESPITE THE CONTINUED HEADWINDS FROM COVID-19 DURING THE QUARTER WE GENERATED THIRD QUARTER OPERATING CASH FLOW OF APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION COMPARED TO NEGATIVE 11 MILLION IN CASH FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD NET DEBT WHICH IS CONSOLIDATED DEBT LESS CASH DECREASED TO 81 MILLION COMPARED TO 97 MILLION IN Q3 LAST YEAR AND 85

MILLION TO $145 MILLION THIS EXPANSION COMBINED WITH THE LOAN RECEIVED UNDER THE CARES ACT THE Q2 RESTRUCTURING AND COST CUTTING INITIATIVES WE'VE UNDERTAKEN GIVES US CONFIDENCE THAT WE'LL

SERVICE OUR LINE OF CREDIT AS WE LOOK TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2020 WE DEFINITELY HAVE BETTER VISIBILITY NOW THAN WE DID WHEN WE LAST SPOKE IN AUGUST HOWEVER COVID-19 CONTINUES TO CREATE UNCERTAINTY AROUND WORLDWIDE RETAIL DEMAND GIVEN THIS MARKET UNCERTAINTY WE WILL NOT BE PROVIDING ANNUAL GUIDANCE AT THIS TIME HOWEVER GIVEN OUR CURRENT VIEW OF CUSTOMER ORDERS AND POSITIVE RETAIL SELL-THROUGH TRENDS WE EXPECT STRONG SEQUENTIAL NET SALES AND ADJUSTED EBITDA GROWTH OVER THE THIRD QUARTER WE EXPECT 2020 YEAR <INAUDIBLE> GROSS MARGINS TO PR- TO IMPROVE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER THOUGH AS I MENTIONED WE'LL SEE SOME PRESSURE OVER THE NEXT QUA- NEXT FEW QUARTERS COMPARED TO HISTORICAL AVERAGES OF MID- 30S AS WE SELL THROUGH OUR EXCESS INVENTORY WE EXPECT TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES TO BE IN THE SAME RANGE OF HIGH 20S TO LOW $30 MILLION FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER NO DIFFERENT THAN FROM ANY OTHER COMPANIES COVID-19 HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS HOWEVER WITH THE STEPS WE'VE TAKEN TO RESTRUCTURE THE BUSINESS REDUCE FIXED COSTS AND ENSURE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY I'M CONFIDENT THE LIKES OF THIS PERIOD IMPACTED BY COVID-19 AS A MUCH STRONGER COMPANY THAN WHEN WE ENTERED WITH THAT

Looking at our third quarter in more detail, as we discussed on our Q2 call in August, we saw a significant sequential uptick in sell-through in June for both our protection and power categories. As several of our larger customers reopened their doors and resumed more normalized store operations, some sell-through weeks even exceeded last year's levels. This trend continued into July and has been consistent. IMPROVED THROUGHOUT AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. WHILE OUR ONLINE SALES GROWTH DID TEMPER A BIT FROM LEVELS WE EXPERIENCED EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC WHEN MUCH OF THE BRICK AND MORTAR WAS CLOSED IT WAS STILL UP NICELY FROM A YEAR AGO AND EXPANDING THIS CHANNEL CONTINUES TO BE A PRIORITY FOR US. WITH RESPECT TO OVERALL PERFORMANCE Q3 REVENUE CAME IN AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION IN THE QUARTER DESPITE THE ROUGHLY THIRTY TWO MILLION DROP IN REVENUE COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER LAST YEAR COMBINED WITH SOME GROSS MARGIN HEDGES FROM HIGHER FREIGHT EXPENSES WE DELIVERED A JUSTIFIED EBITDA OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THANKS TO COST SAVING MEASURES WE ENACTED EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC TAYLOR WILL GO THROUGH IN GREATER DETAIL ON THE BALANCE SHEET BUT I WANT TO SHARE A FEW HIGHLIGHTS DESPITE SIGNIF C L A Y N K AH0 M P EH1 R D T AH0 W EH1 R W IY1 EH1 N D IH0 D K Y UW1 T UW1 sil W IY1 JH EH1 N ER0 EY2 T AH0 D P AA1 Z AH0 T IH0 V AA1 P ER0 EY2 T IH0 NG K AE1 SH F L OW2 sil AH0 N D W IY1 K AH0 N T IH1 N Y UW0 T AH0 R IH0 D UW1 S AA1 R K W AO1 R T ER0 IH1 N N EH1 T D EH1 T B AE1 L AH0 N S AA1 N AH0 Y I I'll now provide some additional color to our categories starting with protection we continue to build on our overall digital wellness strategy for a few years now our hero screen protector has been vision guard a product that reduces exposure to high energy visible blue light that can have damaging effects without changing the screen colors or the peak resolution we have now sold over ten million units with this technology in addition all invisible shield screen protectors produce this year and beyond now also include antimicrobial technology this includes our entire lineup The new iPhone 12 which is now available in stores earlier this year we introduced our newest product geared towards our digital wellness strategy a UV UV phone sanitizer which works with all mobile devices and kills up to ninety nine point nine percent of SARS-CoV-2 surface bacteria our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retailers and our consumers and has led to increasing sales and greater shelf space with many of our accounts we've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to Cases with good success, starting with the Samsung Galaxy S20, launched earlier this year, and right through to the recent iPhone 12 launch. All Gear 4 protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology. The combination of this enhancement and benefit in Gear 4's differentiated D3O impact technology is driving excitement amongst consumers, especially as its awareness of the brand and products grow from our efforts to expand distribution with the new iPhone 12 Gear 4 is now available and growing across all of our distribution channels. CARRIER PARTNERS\n\nTHIS EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION ACCELERATES THE MOMENTUM IN PIER FOUR BRAND AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE IT CONTINUE TO GROW THROUGH TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE\n\nIN OUR POWER CATEGORY, MORGAN LAUNCHED MANY EXCITING NEW PRODUCTS DURING Q3 THREE INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW LINE OF WIRELESS CHARGING SOLUTIONS.

WHILE THERE IS STILL A GOOD DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THE VIRUS WILL IMPACT SHOPPING BEHAVIOR THIS HOLIDAY SEASON INCLUDING THE EFFECT ON SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN EUROPE THAT HAVE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED LOCKDOWNS WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO CAPITALIZE ON DEMAND REGARDLESS OF WHICH CHANNEL OUR LAST TWO QUARTERS EVEN AS WE ARE FACING TOUGH COMPARISONS TO LAST YEAR'S RECORD QUARTER SALES I AM CONFIDENT IN THE LONG TERM COURSE WE HAVE SET FOR THE COMPANY OUR EFFORTS AROUND ANTIMICROBIAL UV SANITIZATION AND BLUE LIGHT PROTECTION ARE DRIVEN BY OUR BELIEF THAT CONSUMERS WILL INCREASINGLY LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS THAT WILL IMPROVE THEIR DIGITAL WELLNESS WE ALSO BELIEVE ANOTHER CONSUMER PRIORITY WILL BE INCREASED PRODUCTIV Difficult to know when conditions will fully normalize and what impact COVID nineteen will have on the global economy in our industry. I am confident that we have taken the right steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company. This includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin products and categories and simplify our core lines of business. As a more nimble company, Zagg can better serve our retail partners and core consumers, capitalize on the tailwinds from the multiyear rollout of five G with the margin benefits from our brand and category consolidation and generate increased value. FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS I WILL NOW HAND OVER TO TAYLOR THANKS CHRIS SINCE MANY DETAILS OF OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WERE INCLUDED IN THE SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION ISSUED EARLIER TODAY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON OUR THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Q 3 NET SALES DECREASED YEAR OVER YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY 21 PERCENT TO A HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILL OPEN AND ALLOW A MORE NORMAL IN STORE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE THAT BEING SAID THE RESIDUAL EFFECTS OF COVID NINETEEN COMBINED WITH THE DELAY OF THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW APP DEVICES WHICH PUSHED SOME ORDERS INTO Q U FOUR MADE IT A DIFFICULT YEAR OVER YEAR COMPARE OVERALL WE WERE PLEASED WITH THE MOMENTUM AND SELL THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS WE SAW AT RETAIL WHICH ENABLED US TO INCREASE SALES BY ALMOST FIFTY PERCENT ON A CONSECUTIVE QUARTER BASIS FROM SEVENTY SE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PUTS AND TAKES THAT IMPACTED GROSS PROFIT DURING THE QUARTER INCLUDING A BENEFIT FROM LOWER DUTY RATES AND EXPECTED DUTY REFUNDS WHICH I'LL DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL IN A SECOND THIS BENEFIT WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPEDITED AIR FREIGHT AND INCREASED AIR FREIGHT RATES ALONG WITH THE SALE OF EXCESS INVENTORY MARGINS THAT WERE LOWER THAN OUR HISTORICAL AVERAGES ON THE SUBJECT OF DUTY REFUNDS IN EARLY AUGUST WE RECE LATE TWENTY EIGHT MAY BE SUBJECT TO REFUND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CUSTOMS BROKER TO BEGIN SUBMITTING REFUND DOCUMENTATION TO U S CUSTOMS THIS WORK IS ONGOING AND GIVEN THE VOLUME OF IMPORTS FROM CHINA SINCE LATE TWENTY EIGHT WE WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER BASED ON THE WORK COMPLETED TO DATE WE RECORDED A REFUND RECEIVABLE A QUARTER END OF ABOUT FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR DUTIES PAID THAT WE EXPECT TO BE AND THEN SOLD IN Q3 THREE TWENTY TWO WAS A NET INCOME STATEMENT BENEFIT OF ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OR APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FORTY BASIS POINTS TO GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DURING THE QUARTER. AS I MENTIONED THERE IS STILL QUITE A BIT OF WORK LEFT TO DO DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER TO COMPLETE OUR REMAINING REFUND SUBMISSIONS AND WE'LL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON ANY ADDITIONAL REFUND UPSIDE ON OUR NEXT CALL Q3 OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED TWENT We implemented measures as a result of the expected COVID-19 impacts on demand. Over the last several months, we made the conscious decision to bring some individuals back from furlough to support fourth quarter product launches and customer care. However, we continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult time. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million versus $21 million in the prior year period. The decline versus last year is linked to decreased sales and a reduction in overall gross profit margin for the reasons I mentioned. These items were offset by the decreases in operating expenses that I just discussed. Turning to the balance sheet, compared to a year ago, accounts receivable decreased thirty-three percent to ninety-one million dollars due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period. However, our DSOs improved significantly from eighty-seven days to seventy-three days. The quality of our receivables remains very good. Inventory was eighty million compared to forty-nine million dollars at the end of the first quarter, a reduction of approximately fourteen million dollars. A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO INVENTORY AS WE CLOSELY MONITOR RETAIL SELL THROUGH CUSTOMER FORECASTS AND CUSTOMER INVENTORY LEVELS TO ENSURE WE DID NOT OVER EXTEND ON INVENTORY PURCHASING AS A RESULT WE DID INCUR SOME INCREMENTAL EXPEDITED AIR FREIGHT CHARGES DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER AS RETAIL SELL THROUGH IMPROVED AT THIS POINT WE WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE OUR PUR DESPITE THE CONTINUED HEADWINDS FROM COVID NINETEEN DURING THE QUARTER WE GENERATED THIRD QUARTER OPERATING CASH FLOW OF APPROXIMATELY NINE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO NEGATIVE ELEVEN MILLION IN CASH FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD NET DEBT WHICH HAS CONSOLIDATED DEBT LESS CASH DECREASED TO EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO NINETY SEVEN MILLION IN C Q3 LAST YEAR AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION AT THE END OF THE FIRST QU This expansion combined with the loan received under the CARES Act, the Q2 restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives we've undertaken gives us confidence that we will successfully navigate the headwinds that COVID-19 has put on the business. The capital allocation focus throughout the remainder of 2020 will remain on funding working capital needs and continuing to service our line of credit. As we look to the fourth quarter of 2020, we definitely have better visibility now than we did when we last spoke in August. However, COVID 19 continues to create uncertainty around worldwide retail demand. Given this market uncertainty, we will not be providing annual guidance at this time. However, given our current view of customer orders and positive retail sell-through trends, we expect strong sequential net sales and adjusted ebitda growth over the third quarter. We expect twenty twenty year end gross margins to improve during the fourth quarter, though as mentioned, we'll see some pressure over the next few quarters compared to historical averages of mid thirties as we sell through our excess inventory. We expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high twenties to low thirty million dollars for the fourth quarter. No different than for many other companies, COVID nineteen has been extremely disruptive to our business. However, with the steps we've taken to restructure the business, reduce fixed costs and ensure adequate liquidity, I'm confident that we will emerge from this period as a much stronger company than when we entered. With that, I will now open the call for questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. If you'd like to ask a question, please press the number on your telephone keypad. I have a question at this time. Please press starred in the number one key on your touch tone telephone. Again, that is starred in the number one key on your touch tone telephone. Your first question comes from the line of Eliot Alper from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Great, thank you. So, thanks for the info on just the sequential sales in the fourth quarter. I guess, could you talk about any trends quarter-to-date specifically and specifically geographic sales mix? Are you seeing any material changes? With sales and geographies that have lost restrictions compared to those that have more. Yeah, just a just a couple of notes, you know, with the Apple launch happening a little bit later than we had experienced previously, there was there, you know, maybe five million dollars of of sales that shifted from Q three into Q four which obviously benefits kind of the the sequential the sequential look at revenue overall, though, we're seeing really good sell-through of of the phones. It seems. VERY SUCCESSFUL IN MARKET AND AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BENEFITING THAT BENEFITING FROM THAT. SO Q4 STARTING OFF REALLY REALLY WELL IN TERMS OF GEO'S AND YOU KNOW NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN GEO EXPANSION CHRIS MENTIONED OR GEO MIX CHRIS MENTIONED ON HIS IN HIS PREPARED REMARKS THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY SEEING SOME HEADWINDS AT LEAST IN TERMS OF SHUTDOWNS IN SOME OF OUR INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS HOWEVER YOU KNOW THE WIRELESS DEALERS KIND OF REMAINS TO BE SEEN AS TO HOW THAT'S GONNA IMPACT DEMAND. BUT I THINK OVERALL WE'RE DEFINITELY SEEING SOME STRONG SIGNS THAT THAT WE'RE KIND OF GETTING BACK TO A MORE NORMAL Q4 EXPERIENCE THOUGH OBVIOUSLY COVID REMAINS YOU KNOW A BIT OF A BIT OF A CLOUD OVER EVERYTHING ANY IMPLICATIONS THAT MAY HAVE ON THE DECEMBER QUARTER? YEAH, THE ONE THING THAT WE WILL WE WILL START TO SEE IS OBVIOUSLY THE BLACK FRIDAY SEEMS TO BE MORE SOME RETAILERS ARE TAKING STRATEGY WHICH ARE SPREADING IT OUT OVER A NUMBER OF DAYS OVER THE OVER THE MONTH THATS SOMETHING THATS GONNA BE DIFFERENT I THINK WERE STILL GONNA SEE A PRETTY STRONG ONLINE ATTACHMENT FROM BOTH SIDES DOT COM AND OBVIOUSLY THROUGH AMAZON SO BUT Sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? From the line of Matt Damon from Titan Capital Management, your line is open. Great, thank you. I was hoping you could put a number on the expediting shipping costs that you, that you incurred in the third quarter just to give us some better idea of how the housing market went. Yeah, it was between two and three million dollars, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you know, we we really, it was a bit of a balancing act with inventory, where we were trying to run it down and ourselves. Picked up at the end we mean we did have to move quickly and unfortunately resulted in some some expedited air freight charges. And for the fourth quarter are you expecting that to reoccur or is it heavy up and you feel like you're in a better place now? Yeah, it's a great question you know I think we're still probably chasing a little bit of demand you know the one thing that's also kind of impacted us no different than any other company that's importing from overseas is JUST GENERALLY FREIGHT RATES HAVE INCREASED KINDA GLOBALLY AND SO THAT'S THAT'S ALSO IMPACTED IT BUT I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT YOU KNOWS AS I MENTIONED IT'S A BIT OF A BALANCING ACT WE DEFINITELY WANTED TO BE CAREFUL YOU KNOW GIVEN THE PANDEMIC AND IN HOW MUCH INVENTORY WE WERE PLANNING AND YOU KNOW FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN SOME SOME UPSIDES WHICH IS GREAT Great. I also want to ask if I could really quickly about the terror situation. And now with a biden presidency, I know you've been moving some production out of China. Does that change your view on moving production out of China or how are you thinking about this new regime? Yeah, I think mattie doesn't change our strategy. Ultimately, we were looking to diversify across our cm base. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SETTING THE COMPANY UP FOR CONTINUED BUSINESS. SO WE'RE STILL FOLLOWING THE STRATEGY AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A VERY GOOD QUARTER WHERE WE'VE NOW SUCCESSFULLY PILOTED BOTH SCREEN PROTECTION AND WIRELESS POWER OUTSIDE OF CHINA. SO IT GIVES US THAT ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN WHEN NEEDED. OBVIOUSLY CHINA IS STILL A BIG PART OF OUR STRATEGY BUT WHAT I LIKE IS WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT Great, thanks both of you. Thanks, Matt. Thank you, once again, in order to pass the question, please press the number one on your touchdown telephone. Gentlemen, I'm showing no for the question at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Chris Herrin for any closing remarks. Thank you, and thank everybody for joining our Q3 earnings report. We look forward to updating you again on Q4. Have a great evening, everyone. And stay safe. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining, and we'll disconnect now."

SEVERAL YEARS MICHELLE THE MAJORITY UM IF NOT ALL OF THE COMPANIES YOU KNOW ORGANIC SALES GROWTH HAS COME REALLY FROM PRICING AS OPPOSED TO VOLUME OR CONSUMPTION GROWTH UM AND MUCH OF THIS IS OBVIOUSLY DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY'S NEW PRICING MODEL AND THE ASSOCIATED VOLUME ELASTICITY THAT THAT COMES WITH IT I GUESS THAT SAID AS YOU LOOK FORWARD INTO 21 AND BEYOND I'M CURIOUS IF THERE IS A SORT OF FOCUS INTERNALLY ON MAYBE REGAINING SOME BETTER BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO DRIVERS AND IF SO YOU KNOW WOULD YOU EXPECT TO SEE SOME OF THAT MAYBE DEVELOP MORE FULLY UM NEXT YEAR THANKS SO MUCH YEP ANDREW ABSOLUTELY I THINK WE'VE SHARED BEFORE THAT YOU KNOW WE DO VIEW PRICING AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR GROWTH ALGORITHM BUT WE'RE VERY FOCUSED UM AND WOULD LIKE TO UM DRIVE TO GREATER BALANCE BETWEEN PRICE AND VOLUME YOU KNOW WE HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY INTO UH Q4 AND 2021 AND WE DO EXPECT VOLUME TRENDS TO IMPROVE PART OF THAT WILL BE US LAPPING SOME OF OUR PRICING PLASTICITY FROM LAST YEAR AND ALSO A CONTINUATION OF SOME OF THE STRONG SHARE GAINS THAT WE'VE SEEN TO DATE THAT WILL CARRY INTO THE FIRST PART OF NEXT YEAR I THINK YOU CAN DEFINITELY COUNT ON SEEING VOLUME BEING A MORE IMPORTANT PART OF THE ALGORITHM UM NEXT YEAR AND WE FEEL GOOD THAT THE CALENDAR PROGRAMMING WE HAVE THE INNOVATION THE MEDIA IS REALLY GONNA HELP TO DRIVE SOME OF THAT GREAT GREAT THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM LINE OF KEN GOLDMAN WITH JP MORGAN PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTIONS HI THANK YOU UM ALONG THE SAME LINES OF 2021 IF I CAN UH MICHELLE YOU YOU PULLED

PLAN IS FOR ADVERTISING MARKETING IN GENERAL AS YOU GET INTO WHAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE A MORE NORMAL UH YEAR IN 202 SURE SO WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE IN INVESTING IN OUR BRANDS THAT IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF OUR GROWTH MODEL UM ON THE BUSINESS SO CLEARLY AS WE MENTIONED TO YOU WE HAD PULLED BACK ON SOME SPEND IN AREAS WHERE WE JUST THOUGHT GIVEN THE PANDEMIC IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR EXAMPLE IN REFRESHMENTS WHERE WE KNEW CONSUMER USAGE WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY BUT AS WE LOOKED AT 2021 AND AS WE'VE STARTED TO YOU KNOW SEE THE MOMENTUM THAT WE'RE SEEING AND SOME OF THE RECOVERIES YOU KNOW WE DEFINITELY PLAN ON UM TAKING OUR INVESTMENT LEVELS TO WHERE WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE AND MORE IN LINE WITH WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY SO YOU'LL SEE US UM REALLY LEANING INTO TO DRIVE THE CONSUMER AND TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT WE'RE SEEING THANK YOU AND THEN FOR A FOLLOW-UP UM YOU YOU DIDN'T DO ANY SHARE REPURCHASES THIS QUARTER I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME IN UH TWO YEARS AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME WAS RIGHT BEFORE YOU BOUGHT UM PIRATE'S BOOTY UH I WANNA ASK IF THE LACK OF REPO IS AN INDICATION OF A PENDING DEAL OF COURSE BUT I AM CURIOUS HOW YOU WOULD DESCRIBE THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT FOR POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS UH I GUESS PARTICULARLY OUR TARGETS MAY BE MORE WILLING TO SELL BECAUSE THEY CAN DO SO OFF A HIGHER SALES NUMBER THAN USUAL OR ARE THEY MORE HESITANT BECAUSE THEY I GUESS KIND OF WANNA RIDE THIS DEMAND WAVE AS LONG AS THEY CAN STEVE DO YOU WANNA TAKE THAT ONE YEAH I'D BE HAPPY TO SO FIRST JUST ON THE SHARE REPURCHASE I UH WILL JUST ECHO WHAT YOU SAID DON'T READ ANYTHING INTO THAT I WOULD SAY FOR THIS YEAR WE HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE BIT MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO LIQUIDITY IN GENERAL YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND THE COVID UM PHASE UH JUST TAKING A LITTLE BIT MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH UH WE WILL BE REVISITING THAT AS WE LOOK AT NEXT YEAR AND I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES HAVEN'T CHANGED WITH RESPECT TO M&A SPECIFICALLY IT'S PROBABLY MORE THE LATTER I THINK PEOPLE ARE ARE STILL THE ONES THAT ARE THE MOST INTERESTING ARE RIDING THE WAVE AND THEY STILL HAVE VALUATION EXPECTATIONS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY DID PRE- COVID IF NOT HIGHER UH BUT I WOULD SAY WE'RE CONTINUING TO UH HAVE AN ACTIVE FUNNEL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO UPDATE THE THE MARKET AS APPROPRIATE GREAT THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF ROBERT MOSKOW WITH CREDIT SUISSE PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION HI THANK YOU UM I I THINK THE UM UH THE THE RECOVERY UH UH EXPECTED IN 2021 UH IN INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER IS UM YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE A 2% HEADWIND THIS YEAR IN 202 UH BUT CAN YOU UH GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR AS TO THE CONDITION OF YOUR BUSINESS IN MEXICO AND INDIA AND CHINA UM IS IS IT EASY TO ASSUME THAT THINGS CAN GO BACK TO NORMAL OR HAS THE PANDEMIC IM IMPAIRED YOUR COMMERCIAL CAPABILITIES AT ALL UM OR THE RETAILERS UM DESIRE TO MERCHANDISE CONFECTIONARY PRODUCTS UM I IN THOSE MARKETS YEAH SO FIRST OF ALL I'D START BY SAYING CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND VOLATILITY WITH THE PANDEMIC WE ALL KNOW THAT WE'RE SEEING THE UPS AND DOWNS OF YOU KNOW OCCASIONAL INCREASES OF SPIKES IN MARKETS AROUND THE GLOBE THAT THAT SAID I WOULD SAY THAT WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY OUR PERFORMANCE IN INTERNATIONAL OUR TEAM DID A GREAT JOB EXECUTING IN THIS VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN WHILE EACH MARKET IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE USE OF THE CATEGORY IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT CONSUMERS ARE REALLY LOOKING DURING THIS TIME FOR BRANDS THEY TRUST AND WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUILDING THE THE HERSHEY EQUITY SO WE WERE PLEASED WITH THE REBOUND THAT WE SAW IN MANY OF OUR MARKETS I THINK I MENTIONED IN INDIA OUR BUSINESS WAS NOW UP 6% VERSUS IT HAD BEEN DOWN WE GAINED MARKET SHARE ACROSS ALMOST EVERY MARKET ON OUR CORE CHOCOLATE CATEGORY SO I HA I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE THE BUSINESS HAS BEEN IMPAIRED IN ANY MARKET ON A PERMANENT BASIS UM YOU KNOW JUST AS WE'RE PIVOTING IN THE U S I THINK WE'VE PIVOTED TO WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE IN INTERNATIONAL AND WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE UM THE RECOVERY AND YOU KNOW PLAN TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER AGAINST THAT UM THANKS CAN I CAN I DIVE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO MEXICO UM ARE THERE ANY UM PACKAGING UM UH UH REQUIREMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS MAKING ON OUR NUTRITIONAL VALUES OR UH A ANY CONCERNS ABOUT UM UH UH ABOUT UH THE CATEGORY UH HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT THE CATEGORY YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO THE GOVERNMENT DID PUT IN PLACE FRONT-OF-PACK LABELING CHANGES IN MEXICO AND THAT NEW PACKAGING IS NOW IN THE MARKET AND WE'RE BEGINNING TO MONITOR THE TRENDS UM WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS KNOW OUR CATEGORY AS A TREAT THEY KNOW IT HAS SUGAR AND SO WE EXPECT THAT WE'LL SEE LESS IMPACT FROM THAT THAN PERHAPS OTHER CATEGORIES WILL BUT WE WILL OF COURSE KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THAT AND I WOULD SAY MEXI MEXICO HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HARDER HIT UM DEVELOPING MARKETS RELATIVE TO COVID SO WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE PROGRESS WE'RE SEEING BUT IT'S A LITTLE SLOWER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER MARKETS OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF DAVID PALMER WITH EVERCORE ISI PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION THANKS UH GOOD MORNING UH A QUESTION ON YOUR SHARE GAINS AND IN THE U S AND PARTICULARLY IN CHOCOLATE UH YOU YOU REALLY IN IN YOUR PREPARED REMARKS YOU TOUCHED ON THIS HOW ADAPTIVE YOU WERE BY MARKET BY CHANNEL UH IN EACH STATE IN TER IN TERMS OF S'MORES UM SOME OF THAT IT'S RELATED OR MIGHT BE RELATED TO SUPPLY CHAIN COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT PART OF IT AND AND I THINK THE THE REASON I'M ASKING IS BECAUSE IF THERE IS A SUPPLY CHAIN BREAKDOWN OR LACK OF ADAPTABILITY BY A COMPETITOR MAYBE THAT WILL REPRESENT SHARE GAINS THAT THEY CAN REVERSE SOMEWHAT IN ' 21 AND I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO I WOULD SAY I BELIEVE OUR SHARE GAINS ARE A TESTAMENT TO BOTH OUR STRONG BRANDS OUR UH CONSUMER UNDERSTANDING OUR PROGRAMMING AS WELL AS TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN EXECUTION AND EXECUTION AT RETAIL BOTH OF WHICH TEND TO BE YOU KNOW CORE ADVANTAGES FOR US UM AS A COMPANY SO I THINK WE'RE SEEING OUR CATEGORIES AND OUR BRANDS ARE DEFINITELY RESONATING WITH CONSUMERS AND AS YOU MENTIONED WE REALLY PIVOTED WITH THE CONSUMER SO VERY EARLY ON WE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND HOW CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WAS CHANGING AND WE'VE TALKED TO ALL OF YOU BEFORE ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR CATEGORY SPLITS A THIRD A THIRD A THIRD TAKE HOME INSTANT CONSUMABLE AND SEASONAL AND AS WE SAW CONSUMER SHIFTS TO MORE AT-HOME BEHAVIORS WE VERY EARLY ON SHIFTED THE FOCUS IN OUR PORTFOLIO TO REALLY DIAL UP S'MORES TWIZZLERS FOR MOVIE NIGHTS UM YOU KNOW OUR BAKING PRODUCT ACTIVITIES AND THEN WITHIN THE SEASONS EVEN WITH HALLOWEEN WE MADE THAT DECISION TO LEAN IN AND DRIVE AND BUILD A HALLOWEEN SEASON VERSUS BACK AWAY FROM IT AND AND EVERYTHING RELATED TO THAT RELATIVE TO LET'S SET THE SEASON EARLY SO WE CAN GET CONSUMERS IN IN PRE-TRICK-OR-TREAT UM YOU KNOW LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE SMART ABOUT THE PORTFOLIO THAT'S OUT THERE AND NOT OVERLY INDEX TO SEASONAL SKUS ET CETERA AND THEN WE WORKED REALLY HARD ON MESSAGING TO MESSAGE CONSUMERS SAFE WAYS TO CELEBRATE THE HOLIDAY WE DIALED UP ECOMMERCE AS CONSUMER SHIFTED TO ECOMMERCE AND BECAUSE WE HAD INVESTED IN CAPABILITIES IN THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT UM AND THEN I THINK UH A LOT OF THE STRONG INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE IN OTHER CAPABILITIES OVER THE YEARS HELPED US DURING THIS TIME TO EXECUTE WELL AND SOME OF THOSE GO BEYOND SUPPLY CHAIN SO YOU KNOW WE'VE MADE INVESTMENTS IN BETTER UNDERSTANDING CONSUMER TRENDS WE'VE MADE INVESTMENTS IN OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST AT A MUCH MORE GRANULAR LEVEL WE'VE MADE MEDIA INVESTMENTS TO TARGET BETTER AND CERTAINLY WE'VE INVESTED IN OUR PLANTS ALL ALONG THE WAY WHICH REALLY ENABLED US TO PIVOT QUICKLY TO SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND REALLY REALLY BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE AND THEN WE MADE THE DECISION TO KEEP OUR RETAIL SALES TEAMS AT RETAIL SO AS I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT THAT SHARE GAIN I WOULD SAY CLEARLY WE WOULD EXPECT TO TO CONTINUE TO SEE SHARE GAINS CLEARLY THROUGH THE SPRING OF ' 2 WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD MODERATE AFTER THAT THOUGH WE'RE CERTAINLY EXPECTING TO TO HOLD ON TO SHARE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE OUR OUTSTANDING PROGRAMMING AND AND ALSO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH EXCELLENCE THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU AND THEN JUST ON ANY SORT OF ONE-TIMES FROM THIS YEAR THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT FROM A MODEL PERSPECTIVE I'M THINKING ABOUT COVID-RELATED FRICTION COSTS THIS YEAR BUT ALSO YOU MIGHT ADD BACK SOME SG&A IN PARTS UM AND AND OTHER SO ANY ONE-TIME-TYPE COMPARISONS THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THANKS YEAH I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PREPARE PREPARED REMARKS ON THE TOP LINE WE HAD ABOUT A TWO-POINT IMPACT SO YOU CAN RIGHT AWAY SAY THERE'S A DROP THROUGH THAT TWO POINTS INTO PROFITABILITY BUT THEN IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE NET OF COSTS FOR COVID SO PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND UH EMPLOYEE INCENTIVES THAT WE HAD EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND YOU NET THEM AGAINST THE DME OPTIMIZATION THE MEDIA OPTIMIZATION THAT WE DID AS WELL AS THE T&E SAVINGS IT WAS A NET SLIGHT POSITIVE ON THOSE TWO PIECES AND SO THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO MOSTLY GO AWAY WE'LL HAVE SOME LINGERING COSTS NEXT YEAR PROBABLY LESS ONE-OFF IN ANY QUARTER RELATED TO COVID PPE AND SO FORTH THAT CONTINUE UH BUT NET IT WAS JUST A SLIGHT POSITIVE OUTSIDE OF THE TWO-POINT DRAG ON THE TOP LINE THANK YOU THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM LINE OF CHRIS GROWE WITH STIFEL PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION HI GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HI I HAD A QUESTION FOR YOU IF I IF I LOOK BACK AT UH HALLOWEEN I'M CU CURIOUS IF YOU SPLIT THE SEASON APART AND YOU HAD GIVEN SOME INFORMATION ON UH LAST QUARTER UM SORT OF THE EARLY SEASON PART AND THAT TRICK-OR-TREAT SEASON PART KIND OF HOW EACH PIECE PERFORMED IF YOU CAN GIVE IT A LITTLE COLOR ON THAT WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION FROM IRI BUT I'M CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE BETTER INFORMATION THAN WE HAVE AND THEN I'M I'M ALSO CURIOUS AS I THINK ABOUT THAT EARLY PART IF THAT'S MORE INDICATIVE OF WHAT YOU EXPECT FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON AS WE MOVE INTO CHRISTMAS AND THAT KIND OF TIME WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE A TRICK-OR-TREAT UH EVENT UM COULD THAT EARLY SEASON IF YOU START THAT THAT SEASON EARLY IN PARTICULAR IN STORES BE MORE LIKE WHAT WE SAW IN THE EARLY PART OF HALLOWEEN IF THAT MAKES SENSE YUP SO CLEARLY WE SAW THAT WITHIN THE SEASON THE EARLY PART OF THE SEASON PERFORMED MORE STRONGLY UH AND THE LATER PART THAT'S MORE TRICK-OR-TREAT FOCUSED PERFORMED A LITTLE BIT SOFTER NOW WE HAD ANTICIPATED THAT SO OVERALL THE SEASON PERFORMED EXACTLY IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS UM AS WE LOOK AT THE TOTAL SEASON WE WERE UH QUITE PLEASED THAT OUR SALES WERE ACTUALLY UP VERSUS A YEAR AGO AS WAS OUR SELL-THROUGH UP VERSUS A YEAR AGO SO DURING A TIME OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE RESILIENCY OF THE CATEGORY AND THE CONSUMER'S DESIRE TO REALLY HOLD ONTO AND CONTINUE TO CELEBRATE THE UH TRADITIONS AND FUN OCCASIONS LIKE THIS IN THEIR FAMILY LIVES AS WE LOOK AT HOLIDAY HOLIDAY IS HAS SOME DIFFERENT CONSUMER DYNAMICS THAN HALLOWEEN AND SO WE BELIEVE IT WILL BEHAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME OF THE PRESSURE THAT WE ANTICIPATED WE'D HAVE COMING INTO HALLOWEEN UM THE CATEGORY SHOULD BE QUITE STRONG CONSUMERS USE THE PRODUCT IN YOU KNOW IN DIFFERENT WAYS IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT FAMILY OCCASIONS WE AREN'T AS BIG IN GIFTING SOME OF THE AREAS OF THE CATEGORY THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE HARD-HIT SO WE EXPECT SOLID RESULTS UM GIVEN THAT SKEW TO AT-HOME CONSUMPTION OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN UM JUST TO FOLLOW-ON TO THAT DID DID ARE YOU SHIPPING IN SHIPPING IN HOLIDAY UM PRODUCTS EARLY AND WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN AN INCREMENTAL BENEFIT DO WE SEE SOME OF THAT IN THE THIRD QUARTER MORE THAN WE WOULD HAVE SEEN HISTORICALLY YEAH WE DID JUST LIKE WE DID WITH HALLOWEEN UH STARTED SHIPPING IN HOLIDAY A BIT EARLY SO YOU DO GET SOME PICKUP IN THE THIRD QUARTER FOR THAT THAT'LL TAKE AWAY A LITTLE BIT FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER YOU KNOW MAYBE ON THE ORDER OF 50 BASIS POINTS OKAY GREAT AND WE OFFERED THAT TO DRIVE THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR EARLY AS WELL JUST AS WE DID WITH HALLOWEEN UM YOU KNOW AS HALLOWEEN WAS STILL ON THE FLOOR HOLIDAY WAS ALSO OUT THERE SO THAT CO CONSUMERS COULD ALSO YOU KNOW GRAVITATE TO THE HOLIDAY PRETTY QUICKLY <INAUDIBLE> A STRONG HALLOWEEN YES STRONG HALLOWEEN SELL-THROUGH REALLY HELPS US BECAUSE IT HELPS US GET THAT FAST START TO HOLIDAY BECAUSE IT CLEARS THE SPACE TO BE ABLE TO PUT HOLIDAY ON THE FLOOR OKAY THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE COLOR THERE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM LINE OF JASON ENGLISH WITH GOLDMAN SACHS PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION HEY GOOD MORNING FOLKS CONGRATULATIONS ON A ON A GOOD QUARTER AS WELL THANK YOU UH I WANNA PICK UP ON THE BACK OF CHRIS'S QUESTIONS AND AND TEASE OUT TRY TO TEASE OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE OUTLOOK ON HOLIDAYS GOING FORWARD UM THE HALLOWEEN EARLY PART SELLING WAS PHENOMENALLY STRONGER MUCH BETTER THAN I THINK ANY OF US EXPECTED IT UH I THINK A BIG PART OF THAT IS DUE TO THE MERCHANDISING PROGRAMS THAT RETAILERS HAD IT SEEMS LIKE THEY STARTED BIGGER AND EARLIER THAN THEY USUALLY DO UM HAS HAS THAT EASILY INFLUENCED HOW THEY'RE GONNA APPROACH OTHER SEASONS GOING FORWARD SO SAY SAID MORE DIRECTLY YOU EXPECT RETAILERS TO PROVIDE MORE MORE MERCHANDISING SUPPORT BEHIND THE CATEGORY INTO THE HOLIDAY INTO EASTER THAN THE OTHERWISE WOULD COMING OUT OF THE THE SUCCESS THEY SAW ON HALLOWEEN SO WE'VE ALWAYS HAD PRETTY STRONG MERCHANDISING SUPPORT UM AT EVERY SEASON AND ONE THING WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WITH SEASONS IS WHEN WE GET IT ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT CONSUMERS WILL BUY UM THAT HOLIDAY OR SEASONAL PRODUCT WHETHER IT'S EASTER OR WHEREVER EARLY FOR IN-HOME CONSUMPTION IF YOU GET IT OUT THERE IT'S KIND OF SPARKS THE TRIGGER OF YOU KNOW FUN MOMENTS EARLIER SO I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD SAY SPECIFICALLY THAT UM WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT RETAILERS ARE GONNA MERCHANDISE IT EVEN MORE THAN THEY EVER HAVE UM I DO THINK THAT THEY WILL BE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT THEY DEFINITELY GET IT OUT EARLY TO CAPTURE THE EARLY PART OF THE SEASON SINCE THAT IS THE PIECE THAT YOU KNOW IS A BIT MORE STABLE UM THERE WERE A FEW RETAILERS YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH THE UNCERTAINTY OF HALLOWEEN AND THE FACT THAT ALL THESE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH HALLOWEEN REALLY HAD TO BE MADE IN EARLY MAY WHEN THINGS WERE QUITE UNCERTAIN AND SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED AND BARS AND RESTAURANTS AND ALL OF THAT SO THERE ARE A FEW RETAILERS WHO HAD PULLED BACK ON HALLOWEEN AND BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE SEASON THIS YEAR THEY WILL LIKELY HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE GOING FORWARD WHICH SHOULD HELP TO MAKE FOR AN EVEN STRONGER HALLOWEEN NEXT YEAR AND PROBABLY ALSO BUILD CONFIDENCE FOR THE OTHER SEASONS LIKE EASTER THAT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THEN ONE MORE QUESTION ON THE UM I AM STICKING WITH FOLLOW-ONS TO CHRIS'S QUESTION WHICH I THOUGHT WAS SOLID UM THE THE THE THE EARLY PART OF THE SEASON VERSUS THE LATTER PART OF THE SEASON UH THE EARLY PART OF SEASON WAS EXCEPTIONALLY ROBUST UM AND YOU SAID LATE PART WAS A BIT SOFTER BUT IN SOMEWHERE IN YOUR REMARKS I THINK YOU SAID ALL-IN TOTAL HOLIDAY SO BOTH PRE EARLY PART AND LATE PART FINISHED DOWN MID-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE CATEGORY I THINK MATHEMATICALLY TO GET THE CATEGORY DOWN MID-SINGLE DIGITS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE SOME PRETTY PRETTY SHARP DECLINES UM COMING THROUGH THE THE RETAIL SALES DATA IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AS WE AS WE CAPTURE THAT LATE PART OF THE SEASON I'M THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT AM I INTERPRETING YOUR COMMENTS CORRECTLY YES YEP YOU ARE INTERPRETING THEM CORRECTLY UM SO CATEGORY WAS DOWN MID-SINGLE DIGITS OVERALL AS MUCH AS OUR BUSINESS WAS ACTUALLY UP UM AND WE WILL SEE SOME OF THOSE DECLINE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JASON IT'S MELISSA ONE OTHER THING- SURE TO JUST KEEP IN MIND THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A TIMING IMPACT FROM THE NIELSEN AND IRI DATA GIVEN THAT THE SEASON WAS ON A SATURDAY VERSUS A THURSDAY AND BASED ON RETAIL RECORDING DAYS SO YOU WILL PROBABLY EVEN SEE IT DOWN EVEN MORE UM AND YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT TILL KIND OF MID NOVEMBER SO YOU SEE SOME OF THE THOSE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS BEING REPORTED SO SOME OF IT WHEN YOU SEE WILL BE JUST THE TIMING SHIFT BECAUSE OF THE DAY OF THE WEEK AND SOME OF IT WILL CERTAINLY BE THE THE DECLINES IN INTEGRITY AT THE END UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF DAVID DRISCOLL WITH DD RESEARCH PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION GREAT THANK YOU GOOD MORNING AND CONGRATULATIONS ON A GREAT EXECUTION IN THE QUARTER THANKS DAVID I HAD UH TWO TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE JUST UM UM TWO RELATIVELY SMALL ONES ON THE OTHER EXPENSE COMMENTARY I THINK THROUGH THE THROUGH THE YEAR TO DATE PERIOD OTHER EXPENSE IS IS ONLY A SMALL NUMBER BUT YOUR FULL YEAR PROJECTION 100 TO $110 MILLION ON THAT MEANS IT'S A VERY MASSIVE NUMBER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER IF AM I DOING THE MATH RIGHT IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT ON HOW THE THE PATTERN LAYS OUT FOR OTHER EXPENSE AND THEN RELATED JUST ANOTHER FOLLOW UP ON YOUR VOLUMES E EXPECTED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER I THINK IN YOUR PREPARED COMMENTS YOU SAID NORTH AMERICAN ORGANIC GROWTH SIMILAR TO THIRD QUARTER BUT PRICING ONLY LIKE A HALF POINT SO THAT WOULD MEAN VOLUME IS SOMETHING LIKE FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS POSITIVE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AM I DOING THOSE TWO PIECES RIGHT ANY COLOR YOU CAN GIVE ON THOSE TWO COMMENTS YEAH I'D BE HAPPY TO SO ON THE TAX SIDE AND OTHER EXPENSE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT WE WILL HAVE A LARGE OTHER EXPENSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER NOW THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING EVEN IN THE EARLY GUIDANCE EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND THEN ALONG WITH THAT A LOWER TAX RATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER TO DO THE MATH ON THE TAX RATE YOU ALSO HAVE TO SOLVE FOR A LOWER TAX RATE SO THAT'S HOW THE THOSE TWO LINES WILL PLAY OUT AND YES ON THE VOLUME UP IN THE FOURTH QUARTER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT THE RIGHT WAY UH WE DO HAVE SOME INVENTORY REPLENISHMENTS THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WE SAW THAT IN THE THIRD WE'LL SEE SOME MORE OF THAT OR THAT CONTINUE INTO THE FOURTH WE'RE ALSO LAPPING SOME UH ELASTICITY AFTER THE PRICE INCREASE LAST YEAR AND THEN THIS CONTINUED STRONG SHEER GAINS THOSE THREE THINGS ARE PART OF DRIVING THAT FOURTH QUARTER VOLUME MICHELE LIKE A BIGGER PICTURE QUESTION HERSHEY TOOK PRICING IN MOST OF THE PORTFOLIO OUTSIDE OF SEASONAL CANDIES IN 2018 AND THEN IN 201 GIVEN THE NEGATIVE IMPACT TO HALLOWEEN FOR THE ENTIRE CATEGORY WOULD YOU AGREE THAT NOW IS PROBABLY NOT THE TIME FOR SEASONAL PRICE INCREASE ACTIONS MAYBE THIS GETS DELAYED TO 2022 OR SOMETIME LATER UNTIL WE GET A NORMAL CONSUMER ENVIRONMENT ESSENTIALLY I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO ASSESS YOUR YOUR ABILITY TO PASS THROUGH COST INCREASES THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS IT'S A WEIRD ENVIRONMENT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S ALTERED THAT CALCULUS THANK YOU YEP SO OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T SPEAK TO ANY SPECIFICS ABOUT OUR SPECIFIC ANY UPCOMING SPECIFIC PRICING ACTIONS UM WHAT I CAN SAY IS YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE TO OUR PRICING STRATEGY OF SMALLER MORE FREQUENT INCREASES AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF PRICING EVERY YEAR OR THAT WE WOULD ALWAYS ANNOUNCE PRICING AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW WE DID FOR EXAMPLE UM ACTUALLY HAVE A SMALL PRICE INCREASE THIS PAST YEAR ON OUR FOOD SERVICE BUSINESS IN THE THIRD QUARTER SO YOU KNOW IF WE LOOK O OVER TIME WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRICE AT VARIOUS TIMES UM AND VARIOUS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS UM SO WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US IS WE DO THINK PRICING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ALGORITHM BUT AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WE REALLY WANNA GROW THROUGH BALANCED GROWTH ACROSS LEVERS DISTRIBUTION VELOCITY INNOVATION UH PRICE ET CETERA SO UM YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT UH THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY UM THE ONE PIECE OF THE PORTFOLIO THAT WE WE HAVE NOT YET PRICED AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT WE HAVEN'T ANNOUNCED A PRICE INCREASE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME THE MAGNITUDE OF PRICING IN ' 21 WOULD BE LESS THAN WE'VE SEEN IN PRIOR YEARS AT LEAST AT THIS POINT UM YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN PLEASED THAT WE'VE SEEN CONVERSION BE PRETTY GOOD THIS YEAR EVEN IN A VERY DIFFICULT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT UM AND I THINK THAT CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS WHICH IS THE CATEGORY IS VERY RESILIENT OUR BRANDS ARE STRONG WE CONTINUE TO INVEST INTO OUR BRANDS AND THAT DOES UM ALLOW US FOR AN EVEN GREATER AMOUNT OF PRICING POWER REALLY HELPFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF STEVE POWERS WITH DEUTSCHE BANK PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION YES HEY THANKS UM GOOD MORNING I I GUESS BUILDING UH UH SOMEWHAT ON EARLIER QUESTIONS I'D LOVE A LITTLE BIT MORE COLOR AROUND JUST YOUR GENERAL MINDSET HEADING INTO 21 AS YOU WORK THROUGH YOUR PLANNING PROCESS UM YOU CLEARLY THERE THERE ARE PARTS OF YOUR BUSINESS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER PRESSURE THIS YEAR INTERNATIONAL MOVIE THEATERS VENDING SPECIALTY ET CETERA UH AND HOPEFULLY ALL THOSE SET UP FOR AT LEAST DIRECTIONAL RECOVERY IN THE YEAR AHEAD BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'VE BEEN GAINING A LOT OF SHARE YOU'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS UH IN AT-HOME CATEGORIES LIKE BAKING AND WITH INITIATIVES LIKE S'MORES UM ALL OF WHICH IS FANTASTIC MOMENTUM BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN COULD SET UP FOR DIFFICULT YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS UM SO AS YOU SIZE IT ALL TOGETHER I GUESS IS THERE A WAY TO TO FRAME YOUR THINKING AT A SUMMARY LEVEL TO WHAT DEGREE THOSE VARIOUS PUTS AND TAKES SORT OF JUST NET EACH OTHER OUT IN YOUR MIND OR ARE YOU APPROACHING ' 21 PLANNING THINKING WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW EITHER A NET EASIER OR A NET HARDER SETUP VERSUS WHAT UM YOU KNOW ONE ONE MIGHT CONSIDER TYPICAL THANKS YEAH SO WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE MOMENTUMS UH THAT WE'RE SEEING AND I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW YOUR CALL-OUTS IN WHAT YOU SHARED ABOUT SOME OF THE UPS AND DOWNS ON THE BUSINESS I THINK ARE VERY ACCURATE UM YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE WE'RE SEEING THAT OUR CATEGORY AND OUR BRANDS REALLY RESONATE WITH CONSUMERS UM AND ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOME OF THOSE MOMENTS OF GOODNESS MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PIVOT WITH THE CONSUMER AND ALSO PIVOT WITH OUR CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE WITHIN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT MO MOMENTUM AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE PIVOTING SO YOU KNOW THIS YEAR OBVIOUSLY IT WAS CONSUMER SHIFTED TO TAKE HOME AND SO WE DIALED UP S'MORES AND WE DIALED UP TWIZZLERS AND WE DIALED UP BAKING AND WE YOU KNOW LEANED IN TO CREATE THE SEASON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD CAPTURE THAT OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW GIVING CONSUMERS NEW WAYS TO PARTICIPATE IN HALLOWEEN THAT FRANKLY WE BELIEVE THOSE THINGS LIKE CANDY SLIDES AND CANDY GRAVEYARDS AND ALL THE CREATIVE THINGS PEOPLE DID WILL PROBABLY BECOME A PART OF THEIR ONGOING TRADITIONS AND THEY HAVE JUST EVOLVED YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED WE WERE ABLE TO DIAL IN AND ACCELERATE ECOMMERCE AND I TH I THINK AS WE LOOK TO NEXT YEAR WE'RE PREPARED IF THE CONSUMER PIVOTS YET AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO PIVOT WITH THEM I THINK WE'VE BUILT AND WE'VE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO EXECUTE WELL DURING THIS ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO TO PIVOT FROM AN EXECUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE WHETHER IT'S AT RETAIL OR IN OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES SO WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE CAPTURED AS WELL SOME YOU KNOW CULTURAL UM UM POSITIVE EFFECTS I THINK CAPABILITIES WE'VE BUILT IN TERMS OF OPERATING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS ALLOW US TO MAKE DECISIONS MORE QUICKLY AND YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT IS AN ENABLER FOR US GOING FORWARD SO SO WE FEEL WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE THANKS FOR THAT MICHELE UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANNA TAKE THIS ONE OR STEVE BUT I JUST AS A FOLLOW-UP UM SORT OF UNRELATED JUST ANY ANY COMMENTS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON ON JUST CURRENT LEVELS OF PROMOTION THE PROMOTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT YOU EXPECT TO SEE THERE OVER THE BALANCE OF 4Q AND INTO ' 21 THANKS YEAH WE DON'T SEE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE RELATIVE TO PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY UM WE DIDN'T REALLY SEE IT THIS YEAR WE DIDN'T EXECUTE ANYTHING SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTLY AND NOR DO WE EXPECT TO UH SEE ANYTHING IN THE FUTURE OKAY PERFECT APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM LINE OF NIK MODI WITH RBC PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION YEAH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UM SO MICHELE I WAS HOPING YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT ON THE PARTNERSHIP WITH GOOGLE THAT YOU USED DURING THE HALLOWEEN PERIOD AND YOU KNOW DO YOU BELIEVE THIS CAPABILITY CAN BE LEVERAGED FOR THIS HOLIDAY SEASON BUT ALSO KIND OF IN YOUR EVERYDAY BUSINESS AS YOU KIND OF LOOK FORWARD YOU KNOW WE'RE CONTINUING TO UM TO LEVERAGE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA AND ANALYTICS AND INSIGHTS MORE AND MORE ACROSS THE BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO REALLY TRY AND STAY ON TOP OF TRACKING CONSUMER SENTIMENT AND LEVERAGING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO TAILOR COPY TO TAILOR MESSAGING TO TAILOR MEDIA SO MORE AND MORE WE'RE OPERATING AT A MORE SOPHISTICATED LEVEL RELATIVE TO USING MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES AND ALSO USING THAT TO REACH CONSUMERS AT THE RIGHT PLACES WITH THE RIGHT MESSAGE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND I I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS YOU KNOW IS THIS KIND OF NEW WAY OF OF KIND OF TARGETING CONSUMERS LIKE THE RETURN THAT YOU SEE FROM WHAT YOU'VE DONE LIKE CAN YOU JUST GIVE US ANY KIND OF UNDERSTANDING UM BECAUSE ONE THING I'M NOTICING ACROSS THE ENTIRE CPG LANDSCAPE IS COMPANIES ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY BUT THEY'RE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON THE SAME MESSAGE AND IN FACT YOU KNOW NEW CONSUMERS ARE BEING RECRUITED YOU KNOW USAGE OCCASIONS ARE CHANGING AND SO IT REALLY REQUIRES A CHANGE IN HOW YOU TALK TO THOSE CONSUMERS AND SO I FIND THIS YOU KNOW GOOGLE PARTNERSHIP YOU KNOW INCREDIBLY COMPELLING FOR YOU GUYS SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET BETTER CONTEXT ON HOW IT'S CHANGING UH THE RETURN PROFILE OF YOUR SPEND IF YOU CAN PROVIDE ANY CONTEXT ON THAT SO WE HAVE A CONTINUOUS FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING MEDIA AND THE RETURNS ON OUR MEDIA WE ALWAYS HAVE WE'VE HAD STRONG MEDIA ROI FOREVER AND OUR CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE KEEP MAKING THEM BETTER AND THEN WE CONTINUOUSLY OPTIMIZE BASED ON THAT SO RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A BIG SPEND AREA FOR US SO IT'S AN AREA WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON ELEVATING AND IT IS ABOUT YOU KNOW MAKING SURE RIGHT NOW I WOULD SAY SOME OF THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY IS THAT OPPORTUNITY OF EVEN MORE PRECISE TARGETING AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THAT TARGET THE ABILITY TO ALTER THE MESSAGE SO AND THEN WE ALTER OUR MEDIA MIX ACCORDINGLY AND I WOULD SAY WE WE SEE YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT IN THAT MIX ON A YEAR-TO-YEAR BASIS AS WE GET BETTER AT THAT I THINK WE'VE RAISED YOU KNOW SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES OF HOW WE'VE GONE JUST VERY DEEP RELATIVE TO UM SPECIFIC SEASONS WHETHER IT'S S'MORES BY ZIP CODE OR WHETHER IT'S SPECIFIC YOU KNOW HOLIDAYS AND LOOKING AT SELL-THROUGH AT A STORE LEVEL UM BASIS TO BE ABLE TO DIAL UP MEDIA ON A ZIP CODE LEVEL BASIS SO YOU'LL YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SEE MORE OF THAT FRANKLY THAT'S JUST BECOMING A WAY OF OF HOW WE OPERATE NOW GREAT AND LAST QUESTION JUST FROM AN INNOVATION STANDPOINT CAN YOU JUST PROVIDE ANY CONTEXT ON KIND OF WHAT'S REMAINING IN TERMS OF INNOVATION THIS YEAR AND HOW THINGS ARE GONNA WORK IN 2021 IF THERE'S ANY CLARITY YOU CAN PROVIDE ON ON ON THE LAUNCH TIMING YUP SO WE FEEL VERY GOOD UM ABOUT OUR INNOVATION UM SOME OF THE INNOVATIONS THAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT UM THAT ARE YOU KNOW NEW TO THE MARKET INCLUDE THE REESE'S PRETZEL PRODUCT A REESE'S CUP WITH PRETZELS IN IT UM WE'VE HAD A A RANGE OF KIT KAT FLAVORS WE KNOW ON A GLOBAL BASIS A BIG P PART OF THE KIT KAT PORTFOLIO ARE FLAVORS THEY TEND TO DO QUITE WELL UM WE ARE ON A VERY SMALL UH LEVEL UH WATCHING SNACK CAKES UM UNDER OUR RESEARCH TRADEMARK WHICH YOU KNOW DELIVERS THAT REESE EXPERIENCE IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TYPE OF PRODUCT FORM AND WE FEEL GOOD ON THAT VERSUS BASIS SOME OF THE EARLY TEST RESULTS UM AND WE WILL HAVE MORE COMING SOME ITEMS UM ON OUR TAKE-HOME SIDE OF OUR BUSINESS THAT WON'T GET ANNOUNCED TILL EARLY NEXT YEAR WHICH IS TYPICALLY THE TIME WE ANNOUNCE THOSE THINGS JUST GIVEN RESET WINDOWS UM NO MAJOR CHANGE IN OUR INNOVATION STRATEGY WE THINK IT'S WORKING VERY WELL FOR US WE THINK IT'S RIGHT SIZED UM AND WE THINK IT'S DELIVERING MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE RESULTS GREAT I'LL PASS IT ON THANK YOU THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF MICHAEL LAVERY WITH PIPER SANDLER PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE THE INCREASE IN ECOMMERCE SALES UH EVEN IF IT IT MIGHT'VE DECELERATED A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S IT'S UP VERY STRONGLY UH YOU'VE SAID IN THE PAST THAT BASKETS AND DOLLAR RING ARE HIGHER ONLINE IS THAT STILL HOLDING TRUE WITH THE GROWTH THAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW UH AND ON THE MARGIN SIDE YOU'VE YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT THERE'S A SMALL GAP BUT THAT IT THAT YOU WERE NARROWING IT AND AND THE SCALE WOULD HELP THAT IS IS THAT COMING ALONG THE WAY UH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HOW DOES THAT LOOK NOW YEAH I MEAN WE'VE GENERALLY SEEN LARGER BASKET SIZES IN GENERAL ACROSS MOST CHANNELS THIS YEAR AS PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW DOING FEWER TRIPS AND YOU KNOW MORE QUANTITY PER TRIP SO I THINK THAT'S BEEN SOMEWHAT OF JUST AN UNDERLYING DYNAMIC GIVEN THE THE PANDEMIC IMPACT IN THE MARKETPLACE UM FOR US ON OUR ECOMMERCE BUSINESS WE'VE SEEN VERY SIGNIFICANT GROWTH ACROSS THE BOARD BUT PARTICULARLY IN CLICK AND COLLECT WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO AND AND PICK UP THEIR THEIR UH GROCERIES AND ALSO IN THE LOCAL DELIVERY MODELS AS WELL VERSUS KIND OF NATIONAL DELIVER UM THE MARGINS THAT WE HAVE ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SEE IN BRICKS-AND-MORTAR OKAY GREAT THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL IN THOSE TWO AREAS E EXCUSE ME IN THOSE TWO AREAS WHERE WE HAVE YOU KNOW SIMILAR PRODUCTS OBVIOUSLY THAT WE SELL IN BRICKS-AND-MORTAR STEVE- RIGHT RIGHT ANYTHING YOU WANNA ADD YEAH I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE SAID IN THE PAST THAT OVERALL ECOMMERCE MARGINS ARE UH A LITTLE BIT DILUTIVE AND IT'S THERE AS MICHELE JUST SAID IN CLICK AND COLLECT AND LOCAL DELIVERY VERY SIMILAR NOT MUCH IMPACT AND THAT'S PROBABLY TWO THIRDS OF OUR ECOMMERCE BUSINESS THE PIECE THAT IS MORE DILUTIVE IS THE SHIP TO HOME AND IN PARTICULAR COLD SHIP AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND LOOK AT OUR OVERALL INVESTMENT WITH THOSE CUSTOMERS AND JOINT BUSINESS PLANNING TO DRIVE EFFICIENCIES OVER TIME SO THAT THOSE MARGINS ALIGN OKAY THANKS AND I I JUST WANNA FOLLOW UP ON S'MORES I THOUGHT THAT THAT YOUR THAT YOUR DATA

AS WELL OKAY GREAT THANKS A LOT THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF BRYAN SPILLANE WITH BANK OF AMERICA PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION HI GUYS GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UM SO SO JUST JUST ONE ONE QUESTION FOR ME AND I THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A COMMENTARY IN THE UM PREPARED REMARKS ABOUT UH SOME CO YOU KNOW INFLATION AND COST OF GOODS SOLD SO MAYBE STEVE COULD YOU JUST GIVE US A KIND OF UH UH A LAY OF THE LAND RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF UM YOU KNOW WHAT COMMODITY COSTS AND AND JUST COST TO GOODS INFLATION LOOKS LIKE CURRENTLY UM YOU KNOW IN THE CONTEXT OF THINGS LIKE FREIGHT COSTS ARE GOING UP YOU'VE HAD SOME COMPETITORS TALK ABOUT UH COCOA PRICES GOING UP UH SO JUST TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF YOU KNOW DIRECTIONALLY WHERE WHERE INFLATION IS HEADED RIGHT NOW SURE YEAH FOR US I'D SAY OVERALL IT'S BEEN RELATIVELY STABLE SO ON THE COMMODITY SIDE UH RELATIVELY STABLE YOU KNOW YOU SAW BIG MOVEMENTS IN IN COMMODITIES ACROSS Q2 AND Q3 AND OF COURSE WE'VE TALKED IN THE PAST WE MITIGATE SOME OF THAT VOLATILITY WITH OUR HEDGING PROGRAM AND I WOULD SAY TODAY THEY'RE FAIRLY STABLE UH THERE ARE INCREASES IN FREIGHT COSTS THERE TOO OUR TEAMS DO A GREAT JOB OF A LONGER-TERM CONTRACTING UH WHICH HELPS MITIGATE SOME OF THAT INCREASE SO THAT HASN'T BEEN A REAL MATERIAL IMPACT FOR US WE HAVE SEEN SOME INCREASED WAREHOUSING COSTS AND PART OF THAT VOLUME AND FLOW THROUGH UH ALONG WITH THE SHARE GAINS AND AND THE VOLUME INCREASES THAT WE'VE SEEN UH SO WE CALLED THAT OUT IN THE PREPARED REMARKS BUT IN TOTAL AT LEAST SITTING AT THIS POINT UH YOU KNOW WOULD SAY OVERALL COGS IS FAIRLY STABLE AND WE'LL GET MORE GUIDANCE ON 2021 WHEN WE GET INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER CALL BUT BUT I GUESS WE CAN INFER FROM THAT AT LEAST FROM WHERE WE SIT TODAY THAT YOU KNOW THAT STABLE IS IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE IT KIND OF CARRIES INTO NEXT YEAR UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES YEAH I THINK THAT'S FAIR YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR AS WE GET THE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE 2020 AND 2021 CROPS UH CROPS OF COCOA START TO BEAR THE LID SO YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT TO CONSIDER UM AND THEN THERE'S OTHER THINGS OBVIOUSLY ON THE GROSS MARGIN SIDE WE AS MICHELE SAID YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE VOLUME-DRIVEN THAN PRICE-DRIVEN MIX DRIVING GROSS MARGIN NEXT YEAR WE'LL HAVE OUR CONTINUING PRODUCTIVITY GOALS UH AND AGAIN A LOT MORE ON THAT TO COME WHEN WE TALK ON THE FOURTH QUARTER CALL ALL

YOU KNOW HERSHEY WENT DOWN THIS PATH ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO AND IT DIDN'T REALLY TRANSLATE INTO ANYTHING MATERIAL SO I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE DATA TELLS YOU IN TERMS OF CHANGES THE LANDSCAPE NOW UM DOES THIS MAYBE MARK A NEW PHASE OVER THE SNACK SECTION EVOLUTION AND UH I GUESS WHERE DO YOU THINK IT SLOTS IN I MEAN DOES IT COMPETE AGAINST THE TWINKIES THE COOKIES JUST YOU KNOW WHERE'S THE TARGET MARKET YOU KNOW ANY ANY BIG PICTURE THOUGHTS WOULD BE APPRECIATED YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE APPROACHED THIS IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL AND MEASURED WAY WHICH WAS UM NOT A MASS LAUNCH WHERE WE JUST THREW IT OUT THERE AND TRIED TO MAKE IT AS BIG AS WE POSSIBLY COULD AT ONE POINT IN TIME BUT WE DID A VERY TARGETED END-MARKET LAUNCH FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT WE COULD REALLY LEARN ABOUT THE PROPOSITION WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING THE PRODUCT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY UNDERSTOOD SOME OF THE DRIVERS OF LIKING IN THIS SNACK CAKE AREA UM AND WE ALSO REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW WHERE HOW WHERE AND HOW WE WANTED TO TO PLAY AND LAUNCH SO THIS FOR EXAMPLE IS VERY C-STORE FOCUSED UM IT IS YOU KNOW A A SINGLE SERVE TYPE OF ITEM SO WE'RE KEEPING IT AS A AS A FOCUSED LAUNCH UM IT IS DEFINITELY BRINGING THE GREAT UH CHOCOLATE AND PEANUT BUTTER TASTE PROFILE THAT WE HAVE ON REESE'S TO THE SNACK CAKE MARKET SO YES IT IS YOU KNOW PLAYING IN THAT SNAKE SNACK CAKE AREA VERSUS OTHER SNACK CAKE BRANDS UM WE KNOW THAT WE HAD PARTICIPATED IN THIS CATEGORY FOR MANY YEARS THROUGH LICENSING AND WE LEARNED THROUGH THAT THAT OUR BRANDS COULD PARTICIPATE AND EXTEND TO THE CATEGORY WE ALSO KNOW THAT MORNING SNACKING HAS BEEN A GROWING TREND AND OUR CONFECTION ITEMS SKEW MORE TO AFTERNOON AND EVENING SO THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF THAT GROWTH BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THESE SNACK CAKES GET UTILIZED UM SO AGAIN WE'RE GONNA BE VERY FOCUSED ROLLOUT WE'LL PUT IT IN LOCATIONS WHERE WE THINK WE CAN UH GARNER INCREMENTAL SPACE AND WHERE WE THINK

DOLLAR AS CONSUMERS EAT MORE AT HOME UM THE C-STORE UH CLASS DID SEE A BIT OF RECOVERY IN THE THIRD QUARTER SO WE SAW UH THE BUSINESS GROW IN THE LOW LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHICH IS DEFINITELY AN IMPROVEMENT VERSUS THOSE EARLY PANDEMIC TRENDS UM IT DID THEN SLOW A LITTLE BIT AS SUMMER ENDED AND THOSE SUMMER ROAD TRIPS DECREASED WITH KIDS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL UM OUR BUSINESS HAS TRACKED PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE CHANNEL UH AND SIGNIFICANTLY AHEAD OF THE CATEGORY SO WE HAVE SHARE GAINS OF ABOUT 120 BASIS POINTS UM IN Q3 IN THAT CHANNEL SO I'M SEEING SOME SOME REBOUNDS AND SOME RECOVERY VERSUS VERSUS WHERE IT WAS IN THE PAST AS PEOPLE ARE OUT AND ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THEY WERE GREAT AND AND THEN AS A FOLLOW-UP UM FOLLOW-UP ACTUALLY ON BRYAN SPILLANE'S QUESTION ABOUT FREIGHT COSTS I REMEMBER BACK IN 2018 AS FREIGHT COSTS SPIKED BACK THEN THAT'S QUITE A BIT OF A HEADWIND FOR YOU UM IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IT'S NOT SO MUCH OF A PROBLEM THIS TIME AROUND UH ARE YOU

UM A BIT MORE MANAGEABLE THANK YOU SURE SO YEAH FREIGHT COST RIGHT NOW WE DON'T SEE AS A A MATERIAL IMPACT IF IT CONTINUES TO RISE IT'LL HAVE A BIGGER UH A BIGGER IMPACT RIGHT NOW AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE CONTRACTED AND OUR TEAMS DO A GREAT JOB OF MANAGING THOSE CONTRACTS UH IT'S NOT HAVING AS MATERIAL IMPACT YOU KNOW IT'S ROUGHLY 10% OF OF COGS OVERALL AND SO IT'S NOT IMMATERIAL BUT RIGHT NOW NOT

AND SECONDLY UM HISTORICALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR TODAY'S VELOCITY IS GENERALLY TOMORROW'S DISTRIBUTION AND YOUR VELOCITY HAS BEEN FANTASTIC THIS IS A WEIRD YEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE'S VELOCITY IS FANTASTIC BUT DO YOU ANTICIPATE GAINING SHELF SPACE AND THAT EVERY DAY PLACE YOU KNOW YOU YOU'LL LOOK AT THE STEEL BAKING ITEMS YOU LOOK AT THESE TAKE-HOME ITEMS LIKE THIS IS PHENOMENALLY BETTER VELOCITY FORGET ABOUT JUST THE TOTAL SALES THAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE YOU ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT SHARE GAINS PERHAPS STRUCTURAL ONES I'M TALKING SHARE OF SHELF HERE AS RETAILERS UH DO RESETS FOR HOLIDAY AND FULL GOING FORWARD THANK YOU SURE SO TWO PARTS TO YOUR QUESTION THE FIRST ONE'S AROUND UM PRICE AND UM SOME OF THE DISCREPANCY AND YES THERE IS A MIX IMPACT UM HONESTLY IT MIGHT BE BEST IF MELISSA GOES AND TAKES YOU THROUGH A DEEP DIVE ON THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT UM BUT UM THE P&L IS IS DEFINITELY ACCURATE UM AS IT RELATES TO VELOCITY UH YEAH GOOD VELOCITY I LIKE YOUR PHRASE TODAY'S LOSS OF THE SMARTEST DISTRIBUTION I DO THINK THAT'S VERY ACCURATE AS WE LOOK AT UM THE SEASONS YOU ASKED ABOUT HOLIDAY YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GARNER INCREMENTAL DISTRIBUTION INCREMENTAL SK USE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR UM BOTH IN TERMS OF EVERY DAY AND SEASONS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER AND THE ITEMS THAT WE THEN PUT ON SHELF UM NOT ONLY COULD WE SUPPLY THEM BUT THEN THEY MOVED SO UM WE DO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW WE'LL CONTINUE TO TAKE A VERY DISCIPLINED APPROACH AND BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T OVER SKEW UM SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF EVERY SKEW AND AS LONG AS IT'S GOOD UM WE WILL BE THERE BUT YES WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GAIN SOME DISTRIBUTION AND AND GOING FORWARD I ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO

AND YOU KNOW IMPLEMENT IT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR KEY LEARNINGS AND WHAT DO YOU TAKE FORWARD TO FUTURE LEARNINGS TO FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WELL SO UH I THINK A LOT OF LEARNINGS ALONG THE WAY I GUESS I WOULD START WITH UM YOU KNOW THERE'S A BUSINESS MODEL FOR BRANDS THAT THAT WE AS A COMPANY ARE BEST WITH AND THAT IS YOU KNOW BRANDED ITEMS WHERE YOU KNOW BRAND MATTERS WHERE THE BUSINESS HAS SIGNIFICANT SCALE YOU KNOW PROBABLY CLOSE TO THAT $100 MILLION DOLLAR MARK AND IT NEEDS TO BE A BUSINESS THAT HAS A HIGH GROSS MARGIN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS WE'RE A BRANDED COMPANY WE INVEST A LOT IN MARKETING AND WE HAVE HIGH MARGINS THAT ENABLE US TO KIND OF INVEST IN GROW INVEST IN GROWTH AND WE THAT'S THAT'S OUR MODEL THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED SO I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LEARNINGS WAS TO HELP US SELECT THE ASSET UM I THINK SECONDLY UM REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE STRENGTH OF THE BRAND AND REALLY BEING ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT DEEP DIVE ON WHICH KPIS WE THINK UM PREDICT THE ABILITY FOR A BRAND TO SCALE AND THEN I WOULD SAY UM YOU KNOW REALLY TRYING TO SCALE THE BUSINESS WELL AND I WOULD SAY HEY WE'VE LEARNED LESSONS THE WHOLE WAY ALONG THE WAY AS YOU KNOW IN THE PAST WE BOUGHT SOME BUSINESSES OVER TO SMALL WE BOUGHT SOME BUSINESSES THAT YOU KNOW HAD LOWER MARGINS AND WE HAD SOME THAT WE PERHAPS DIDN'T EXECUTE ON THE SCALING AS WELL AND I THINK WE'VE HAD A VERY FOCUSED EX UH EFFORT ON THE SCALING AS WELL AND WE'VE GOTTEN MUCH BETTER AT THAT UM RELATIVE TO SUPPLY CHAIN RELATIVE TO THE TALENT THAT WE NEED WHEN WE BUY A COMPANY LIKE THIS WHERE WE WANT TO KEEP THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT WE WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE BRAND AND THE BUSINESS UM BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE FOCUSED ON THE POINT THAT WE'RE ALSO AT A POINT WHERE WE WANT

I THINK YOU CAN DEFINITELY COUNT ON SEEING VOLUMES BEING A MORE IMPORTANT PART OF THE ALGORITHM NEXT YEAR AND WE FEEL GOOD THAT THE CALENDAR OF PROGRAMMING WE HAVE THE INNOVATION THE MEDIA IS REALLY GOING TO HELP TO DRIVE SOME OF THAT GREAT GREAT THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM A LINE OF KEN GOLDMAN WITH D P MORGAN PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION HI THANK YOU ALONG THE SAME LINES OF TWENTY TW I can, michelle, you pulled back a little bit on advertising this quarter. it's been a little up and down this year for for understandable reasons. i'm just curious what your thoughts are in general on what the company's plan is for advertising, marketing, in general as you get into what hopefully will be a more normal year in twenty twenty one. sure. so we definitely believe in investing in our brands. that is a critical piece of our growth. MODEL OF ON THE BUSINESS. SO CLEARLY AS WE MENTIONED TO YOU, WE HAD PULLED BACK ON SOME SPEND IN AREAS WHERE WE JUST THOUGHT GIVEN THE PANDEMIC IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN REFRESHMENTS WHERE WE KNEW CONSUMER USAGE WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. BUT AS WE LOOKED AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND AS WE'VE STARTED TO YOU KNOW THE MOMENTUM THAT WE'RE SEEING AND SOME OF THE RECOVERIES YOU WE DEFINITELY PLAN ON TAKING OUR INVE With where they have been historically so you'll see us really leaning in to to drive the consumer and to leverage some of the behaviors that we're seeing thank you and then for a follow up you didn't do any share repurchases this quarter i think that's the first time in two years and that was the last time was right before you bought pirate's booty i want to ask if the lack of repo is an indication of a pending deal of course but i am curious how you would describe the current environment FOR POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS I GUESS PARTICULARLY OUR TARGETS MAY BE MORE WILLING TO SELL BECAUSE THEY CAN DO SO OFF A HIGHER SALES NUMBER THAN USUAL OR ARE THEY MORE HESITANT BECAUSE THEY I GUESS KIND OF WANT TO RIDE THIS DEMAND WAVE AS LONG AS THEY CAN DAVE DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT ONE YEAH BE HAPPY TO SO FIRST JUST ON THE SHEER PURCHASE PRICE I WILL JUST ECHO WHAT YOU SAID DON'T READ ANYTHING INTO IT I WOULD SAY FOR THIS YEAR W Um, phase just taking a little bit more cautious approach we will be revisiting that as we look at next year and i would say in general our capital allocation priorities haven't changed with respect to emn specifically it's probably more in the latter i think people are still the ones that are the most interesting are riding a wave and they still have valuation expectations that look like they did pre-covid, if not higher but i would say we're continuing to have an active funnel, continue to look at a number of opportunities and Will continue to update the market as appropriate. great, thank you both. thank you. our next question comes from a line of robert moscow with courted sweets. please proceed with your question. hi, thank you. i think the um the recovery expected in twenty twenty one in international and and other is you know you have a two percent headwind this year Twenty twenty but can you give us a little bit of color as to the condition of your business in mexico and india and china um is it easy to assume that things can go back to normal or has the pandemic impaired your commercial capabilities at all or the retailers desire to merchandise confectionary products in those markets yeah so first of all I would say, certainly, there's a lot of uncertainty and volatility with the pandemic. we all know that we're seeing the ups and downs of, you know, occasional increases in spikes in markets around the globe. that said, i would say that we were pleasantly surprised by our performance in international. our team did a great job executing in this very challenging environment and i think that, you know, we've seen while each market is a little different and the use of the category is a little bit different. Different consumers are really looking during this time for brands they trust and we've done a great job over the past couple of years building the the hersey equity so we were pleased with the rebound that we saw in many of our markets i think i mentioned in india our business was now up six percent versus it had been down we gained market share across almost every market on our core chocolate category so i wouldn't say that we believe our ability to drive the chocolate category. BUSINESS HAS BEEN IMPAIRED IN ANY MARKET ON A PERMANENT BASIS YOU KNOW JUST AS WE ARE PIVOTING IN THE U S I THINK WE'VE PIVOTED TO WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE IN INTERNATIONAL AND WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE RECOVERY AND YOU KNOW PLAN TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER AGAINST THAT THANK YOU CAN I DIVE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO MEXICO UM ARE THERE ANY PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS MAKING ON NUTRITIONAL VALUES OR ANY CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT THE CATEGORY HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT THE CATEGORY YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO THE GOVERNMENT DID PUT IN PLACE FRONT OF PACK LABELLING CHANGES IN MEXICO AND THAT NEW PACKAGING IS NOW IN THE MARKET AND WE ARE BEGINNING TO MONITOR THE TRENDS WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS KNOW OUR CATEGORIES A TREAT THEY KNOW IT HAS SUGAR AND SO WE EXPECT THAT WE'LL SEE LESS IMPACT From that than perhaps other categories will but we will of course keep a close eye on that and i would say mexico has been one of the harder hit developing markets relative to covid so we feel good about the progress we're seeing but it's a little slower than some of the other markets very good thank you our next question comes from line of david pollard with evercore isi please proceed with your question thanks thanks our next question comes from line of david pollard with evercore isi please proceed with your question A question on your share gains in the u s and particularly in chocolate you you really and in your prepared remarks you touched on this how adaptive you were by market by channel by need state and in terms of smores some that's related or might be related to supply chain could you talk about that part of it and and i think the reason i'm asking is because if there is a supply chain breakdown or lack of Adaptability by a competitor maybe that will represent share gains that they can reverse somewhat in twenty one and i have a follow-up yes absolutely so i would say i believe our share gains are a testament to both our strong brands our consumer understanding our programming as well as to the supply chain execution and execution at retail both of which tend to be you know core advantages for us AS A COMPANY SO I THINK WE'RE SEEING OUR CATEGORIES AND OUR BRANDS ARE DEFINITELY RESONATING WITH CONSUMERS AND AS YOU MENTIONED WE REALLY PIVOTED WITH THE CONSUMERS SO VERY EARLY ON WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WAS CHANGING AND WE'VE TALKED TO ALL OF YOU BEFORE ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR CATEGORIES SPLIT THIRD THIRD THIRD THIRD TAKE HOME INSTANT CONSUMABLE AND SEASONAL AND AS WE SAW CONSUMERS SHIFT TO MORE AT HOME BE In our portfolio to really dial up some more's twizzlers for movie nights our baking product activities and then within the seasons even with halloween we made that decision to lean in and drive and build a halloween season versus back away from it and and everything related to that relative to let's set the season early so we can get consumers in in pre-trick-or-treat you know let's make sure we are smart about the portfolio that's out there and not back away from it and and everything related to that relative to let's set the season early so we can get consumers in in pre-trick-or-treat you know let's make sure we are smart about the portfolio that's out there and not back away from it and and everything related to that relative to let's set the season early We haven't overly indexed to seasonal skews, et cetera, and then we worked really hard on messaging to message consumers safe ways to celebrate the holiday. We dialed up e-commerce as consumers shifted to e-commerce, and because we had invested in capabilities in that, we were able to do that. And then I think a lot of the strong investments we've made in other capabilities over the years helped us during this time to execute well. And some of those go beyond supply. So, you know, we've made investments in better understanding consumer trends. We've made investments in our ability to forecast at a much more granular level. We've made media investments to target better. And certainly, we've invested in our plants all along the way, which really enabled us to pivot quickly to safety protocols and really be able to continue to execute. And then we made the decision to keep our retail sales teams at retail. So as i think about You know, think about that share gain. I would say clearly, we would expect to continue to see share gains clearly through the spring of twenty one. we would expect that they would moderate after that, though we're certainly expecting to to hold on to share and we will continue to drive our outstanding programming and and also continue to execute our supply chain with excellence. that's helpful. thank you. and then just on any sort of one times from this year, that we should be thinking about from a model perspective. i'm thinking about covid-related friction costs this year, but also you might add back some sgna in parts and in other so any one-time type comparisons that we should think about, thanks yeah, i think we talked about in the repaired, repaired remarks on the top line, we had about a two point impact, so you can right away say there's a drop through that two point into profitability but then if you take a look at the net of costs for covid, so protective equipment, and parts and other, so any one-time type comparisons that we should think about, thanks yeah, i think we talked about in the repaired, repaired remarks on the top line, we had about a two point impact, so you can right away say there's a AND EMPLOYEE INCENTIVES THAT WE HAD EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND YOU NET THEM AGAINST THE D E M O P T I M I Z A T I O N B I T I O N I Z A T I O N THAT WE DID AS WELL AS THE T I N S E A V I N G Z I T WAS A N E T S L AY T P O Z I T IH0 V AA1 N DH OW1 Z T UW1 P IY1 S IH0 Z sil AE1 N D S OW1 DH AE1 T W IY1 W UH1 D IH0 K S P EH1 K T T AH0 sil M OW1 S L IY0 G OW1 Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes in line of chris growey with steph. Please proceed with your question. Hi, good morning. Good morning. Hi, i had a question for you. If i look back at halloween, i'm clear, curious if you split the season apart and you had given some information around this last quarter, sort of the early season part and that trick or treat part. How each piece perform, if you can give it a little color around that. We have some information from ira. I'm curious if you have better information than we have and then i'm also curious as i think about that early part if that's more indicative of what you expect for the holiday season as we move into christmas and that kind of time where you don't have a trigger treat event can that early season if you start that that season early in particular in stores be more like what we saw on the early part of halloween if that makes sense yeah so clearly we saw that within the season the early part of the season performed more strongly And the later part that's more trick or treat focused performed a little bit softer now we had anticipated that so overall the season performed exactly in line with our expectations as we look at the total season we were quite pleased that our sales were actually up versus year ago as was our selldroid up versus year ago so during a time of the global pandemic i think it speaks to the resilience of the category and the consumer's desire to REALLY HOLD ON TO AND CONTINUE TO CELEBRATE THE TRADITIONS AND FUN OCCASIONS LIKE THIS IN THEIR FAMILY LIVES AS WE LOOK AT HOLIDAY HOLIDAY IS HAS SOME DIFFERENT CONSUMER DYNAMICS THAN HALLOWEEN AND SO WE BELIEVE IT WILL BEHAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME OF THE PRESSURE THAT WE ANTICIPATED WE'D HAVE COMING INTO HALLOWEEN THE CATEGORY SHOULD BE QUITE STRONG CONSUMERS USE THE PRODUCT IN YOU K family occasions, we aren't as big in gifting some of the areas of the category that might be a little bit more hard hit. so we expect solid results given that skew to at-home consumption. okay, thank you. and then just a follow-up to that, are you shipping in, shipping in holiday product early? and would that have been an incremental benefit? did we see some of that in the third quarter more than we would have seen historically? yeah, we did. just like we did with halloween. yeah, we did. just like we did with halloween. yeah, we did. just like we did with halloween. yeah, we did. just like we did with halloween. yeah, we did. just like we did with halloween. yeah, we did. just like we did with halloween started shipping in holiday a bit early. so you do get some pickup in the third quarter for that. that'll take away a little bit from the fourth quarter. you know, maybe on the order you have fifty basis points. and we also drew that to drive the consumer behavior early as well. just as we did with halloween. you know, as halloween was still on the floor. holiday was also out there so that consumers could also gravitate to the holiday pretty quickly. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. a strong holiday season. YEAH, STRONG HALLOWEEN SELL THROUGH REALLY HELPS US BECAUSE IT HELPS US GET THAT FAST START TO HALLOWEEN BECAUSE IT CLEARS THE SPACE TO BE ABLE TO PUT HALLOWEEN ON THE FLOOR. OK, THANKS MUCH FOR THE COLOR THERE. ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES IN LINE OF JASON ENGLISH WITH GOLDMAN SACHS. PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION And and tease out try to tease out a little bit more of the outlook on holidays going forward the the halloween early part selling was phenomenal much more than i think anyone's expected i think a big part of that's due to the merchandising programs that retailers had it seems like they started bigger and earlier than they usually do has has that you think influenced how they're going to approach other seasons going forward or said said more directly you expect retailers to provide more more merchandise import behind the category into halloween HOLIDAY INTO EASTER THAN THE OTHERWISE WOULD COMING OUT OF THE SUCCESS THEY SAW IN HALLOWEEN SO WE'VE ALWAYS HAD PRETTY STRONG MERCHANDISING SUPPORT AT EVERY SEASON AND ONE THING WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WITH SEASONS IS WHEN WE GET IT ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT CONSUMERS WILL BUY THAT HOLIDAY OR SEASONAL PRODUCT WHETHER IT'S EASTER OR WHEREVER EARLY FOR IN HOME CONSUMPTION IF YOU GET IT OUT THERE IT KINDS OF SPARKS The trigger of you know fun moments earlier so i don't know that i could say specifically that we can anticipate that retailers are going to merchandise it even more than they ever have um i do think that they will be focused on making sure that they definitely get it out early to capture the early part of the season since that is the piece that you know is a bit more stable there were a few retailers you know as you can imagine with the uncertainty of HALLOWEEN AND THE FACT THAT ALL THESE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH HALLOWEEN REALLY HAD TO BE MADE IN EARLY MAY WHEN THINGS WERE QUITE UNCERTAIN AND SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED AND BARS AND RESTAURANTS AND ALL OF THAT SO THERE ARE A FEW RETAILERS WHO HAVE PULLED BACK ON HALLOWEEN AND BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE SEASON THIS YEAR THEY WILL LIKELY HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE GOING FORWARD WHICH SHOULD HELP TO MAKE IT FOR AN EVEN STRONGER HALLOWEEN NEXT Like easter? that makes a lot of sense. and then one more question on the i'm sticking with follow ons to chris's questions, which i thought was solid. the the earlier part of the season versus the later part of the season the earlier part of the season was exceptionally robust and you said late part was a bit softer but in somewhere in your remarks i think you said all in total holiday so both the early part and late part finished down on single digit digits for coca cola I think mathematically to get the category down to single digits we're going to have to see some pretty sharp declines coming through the retail sales data in the next couple of weeks as we as we capture that late part of the season am i thinking about it right am i interpreting your comments correctly yes yes you are interpreting them correctly so category was down mid single digits overall as much as our business was actually up and we will see some of those declines Thank you very much one other thing just to keep in mind there is a little bit of a timing impact from the nilson and i r i data given that the season was on a saturday versus a thursday and based on retail reporting days so you will probably even see it's down even more and you'll have to wait till kind of mid november till you see some of the those last couple of days being reported so some of it when you see will be just the timing shift as the day of the week and some of it will certainly be the declines and in trick or treat at the end understood thank you Thank you. our next question comes from line of david driskell with d d research. please proceed with your question. great thank you. good morning and congratulations on a great execution in the quarter. thanks david i had a so two questions the first one just a two relatively small ones on the other expense commentary i think through the through the date period other expense is only a small number but your full year projection is A hundred to one hundred and ten million dollars on that means it's a fairly massive number in the fourth quarter. am i doing the math right? is that, is that correct on how the the pattern lays out for other expenses? and then related just another follow up on your volumes expected in the fourth quarter. i think in your prepared comments you said north american organic growth similar to third quarter but pricing only like a half point. so that would mean volume is something like five percent points positive in the fourth quarter. DOING THOSE TWO PIECES RIGHT, ANY COLOR YOU CAN GIVE ON THOSE TWO COMMENTS? YEAH, I'D BE HAPPY TO. SO ON THE TAX SIDE AND OTHER EXPENSES, YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. WE WILL HAVE A LARGE OTHER EXPENSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING, EVEN IN THE EARLIER GUIDANCE, EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND THEN ALONG WITH THAT, A LOWER TAX RATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. TO DO THE MATH ON THE TAX RATE, Y PENITENTIARY REPUNISHMENT THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WE SAW THAT IN THE THIRD WE'LL SEE SOME MORE OF THAT OR THAT CONTINUED INTO THE FOURTH WE'RE ALSO LAPPING SOME ELASTICITY AFTER THE PRICE INCREASE LAST YEAR AND THEN THIS CONTINUED STRONG SHARE GAINS THOSE THREE THINGS ARE PART OF DRIVING THAT FOURTH QUARTER VOLUME MICHELLE A BIGGER PICTURE QUESTION HERSHEY TOOK PRICES IN MOST OF THE PORTFOLIO OUTSIDE OF SEASONAL HALLOWEEN FOR THE ENTIRE CATEGORY WOULD YOU AGREE THAT NOW IS PROBABLY NOT THE TIME FOR SEASONAL PRICE INCREASE ACTIONS MAYBE THIS GETS DELAYED TO TWENTY TWO TWO OR SOMETIME LATER UNTIL WE GET A NORMAL CONSUMER ENVIRONMENT ESSENTIALLY I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO ASSESS YOUR YOUR ABILITY TO PASS THROUGH FOSTER INCREASES THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS IT'S A WEIRD ENVIRONMENT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S ALTERED THAT CALCULUS THAN Specifics about our specific any upcoming specific pricing actions what i can say is you know there's been no change to our pricing strategy of smaller more frequent increases and that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to have the same amount of pricing every year or that we would always announce pricing at the same time we did for example actually have a small price increase this past year on our food service business in the third quarter so if we look over time Time, we have been able to price at various times at various economic conditions so what's important to us is we do think pricing is an important part of our algorithm but as we've talked about before, we really want to grow through balanced growth across leverages distribution velocity innovation price et cetera so you know that that is certainly the one piece of the portfolio that we We have not yet priced and i think it's fair to say that given that we haven't announced a price increase at this moment in time the magnitude of pricing in twenty one would be less than we've seen in prior years at least at this point. We've been pleased that we've seen conversion be pretty good this year even in a very difficult economic environment and i think that continues to demonstrate what we've seen over the years which is the category is very resilient. Our brands are strong. We continue to invest into our brands and that does allow us for an even greater amount of pricing power. Really helpful. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. AS YOU WORK THROUGH YOUR PLANNING PROCESS IT CLEARLY THERE ARE PARTS OF YOUR BUSINESS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER A PRESSURE THIS YEAR INTERNATIONAL MOVIE THEATRES VENDING SPECIALTY ETC AND HOPEFULLY ALL THOSE SET UP FOR AT LEAST DISTRICT RECOVERY IN THE YEAR AHEAD BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'VE BEEN GAINING A LOT OF SHARE YOU'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN AT HOME CATEGORIES LIKE BAKING AND WITH INITIATIVES LIKE SMORES ALL OF WHICH IS FANTASTIC MOMENTUM BUT Y Is there a way to frame your thinking at a summary level to what degree those various plits and takes sort of just met each other out in your mind or are you approaching twenty one planning thinking we've got you know either a net easier or a net harder set up versus what you know one might consider typical thanks yeah so we're pleased with the momentum that we are seeing and i would say you know your call outs in what you shared about some of the ups and downs on the business i think are very ACCURATE. WE BELIEVE WE'RE SEEING THAT OUR CATEGORY AND OUR BRANDS REALLY RESONATE WITH CONSUMERS AND ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOME OF THOSE MOMENTS OF GOODNESS, MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS. WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PIVOT WITH THE CONSUMER AND ALSO PIVOT WITH OUR CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE WITHIN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT MOMENTUM AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE PIVOTING THIS YEAR OBVIOUSLY IT WAS CONSUMER SHIFTED TO TAKE HOME AND SO WE DIALED UP SMORES AND WE DIALED UP TWIZLERS AND WE DIALED UP BAKING AND WE YOU KNOW LEANED IN TO CREATE THE SEASON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD CAPTURE THAT OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW GIVING CONSUMERS NEW WAYS TO PARTICIPATE IN HALLOWEEN THAT FRANKLY WE BELIEVE THOSE THINGS LIKE CANDY SLIDES AND CANDY GRAVEYARDS AND ALL THE CREATIVE THINGS PEOPLE DID WILL PROBABLY BECO AND I THINK AS WE LOOK TO NEXT YEAR WE ARE PREPARED IF THE CONSUMER PIVOTS YET AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO PIVOT WITH THEM I THINK WE'VE BUILT AND WE'VE DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE WELL DURING THIS ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO TO PIVOT FROM AN EXECUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE WHETHER IT'S AT RETAIL OR IN OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES SO WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE CAPTURED AS WELL SOME CULTURAL UM UP POSITIVE EFFECTS I OPERATING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS ALLOWS US TO MAKE DECISIONS MORE QUICKLY AND YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT IS AN ENABLER FOR US GOING FORWARD SO SO WE FEEL WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE THANKS FOR THAT MICHELLE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ONE OR STEVE BUT I JUST AS A FOLLOW UP SORT OF UNRELATED JUST ANY COMMENTS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON JUST CURRENT LEVELS OF PROMOTION THE PROMOT Thanks. Yeah, we don't see any significant change relative to promotional activity. We didn't really see it this year. We didn't execute anything significantly differently and nor do we expect to see anything in the future. Okay, perfect. Appreciate it. Um, Michele, I was hoping you could provide some context on the partnership with Google that you used during the hallowing period. And, you know, do you believe this capability can be leveraged for this holiday season, but also kind of in your everyday business as you kind of look forward. You know, we are continuing to to leverage different types of data and analytic and insights more and more across the business. And, you know, we continue to do so. Really try and stay on top of tracking consumer sentiment and leveraging data and analytics to tailor copy, to tailor messaging, to tailor media. So more and more, we are operating at a more sophisticated level relative to using multiple data sources and also using that to reach consumers at the right places with the right message at the right time. And i guess what i'm trying to get at is, you know, is this kind of new way of, of kind of targeting consumers, like the return that you see from what you do? DONE LIKE CAN YOU GIVE US ANY KIND OF UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE ONE THING I'M NOTICING ACROSS THE ENTIRE SEO LANDSCAPE IS COMPANIES ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY BUT THEY'RE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON THE SAME MESSAGE AND IN FACT YOU KNOW NEW CONSUMERS ARE BEING RECRUITED YOU KNOW USAGE CASES ARE CHANGING AND SO IT REALLY REQUIRES A CHANGE IN HOW YOU TALK TO THOSE CONSUMERS AND SO I FIND THIS GOOGLE PARTNERSHIP YOU KNOW INCREDIBLY COMPELLING FOR YOU GUYS You can provide any context on that. So we have a continuous focus on optimizing media and the returns on our media. We always have. We've had strong media ROI's forever and our challenges are how do we keep making them better and then we continually optimize based on that. So right now, you know, it's it's a big spend area for us. So it's an area we're very focused on elevating and it is about you know making sure right now i would say it's a big spend area for us. So it's an area we're very focused on elevating and it is about you know making sure right now i would say it's a big spend area for us. So it's an area we're very focused on elevating and it is about you know making sure right now i would say it' Some of the biggest opportunity is that opportunity of even more precise targeting and then once you have that target, the ability to alter the message. So and then we alter our media mix accordingly and i would say we we see you know significant movement in that mix on a year to year basis as we get better at that. I think we've raised you know some of the opportunities of how we've gone just very deep relative to specific seasons whether it's sameday or buy code or whether it's WHERE IT'S SPECIFIC YOU KNOW HOLIDAYS AND LOOKING AT SELL THROUGH AT A STORE LEVEL BASIS TO BE ABLE TO DIAL UP MEDIA ON A ZIP CODE LEVEL BASIS SO YOU'LL YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SEE MORE OF THAT FRANKLY THAT'S JUST BECOMING A WAY OF HOW WE OPERATE NOW GREAT AND LAST QUESTION JUST FROM AN INNOVATION STANDPOINT CAN YOU JUST PROVIDE ANY CONTEXT ON KINDA WHAT'S REMAINING IN TERMS OF THE INNOVATION THIS YEAR AND HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO W Timing yes so we feel very good about our innovation some of the innovations that we are excited about that are new to the market include the reese's pretzel product a reese's cup with pretzels in it we've had a range of kit kat flavors we know on a global basis a big part of the kit kat portfolio are flavors they tend to do quite well WELL WE ARE ON A VERY SMALL LEVEL LAUNCHING SNACK CAKES UNDER OUR REESE'S TRADEMARK WHICH YOU KNOW DELIVERS THAT REESE'S EXPERIENCE IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TYPE OF PRODUCT FORM AND WE FEEL GOOD ON THAT VERSUS BASES SOME OF THE EARLY TEST RESULTS AND WE WILL HAVE MORE COMING SOME ITEMS ON OUR TAKE HOME SIDE OF OUR BUSINESS THAT WON'T GET ANNOUNCED TILL LATE NEXT YEAR WHICH IS TYPICALLY THE TIME WE ANNO Those things just given reset windows. No major change in our innovation strategy. We think it's working very well for us. We think it's right-sized and we think it's delivering much more sustainable results. Great. I'll pass it on. Thank you. You've talked about the increase in e-commerce sales, even if it might have decelerated a little bit, but it's up very strongly. You've said in the past that baskets and dollar ring are higher online. Is that still holding true with the growth that you're seeing now? And on the margin side, you've mentioned that there's a small gap, but that you were narrowing it and that scale would help that. Is that coming along the way that you would have expected? Yeah, i mean we've generally seen larger basket sizes in general across most channels this year as people are you know doing fewer trips and you know more quantity per trip. so i think that's been somewhat of an underlying dynamic given the the pandemic impact in the marketplace for us on our e commerce business we've seen very significant growth across the board but particularly in click and collect where people are actually acting as To go and and pick up their their groceries and also in the local delivery models as well versus kind of national deliver the margins that we have are similar to what we see in bricks and mortar stores ok great that's helpful in those two areas it excuse me and those two areas where we have you know similar products obviously that we sell in bricks and mortar steve anything you want to add yeah i would say is that you know we've said in the past that overall ecommerce margins are our A little bit dilutive and it's there, as michelle just said, in click and collect and local delivery, very similar, not much impact. And that's probably two thirds of our ecommerce business. The piece that is more dilutive is the ship to home and in particular, cold ship and that's an area where we continue to work with our customers and look at our overall investment with those customers and joint business planning to drive efficiencies over time, so that those margins align. Okay, thanks. And i just wanna follow up on smore's. i thought that That your data analysis and insight there to push that the way that you did was was interesting as you're seeing cases rise again now are you replicating that? are you seeing similar results? is there a smores surge we should expect and and would it be right to assume that those hersey's milk chocolate bars are probably some of the highest margin ones that you have? We've expanded s'mores from, at one point, it was a very focused time of year to really capturing s'mores as a year-round opportunity. especially if you think about how different weather is across the entire country there are lots of opportunities to continue to expand that. so we're very focused on that. you know, we're also very focused on the upcoming baking season, where we know that consumers will be spending time at home, it's already a natural baking season and so we'll be looking at that. To really optimize what we're able to drive, you know, leveraging insights around that season as well. okay, great, thank you. thank you. our next question comes from the line of brian spilane with bank of america. please go ahead with your question. hi, good morning, everyone. i think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks about, you know, just one, one question for me and i think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks about, you know, just one, one question for me and i think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks about, you know, just one, one question for me and i think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks about, you know, just one, one question for me and i think there was a little Some cocoa, you know, inflation and cost of goods sold. So maybe Steve, could you just give us a kind of a lay of the land right now in terms of what commodity costs and just cost of goods inflation looks like currently. Um, you know, in the context of seems like freight costs are going up. You've had some competitors talk about cocoa prices going up. So just trying to get a understanding of, you know, directionally where inflation is headed right now. Sure. Yeah, for us, inflation is going up. Yeah, for us, inflation is going up. So just trying to get a understanding of, you know, directionally where inflation is headed right now. Sure. Yeah, for us, inflation is going up. Yeah, for us, inflation is going up. So just trying to get I say overall it's been relatively stable. so on the commodity side relatively stable. you know you saw big movements in commodities across q two and q three. and of course we've talked in the past we mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program. and i would say today they're fairly stable. there are increases in freight costs. there too. our teams do a great job of a longer-term contracting which helps mitigate some of that increase. so that hasn't been a real material impact for us. we have seen some increased warehousing which helps mitigate some of that increase. so we have seen some increased warehousing which helps mitigate some of that increase. so that hasn't been a real material impact for us. we have seen some increased warehous Costs and that's volume and flow through along with the share gains and the volume increases that we've seen so we call that out in the prepared remarks but in total at least sitting at this point you would say overall cogs is fairly stable and we'll get more guidance on twenty twenty one when we get into the fourth quarter call but i guess we can infer from that at least from where we sit today that that's stable is is something that looks like it kind of carries into next year unless something changes I think that's fair. you know, next year as we get the, you're gonna have the twenty twenty and twenty twenty one cop crops of cocoa start to bear the lids, so you know, there's that to consider. and then there's other things, obviously, on the gross margin side, which as michelle said, you'll have a little bit more volume-driven than price-driven mix, driving gross margin next year. we'll have our continuing productivity goals. and again, a lot more on that to come when we talk on the fourth quarter call. all right. thanks, steve. that's that's very helpful. have a happy thanksgiving, everyone. thank you. thank you. our next question comes from line of john bomgardner with wells fargo. please proceed with your question. good morning. thank you for the question. good morning. good morning. michelle, i'd like to follow up on the risa snack cake. you mentioned that it's small right now, but you hersey went down this path about fifteen years ago and it didn't really translate into anything material. so i'm curious what the data tells you in terms of changes to the landscape now. does this mean a new phase of the snack cake? Section Evolution And I guess where do you think it slots in? I mean, does it compete against the twinkies, the cookies, just you know, where's the target market? You know, any any big picture of thoughts would be appreciated yeah, absolutely so, you know, i think we've approached this in a very thoughtful and measured way which was not a mass launch where we just threw it out there and tried to make it as big as we possibly could at one point in time but we did a very targeted in-market launch for EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT WE COULD REALLY LEARN ABOUT THE PROPOSITION WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING THE PRODUCT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY UNDERSTOOD SOME OF THE DRIVERS OF LIKING IN THIS SNACK CAKE AREA AND WE ALSO REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE WHERE AND HOW WE WANTED TO PLAY AND LAUNCH SO THIS FOR EXAMPLE IS VERY SEA STORE FOCUSED IT IS YOU KNOW A SINGLE GIRLS SERVE TYPE OF ITEMS. SO WE'RE KEEPING IT AS A AS A FOCUSED LAUNCH IT IS DEFINITELY BRINGING THE GREAT CHOCOLATE AND PEANUT BUTTER TASTE PROFILE THAT WE HAVE ON REESE'S TO THE SNAKE CAKE MARKET. SO YES IT IS YOU KNOW PLAYING IN THAT SNAKE SNAKE AREA VERSUS OTHER SNAKE CAKE BRANDS WE KNOW THAT WE HAD PARTICIPATED IN THIS CATEGORY FOR MANY YEARS THROUGH LICENSING AND WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THAT THAT OUR BRANDS CO AND EXTEND TO THE CATEGORY WE ALSO KNOW THAT MORNING SNACKING HAS BEEN A GROWING TREND AND OUR CONFECTION ITEMS SKEW MORE TO AFTERNOON AND EVENING SO THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF THAT GROWTH BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THESE SNACK CAKES GET UTILIZED SO AGAIN WE'RE GONNA HAVE A VERY FOCUSED ROLLOUT AND WE'LL PUT IT IN LOCATIONS WHERE WE THINK WE CAN GARNER INCREMENTAL SPACE AND WHERE WE THINK THERE'S A STRONG CONSUMER FIT AND STARTING AT SE And looking at other select areas and then if it continues to perform well, we will expand. But we will watch it closely and take a measured approach. Great. Thanks, Michelle. Sure. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Good morning, everyone. Hi, Alexia. Hi, Alexia. Hi, Alexia. Can I just talk about the C-store channel specifically? It's obviously been under pressure because of the pandemic but i imagine that there has been some sequential improvement in there. could you maybe just give us some numbers about how that channel is is recovering absolutely so as you said we've continued to see strength in food and mass and dollar as consumers eat more at home the sea store class did see a bit of recovery in the third quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw the business grow in the low quarter so we saw Low single digits in the third quarter which is definitely an improvement versus those early pandemic trends it did then slow a little bit as summer ended and those summer road trips decreased with kids going back to school our business has pretty much in line with the channel and significantly ahead of the category so we have share gains of about a hundred and twenty basis points in q three in that channel so Seeing some, some rebounds and some recovery versus where it was in the past, as people are out about a little bit more than they were. Great. And then there's a follow-up, follow-up actually on brian's behalf, question about freight costs. I remember back in twenty eighteen, as freight costs spiked back then, that was quite a bit of a headwind for you. It seems as though it's not so much of a problem this time around. Are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of cogs freight actually represents? Events and how much of that has already been contracted out and what you've learned since twenty eighteen to make the situation this time around a bit more manageable. thank you sure so yeah fracking right now we don't see as a a material impact if it continues to rise it'll have a bigger bigger impact right now again because we're contracted and our teams do a great job of managing those contracts it's not having as much of an impact. It's roughly ten percent of of cogs overall and so it's not immaterial but right now not seeing enough movement there given the contracting to really drive a material impact on overall cogs great thank you very much i'll pass it on thank you our next question comes from line of jonathan finney with consumer edge please proceed with your question good morning thanks very much and thanks for a great halloween Um, personally, personally and professionally, the venom of my financial ambitions has been to give out full size candy bars, which i was again able to execute. so, thank you. up, two quick ones. i noticed in the data you're pricing in north america is plus one ninth on the takeaway. plus three is what you reported. is that just the math or is there some shrinking or different mix within retail margins there? my first question. and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and secondly, and second Historically, when you look at today's velocity, it's generally tomorrow's distribution. And your velocity's been fantastic. This is a weird year. A lot of people's velocity is fantastic. But do you anticipate gaining shelf space in that everyday place? You know, you look at these baking items, you look at these take-home items. Like, this is phenomenally better velocity. Forget about just the total sales that you're seeing there. You anticipate significant share gains. Perhaps structural ones. I'm talking share of shelf here as retailers do resets for holiday and for going forward. thank you sure so two parts to your question the first was around price and some of the discrepancy and yes there is a mix impact honestly it might be best if melissa goes and takes you through a deep dive on that because there's some complexity associated with it but but The P N L is is definitely accurate as it relates to velocity yeah good velocity i like your phrase today's velocity is tomorrow's distribution i do think that's very accurate as we look at the seasons you asked about holiday you know we certainly have been able to garner incremental distribution incremental s k u's throughout the year both in terms of every day and seasons because WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER AND THE ITEMS THAT WE THEN PUT ON SHELVES NOT ONLY COULD WE SUPPLY THEM BUT THEN THEY MOVED SO WE DO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE A VERY DISCIPLINED APPROACH AND BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T OVER SKU SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF EVERY SKU AND AS LONG AS IT'S GOOD WE WILL BE THERE BUT YES WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GAIN SOME DISTRIBUTION AND GOING FOR Continue to be able to perhaps even through the the first part of next year. Thanks very much and I'll follow up with melissa. Very good. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of ken zaslo with bmo. Please proceed with your question. Good morning everyone. Good morning, ken. I just have one quick question. Everything's been asked and answered. You make a reference in the prepared remarks about pirate's booty and tracking ahead of your strategic plans.

SO I GO BACK TO THE SCALE, THE BRANDED NATURE, THE HIGH MARGIN ARE PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ONES AND THEN PICKING THE RIGHT UNDERLYING KPIs THAT SAY IT'S A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS. BECAUSE IF WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE VALUE THE IMPORTANT ROLE WE PLAY IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE OUR TEAM MEMBERS LIVE AND WORK WE UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT COMES WITH BEING A MAJOR EMPLOYER IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND WE WORK HARD TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELL BEING OF THOSE COMMUNITIES BY NOT ONLY PROVIDING GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO PARTICIPATE IN IN VOLUNTARIES DONATION AND SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THIS QUARTER WE ACCRUED $50 MILLION IN SG&A FOR THIS INITIATIVE TURNING TO THE SPECIFICS OF OUR BUSINESS DESPITE CONTINUING VOLATILITY IN CHALLENGING MARKET ENVIRONMENTS IN Q3 AND ADDED OPERATING COSTS WE HAVE CONTINUED TO GENERATE A SUPERIOR RELATIVE PERFORMANCE TO THE COMPETITION AND HAS REMAINED RESILIENT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS THIS IS A REFLECTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO APPROACH INCLUDING THE STRATEGY ON WELL DIVERSIFIED PRODUCTS BROAD GEOGRAPHICAL FOOTPRINTS AND THE RELENTLESS FOCUS ON KEY CUSTOMERS FOR THE FULL QUARTER OPERATING PERFORMANCE BOTH IN THE US AND MEXICO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SEQUENTIALLY AND EUROPE ALSO CONTINUE TO INCREASE DESPITE THE CHALLENGES DUE TO COVID-19 IN Q3 WE SAW MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO RECOVER ACROSS ALL OF OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS WITH THE US AND PARTICULARLY MEXICO EXPERIENCING THE STRONG REBOUND IN PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO WEAK CONDITIONS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS ESPECIALLY WHEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE DISRUPTIONS LESS THAN OPTIMAL PRODUCT MIX AND ADDED OPERATING COSTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN 201 DESPITE CONTINUED CHALLENGE IN GLOBAL MARKET CONDITIONS DUE TO COVID-19 OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS HAVE ALSO REMAINED WELL BALANCED AND THE RESULTS OF OUR REVISION TO BECOME THE BEST AND MOST RESPECTED COMPANY CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR TEAM MEMBERS TO SUPPORT OUR VISION WE ARE CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGY OF DEVELOPING A UNIQUE PORTFOLIO DIVERSE COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESS MODELS CONTINUE TO RELENTLESSLY PURSUE OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE BECOMING A MORE VALUED PARTNER WITH KEY CUSTOMERS AND CREATING AN ENVI- ENVIRONMENT FOR SAFE PEOPLE SAFE PRODUCTS AND HEALTHY ADDITIVES WHILE MARKET CONDITIONS IN ALL OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS ARE CONTINUING TO IMPROVE DURING THE QUARTER FOOD SERVICE DEMAND GLOBALLY STILL HAS NOT REACHED PRIOR LEVELS AND THE ENVIRONMENTS ARE STILL QUITE CHALLENGING SOME SECTORS WHERE WE OPERATE DISRUPTIONS FROM COVID-19 HAVE CONTINUED TO PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE ON EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY'S DEMAND FOR PROTEIN CONSUMPTION AS WELL AS FOR THE FLOW OF GLOBAL TRADES AND GENERATES VOLATILITY FAR BEYOND NORMAL SEASONAL FACTORS WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR STRATEGY WHILE CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THE PORTFOLIO TO BETTER RESPOND TO INDIVIDUAL MARKET DYNAMICS AND GENERATE A RELATIVE INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE OVER OUR PEERS WE BELIEVE THIS APPROACH WILL GIVE US HIGHER AND MORE CONSISTENT RESULTS FOR THE MID TO LONG RUN AND THEN MINIMIZE THE FULL PEAKS AND TROUGHS OF THE COMMODITY SECTORS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER IN THE US WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SEE DEMAND RECOVERING AT OUR FRESH OPERATIONS INCLUDING FROM SOME SECTORS WITHIN FOOD FOOD SERVICE WITH MORE STATES GRADUALLY LOSING TRAVEL AND MOVEMENT RESTRICTIONS QSR VOLUME HAS BEEN SPECIALLY STRONG AND DEMAND FROM OUR CUSTOMERS HAS BEEN OUTPERFORMING THE INDUSTRY SIMILAR TO LAST QUARTER COMMODITY LARGE BIRD DEBONING WAS ALSO AGAIN THE MOST CHALLENGED DURING Q3 OPERATIONALLY HOWEVER WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR RE- RELATIVE PERFORMANCE VERSUS THE INDUSTRY ACROSS ALL BUSINESS UNITS WE'RE CONTINUING TO ADAPT TO THE SHIPPING CHANNEL DEMAND BY INCREASING OUR VOLUME MIX TO KEY CUSTOMER RETAILERS IN ADDITION A LARGE PORTION OF OUR FOOD SERVICE CUSTOMERS ARE ALSO WITHIN THE QSR SEGMENTS WHICH HAS FURTHER DAMPENED THE IMPACT ACROSS OUR FRESH BUSINESS UNIT MODELS OUR PORTFOLIO OF DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ALONG WITH OUR KEY CUSTOMER MODEL ARE GIVING US BETTER INSULATION AGAINST THE VOLATILITY WE'RE ALSO MUCH BETTER POSITIONED TO ADJUST PRODUCTS AND CHANNEL MIX GIVEN OUR PRESENCE ACROSS ALL BIRDS SIZES FROM SMALL TO LARGE WITHIN THE SMALL BIRD AND CASE-READY SEGMENTS MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND WAS AGAIN VERY WELL BALANCED DURING Q3 DEMAND FROM RETAILERS ESPECIALLY FROM OUR KEY CUSTOMERS ARE STRONG SUPPORT IN IMPROVING PERFORMANCE OF OUR CASE-READY BUSINESS OUR MARKET LEADERSHIP IN THIS CATEGORY AND MORE DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCT PORTFOLIO HAVE CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN THE GROWTH OF OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE VERSUS THE INDUSTRY WHILE WE'RE COMMITTED TO OUR KEY CUSTOMER STRATEGY HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE CONSISTENCY FOR OUR PAST RESULTS THE VALUE OF THIS APPROACH HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE RELEVANT TO OUR GROWTH THAN DURING THE CURRENT TIMES OF GREAT UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF KEY CUSTOMERS WE ARE DOUBLING OUR CASE-READY CAPACITY AT OUR PLANT IN MINNESOTA BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HEADS PROCESS AT THE PLANT WHILE ALSO RAISING THE MIX OF MORE STABLE MARGIN CASE-READY PRODUCTS WITH THIS ADDITION WE ALSO EXPECT TO INCREASE BY 20% OF PRODUCTION OF OUR DIFFERENTIATED HIGHER ATTRIBUTES JUST BARE BRAND PRODUCTS IT IS ALSO SUPPORTED OUR CONVERSION OF ONE PLANT FROM THE COMMODITIZED LARGE BIRD DEBONING TO A KEY CUSTOMER QSR IN THE SMALL BIRD SEGMENT THE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE TO KEY CUSTOMERS ARE GIVING US MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO SUSTAIN OUR VOLUME INCREASE SINCE THIS CUSTOMER RELY ON US TO SATISFY THEIR NEED FOR GROWTH IN ADDITION MANY OF OUR KEY CUSTOMERS MAINTAIN A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CATEGORIES AS A RESULT WE ARE DIRECT BENEFICIARIES OF THEIR ABILITY TO OUTGROW THEIR COMPETITION BEYOND RISING PEER GROWTH OUR KEY CUSTOMER STRATEGY ALSO PROMOTES TRUST ENHANCES LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS AND STRENGTHEN OUR MARGIN STRUCTURE IN THE US PREPARED FOODS BUSINESS REVENUE DECLINED 23% ON 26% LESS VOLUME YEAR OVER YEAR A LARGE PART OF THIS DECREASE 70% OF THE VOLUME WAS DRIVEN BY SCHOOLS REMAINING CLOSE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRENGTHENING THE RETAIL DEMAND ON THE OTHER HAND OUR MARGIN FROM SALES HAS IMPROVED 29% DRIVEN BY MORE FAVORABLE PRICE AND MIX WE CONTINUE TO SIMPLIFY OUR PORTFOLIO TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES AND SHIFT RESOURCES TOWARDS BRANDED GROWTH IN THE RETAIL CHANNEL OUR PILGRIM'S BRAND SALES GREW 52% AND OUR JUST BARE BRAND GAINING NEW DISTRIBUTION RESULTING IN DOLLAR SHARE GROWTH IN THE RETAIL CHANNEL TURNING TO COLD STORAGE DATA AT THE END OF AUGUST BROILER INVENTORY WAS UP 2% FROM THE CLOSE OF Q2 BUT DOWN 1% FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR LAST QUARTER INVENTORIES WERE UP 10% COMPARED TO LAST YEAR THIS IS NOT SURPRISING CONSIDERING THE MIX SIMPLIFICATION DUE TO ONGOING LABOR CONSTRAINTS SEEN DURING Q3 AND OVERALL LACK OF WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 AND SO MARKETS REOPENED AND THE PIPELINES ARE EMPTY WE ARE SEEING SOME INCREASING LEG QUARTER SALES DURING OCTOBER AND A REDUCTION IN INVENTORIES AND UPWARD MOVEMENT IN PRICES US POULTRY EXPORTS INCLUDING PORK WERE UP 4.70% YEAR OVER YEAR THROUGHOUT AUGUST BROILER MEAT ALONE WAS UP 3% IN CONTRAST UH THROUGH Q3 OUR EXPORTS HAVE INCREASED BY 14% YEAR OVER YEAR OUTPACING THE MARKET CHINA CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DRIVER AND WE BELIEVE THE IMPACT OF ASF IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND NOW GERMANY CAN PROVIDE FURTHER SUPPORT TO EXPORT DEMAND AS WE APPROACH THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF CHINA REOPENING TO US POULTRY PRODUCERS ARE PRESENTED WITH A VASTLY DIFFERENT MARKET LANDSCAPE THAN A YEAR AGO CHINA HAS SOLIDIFIED ITSELF AS ONE OF THE LARGEST EXPORTER DESTINATIONS FOR POULTRY SECOND ONLY TO MEXICO CHINA'S PRESENCE AS A SIGNIFICANT BUYER KEEPS DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR EXPORT PORTFOLIO A HIGH PRIORITY WE HAVE ADDED 95 NEW DIRECT CLIENTS IN 2020 AND HAVE ALSO CONTINUED TO DIVERSIFY OUR PRODUCTS AND DESTINATION MIX THE USE OF NON-TRADITIONAL EXPORT ITEMS ARE UP 30% YEAR OVER YEAR WHICH STRENGTHENS THE CUT OUT MARGIN WE ENTER Q4 WITH OPTIMISM AS WE CONTINUE TO PLACE COMMODITY ITEMS EFFICIENTLY LEVERAGE BUSINESS OVERALL PORTFOLIO DIVERSITY AND PRIORITIZE EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR KEY CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AFTER A VERY CHALLENGING FIRST HALF IN 2020 OUR MEXICAN OPERATIONS DELIVER GREAT RESULTS IN Q3 AND WE RECORD IN ONE OF THE STRONGEST Q3 IN THE COMPANY'S HISTORY DESPITE THE UNFAVORABLE MIX IMPACTED AND ADDED OPERATION COSTS RE- RELATIVE TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR MORE NORMALIZED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVED SUPPLY DEMAND BALANCE IN THE MARKET ARE INCREASED SHARE OF NON-COMMODITY PRODUCTS AND OUR VERY GOOD OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE RESULTS ALTHOUGH OVERALL DEMAND IS IMPROVING WE REMAIN AGILE AND ARE CONTINUING TO ADAPT OUR FACILITIES BY SHIFTING PRODUCTION TO THOSE CHANNELS THAT ARE EXPERIENCED BETTER RELATIVE DEMAND PREPARED FOODS IN MEXICO EXPERIENCED SOME CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY IN THE VALUE CATEGORIES DUE TO LESS TRAFFIC ON RETAIL COMBINED WITH A CONTRACTION IN THE QSR VOLUME BUT WE BEGIN TO SEE SOME SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENTS TOWARDS THE END OF THE QUARTER AND WE BELIEVE THAT POSITIVE TRENDS CAN BE SUSTAINED INTO Q4 WE REMAIN COMMITTED IN LONG TERM GROWTH AND DEMAND PROSPECTS IN MEXICO WE HAVE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN OUR DEL DIA AND PREMIUM PILGRIM'S BRAND BOTH IN FRESH AND IN PREPARED AS WELL AS SEEING KEY MORE MARKET SHARE IN THE MODERN CHANNEL WHICH WILL BRING MORE STABLE MARGINS TO OUR OPERATIONS OUR EUROPEAN CHICKEN OPERATIONS DELIVERED AN EBIT IN Q3 THAT WAS 13% SEQUENTIALLY ABOVE Q2 WITH BOTH VOLUMES AND REVENUE 7% AND 18% HIGHER RESPECTIVELY SUPPORTED BY OUR EXPOSURE TO RETAIL AND THE CONTINUED RECOVERING FOOD SERVICE AND QSR DEMAND IN PARTICULAR RELATIVE TO Q3 OF 2019 EBIT WAS STILL HIGHER 2% DESPITE 8% LOWER VOLUME AND 5% LOWER REVENUE UM EASING OF UH COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS DUE TO REDUCTION OF UK GOVERNMENT INCENTIVE DIRECTS TOWARDS FOOD SERVICE AS WELL AS A CONSISTENT IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD SERVICE DEMAND WITHIN CONTINENTAL EUROPE HAVE ALL CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER SEQUENTIALLY IMPROVE PERFORMANCE VERSUS THE PRIOR QUARTER WE STILL HAVE NOT YET REACHED PRIOR LEVELS EVEN DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME WE CONTINUE TO BE RELENTLESS IN INVESTING IN INNOVATION WE'RE DELIVERING LABOR AND NEW IMPROVEMENTS DRIVING BETTER EFFICIENCIES MANAGING OUR COST BASE AND OFFSETTING COST INCREASES TO LEAN MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AROUND AUTOMATION AND PROCESS FLOW WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS WHICH REMAINS A PRIORITY WE ARE COMMITTED TO DELIVERING THE SAFEST WORK ENVIRONMENT POSSIBLE IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS WHILE ACHIEVING OUR SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA AND BIRD WELFARE TARGETS OUR RELATIVE PERFORMANCE TO THE INDUSTRY MEASURE AS THE RESULTS OF THE LAST 12 MONTHS CONTINUES TO SHOW US IMPROVING AND OUTPACING THE AVERAGE ON THE COMPETITION IN EUROPE FOR THE NEXT QUARTER WE EXPECT FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS COMING FROM THE FOOD SERVICE AND QSR SEGMENTS AS THE SEGMENTS ADAPT TO THE SITUATION IN EACH COUNTRY AND WE REMAIN VIGILANT AND PREPARED TO REACT AND ADAPT IN CASE MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR NEWLY ACQUIRED EUROPEAN PORK OPERATIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO IMPROVE WE DID THAT ON AN UPWARD MOMENTUM WE HAVE NOW BEEN PROFITABLE ON AN EBITDA BASIS FOR THE LAST SIX QUARTERS IN A ROW WITH MARGINS ALSO INCREASING ON A CONSISTENT BASIS THE IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE WAS DRIVEN BY ROBUST DEMAND AT RETAIL PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTION IN FOOD SERVICE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN PORK EXPORTS SPECIALLY TO CHINA AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AND CAPTURE OF SYNERGIES EXPORTS TO CHINA REMAIN STRONG AND WERE UP TO 100% IN Q3 ALSO EXPORTS TO CHINA HAVE DOUBLED AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL PORK SALES AND WE EXPECT DEMAND FROM CHINA TO CONTINUE DRIVING AND STRENGTHEN THE OVERALL OVERALL EXPORTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE ALL OF OUR E- EUROPEAN FRESH PORT FACILITIES ARE APPROVED TO EXPORT FROM CHINA SO WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO BENEFIT FROM THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE IN OUR STRATEGY AND IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR VOLUMES WITH A NEW KEY CUSTOMER IN THE NEXT QUARTERS INTEGRATION OF THE ASSETS IS ON TRACK TO EXPECTATIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE EXPECT TO GENERATE AN EBITDA IMPRO- IMPROVEMENTS TO ACHIEVE A LEVEL THAT IS COMPETITIVE WITH LEADING COMPANIES WITH SIMILAR PORTFOLIO WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY FOR THE NEWLY ACQUIRED EUROPEAN ASSETS THROUGH SOME RECENT WINS TO INCREASE OUR RETAIL EXPOSURE AND STRENGTHEN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH KEY CUSTOMERS WE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT BUILDING UPON OUR OPERATION IMPROVEMENTS BY CONTINUING TO OPTIMIZE OUR MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT EXTRACT BEST IN CLASS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE CAPITALIZE EXPORT OPPORT- OPPORTUNITIES OPTIMIZE THE PORTFOLIO CHANNELS SEGMENTS AND PRODUCTS AS WELL AS STRENGTHENING OUR GROWTH BUSINESS WITH KEY CUSTOMERS TO DRIVE INNOVATION IN VALUE ADDED IN HIGHER MARGIN AREAS WE HAVE A GREAT TEAM IN EUROPE DEDICATED TO GENERATING THE BEST POSSIBLE RELATIVE RESULTS BY FOCUSING ON FACTORS WITHIN OUR CONTROL WHILE ENSURING AND PROTECTING THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS OUR PRICES HAVE BEEN RISING SINCE AUGUST DRIVEN HIGHER BY A COMBINATION OF STRONGER THAN EXPECTED EXPORT DEMAND AND SMALLER THAN EXPECTED OLD CROP ENDING STOCKS IN THE US USDA IS PROJECTING NEW CROP ENDING STOCKS AT 2.17 BILLION BUSHELS VERSUS 1.99 BILLION LAST YEAR WHICH INCLUDES A 550 MILLION BUSHELS INCREASE IN EXPORT DEMAND THE CURRENT CORN CROP IS PROJECTED AT 14.7 BILLION BUSHELS THE HIGHEST IN FOUR YEARS AND OVER ONE BILLION BUSHELS LARGER THAN LAST YEAR ALTHOUGH CORN PRICES HAVE RISEN FROM THE LOWS WE SAW IN AUGUST PRICES ARE VERY SIMILAR TO WHERE THEY WERE THIS TIME LAST YEAR SO THE NEW PRICES HAVE ALSO BEEN RISING SINCE AUGUST DRIVEN HIGHER BY LARGER THAN EXPECTED EXPORT DEMAND PRIMARILY TO CHINA US IS PROJECTING THE CURRENT SOYBEAN CROP OF 4.3 BILLION BUSHELS AND O- OVER 700 MILLION FROM LAST YEAR DESPITE THE LARGE INCREASE IN PRODUCTION USDA IS PROJECTING NEW CROP ENDING STOCKS AT 290 MILLION BUSHELS THE LOWEST LEVEL IN FOUR YEARS THE UNCERTAINTY OVER THE SIZE OF THE CHINESE IMPORT PROGRAM IS CAUSING INCREASING UNCERTAINTY AND VOLATILITY IN THE UNITED STATES MARKET GLOBALLY WITH PRICES IN EUROPE HAS ALSO RISEN RECENTLY DESPITE THE LARGER THAN EXPECTED RUSSIAN WHEAT CROP AND PROJECTED INCREASE SUPPLY IN OTHER MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTERS LIKE AUSTRALIA A SLOW START TO THE PLANTING SEASON IN RUSSIA AND LARGER THAN EXPECTED EXPORT DEMAND OUT OF THE US ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE RISE PRICES IN THE WHEAT MARKET ON THE CHICKEN PRODUCTION ACCORDING TO THE USDA Q3 WAS DOWN HALF OF A PERCENT RELATIVE TO Q3 2019 AS INCREASED LIGHTWEIGHT DID NOT AFFECT HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A LARGER LAYER FLOCK WITH CURRENT LEVELS 4.40% ABOVE LAST YEAR IN LINE WITH THE TRENDS OBSERVED IN Q1 INDUSTRY THE INDUSTRY HAS ALSO MANAGED TO REDUCE THE AVERAGE AGE OF LAYING HENS PROMOTING A YOUNGER MORE EFFICIENT BREEDS THIS HAS ALLOWED THE INDUSTRY TO MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE SUPPLY OF EGGS IN THE SHORT TERM WHILE ENABLING GROWTH IN THE LONG TERM AS THE DEMAND ENVIRONMENT IMPROVES OVERALL THE TREND HAS SHOWN A SLOWING OF FULL REPLACEMENT GROWTH WHICH IS IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS GIVEN THAT MOST OF THE PUBLIC PLACEMENT INCREASES IN 2019 AND EARLY 202 WE'RE EXPECTED TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF NEW CAPACITY THAT HAS COME ONLINE OVER THAT PERIOD FROM Q2 TO Q3 COVID-19 RELATED RESTRICTIONS HAVE SLOWLY BEEN ROLLED BACK WITH MANY BUSINESSES AND RESTAURANTS OPENING UNDER MODIFIED ENVIRONMENTS TO PROTECT WORKER AND CONSUMER HEALTH THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS CONSUMERS HAVE PROVEN HIGHLY ADAPTABLE TO THE NEW NORMAL AND HAS CONTINUED TO MODIFY THEIR SHOPPING AND SPENDING HABITS IN RESPONSE TO THE NEW NORMAL ENVIRONMENT THIS NEW CONSUMER ENVIRONMENT FAVORS THE RETAIL CHANNEL AS MANY CONSUMERS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO WORK FROM HOME AND CHOOSING TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY MORE CROWDED AREAS AS A RESULT RETAIL DEMAND FOR CHICKEN LIKE THAT ALL PROTEINS HAVE REMAINED SUPPORTED THROUGHOUT THE QUARTER WHILE FOOD SERVICE DEMANDS TO TRAIL BELOW YEARS AGO LEVEL THIS CHANNEL HAS PROVEN HIGHLY ADAPTABLE AND CONTINUES TO IMPROVE EACH MONTH FROM THE LOW POINTS IN APRIL LED BY THE QSR SEGMENTS ENTERING Q4 THE USDA EXPECT PREDICTION TO BE FLAT FOR THE QUARTER ON A YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS BEFORE ENTERING 2021 IN WHICH THE USDA EXPECTS OIL PRODUCTION TO GROW 0.90% VERSUS 202 HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND CONSUMER UNCERTAINTY CONTRIBUTE TO A FOOD MACRO ENVIRONMENT AND THE FALLOUT EFFECTS OF COVID-19 WILL AFFECT THE CHANNELS DIFFERENTLY WE EXPECT THE RESTRICTION OF RESTAURANT CAPACITIES SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES CONSUMER CONCERN FOR INDIVIDUAL HEALTH AND THE ADAPTATION OF CONSUMERS TO THEIR PERSONAL ECONOMIC SITUATIONS TO CONTINUE FAVOR- FAVORING THE INCREASED FREQUENCY FREQUENCY OF AT HOME MEALS SINCE CHICKEN CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE MOST AFFORDABLE AND VERSATILE PROTEINS RETAIL DEMAND IS LIKELY TO REMAIN ABOVE YEAR AGO LEVELS WHEN WE EXPECT OVERALL FOOD SERVICE DEMAND TO REMAIN MORE VOLATILE AND REMAIN BELOW YEAR AGO LEVELS AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM QSR'S ABILITY TO ADAPT QUICKLY TO THE NEW ENVIRONMENT IN A POSITIVE SIGN FOR THE CHICKEN INDUSTRY MOVING FROM LATE 2020 TO 202 OUR STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO ADAPT WELL TO THE CHALLENGING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHILE MINIMIZING THE IMPACT FROM VOLATILITY IN MARKET CONDITIONS WHILE WE ARE ALREADY WELL BALANCED IN TERMS OF OUR BIRD SIZE EXPOSURE WE WILL REMAIN DILIGENT IN SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREMENTALLY DIVERSIFY OUR PRODUCT MIX AND REDUCE THE COMMODITY PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS TO KEY CUSTOMERS WHILE OPTIMIZING OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS BY PURSUING OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENT TARGETS OUR KEY CUSTOMER APPROACH IS STRATEGIC AND CREATES THE BASIS FOR FURTHER ACCELERATE GROWTH IN IMPORTANT CATEGORIES BY PROMOTING MORE CUSTOMIZED HIGH QUALITY INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO GIVE US A CLEAR LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WHILE FURTHER IMPROVING THE RESILIENCE TO MARKET SITUATION WITH THAT LET'S TURN TO TWO ADDITIONAL DETAILS UH TO OUR FINANCIALS OUR SG&A IN THE THIRD QUARTER WAS HIGHER VERSUS A YEAR AGO AS WE IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCIES OF OUR EXPENSES BUT INCREASED SUPPORT FOR EXPANDING THE JUST BARE BRAND NATIONALLY AND THE INVESTMENT FOR OUR NEW PREPARED FOODS PRODUCTS BOTH IN THE US AND MEXICO AS WELL AS THE INCLUSION OF THE NEW ASSETS IN EUROPE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE REPORTED SG&A IS OUR $50 MILLION CONTRIBUTION TO THE HOMETOWN STRONG INITIATIVE AND THE DOJ AGREEMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE OUR CAPITAL SPENDING PLAN THIS YEAR TO OPTIMIZE OUR PRODUCT MIX THAT IS AIMED AT IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO SUPPLY INNOVATIVE LESS COMMODITIZED PRODUCTS AND STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS WITH KEY CUSTOMERS EVEN DURING THESE UNCERTAINTY TIMES WHILE WE CONTINUE- CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ALL CAPEX PROJECTS AND DEFER THOSE WITHIN NON ESSENTIAL WE WILL REITERATE OUR COMMITMENT TO INVESTING ON STRONG RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED PROJECTS THAT WILL IMPROVE OUR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND TAILOR CUSTOMER NEEDS TO FURTHER SOLIDIFY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR PEERS OUR BALANCE SHEETS CONTINUED TO BE ROBUST GIVEN OUR RELENTLESS EMPHASIS ON CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOCUS ON MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL AND DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT IN HIGH RETURN PROJECTS OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION REMAINS VERY STRONG IN MORE THAN $1.30 BILLION IN TOTAL CASH AND AVAILABILITY WE HAVE NO SHORT TERM IMMEDIATE CASH REQUIREMENTS WITH OUR BONDS MATURING IN 2025 AND 2027 AND OUR TERM LOAN MATURING IN 202 DURING THE QUARTER OUR NET DEBT WAS 1.9 BILLION THE LOWEST SINCE 2016 AND A LEVERAGE RATIO FOR 2.5 TIMES LESS 12 MONTHS EBITDA OUR LEVERAGE REMAINS AT A MANAGEABLE LEVEL AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS THIS YEAR INCREASING OUR FINANCIAL CAPABILITY TO PURSUE STRATEGIC ACTIONS WE EXPECT 2020 INTEREST EXPENSE OF AROUND 130 TO $140 MILLION WE HAVE A STRONG BALANCE SHEET IN A LEVERAGE THAT IS WITHIN OUR TARGETS WHICH ARE SUPPORTIVE FOR US TO ACT ON GREAT OPPORTUNITIES DURING THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON EXERCISE IN GREAT CARE ENSURING THAT WE CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE BY OPTIMIZING OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE WHILE PRESERVING THE FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE A GROWTH STRATEGY AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO CONSIDER AND EVALUATE ALL RELEVANT CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGIES THAT WILL MATCH THE PURSUIT OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY AND CONTINUE TO REVIEW EACH PROSPECT ACCORDINGLY TO OUR VALUE CREATING STANDARDS OPERATOR THIS CONCLUDES OUR PREPARED REMARKS PLEASE OPEN THE CALL FOR QUESTIONS THANK

INCLUDING THE MASKS AND FACE SHIELDS TO ALL OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND WE INSTALL PHYSICAL BARRIERS IN OUR PRODUCTION AREA AND OF COURSE WE ARE MAINTAINING SOCIAL DISTANCING WHENEVER WHEREVER UH AREAS WE CAN WE DID MORE THAN 10,000 BARRIERS WITHIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS OF THE THE PANDEMIC AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO UPGRADE THOSE BARRIERS WE ALSO INSTALLED THAT DUAL TECHNOLOGY UV AND BIPOLAR IONIZATION IN EVERY PLANT TO FILTER THE AIR AND NEUTRALIZE POTENTIAL VIRUSES AS I MENTIONED WE ARE OFFERING FREE LIVEHEALTH ONLINE SERVICES FOR ALL OF OUR UH TEAM MEMBERS THAT ALLOW FOR VIRTUAL DOCTOR VISITS AT ZERO COSTS AND ABOVE ALL CDC GUIDELINES WE REMOVED THE VULNERABLE TEAM MEMBERS FROM FACILITIES WITH FULL PAY AND BENEFITS DURING COMMUNITY OUTBREAKS AND THAT IS CREATING SOME CHALLENGES TO OPERATIONS BECAUSE BY REMOVING THOSE PEOPLE WE HAVE LESS PEOPLE AT OUR PLANTS YEAH IT THE SITUATION IS VERY FLUID IT UH VARIES FROM PLANT TO PLANT BUT OVER THE LAST UH MONTHS WE HAVE INCREASED OUR STAFFING TO CLOSE TO THE LEVELS THAT WE WERE BEFORE COVID SO WE ARE ALREADY RUNNING A MUCH BETTER MIX THAT WE WERE DURING UH THE Q2 AND WE ARE SEEING A VERY GOOD INCREASE IN UH OUR ABSENTEEISM LEVELS UH AS PEOPLE ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT WE ARE DOING AS WE'RE GAINING THE TRUST OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES PEOPLE ARE UH LESS UH UH RELUCTANT TO RETURN TO WORK AND WITH THAT WE'VE BEEN UH UH IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE THE OPTIMAL MIX OF COURSE WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH OUR KEY CUSTOMERS TO SIMPLIFY OUR MIX TO CREATE A MORE OPTIMAL FOOTPRINT AND WITH THE FREQUENT UH COMMUNICATION WITH THE WITH THEM UH WE ARE ENSURING THAT OUR TEAM MEMBERS UH WE EXPECT TO RETURN TO THE OPTIMAL OPERATION UH UH IN THIS QUARTER <INAUDIBLE> ON YOUR RESULTS THE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM KEN ZASLOW WITH BANK OF MONTREAL PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY GOOD MORNING EVERYONE GOOD MORNING KEN UH JUST TWO QUESTIONS WHAT IS AS YOU MIX AS YOU CHANGE YOUR MIX WHAT IS GO WHAT WAS THE MIX BETWEEN BIG SMALL AND MEDIUM SAY LAST YEAR AND THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE NOW AND THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW AS YOU ADJUST YOUR YOUR PRODUCT MIXES YEAH CAN WE UNROLL BALANCE BETWEEN UH SMALL BIRDS UH TRAY-PACK AND LARGE BIRD DEBONING UH WHAT WE ARE DOING IS UH AS THE AS THE DEMAND HAS BEEN SHIFTING TO MORE RETAIL WE'VE BEEN SHIFTING SHIFTING OUR OPERATIONS ALSO WITH THE GROWTH OF QSR WE'VE ALSO ADAPTED THOSE CONDITIONS WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR 2021 IS TO FIRST UH MOVE THAT PLANT FROM BIG BIRD DEBONING TO SMALL BIRD DEBONING WHICH WILL INCREASE UH OUR OUR PRESENCE IN THAT SEGMENT WE ARE ALSO DOUBLING THE CAPACITY IN OUR MINNESOTA PLANT UH TO UM COMPLY AND COMPLY OR SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR KEY CUSTOMERS AND ADJUST THEIR BRAND WHICH HAS DOUBLED THE SALES IN THE ONLINE CHANNEL OVER UH THIS QUARTER LOOKING INTO OVERALL PORTFOLIO WE MOVE FROM 46% OF OUR TOTAL SALES IN RETAIL TO AROUND 51% JUST IN 2020 WITH SMALL CHANGES IN OUR OPERATION FOR NEXT YEAR EXPECT UH 2% INCREASE IN THAT UH PORTFOLIO TO THE RETAIL AND UH ONE TO 2% INCREASE IN THE SMALL BIRD WITH THOSE UH TWO CONVERSIONS GREAT MY MY NEXT QUESTION IS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE MEXICAN MARGINS I I YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY I I DID SEE THAT THERE WAS A UH A LITTLE BIT OF A FX BENEFIT HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE MEXICAN OPERATION I THINK YOU DID SAY THAT IT'S GOING TO IT'S STILL CONTINUING THE MOMENTUM INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER THEN HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR 2000 UH UH 21 HOW HOW DO WE FRAME IT IN OUR MINDS YEAH SURE KEN AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MEXICO UH OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THEY ARE VERY VOLATILE QUARTER OVER QUARTER BUT THEY ARE MORE STABLE IF YOU THINK A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OR WITHIN A YEAR WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OR IN THE FIRST SEMESTER IN MEXICO WAS A COMPLETE IMBALANCE DURING SUPPLY AND DEMAND SO THE INDUSTRY INCREASED SUPPLY DURING THE FIRST SEMESTER AND AT THE SAME TIME DEMAND BECAUSE OF THE COVID-19 UH REALLY UH CREATE A A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT AS YOU REMEMBER IN MEXICO THERE WAS NO UM SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE COVID-19 LIKE WE HAVE IN US IN EUROPE THERE IS NO GOVERNMENTAL STIMULUS OR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WHICH CREATED A SHARP UH SLOWDOWN AND RECESSION IN THE REGION WHICH REALLY AFFECTED THE THE THE DEMAND BOTH IN THE FOOD SERVICE AND RETAIL WHILE WITHIN US WE SAW UM AN INCREASE IN RETAIL COMPENSATING AT LEAST PARTIALLY THE SHUTDOWN IN FOOD SERVICE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN IN MEXICO AND THAT'S WHY THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF BALANCE AS THE INDUSTRY ADAPTED THEIR SUPPLY UH FOR THE Q3 AND WE UH AT PILGRIM'S UH ADAPTED TO THAT SITUATION AS WELL WE REDUCE OUR COSTS AND WE ALSO CUT PRODUCTION THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND IMPROVES A LOT AND WE SAW THE REBOUND IN THE FOOD SERVICE AND DEMAND IN Q3 AND NOW WE HAVE VERY UH STABLE PRICES UH DURING THIS TIME IN MEXICO WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE DURING UH Q4 Q4 HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRONGER QUARTER FOR MEXICO WITH THE FESTIVITIES WE DON'T KNOW AT WHICH UH POINT THAT WILL BE UH UH REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE THE COVID RESTRICTIONS WE'VE SEEN SOME INCREASE IN CASES IN MEXICO UH SO THERE COULD BE SOME MORE RESTRICTIONS IN IN THE Q4 BUT GIVEN THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SITUATION THAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW THE RESULTS ARE ARE SUSTAINABLE NOW FOR Q1 WE EXPECT UH THE INDUSTRY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION TO UH EQUATE UH SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE RETURN TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS MEXICO IS REALLY VOLATILE QUARTER OVER QUARTER AGAIN BUT WE EXPECT UH TO BE VERY STABLE UH YEAR OVER YEAR OF COURSE OUR STRATEGY IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE GROWTH TO INCREASE THE HIGHER MARGIN DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AS WELL WE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF UH IMPACT IN THE PREPARED FOODS UH ESPECIALLY ON THE MORE AFFORDABLE PRODUCTS DURING Q1 BUT WE CONTINUE TO INVEST AND UH HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED THE PILGRIM'S PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO SELL REALLY WELL LONGER TERM DESPITE THE VOLATILITY MEXICO IS A GROWING ECONOMY AND AS THE POPULATION INCREASE THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOME IT LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN PROTEIN CONSUMPTION GREAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ANSWER THANK YOU KEN THE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM BEN BIENVENU WITH STEPHENS INC PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY GOOD MORNING HI BEN I WANT TO ASK UM YOU YOU TOUCHED ON IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS WITH ASF IN CHINA AND AND GERMANY I WANT TO ASK ON GERMANY MORE SPECIFICALLY I WOULD THINK THAT'S A NICE BOON FOR THE TOOL OF BUSINESS JUST CURIOUS ON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THAT BUSINESS BOTH AS IT RELATES TO THE IMPACT ON THE DOMESTIC MARKET AND THEN AN UPTICK IN POTENTIAL DEMAND FROM THAT MARKET AS WELL UH AND HOW YOU THINK YOU'RE POSITIONED TO CAPTURE THAT BENEFIT YEAH THANK YOU BEN AND THE OPERATIONS IN EUROPE ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THE RETAIL SO WE PRODUCE UH MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS IN UK FOR THE RETAIL UK MARKET AND BECAUSE OF THE HIGH WELFARE WE COMMAND A PREMIUM IN THAT REGION THE BIG COMPETITION UH AS YOU AS YOU REFER IS ON THE FOOD SERVICE UH SECTOR HAVE IMPORTED PRODUCTS FROM POLAND AND GERMANY MAINLY AND SPAIN ON THE PORT SIDE UM AS THE GERMANS UH HAVE THIS ISSUES WITH UH THEIR PRODUCTION AND BECAUSE OF THE BAN IN CHINA IT ACTUALLY INCREASES THE SALES UH IN THE UK MARKET IT ALSO CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR UK PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD INTO CHINA SO WHAT WE SAW IS THAT ON THE UH WHAT WE CALL FIFTH QUARTER PRODUCTS A A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PRICING BUT ON THE NORMAL PRODUCTS LIKE LOINS AND AND OTHERS WE SEE THE PRICES MORE STABLE BECAUSE IT'S A A A ZERO SUM GAME AT THE END OF THE DAY SO UH IT INCREASES THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHINA SO THAT WAS UH UH WELCOME I THINK OUR SALES UH LIKE WE MENTIONED HAVE DOUBLED DURING Q3 AND WE'RE SEEING SOME SOME VERY STABLE PRICING BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES THE COMPETITION IN THE FOOD SERVICE SEGMENTS IN UH UK OKAY GREAT UH MY SECOND QUESTION IS RELATED TO GRAIN AND APOLOGIES IF I MISSED THIS IN YOUR OPENING COMMENT I DID HEAR YOUR OVERVIEW OF THE MARKET COULD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE POSITIONED RELATIVE TO THE MARKETS YOU KNOW ARE YOU MORE HAND TO MOUTH AT THE MOMENT DO YOU HAVE ANY BASIS SECURED ANY COLOR YOU COULD OFFER THERE ON HOW YOUR POSITIONED UM YOU KNOW THROUGH THE BALANCE OF FOURTH QUARTER AND INTO NEXT YEAR WOULD BE HELPFUL HEY BEN THIS IS JOE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION O- OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN PRICES OF CORN AND SOYBEAN NOW INCREASE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN THE RESULT OF A FEW FACTORS FOR CORN WE'VE SEEN A REDUCTION FROM THE SUPPLY SIDE WITH USDA REPORTING 6 MILLION FEWER PLANTED ACRES THAN THEY ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED BACK IN MARCH WE ALSO SAW OUR FINAL STOCKS FOR 2019 END UP BEING 200 MILLION BUSHELS LESS THAN WAS EXPECTED WHEN THE FINAL ACCOUNTING WAS DONE ON THE CURRENT CROP WE ACTUALLY FOR THE ACRES THAT ARE PLANTED SEE PRETTY GOOD YIELDS OF UPTREND ON YIELDS SO IT'S NOT AN ISSUE ON THE SUPPLY SIDE IN TERMS OF US PRODUCTION BUT ON THE DEMAND SIDE WE'VE ALSO SEEN MUCH BIGGER EXPORT UH DEMAND PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHINA STILL THE USDA IS PROJECTING A CARRIER OUT CARRYOUT OF AROUND 2.1 BILLION BUSHELS AND THAT INCLUDES A 30% INCREASE IN EXPORT DEMAND FROM LAST YEAR SO EVEN IF EXPORT DEMAND ENDS UP HIGHER THAN WHAT THE USDA IS PROJECTING CORN STOCK SHOULD STILL BE IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS YEARS ON SOYBEANS USDA IS PROJECTING A 290 MILLION BUSHEL CARRYOUT WHICH WOULD BE THE LOWEST CARRYOUT IN FIVE YEARS THIS PROJECTION THOUGH INCLUDES A 31% INCREASE IN EXPORT DEMAND DRIVEN BY CHINA IN ADDITION TO INCREASE EXPORTS IN ARGENTINA WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST SOLD SEED EXPORTING COUNTRIES IS IN THE MIDST OF A HISTORIC ECONOMIC CRISIS WHICH IS CAUSING FARMERS NEAR TO HOLD BACK AVAILABLE SUPPLIES FROM THE MARKET ADDING MORE PRESSURE TO THE US TO MEET THIS DEMAND WE BELIEVE THE MARKET IS LIKELY TO FEEL ANXIOUS ABOUT US SOYBEAN SUPPLIES UNTIL THERE'S A RESOLUTION TO THIS CURRENCY SITUATION IN ARGENTINA OR IN SOUTH SOUTH AMERICAN SUPPLIES CAN BE AVAILABLE TO MEET THIS DEMAND IN TERMS OF OUR POSITION WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT OUR HEDGING STRATEGY IS ADAPTIVE TO THE MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE RISK WE SEE AND WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE WE ARE IN CORN AND SOY WE DO RECOGNIZE THE RISKS OF SOYBEAN SUPPLIES IN THE US AND OUR POSITIONS REFLECT THAT OKAY AWESOME THANKS AND THAT'S ALL THANK YOU AGAIN AS A REMINDER IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN ONE THE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM MICHAEL PEKIN WITH CLEVELAND RESEARCH PLEASE GO AHEAD YEAH HI GOOD MORNING I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH BASE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF UH YOU KNOW THE MOVE I GUESS UH YOU KNOW INTO RETAIL AND YOU KNOW UH SOME OF THAT BIG BIRD PRODUCT IS THAT UH BEING CHOPPED UP AND PUT INTO TRAYS AND YOU KNOW HOW IS THAT IMPACTING YOU KNOW SOME OF THE MARGINS ON THE COMMODITY BUSINESS YES MIKE UM THERE'S A LOT OF PRODUCTS ON THE BIG BIRDS UH ESPECIALLY DURING UH PROMOTIONAL SEASON SEASONALITY DURING THE SUMMER THAT FROM THE BIG BIRDS END UP BEING PUT IN THE TRAY TO BE SOLD IN THE RETAILERS WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT I THINK THE THE CHALLENGE TO THE INDUSTRY IS THAT UH WE NEED TO HAVE A LABEL AVAILABLE AND THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE TO DO MORE OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY THE INDUSTRY HAS NOT INCREASED UH MORE UH PRODUCTION TO THE TRAY PACK AS WE UH AS AS WE WANT OR AS THE DEMAND CONTINUES TO GROW IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE INCREASING THE CAPACITY IN OUR MINNESOTA PLANT SO AS OF TODAY YES WE ARE BUYING BIG BIRD MEAT AND WE CONTINUE TO PUT IT ON ON A TRAY ESPECIALLY DURING SATURDAYS AND I I THINK THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IS DOING THAT OKAY GREAT AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS YOU KNOW JUST LOOKING AT THE UH YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOUR ABSENTEE RATES ARE STARTING TO GO DOWN AND YOU'RE STARTING TO GET BACK TO YOUR NORMAL MIX UM IN TERMS OF SOME OF DEBONED DARK MEAT DO YOU ARE YOU STARTING TO UH RETURN THAT UH YOU KNOW HISTORICAL LEVELS AND WHAT COULD THAT MEAN UH FOR THE LEG QUARTER PRICES WHICH IS SEEING YOU KNOW THE MOST PRESSURE CANNOT HELP OR IS IT YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT CHINA IS TAKING MORE PORK CAN THAT HELP WITH LEG QUARTERS THAT ARE DO I HAVE A LEG QUARTER PRICES MOVED IF THERE'S MORE DEBONED UH DARK MEAT POTENTIALLY BEING PRODUCED AND YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW THE AT THE VERY LEAST TRYING TO TAKE IN MORE US PORK YES YOU'RE RIGHT MIKE UM BECAUSE OF THE ABSENTEEISM AND ALSO THE FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY IN US UH THE INDUSTRY PRODUCE 3% MORE LEG QUARTERS UH IN JULY AND AUGUST THAN THE SAME PERIOD UH LAST YEAR DESPITE A LOWER TOTAL PRODUCTION THAT PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE IN THE LEG QUARTER PRICING UM AND AS WE ARE SEEING MORE THE REOPENING OF THE FOOD SERVICE AND AS WE ARE SEEING THE ABSENTEEISM AND THE STAFFING OF OUR CLIENTS INCREASING UH FOR US AND FOR THE WHOLE INDUSTRY WE ARE SEEING MORE UH DEBONING WE ARE UH ALREADY AT LEVELS COMPARABLE TO LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF DEBONING WHICH WILL REDUCE THE PRESSURE IN THE LEG QUARTERS OF COURSE UH CHINA HAS BEEN ALSO MORE ACTIVE IN THE LEG QUARTER MARKET OVER THE THE LAST MONTH AND WE ARE SEEING THAT IN THE LEG QUARTER INVENTORY THAT WAS UP ON A ON A SEQUENTIAL BASIS UP TO AUGUST BUT WE ARE SEEING A REDUCTION AND ALSO THE INVENTORIES UH TODAY IS DOWN 9% COMPARED TO THE PEAK Q1 AVERAGE THAT WE HAVE SO THOSE TWO FACTORS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE LEG QUARTER PRODUCTION WHICH IS A COMMODITY UH ITEM AS AS I MENTIONED AND THE CHINA INTEREST I THINK WE SAW OVER THE LAST UH UH WEEKS ALTHOUGH NOT TODAY THE INCREASE IN THE OIL PRICES AND THE REDUCTION IN IN THE IN THE DOLLAR WHICH INCREASE THE UH AVAILABILITY OF DOLLARS FROM THE UH UH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHICH ALSO INCREASES THE DEMAND FOR LEG QUARTERS SO WHAT COULD HELP ON THE LEG QUARTERS UH GOING FORWARD IT'S BOTH ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND SUPPLY IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID THE LAST LEG QUARTERS BECAUSE OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN UH LABOR EFFICIENCIES AND THE MORE SALES IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET ON THE FOOD SERVICE AND ON DEMAND BECAUSE OF LOW PRICES AND BECAUSE OF UH MORE STABLE INCOME IN THE IN THE DEVELOPING ECONOMIES THE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM PETER GALBO WITH BANK OF AMERICA PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY GUYS GOOD MORNING UH THANKS FOR TAKING THE QUESTION UM YOU KNOW FABIO JUST AS AS I'M THINKING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW THE THE THE SMALL BIRD AND RETAIL CHANNELS OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUSLY PROFITABLE UM FOR FOR YOU GUYS DURING YOU KNOW THIS TIME PERIOD UM WITH AND AND YOU KNOW WITH THE PLANT CONVERSION COMING BUT YOU YOU KNOW WITH WITH COMMODITY BIG BIRD REMAINING YOU KNOW IN A CUT OFF YOU HAVE YOUR REMAINING UNDER SUCH PRESSURE JUST AT AT WHAT POINT DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO START TALKING ABOUT CONVERTING ANOTHER PLANT UM WHETHER THAT'S TO RETAIL OR OR TO SMALL BIRD BECAUSE IT JUST IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT BIG BIRD PORTION IS IS NOT GOING TO IMPROVE WITHOUT MORE CAPACITY EITHER BEING CONVERTED OR OR TAKEN OUT OF THE MARKET YOU KNOW IN IN IN SOME CAPACITY SURE THANK YOU PETER I THINK THE DECISION TO CONVERT THE PLANT IS A MORE LONG TERM DECISION AND WE ALWAYS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS UH COMBINED WITH OUR KEY CUSTOMER STRATEGY AS WE SEE THE DEMAND OF THIS KEY CUSTOMERS GROWING UH WE TAKE ACTION IN OUR PORTFOLIO SO AND AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FOR US TO DO THAT CONVERSION RIGHT NOW FROM THAT UH FROM THAT OPERATION FROM BIG BIRD TO SMALL BIRD TO SUPPORT UH THIS GROWTH I THINK A- AGAIN YOU NEED TO LOOK INTO A MORE BROADER LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE FOOD SERVICE SECTOR TO REBOUND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FOOD SERVICE SECTOR TODAY THE FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS ARE NOW 13% YEAR OVER YEAR AND THAT IS IMPACTING THE BIG BIRD DEBONING FOR SURE WHILE THE QSR IS AROUND 9% AS WE GO THROUGH A MORE NORMAL UH OPERATIONS AS WE SEE UH MAYBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR WE SEE MORE OPENINGS OF THE RESTAURANTS WE EXPECT THE FOOD SERVICE UH RESTAURANTS ESPECIALLY ON THE FOOD SERVICE TO REGAIN UH SOME MARKET SHARE THAT THEY ARE NOT UH UH OPERATING TODAY SO I I THINK IT'S A LONG TERM DECISION AND IT'S ALSO A VERY UH DIFFICULT DECISION TO MOVE FROM BIG BIRD TO A SMALLER BECAUSE WE HAVE THE GROWERS AND WE HAVE THE FEED MILLS IT'S ALL BUILT TO THAT SPECIFIC BIRD OUR OUR PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE REALLY CUSTOMIZED TO THAT SPECIFIC SEGMENT SO ANY CONVERSION IT REALLY REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL AND REQUIRES SOME SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT UH CHANGES IN THE UH OVERALL SUPPLY CHAIN BOTH STARTING FROM THE GROWERS YOUR FEED MILLS AND YOUR FIELD OPERATIONS SO IT'S A IT'S A HIGH CAPITAL INVESTMENT THAT IT NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED IN FOR THE LONG RUN SO THAT'S WHY WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF CONVERSIONS UH IN OUR INDUSTRY OF COURSE IF THIS UM SITUATION CONTINUED FOR FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME YOU CAN SEE SOME CONVERSIONS I THINK ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT UH TO KNOW THAT SOME OTHER PLAYERS DON'T HAVE THE KEY CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE AND MOVING FROM THE BIG BIRD TO THE SMALL BIRD OR TO THE CASE-READY REQUIRE A CUSTOMER AND UM A KEY CUSTOMER TO SUPPORT AND SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS IT'S HARDER FOR THEM TO DO SOME UM CONVERSIONS ALL RIGHT NOW THAT- THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL UM AND AND THEN MAYBE JUST TO FOLLOW UP YOU KNOW GIVEN WHERE THE BALANCE SHEET IS NOW SOME- SOMETHING YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR PREPARED REMARKS UM YOU KNOW HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT M&A POTENTIAL MAYBE FROM A GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE UM OR DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO GET BIGGER IN IN PORK AND IN EUROPE AND YOU KNOW GOING INTO 2021 UH JUST JUST ANY HELP THERE AND THEN AND THEN MAYBE YOU CAN ALSO COMMENT ON ANY UPDATES ON YOUR UH CFO SEARCH THANKS VERY MUCH SURE IN TERMS OF STRATEGY I THINK OUR STRATEGY CONTINUES TO SAME AND OUR GROWTH STRATEGY CONTINUES IN FACT AS AS I MENTIONED HAVE A VERY STRONG BALANCE SHEET WE LOOK INTO INCREASING OUR PREPARED FOODS OPERATION AND OUR BRANDED OPERATION TO UH TO CREATE A MORE BALANCED PORTFOLIO AND WE ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR CHICKEN ASSETS WHERE WE CAN EXTRACT UH MORE VALUE FROM OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES UH WE'RE SEEING TARGETS UH BOTH IN THE US AND OUTSIDE US GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSIFICATION AND TO GROWTH IN EUROPE AND WE WILL EVALUATE ALL ALTERNATIVES UH TO OUR VALUE CREATION STANDARDS IN TERMS OF UH THE CFO WE ARE UM IN IN THE PROCESS OF UH OF FINDING ANOTHER C- CFO WE ALREADY ENGAGE UH UH RECRUITING FIRMS AND WE SHOULD HAVE UH SOME SOME NEWS IN THE NEAR FUTURE GREAT THANKS VERY MUCH GUYS MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> THE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM ADAM SAMUELSON WITH GOLDMAN SACHS & CO PLEASE GO AHEAD UH YEAH THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYONE GOOD MORNING ADAM ALL RIGHT SO SO MAYBE FIRST JUST A CLARIFICATION AND A LITTLE MORE DETAIL UM THE EXPANSION OF THE MINNESOTA PLANTS FOR FOR CASE-READY AND AND THE CONVERSION OF THE TEXAS PLANTS SMALL BIRD FROM BIG BIRD UM WHAT'S THE NET IMPACT ON YOUR PRODUCTION VOLUME UM AND WHAT'S THE CAPITAL COSTS OF THOSE UH PROJECTS YEAH IN TERMS OF TOTAL VOLUME I THINK WE SHOULD BE JUST A LITTLE BIT UP WE EXPECT TO BE TO GROW IN LINE WITH THE USDA EXPECTATIONS AND THE INDUSTRY FOR 2021 WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN 1% YES AS WE H- HAVE MORE BIRDS IN MINNESOTA BUT WE'VE ALSO REDUCED THE WEIGHTS IN OUR OPERATION UH ON THE BIG BIRD THAT WE ARE TRANSFORMING TO A SMALL BIRD SO WE EXPECT TO BE FOR 2021 IN LINE WITH WITH THOSE TWO IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS IT'S NOT A VERY SIGNIFICANT TO OUR TOTAL CAPEX UM AS THE CONVERSION OF THE SMALL BIRD PLANT IT'S IT'S NOT A IT'S IT'S A SIMPLE CONVERSION UH OF COURSE THAT QSR REQUIRES UM SOME DSI WHICH IS PORTIONING EQUIPMENT AND SOME MARINATION EQUIPMENT AND WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN AUTOMATION IN THAT PLANT AS WELL TODAY THERE'S A MANUAL DEBONING OPERATION AND WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN THE AUTOMATE- AUTO- AUTOMATED DEBONING SO THE INVESTMENT IS CLOSE TO 20 TO $25 MILLION IN THAT OPERATION AND IN THE UM IN THE CASE OF THE CASE-READY OPERATION IS CLOSE TO $70 MILLION SO OVERALL IT IS A TOTAL OF $100 MILLION THAT WE GOT TO INVEST IN THOSE TWO CONVERSIONS OKAY THAT'S UH THAT'S HELPFUL AND THE THE THE FOLLOW UP WAS UM I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I HEARD SOMETHING RIGHT IN THE PREPARED REMARKS UH YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PREPARED FOOD BUSINESS IN THE US DECLINING UH 26% I THINK IS WHAT I HEARD UM AND MAYBE HOPING TO JUST COULD YOU EXPAND ON THAT THAT'S A BUSINESS THAT I THINK HAD MORE CHALLENGES OVER THE YEARS AND JUST IS DO WE IS IT REALLY JUST A QUESTION OF RETURN TO SCHOOL AND AND FOOD SERVICE TRAFFIC OR HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT BUSINESS OR MARGIN PROFILE MOVING FORWARD YEAH UH THAT'S EXACTLY IT WE IN OUR PREPARED FOOD BUSINESS WE HAVE A STRONG BRAND WHICH IS THE PIERCE BRAND THAT IS MAINLY A FOOD SERVICE UH BRAND WE ALSO ARE VERY STRONG IN THE SCHOOL WITH OUR GOLD GOLD KIST UH BRAND BOTH THOSE SEGMENTS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST MOST AFFECTED BY THE THE COVID-19 THE NON COMMERCIAL FOOD SERVICE THAT INCLUDES SCHOOLS ARE NOW 66% AT UH Q2 AND NOW THEY ARE DOWN 43% WE'RE SEEING SOME SCHOOL REOPENS WHICH COULD HELP BUT IT'S THE SEGMENT THAT IS STILL DOWN 40% ON WHAT WE CALL THE COMMERCIAL FOOD SERVICE WHICH IS A STREET BUSINESS WHERE OUR PIERCE BRAND IS A IS A LEADING BRAND IN WINGS AND IN CHUNKS WE SAW THAT IN Q2 THEY UH END UP 36% LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR BUT THEY'RE REBOUNDING AND THEN TODAY THEY ARE CLOSE TO 4% LOWER THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST LAST YEAR SO THE FOOD SERVICE BUSINESS HAS BEEN RECOVERING AND WITH THAT OUR PIERCE UH BRAND HAS UH RECOVERED IN OUR VOLUMES BUT UH SCHOOL SYSTEM IS STILL UH CLOSE TO 20% LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE INVESTING IN MORE RETAIL BRANDED BUSINESS AS WE MENTIONED OUR UM PILGRIM'S BRAND HAS INCREASED MORE THAN 30% AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN SPENDING THE JUST BARE BRAND FROM THE FRESH CATEGORY WHICH HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL ON ON THE ONLINE SEGMENT AND ALSO ON THE ON THE HIGHER ATTRIBUTES SEGMENT IN OUR UH KEY CUSTOMERS TO THE PREPARED FOOD SEGMENT UH ALL RIGHT GREAT THAT'S UH THAT'S HELPFUL I'LL PASS IT ON THANK YOU THANK YOU ADAM THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM CARLA CASELLA WITH JP MORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD HI MY QUESTION IS REGARDING YOUR LEVERAGE UM THE THREE TIMES TARGET HOW COMFORTABLE OR OR HOW HIGH WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE TAKING THAT IN THE EVENT OF ADDITIONAL M&A AND ARE YOU SEEING ANY UM MORE M&A OPPORTUNITIES JUST GIVEN THE VOLATILITY IN WORLDWIDE PROTEIN MARKET YEAH THANK YOU CARLA WE WE SET THESE TARGETS OF TWO TO THREE TIMES BECAUSE IT'S THE IT'S THE BEST CAPITAL STRUCTURE THAT CAN PROTECT AND REDUCE OUR UH UH INTEREST UH PAYMENTS WHILE NOT CREATING ANY ANY ANY PROBLEM FOR OUR FOR OUR BONDS AND FOR OUR OUR LEVERAGE UM THE TWO TO THREE TIMES IS IN NORMAL OPERATIONS OF COURSE DURING SOME ACQUISITIONS IF WE HAVE A A GREAT PLAN ON HOW TO REDUCE THAT BACK WE CAN GO FURTHER I DON'T THINK THERE IS A NUMBER THAT UH IT'S SPECIFIC UH ON ON WHERE WE GO I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT WHAT IS THE PLAN TO DELEVERAGE AND OF COURSE THE PLAN TO DELEVERAGE COULD INCLUDE UH THE ISSUE OF STOCK AND THAT'S WHY PILGRIM'S AS A PUBLIC TRADED COMPANY HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE STOCK AS A CURRENCY NOT TO INCREASE THE LEVERAGE UH TO POINTS UH WHERE WE DON'T THINK IT IS PRUDENT IN THE CASE OF A SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITION THAT WILL BE TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR THE COMPANY IN TERMS OF- OKAY AND JUST ONE LAST ONE NOW IN TERMS S- SORRY IN TERMS OF M&A YES WE ARE SEEING MORE TARGETS OF COURSE THE THE WHOLE SITUATION ABOUT TRAVELING HAS UH UH CREATED SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF UH SEEING AND VISITING ASSETS BUT UH WE ARE SEEING UH SOME TARGETS THAT ARE STILL UH VERY UH INTERESTING TO US AND COULD CREATE A LOT OF VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS OKAY GREAT AND THEN JUST IN THE EVENT THAT JBS IS ABLE TO LIST THE US BUSINESS WOULD THAT CAUSE ANY NEED FOR A CHANGE IN YOUR STRUCTURE YEAH WE DON'T BELIEVE SO I THINK JBS HAS UH SAID MANY TIMES THAT THEY THEY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT UM PILGRIM'S TO BE A PUBLIC TRADED COMPANY AND AND JUST AS I MENTIONED IT IS A GREAT WAY FOR US TO UH KEEP OUR GROWTH WE CAN USE UH THE EQUITY AS A CURRENCY IN THE CASE OF A VERY IMPORTANT UH AND TRANSFORMATIONAL EVENT FOR PILGRIM'S OKAY THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR AND ONE ON YOUR PHONE

We are continuously adapting our global operations to the change in channel demand while adjusting our operations to be able to maintain the operations at all our plants and minimize any significant disruption due to labor and health issues. We remain diligent in implementing precautionary, proactive steps to better safeguard the wellness and health of each team member while fulfilling our sacred duty as a food producer to consumers in every region where we operate. We incur direct COVID 19 mitigation costs of roughly twenty seven million for the quarter and close to seventy seven million year to date. The direct costs are related to the extra cleaning of our production and common areas, the extra PPE including masks and face shields that we are providing to all of our team members and the installation of physical barriers in our production areas. We also install biotechnology UV and bi polar ionization in every plant to filter The air and neutralize potential viruses. We are offering free light health online services that allow for virtual doctor visits at no cost. And above all cdc guidelines, we remove vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks. These figures include indirect costs that are more. There are a lot of indirect costs that are more difficult to precisely quantify, such as overall disruptions to our operations, less optimal mix. In the production of efficiencies that are not included in these numbers. Also, we are supporting communities with our home strong initiative. It is an example of how we value the important role we play in the communities where our team members live and work. We understand the responsibility that comes with being a major employer in rural communities and we work hard to contribute to the well-being of those communities by not only providing gainful employment opportunities but also participating in voluntary activities. DONATION AND SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. THIS QUARTER WE ACQUIRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN S G N A FOR THIS INITIATIVE. TURN TO THE SPECIFICS OF OUR BUSINESS. DESPITE CONTINUING VOLATILITY IN CHALLENGING MARKET ENVIRONMENTS IN Q 3 AND ADDED OPERATING COSTS WE HAVE CONTINUED TO GENERATE A SUPERIOR RELATIVE PERFORMANCE TO THE COMPETITION AND HAVE REMAINED RESILIENT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. THIS IS THE REFLECT AND A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON KEY CUSTOMERS FOR THE FULL QUARTER OPERATING PERFORMANCE BOTH IN U S AND MEXICO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SEQUENTIALLY AND EUROPE ALSO CONTINUED TO INCREASE DESPITE THE CHALLENGES DUE TO COVID NINETEEN IN Q2 THREE WE SAW MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO RECOVER ACROSS ALL OF OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS WITH THE U S AND PARTICULARLY MEXICO EXPERIENCING THE STRONGEST REBOUND IN PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO WEAK CONDITIONS D Especially when taking into account all the disruptions, less than optimal product mix, and added operating costs when compared to the environment in two thousand and nineteen. Despite continued challenges in global market conditions due to COVID nineteen, our consolidated results have also remained well-balanced. The result of our vision to become the best and most respected company, creating the opportunity of a better future for our team members. To support our vision, we are continuing to implement our strategy of developing a unique portfolio of diverse complementary products. Business models continue to relentlessly pursue operational excellence, becoming a more valuable partner with key customers and creating an invaluable environment for safe people, safe products, and healthy attitudes. While market conditions in all our global operations are continued to improve during the quarter, food service demand globally still has not reached prior levels and the environments are still quite challenging in some sectors where we operate. Disruptions from COVID-19 have continued to persist. We present a significant challenge on each individual country's demand for protein consumption as well as for the flow of global trade and generate volatility far beyond normal seasonal factors. We will maintain our strategy while continuing to improve the portfolio to better respond to individual market dynamics and generate a relatively increasing performance over our peers. We believe this approach will give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to long-term and minimize the full picks and troughs of the commodity. During the third quarter in the U.S., we continue to see demand recovering at our fresh operations, including from some sectors within food service with more states gradually losing travel and movement restrictions. QSR volume has been especially strong and the demand from our customers has been outperforming the industry. Similar to last quarter, commodity large dried beef was again the most challenged commodity during Q3, operationally. However, we continue to improve our relative performance versus the industry across all business units. We are continuing to adapt to the shipping channel demand by increasing our volume mix to key customer retailers. In addition, a large portion of our foodservice customers are also within the qsr segment which has further dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models. Our portfolio of differentiated products along with our key customer model are giving us better insulation against the volatility. WE ARE ALSO MUCH BETTER POSITIONED TO ADJUST PRODUCTS AND CHANNEL MIX GIVING OUR PRESENCE ACROSS ALL BIRD SIZES FROM SMALL TO LARGE WITHIN THE SMALL BIRD AND CASE READY SEGMENTS MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND WAS AGAIN VERY WELL BALANCED DURING Q2 DEMAND FROM RETAILERS SPECIALLY FROM OUR KEY CUSTOMERS WAS STRONG SUPPORTING THE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF OUR CASE READY BUSINESS OUR MARKET LEADERSHIP IN THESE CATEGORIES AND MORE DIFFER ADVENTURES VERSUS THE INDUSTRY WHILE WE COMMIT MENT TO OUR KEY CUSTOMERS STRATEGY HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE CONSISTENCY OF OUR PAST RESULTS. THE VALUE OF THIS APPROACH HAS NEVER BEEN MORE RELEVANT TO OUR GROWTH THAN DURING THE CURRENT TIMES OF GREAT UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF KEY CUSTOMERS WE ARE DOUBLING OUR CASE READY CAPACITY AT OUR PLANT IN MINNESOTA BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HANDS PROCESSE With this addition, we also expect to increase by twenty percent our production of our differentiated higher attribute just bear brand products. It is also supported our conversion of one plant from the commoditized large bird deboning to a key customer ksr in the small bird segment. The stronger relationships we have with the key customers are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase since this customer rely on us to satisfy their need for growth. In addition, many of our products are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase since this customer rely on us to satisfy their need for growth. In addition, many of our products are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase since this customer rely on us to satisfy their need for growth. In addition, many of our products are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase since this customer rely on us to Customers maintain a leadership position in their respective categories. As a result, we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition. Beyond driving pure growth, our key customer strategy also promotes trust, enhances long-term relationships, and strengthens our margin structure. In the U.S. prepared foods business, revenue declined twenty-three percent, on twenty-six percent less volume year over year. A large part of this decrease was driven. BY SCHOOLS REMAINING CLOSED PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRENGTH IN RETAIL DEMAND ON THE OTHER HAND OUR MARGINS FROM SALES HAVE IMPROVED TWENTY NINE PERCENT DRIVEN BY MORE FAVORABLE PRICES AND MIX WE CONTINUE TO SIMPLIFY OUR PORTFOLIO TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES AND SHIP RESOURCES TOWARDS BRANDED GROWTH IN THE RETAIL CHANNEL OUR PILGRIM'S BRAND SALES GREW FIFTY TWO PERCENT IN OUR JUST BEAR BRAND GAINED I'm sorry, but I am unable to recognize the verbal communication and transcribe it into text. Can you please provide more context or clarify your request? During October, our sales were up by 47% and our inventories were reduced by 25%. US poultry exports, including broilers, were up by 497% year over year throughout August. Turkey meat alone was up by 3%. In contrast, our exports have increased by 40% year over year outpacing the market. China continues to be a significant growth driver, and we believe the impact of ASF in Southeast Asia has now passed. Germany can provide further support to export demands. As you approach the one year anniversary of China reopening to US poultry, producers are presented with a vastly different market landscape than a year ago. China has solidified itself as one of the largest export destinations for poultry, second only to Mexico. China's present as a significant buyer keeps the diversification of our export portfolio a high priority. We have added ninety-five new direct clients in 2020. Twenty twenty and have also continued to diversify our products and destination mix sales of non traditional export items are up thirty percent year over year which strengthens the cut out margin we enter two for with optimum as we continue to place commodity items efficiently leverage piggyback overall portfolio diversity and prioritize exceptional customer service to meet the needs of our key customers around the world after a very challenging first half in twenty twenty our mexican operations We deliver great results in Q3 and we recorded one of the strongest Q3 in the company's history despite the unfavorable mix impacted and added operation costs relative to the same period last year. More normalized economic activities, an improved supply demand balance in the market, our increased share of no commodity products, and our very good operational performance all contribute to the results. Although overall demand is improving, we remain agile and are continuing to adapt. Facilities by shifting production to those channels that are experienced better relative demand. Preparations in Mexico explain some challenges, especially in the value categories due to less traffic on retail combined with a contraction in the csr volume. But we began to see some signs of improvements towards the end of the quarter and we believe the positive trend can be sustained into q4. We remain committed to long-term growth and demand prospects in mexico where we continue to invest in aldila and premium filgermount brand both. Fresh and in-prepared as well as seeing King Moore market share in the modern channel which would bring more stable margins to our operations. Our European chicken operations deliver an EBIT in Q3 that was thirty percent sequentially above Q2 with both volumes and revenue seven percent and eighteen percent higher respectively. Supported by our exposure to retail and the continuous recovering food service and KSR demand in particular relative to Q3 of two thousand and nineteen. The introduction of UK government incentives directed towards food service as well as a consistent improvement in food service demand within continental Europe have all contributed to a better sequentially improved performance versus the prior quarter. Even during this challenging time, we continue to be relentless in investing in innovation. DELIVERING LABOR AND NEW IMPROVEMENTS DRIVING BETTER EFFICIENCIES MANAGING OUR COST BASE AND OFFSETTING COST INCREASES TO LEAN MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AROUND AUTOMATION AND PROCESS LOOP WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS WHICH REMAINS A PRIORITY WE ARE COMMITTED TO DELIVERING THE SAFEST WORK ENVIRONMENT POSSIBLE IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS WHILE ACHIEV The industry measures the results of the last twelve months and continues to show us improving and outpacing the average of the competition in Europe. For the next quarter, we expect further improvements coming from the food service and ksr segments. As these segments adapt to the situation in each country, they will remain vigilant and prepared to react and adapt in case market conditions change. The performance of our newly acquired European pork operations have continued to improve, with Iberica on an upward momentum. We have now been profitable on an annual basis for the last six quarters in a row with margins also increasing on a consistent basis. The improvement in performance was driven by robust demand at retail, partially offset by reduction in food service. Continued strength in pork exports, especially to China, as well as the implementation of operational improvements and capture of synergies. Exports to China remain strong and are up 100 percent year-over-year. AND WE EXPECT DEMAND FROM CHINA TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE AND STRENGTHEN THE GROWTH OF OVERALL EXPORTS IN THE NEW FUTURE. ALL OF OUR EUROPEAN FRESH POTATO FACILITIES ARE APPROVED TO EXPORT FROM CHINA, SO WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO BENEFIT FROM THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE IN OUR STRATEGY AND WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR VOLUMES WITH A NEW KEY CUSTOMER IN THE NEXT QUARTERS. INTEGRATION OF THE ASSETS IS ON TRACK TO EXPECT We have enhanced our improvements to achieve a level that is competitive with leading companies with similar portfolios. We have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired European assets through some recent wins to increase our retail exposure and strengthen our partnership with key customers. We are optimistic about building upon our operation improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint, extract best-in-class operational excellence, capitalize export opportunities, and improve our supply chain. Optimize the portfolio of channels, segments and products as well as strengthening our growth business with key customers to drive innovation, value added and higher margin areas. We have a great team in Europe dedicated to generating the best possible relative results by focusing on factors within our control while ensuring the safety and health of our team members. Corn prices have been rising since August driven higher by a combination of stronger than expected export demand. And smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the U.S. USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at two point seventeen billion bushels versus one point ninety nine billion last year, which includes a five hundred and fifty million bushel increase in export demand. The current corn crop is projected at fourteen point seven billion bushels, the highest in four years and over one billion bushels larger than last year, although corn prices have risen from the lows we saw in August. Prices are very similar to where they were this time last year soybean meal prices have also risen since August, driven higher by larger than expected export demands, primarily to China. The USDA is projecting the current soybean crop at four point three billion bushels, up over seven hundred million from last year. Despite the large increase in production, the USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at two hundred and ninety million bushels, the lowest level in four years. There is uncertainty over this. The science of the Chinese import program is causing increasing uncertainty and volatility in the wheat seeds market globally. Wheat prices in Europe have also risen recently despite the larger than expected Russian wheat crop and projected increased supply in other major wheat exporters like Australia. A slow start to the planting season in Russia and larger than expected export demand out of the US are contributing to the rise in wheat prices in the wheat market. According to the USDA, the chicken production is also a factor. The industry was down half a percent relative to Q3 2019 as increased live weights did not offset head count reductions. The industry continues to maintain a larger layer flock with current levels four point four percent above last year in line with the trends observed in Q1 2019. The industry has also managed to reduce the average age of laying hens promoting a younger, more efficient breeding stock. This has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to supply eggs in the short term while enabling growth. In the long term as the demand environment improves overall the trend has shown a slowing of pulley placement growth which is in line with expectations given that most of the pulley placement increases in two thousand and nineteen and early to twenty twenty were expected to be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period from two to two to two nineteen related restrictions have slowly been rolled back with many businesses and restaurants opening under modified environment To protect worker and consumer health throughout this process, consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal and have continued to modify their shopping and spending habits in response to the new normal environment. This new consumer environment favors the retail channel as many consumers are still required to work from home and choosing to limit exposure to potentially more crowded areas. As a result, retail demands for chicken like that of all proteins have remained supported throughout the quarter. WHILE FOOD SERVICES DEMANDS TWO TRAILS BELOW YEARS AGO LEVEL, THIS CHANNEL HAS PROVEN HIGHLY ADAPTABLE AND CONTINUES TO IMPROVE EACH MONTH FROM THE LOW POINTS IN APRIL LED BY THE T V S R SEGMENTS ENTERING TWO FOUR THE USDA EXPECT PRODUCTION TO BE FLAT FOR THE QUARTER ON AN YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS BEFORE ENTERING TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN WHICH THE USDA EXPECT BOILER PLANT PRODUCTION TO GROW POINT NINE PERCENT VERSUS TWENTY T Contribute to a fluid macro environment and the fallout effects of covid nineteen will be packed to the channels differently. We expect the restriction of restaurant capacities, social distancing guidelines, consumer concern for individual health and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations to continue favoring the increased frequency of at home meals. Since chicken continues to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins, retail demand is likely to remain high. Above year ago levels when we expect overall food supply demand to remain more volatile and remain below year ago levels at least in the near term KSR's ability to adapt quickly to the new environment in a positive sign for the chicken industry moving from late twenty twenty to twenty twenty one our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions while minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions We are already well balanced in terms of our bird's eye exposure. We will remain diligent in seeking opportunities to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers while optimizing our existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets. Our key customer approach is strategic and creates a basis for further accelerated growth in important categories by promoting more customized, high quality, innovative products. Gives us a clear long-term sustained competitive advantage while further improving the resilience to market fluctuations. With that, let's move on to two additional details to our financials. Our R&G in the fourth quarter was higher versus a year ago as we improve the efficiencies of our expenses but increase support for expanding the Just Bear brand nationally and the investment for our new prepared foods products both in the U S and Mexico as well as the inclusion of the new assets in Europe. The speaker is announcing the contribution of 15 million dollars to the HomeTown Strong Initiative and the Department of Justice Agreement. They will continue to prioritize their capital spending plan this year to optimize their product mix, which aims to improve their ability to supply innovative, less commoditized products and strengthen partnerships with key customers, even during uncertain times. They will also continue to evaluate all CAPEX projects and defer those that are not essential. Investing in strong return on capital employed projects that improve our operational efficiencies and tailor customer needs to further solidify competitive advantages for pillars. Our balance sheet continues to be robust, given our relentless emphasis on cash-flow-positive operating activities, focus on management of working capital, and disciplined investment in high-return projects. Our unique position remains very strong, with more than one point three billion dollars in total cash and availabilities. We have no short-term imminent cash requirements. WITH OUR BONDS MATURING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND OUR TERM BONDS MATURING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE DURING THE QUARTER OUR NET DEPTH WAS ONE POINT NINE BILLION THE LOWEST SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF TWO POINT FIVE TIMES LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS IBIDA OUR LEVERAGE REMAINS AT A MANAGEABLE LEVEL AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS THIS Y We have a strong balance sheet and a leverage that is within our target which are supported for us to act on great opportunities during these uncertain times. We will remain focused on exercising great care in ensuring that we create shareholder value by optimizing our capital structure while preserving the flexibility to pursue a growth strategy. We will continue to consider and evaluate all relevant capital allocation strategies that will match the pursuit of our growth strategy and continue to review each prospect accordingly. Too many requests in 1 hour. Try again later. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Could you please rephrase your question or statement? How is your current level of absenteeism at work? How has that evolved in recent weeks, considering the continuously high number of cases in the US? And also, if you can provide a some of a kind of a rough rate of protective measures related to COVID-19 during the quarter and what do you see going forward? Thanks. Yeah, thank you, and good morning. First, as we face this global coronavirus pandemic, we have been guided by three principles. First, an uncompromising commitment to the safety of our team members. Second, recognizing and embracing our responsibility to provide quality food for the country. And of course, in endeavoring to provide continuous employment opportunities and benefits to our team members during a time of unprecedented economic upheaval. So the direct costs that we are are related to the extra cleaning and in our production in common areas. We also provide the ppe including the masks and face shields to all of our team members. We install physical barriers in our production area, and of course, we are maintaining social distancing whenever wherever possible. We do more than ten thousand barriers within the first thirty days of the pandemic, and we continue to upgrade those barriers. We also install the dual technology UV and biocidal ionization in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses. As I mentioned, we are offering free life health online. Services for all of our team members that allow for virtual doctor visits at zero cost. And above all, our fiduciary guidelines remove the vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks. And that is creating some challenges to our operations because by removing those people we have less people at our plants. The situation is very fluid it varies from plant to plant but over the last year. Months, we have increased our staffing to close to the levels that we were before COVID. So we are already running a much better mix that we were during the Q2 and we are seeing a very good increase in our absenteeism levels as people are more familiar with what we are doing as we are gaining the trust of the entire communities. People are less We are reluctant to return to work and with that we have been improving our ability to execute the optimal mix. Of course, we are also working with our key customers to simplify our mix to create a more optimal footprint. And with the footprint communication with them, we are ensuring there are no team members. We expect to return to the optimal operation in this quarter. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW AS YOU ADJUST YOUR YOUR PRODUCT MIXES DICK AND WE ARE WELL BALANCED BETWEEN SMALL BIRDS TRIPECK AND LARGE BIRD BONING WHAT WE ARE DOING IS AS THE DEMAND HAS BEEN SHIFTING TO MORE RETAIL WE'VE BEEN SHIFTING OUR OPERATIONS ALSO WITH THE GROWTH OF K S R WE HAVE ALSO ADAPTED TO THOSE CONDITIONS WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS TO FIRST MOVE THAT PLANT From big bardy bardy to small bardy bardy, which will increase our presence in that segment. We are also doubling the capacity in our minnesota plant to comply with comply or support the growth of our key customers and our just fair brand, which has doubled the sales in the online channel over the last quarter. Looking into overall portfolio we move from forty six percent of our stock. TOTAL SALES IN RETAIL TO AROUND FIFTY ONE PERCENT JUST IN TWENTY TWENTY WITH SMALL CHANGES IN OUR OPERATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR WE EXPECT TWO PERCENT INCREASE IN THAT PORTFOLIO TO THE RETAIL AND A ONE TO TWO PERCENT INCREASE IN THE SMALL BUSINESS WITH THOSE TWO CONVERSIONS MY NEXT QUESTION IS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE MEXICAN MARGINS YOU PARTICULARLY I DID SEE THAT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A FX B How do you think about the Mexican operation? I think you did say that it's going to still continue the momentum into the fourth quarter. And how do you think about it for two thousand and twenty one? How do we frame it in our minds? Yeah, sure, Ken. And we've been talking about Mexico over the last years that they are very volatile, quarter over quarter, but they are more stable if you take a longer period of time or within a year what happened in the first quarter or the first semester in Mexico was a complete ambush. BALANCE DURING SUPPLY AND DEMAND. SO THE INDUSTRY INCREASED SUPPLY DURING THE FIRST SEMESTER AND AT THE SAME TIME DEMAND BECAUSE OF THE COVID NINETEEN REALLY CREATED A CHALLENGED ENVIRONMENT. AS YOU REMEMBER IN MEXICO THERE WAS NO SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE COVID NINETEEN LIKE WE HAD IN US AND EUROPE THERE WAS NO GOVERNMENTAL STIMULUS OR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. WHICH CREATED A SHARP SLOW DOWN AND REFLECTION The speaker begins by discussing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food service and retail industries in the United States. He notes that the pandemic has had a significant impact on these industries, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat.\n\nThe speaker then discusses the impact of the pandemic on the food service and retail industries in Mexico. He notes that the pandemic has had a similar impact on these industries in Mexico, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat.\n\nFinally, the speaker discusses the impact of the pandemic on the food service and retail industries globally. He notes that the pandemic has had a significant impact on these industries globally, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat.\n\nOverall, the speaker suggests that the pandemic has had a significant impact WELL WE REDUCE OUR COSTS AND WE ALSO CUT PRODUCTION THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND IMPROVED A LOT AND WE SAW THE REBOUND IN THE FOOD SERVICE AND DEMAND IN Q3 AND NOW WE HAVE VERY STABLE PRICES DURING THIS TIME IN MEXICO WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE DURING Q4 Q4 HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRONGER QUARTER FOR MEXICO WITH THE FESTIVITIES WE DON'T KNOW AT WHICH POINT THAT WILL BE REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE Covid restrictions we've seen some increase in cases in mexico so there could be some more restrictions in the qu four but given the supply and demand situation that we are right now the results are are sustainable now for qu one we expect the industry to increase production to adequate supply and demand and the return to more normal levels mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again but we expect TO BE VERY STABLE YEAR OVER YEAR. OF COURSE OUR STRATEGY IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE GROWTH TO INCREASE THE HIGHER MARGIN DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AS WELL. WE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF IMPACT IN THE PREPARED FOODS ESPECIALLY ON THE MORE AFFORDABLE PRODUCTS DURING IYO. BUT WE CONTINUED TO INVEST AND THE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS CONTINUED TO SELL REALLY WELL. LONG TERM, DESPITE THE VOLATILITY, MEXICO IS A GROWING ECONOMY AND Significant growth in protein consumption. Great, I really appreciate that answer. Thank you, Kevin. The next question is from Benvenuti with Siemens Healthcare. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I want to ask, you touched on in your opening comments with ASF and China and Germany. I would like to ask, you know, you touched on in your opening comments with ASF and China and Germany. I would like to ask, you know, you touched on in your opening comments with ASF and China and Germany. I would like to ask, you know, you touched on in your opening comments with ASF and China and Germany. I would like to ask, you know, you touched on in your opening comments with ASF and China and Germany. I would like to ask, you know, you touched on in your opening comments with ASF and Curious on what you're seeing in that business, both as it relates to the impact on the domestic market and then an uptick in potential demand from that market as well and how you think you're positioned to capture that benefit. Yeah, thank you, Ben. The operations in Europe are more focused on the retail. So we produce most of our products in the UK for the retail UK market. And because of the high welfare, we command a premium in that region. The big competition as you're aware, is Tesco. The big competition as you're aware, is Tesco. The big competition as you're aware, is Tesco. The big competition as you're aware, is Tesco. The big competition as you're aware, is Tesco. The big competition as you It is on the food service sector of imported products from Poland and Germany mainly and Spain on the pork side. The Germans have these issues with their production and because of the ban in China, it actually increases the sales in the UK market. So what we saw is that on the food service sector of imported products from Poland and Germany mainly and Spain on the pork side. The Germans have these issues with their production and because of the ban in China, it actually increases the sales in the UK market. So what we saw is that on the food service sector of imported products from Poland and Germany mainly and Spain on the pork side. The Germans have these issues with their production and because of the ban in China, it actually increases the sales in the UK market. So what we saw is that on the food service sector of imported products from Poland and Germany mainly and Spain on the What we call fifth quarter products have a significant increase in pricing. But on the normal products like loins and others, we see the prices more stable because it's a zero sum game at the end of the day. So it increases the opportunity to china, so that was a welcome. I think our sales have, like we mentioned, have doubled in the last two quarters and we're seeing some very stable pricing. But it also increases the competition in the food industry. SERVICE SEGMENTS IN U K GREAT MY SECOND QUESTION IS RELATED TO GRAIN AND APOLOGIES IF I MISSED YOUR OPENING COMMENT I DID HEAR YOUR OVERVIEW OF THE MARKET COULD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOUR POSITIONED RELATIVE TO THE MARKET YOU KNOW ARE YOU MORE HAND MOUTH AT THE MOMENT DO YOU HAVE ANY BASIS SECURED ANY COLOR YOU COULD OFFER THERE ON HOW YOUR POSITIONED YOU KNOW THROUGH THE BALANCE OF FOURTH QUARTER AND INTO NEXT YEAR WOULD Question: Obviously we've seen prices of corn and soybeans increase in the last few months which has been which has been the result of a few factors for corn we've seen a reduction from the supply side with usda reporting six million fewer planted acres than they originally estimated back in march well as to our final stocks for twenty nineteen end up being two hundred million bushels less than was expected when the final counting was done on the current crop we actually for the acres of a planet see pretty good yields above trendline yields so it's not an issue on the current crop we actually for the acres of a planet see pretty good yields above trendline yields so it's not an issue on the current crop we actually for the acres of a planet see pretty good yields above trendline yields so it's not an issue on the current On the supply side, in terms of U.S. production, but on the demand side, we've also seen much bigger export demand, primarily driven by China. Still, the USDA is projecting a carryout of around two point one billion bushels, and that includes a thirty percent increase in export demand from last year. So even if export demand ends up higher than what the USDA is projecting, corn stocks should still be in line with previous years. On soybeans, the USDA is projecting a two hundred and ninety million million bushel carryout, which would be the lowest carryout in five years. However, that includes a thirty one percent increase in export demand driven by China. In addition, an increase in export demand, Argentina, which is one of the world's largest soybean exporting countries, is in the midst of a historic economic crisis, which is causing farmers there to hold back available supplies from the market, adding more pressure to the US to meet this demand. We believe the market is likely to feel anxious about U.S. soybean supplies until there's a resolution to this currency situation in Argentina.

Please go ahead. Yeah, hi, good morning. I just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of, you know, the move, I guess, into retail. And, you know, some of that big bird product. Is that being chopped up and put into trays? And how, you know, is that impacting, you know, some of the margins on the commodity business? The Big Birds especially during promotional seasonality during the summer that from the Big Birds end up being put in a tray to be sold in the retailers. We continue to do that. I think the challenge to the industry is that we need to have the labor available and the facilities available to do more of that. And that's why the industry has not increased more the production to the trade pack as we want. As the demand continues to grow, it's also because of that that we are increasing the capacity in our Minnesota plant. So, as of today, yes, we are buying big beef meat and we continue to put it on a tray, especially during Saturdays. And I think the whole industry is doing that. Okay, great. And then my second question is, you know, just looking at the, you mentioned that your absenteeism rates are starting to go down and you're starting to get back to your normal mix. In terms of some of the The Deboned Dark Meat Do You Do You Are You Starting To Return That To Historical Levels And What Could That Mean For The Leg Quarter Prices Which Have Been Seeing You Know The Most Pressure Can Not Help Or Is The Fact That China Is Taking More Pork Can Not Help With Leg Quarter Prices That Are Why Have Leg Quarter Prices Moved If There's More Deboned Dark Meat Potentially Being Produced And You Know It Seems Like You Know At The Very Least China Is Taking More U S Pork Yes You're Right Mike Because of the absenteeism and also the food service industry in U.S. the industry produce three percent more lag quarters in July and August than the same period last year despite a lower total production. That put a lot of pressure in the lag quarters pricing as we are seeing more the reopening of the food service and as we are seeing the absenteeism and the staffing of our plants increasing for us and for the whole industry. WE ARE SEEING MORE DEBONING WE ARE ALREADY AT LEVELS COMPARABLE TO LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF DEBONING WHICH WILL REDUCE THE PRESSURE IN THE LAG QUARTERS OF COURSE CHINA HAS BEEN ALSO MORE ACTIVE IN THE LAG QUARTER MARKET OVER THE LAST MONTH AND WE ARE SEEING THAT IN THE LAG QUARTER INVENTORY THAT WAS UP ON A SEQUENTIAL BASIS UP TO AUGUST BUT WE ARE SEEING A REDUCTION AND ALSO THE INVENTORY TODAY IS DOWN NINE PERCENT Compared to the peak q one average that we have, so those two factors can contribute to the reduction in the light crude production, which is a commodity item as we mentioned. And the china interest, i think we saw over the last weeks, although not today, the increase in the oil prices and the reduction in the dollar, which increased the availability of dollars from the gulf. Developing countries which also increases the demand for labor quarters. So what could help on the labor quarters going forward? It's both on supply and demand. On the supply, it's exactly what you said. Last, labor quarters because of the improvement in labor efficiencies and the more sales in the domestic market on the food service and on demand because of low prices and because of more available income in the developing economies. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? But you know with with commodity big bird remaining you know in a cut out value you have here remaining under such pressure just at what point does it make sense to start talking about converting another plant whether that's to retail or or to small bird because it just it just seems like that big bird portion is is not going to improve without more capacity either being converted or taken out of the market you know in some capacity sure thank you peter i think the decision to The plan is a more long-term decision and we always make those decisions combined with our key customer strategy. As we see the demand of these key customers growing, we take action in our portfolio. And that makes a lot of sense for us to do that conversion right now from that operation from big bird to small bird to support this growth. I think again, you need to look into a more broader long-term perspective. If we continue to expect the food service sector to rebound, if we look at the food service sector today, the full service restaurants are down thirty percent year over year, and that is impacting the big party bannings, for sure. While the casual dining are up nine percent. As we go to more normal operations, as we see maybe the development of vaccines, we don't know when that's going to happen or we see more openings of the restaurants. We expect the food service sector to rebound. FOOD SERVICE RESTAURANTS SPECIALLY ON THE FULL SERVICE TO REGAIN SOME MARKET SHARE THAT THEY ARE NOT OPERATING TODAY. SO I THINK IT'S A LONG TERM DECISION AND IT'S ALSO A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TO MOVE FROM BIG BIRD TO A SMALLER BIRD BECAUSE WE HAVE THE GROWERS AND WE HAVE THE FEED MILLS. IT'S ALL BUILT TO THAT SPECIFIC BIRD. OUR PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE REALLY CUSTOMIZED TO THAT SPECIFIC BIRD. That specific segment. So any conversion it really requires significant capital and requires some significant changes in the overall supply chain. Both starting from the growers, your feed mills and your field operations. So it's a high capital investment that needs to be supported in the long run. So that's why we don't see a lot of conversions in our industry. Of course, it's this The situation continues for a longer period of time, you can see some convergences. I think it's also important to know that some other players don't have the key customer relationships that we have. And moving from the big bird to the small bird or to the cash ready requires a customer and a key customer to support. And since they don't have those relationships, it's harder for them to do some convergences. I got it, that's helpful. And then maybe just to follow up, you know, given where the balance sheet is now, and something you talked about in your prepared remarks, you know, how should we think about emn a potential, maybe from a geographic perspective, or does it make sense to get bigger in pork in Europe and going into twenty twenty one? Just any help there. And then, and then maybe you can also comment on any updates on your cfo search. Thanks very much. Sure. In terms of strategy, i think our strategy continues the same and our growth strategy continues intact. and as we mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet. we're looking into increasing our prepared foods operation and our branded operation to create a more balanced portfolio. and we're also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more value from operational efficiencies. we're seeing targets both in the u. s. and outside the u. s. geographically. Diversification and growth in Europe and we will evaluate all alternatives to our value creation standards. In terms of the CFO, we are in the process of finding another CFO. We already engage recruiting firms and it should have some news in the near future. Great, thanks very much, guys. The next question is from Adam Samuelsone with Gorman Science Co. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Adam. So, to maybe first, just a clarification or a little more detail on the expansion of the Minnesota plant for Case Ready and the conversion of the Texas plant to Small Bite from Big Bite. What's the net impact on your production volume and what's the capital cost? For those projects? Yeah, in terms of total volume, I think we should be just a little bit up. We expect to be to grow in line with usda expectations and the industry for twenty twenty one, which is a little bit lower than one percent. As we have more birds in minnesota, but we will also reduce the weights in our operation on the big bird that we are transforming into a small bird. So we expect to be for twenty twenty one. ONE IN LINE WITH THOSE TWO. IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS IT IS NOT A VERY SIGNIFICANT TO OUR TOTAL CAPEX AS THE CONVERSION OF THE SMALLER PLANT IT IS NOT IT IS A SIMPLER CONVERSION OF COURSE THAT K S R REQUIRES SOME DIASPORA EQUIPMENT AND SOME MARINATION EQUIPMENT AND WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN AUTOMATION IN THAT PLANT AS WELL. TODAY IS A MANUAL EBONING OPERATION. Invest in the auto-automated debt buying. So the investment is close to twenty to twenty-five million dollars in that operation and in the case of the case-value operation is close to seventy million dollars. So overall it is a total of a hundred million dollars that we're going to invest in those two convergences. Okay, that's a top-of-the-line car. And then the follow-up was I just make sure I heard something right. You talked about the prepared food business. In the US, declining 26% I think is what I heard. And maybe hoping to expand on that, that's a business that I think has had more challenges over the years and just is, is it really just a question of return to school and in food service traffic or how do we think about that business or a margin profile moving forward? Yeah, then that's exactly it. We in our prepared food business have a strong brand which is the pierce brand. MAINTAINING A FOOD SERVICE BRAND WE ALSO ARE VERY STRONG IN THE SCHOOL WITH OUR GOLD KISS BRAND BOTH THOSE SEGMENTS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY THE COVID NINETEEN THE NON-COMMERCIAL FOOD SERVICE THAT INCLUDES SCHOOLS WERE DOWN SIXTY SIX PERCENT AT Q2 AND NOW THEY ARE DOWN FORTY THREE PERCENT WE ARE SEEING SOME SCHOOL REOPENS WHICH COULD HELP BUT IT IS A SEGMENT THAT IS STILL DOWN FORTY PERC On what we call the commercial food service, which is a street business where our Pier 1 brand is a leading brand in Wings and in Chunks, we saw that in Q2 they end up thirty six percent lower than the prior year, but they're rebounding and then today they are close to four percent lower than the same period last year. So the food service business has been recovering and with that our Pier 1 brand has recovered. AND OUR VOLUMES BUT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS STILL CLOSE TO FORTY PERCENT LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE INVESTING IN MORE RETAIL BRANDED BUSINESS AS WE MENTIONED OUR PILOTS BRAND HAS INCREASED MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING THE JUST BARE BRAND FROM THE FRESH CATEGORY WHICH IS BEING VERY SUCCESSFUL ON THE ONLINE SEGMENT AND ALSO ON THE HIGHER ATTRIBUTE SEGMENT Male Speaker 1: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nFemale Speaker 2: The next question comes from Karla Casella with T.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMale Speaker 3: Hi, my questions regarding your leverages, the three times target, how comfortable or how high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional M&A? Do you see any more M&A opportunities as a result of the volatility in worldwide protein markets? Yes, Carol, we set this target of two to three times because it's the best capital structure that can protect and reduce our interest payments while not creating any any any problem for our bonds and for our leverage. The two to three times is in normal operation. Of course, during some acquisition, if we have a great plan on how to reduce that back, we can go further. I don't think there is a number that it's specific or on where we go. I think it's more about what is the plan to be leveraged. And of course, the plan to be leveraged could include the issue of stock. And that's why, as a publicly traded company, we have that opportunity to use the stock as a currency. Increase the leverage to two points where we don't think it is prudent in the case of a significant acquisition that will be transformational for the company. Okay, and just one last point. No, in terms of M and A, yes, we are seeing more targets. Of course, the whole situation about traveling has created some challenges in terms of seeing and visiting assets, but we are seeing some targets that are still very AH, INTERESTING TO US AND COULD CREATE A LOT OF VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS. OH, KAY, GREAT. AND JUST IN THE EVENT THAT JB S IS ABLE TO LIST THE U S BANKRUPTCY WOULD THAT CAUSE ANY NEED FOR A CHANGE IN YOUR STRUCTURE? YEAH, WE DON'T THINK SO. I THINK JB S HAS SAID MANY TIMES THAT THEREY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A PUBLIC TRADED COMPANY AND JUST AS I HAVE MENTIONED IT IS A GREAT WAY FOR US TO KEEP O I can use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important and transformational event for peers. Okay, thank you. Once again, if you have a question, please press star and one on your telephone. Gentlemen, there are no more questions registered at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Fabio Andriani for closing remarks. Well, thank you all. We would like to reiterate our continued commitment to our valued team members to provide them with a safe and healthy work environment while supporting our duty to maintain food production and supply to customers. We are looking forward to closing twenty twenty with good results in spite of the volatility. Our diverse portfolio of differentiated products is tailored to support our key customer strategy in conjunction with our broad geographic footprint. Consistent performance and minimizing margin volatility in challenging market conditions relative to competitors. We will continue to seek new growth potential both organically and through acquisitions while offering even more differentiated products within our business to support key customer needs by cultivating a culture of constant innovation. We would like to thank everyone in the pigments family including our family farm partners, suppliers, and our customers who make our business possible. As always, we appreciate your interest.

DELIVER ANNUAL THROUGHPUT AND COST OUT TARGETS FNES SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS 14.8 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED TO 7.4 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPROVEMENTS IN E-ONE JUST MENTIONED AND THE ACQUISITION OF SPARTAN ER AMBULANCE EBITDA WAS RELATIVELY FLAT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DESPITE THE DECREASE IN SALES DUE TO PRODUCT PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT INCREASED MARGINS MOST NOTABLY AT OUR LARGEST MANUFACTURING LOCATION IN ORLANDO SPARTAN CONTRIBUTED FOUR MILLION ADJUSTED EBITDA TO THE FNE SEGMENT WITHIN THE QUARTER WHICH COMPLETES THREE QUARTERS OF INTEGRATION THAT EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS THE ADDITION OF THIS WORLD-CLASS CHASSIS MANUFACTURING BUSINESS PROVIDES A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE THAT WILL BE LEVERAGED ACROSS OUR FIRE BUSINESSES AND BRANDS CREATING FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES WITHIN THE SEGMENT SPARTAN IS NOW INTEGRATED INTO THE FNE SEGMENT OPERATIONALLY AND WE DO NOT PLAN TO CALL OUT IT'S INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION IN THE FUTURE TOTAL FNE BACKLOG WAS 966 MILLION UP 16% YEAR OVER YEAR THIS INCLUDES BACKLOG ACQUIRED FROM SPARTAN AND STRONG AMBULANCE ORDER INTAKE THROUGHOUT THE FISCAL YEAR INCLUDING THE FOURTH QUARTER A DECLINE IN LEGACY FIRE BACKLOG IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF INCREASED THROUGHPUT AT THE OCALA PLANT AND A DECREASE IN FIRE INDUSTRY UNIT ORDERS THAT OCCURRED FROM THE ONSET TO COVID THROUGH APPROXIMATELY SEPTEMBER OF 2020 INDUSTRY ORDERS DURING THAT PERIOD DECLINED OVER 25% SINCE THAT TIME AND DURING THE FINAL TWO MONTHS OF OUR FISCAL 2020 OUR ORDER RATES IMPROVED TO LEVELS ON PAR WITH FISCAL YEAR 2019 FIRE BACKLOG REMAINED AND STRONG AND NOW REFLECT COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY LEAD TIMES AND AMBULANCE BACKLOG IS AT A RECORD HIGH WHICH PROVIDES A SOLID BASE FOR SALES GROWTH AND CONVERSION TO EARNINGS WITHIN THE FNE SEGMENT WE CURRENTLY EXPECT YEAR OVER YEAR FNE REVENUE IMPROVEMENT VERSUS THIS YEAR SOFTNESS RELATED TO COVID ABSENTEEISM AND INSPECTION DELAYS WHICH OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS AT THIS TIME <INAUDIBLE> ANOTHER RECURRENCE OF THE VIRUS OR ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL CONVERT TO EARNINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND WITH IMPROVED INCREMENTAL MARGINS TURNING TO SLIDE FIVE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT FOURTH QUARTER SALES WERE 91 MILLION A DECREASE OF 56 MILLION COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD WHICH INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY 57 MILLION FROM THE SHUTTLE BUSINESSES DIVEST IN EARLY 2020 THE ORGANIC DECLINE OF SALES WAS RELATED TO LOWER SALES THAT ALL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE SEGMENT YEAR OVER YEAR SCHOOL BUS SALES DECLINED 14% IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER DECLINE OF 31% AND PUTS OUR FISCAL SECOND HALF 2020 SALES AHEAD OF REPORTED DECLINES AND INDUSTRY REGISTRATIONS FOR THE SAME PERIOD MUNICIPAL TRANSIT SALES DECREASED 40% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO DELIVERY SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENT TO A LARGE ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMER THAT WE DISCLOSED IN OUR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER THE CHANGE EXTENDED THE DELIVERY TIMELINE THROUGH FISCAL 2021 AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO FURTHER CHANGES TO THAT CONTRACT SPECIALTY MARKETS REMAIN DEPRESSED WITH SALES DOWN 40% VERSUS LAST YEAR WHILE THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT FROM THIRD QUARTER DECLINE TO 50% THE SALES WERE PRIMARILY EXISTING STOCK UNITS BUILT TO ORDER CANCELLATIONS OR DELIVERY OR DELAYS THAT NEEDED SIGNIFICANT REWORK TO MEET CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS TURNING TO SEGMENT UH ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT COMMERCIAL SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA AT 6.4 MILLION WAS DOWN 61% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WHICH INCLUDED ONE MILLION EBITDA RELATED TO DIVESTED SHUTTLE BUS BUSINESSES THE DECLINE IN EBITDA WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE SALES DECLINE IN ALL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS THE INEFFICIENCIES RELATED TO THE REWORK OF STOCK UNITS WITHIN A SPECIALTY DIVISION ALTHOUGH THE STOCK UNIT REWORK HAD A NEGATIVE CONTRIBUTION TO PERFORMANCE IN THE QUARTER GIVEN THE SEVERE END MARKET DECLINES IN THIS BUSINESS WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO RIGHT-SIZE WHAT HAD BECOME AN INFLATED STOCK UNIT INVENTORY WITHIN THE BUS DIVISION DESPITE REVENUE DECLINES IN BOTH SCHOOL AND MUNICIPAL MARKETS THESE BUSINESSES WERE ABLE TO CONDUCIVE TO FLEX PRODUCTION WITH DEMAND AND CONTRIBUTED HIGH SINGLE DIGIT EBITDA MARGINS COMMERCIAL SEGMENT BACKLOG AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER WAS 274 MILLION DOWN 14% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER WHICH CONTAINED 86 MILLION OF SHUTTLE BUS BACKLOG EXCLUDING SHUTTLE BUS AN 18% ORGANIC BACKLOG INCREASE IS THE PRO- IS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN SPECIALTY DIVISION ORDERS WITHIN THE FOURTH QUARTER IN TIMING OF A LARGE MUNICIPAL TRANSIT ORDER THAT ENTERED BACKLOG IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASE SCHOOL BUS SCHOOL BUS ORDERS THE INCREASED SPECIALTY ORDERS WERE FOR BOTH TERMINAL TRUCKS AND STREET SWEEPERS AND THIS QUARTER MARKS THE BEST ORDER INTAKE SINCE FISCAL FIRST QUARTER 2019 WE HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING NEW CONTRACTS AND RENEWALS IN THESE MARKETS WINNING A LARGE RENTAL COMPANY CONTRACT FOR STREET SWEEPERS AND ADVANCING IN THE BID PROCESS FOR TERMINAL TRUCKS AT SEVERAL NATIONAL ACCOUNTS LAST MONTH WE ARE EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH HYSTER-YALE GROUP TO DEVELOP ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN POWER TERMINAL TRUCKS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND INCREASE INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY WE ARE TARGETING THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR TO HAVE THE INITIAL PROTOTYPES AVAILABLE FOR MARKET TESTING WITH MOMENTUM IN MOMENTUM OUR SPECIALTY MARKETS A LONGER CYCLE MUNICIPAL TRANSIT BACKLOG WE FEEL THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT IS IN A POSITION TO GROW REVENUE DESPITE UNCERTAINTY OF SURROUND THE TIMING THE TIMING OF A FULL TIME RETURNED TO THE CLASSROOM AND IMPACT ON SCHOOL BUS DEMAND AS COVID-19 VACCINES BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD THERE'S REASON TO BE OPTIMISTIC THAT DECISIONS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IN DISTRICTS WILL BENEFIT OUR PEAK SPRING SELLING SEASON FOR SCHOOL BUS GIVEN THE COST OUT ACTIVITIES THAT WE TOOK THIS YEAR ACROSS ALL OF OUR COMMERCIAL SEGMENT BUSINESSES WE EXPECT INCREASED VOLUME AND SPECIALTY AND POTENTIALLY SCHOOL BUS TO CONVERT AT SOLID INCREMENTAL MARGINS WE ANTICIPATE THE OVERALL VARIABILITY OF 2020S COMMERCIAL SEGMENT BOTTOM LINE MARGIN PERFORMANCE WILL DISSIPATE IN 2021 ABSENT ANY NEW GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVES THAT MAY IMPACT END MARKETS EMPLOYEE ATTENDANCE OR DELIVERY ACCEPTANCE THE NEAR TERM POTENTIAL FOR THIS SEGMENT REMAINS IN THE HIGH SINGLE DIGIT EBITDA MARGIN PROFILE TURNING THE PAGE TO SLIDE SIX RECREATION SEGMENT SALES OF 194 MILLION WE'RE UP 12% VERSUS LAST YEAR REFLECTING STRONG WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS AND RETAIL DEMAND FOR CLASS B CLASS C AND TOW-ABLE UNITS CLASS C SHIPMENTS WERE DOWN MID SINGLE DIGITS VERSUS LAST YEAR'S PRODUCTION WAS LIMITED BY SUPPLY CHAIN CONSTRAINTS PRIMARILY IN GAS UNITS WE FEEL A BACKLOG IN PRODUCTIVE AND PRODUCTION CAPACITY ARE IN PLACE TO SUPPORT HIGHER SHIPMENTS ONCE THESE BOTTLENECKS CLEAR DESPITE SHIPPING FEWER CLASS C UNITS OUR AWARD-WINNING PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS CONTINUE TO TAKE MARKET SHARE RESULTING IN HIGHER RETAIL DEMAND INCREASED PRICING AND LOWER DISCOUNTING AND ALLOWANCES RECREATION SEGMENT EBITDA ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS 20.5 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER AN INCREASE OF 12 MILLION OR 175% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN OF 10.6% REFLECTS UH REFLECTS THE HIGHER SALES MIX OF NON-CLASS A PRODUCTS WITHIN THE QUARTER AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF OPERATING LEVERAGE AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES WITH SEQUENTIAL AND YEAR OVER YEAR MARGIN GAINS DESPITE LOWER CLASS A UNITS SALES PROFITABILITY INCREASED OVER 650 BASIS POINTS VERSUS FOURTH QUARTER 2019 AND FOR A BUSINESS THAT HAD RECENTLY STRUGGLED TO BREAK EVEN IT WAS ENCOURAGING TO SEE PROFITABILITY REACH LEVELS IT HAD NOT ATTAINED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE THIS MOMENTUM BY DRIVING EFFICIENT MANUFACTURING PRACTICES AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON DEALER WINS AND MARKET SHARE GAINS THAT WOULD DELIVER SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE NOT ONLY DURING THIS UPTURN IN DEMAND BUT ACROSS ALL PARTS OF DEMAND AND STOCKING CYCLES SEGMENT BACKLOG INCREASED 220% YEAR OVER YEAR TO 540 MILLION WHICH REFLECTS STRONG ORDER INTAKE ACROSS ALL RV CATEGORIES OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS THE PAST TWO QUARTERS WERE HISTORIC HIGHS FOR ORDERS BY A SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN AND OUR CURRENT BACKLOG IS NEARLY DOUBLE THAT OF ANY POINT IN REV'S RECREATION SEGMENT HISTORY WE FEEL THIS SUPPORTS THE CURRENT INDUSTRY THINKING THAT WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS WILL BE UP 20% OR MORE IN CALENDAR 2021 AND THAT OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO NICHE MARKET PLACEMENTS AND ICONIC BRANDS LANDS US IN A STRONG POSITION TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT GROWTH AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE EXPECT THE SALES MIX OF PRODUCTS TO NORMALIZE IF CLASS A PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES IMPROVE AND THEREFORE TO EXPECT SEGMENT MARGINS IN THE MID SINGLE DIGITS VERSUS THE 10% ACHIEVED IN Q4 ON SLIDE SEVEN CONSOLIDATED FULL YEAR NET SALES DECLINED 5% YEAR OVER YEAR TO 2.3 BILLION IN A CHALLENGING YEAR THAT INCLUDES EXPANSION OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES THAT OUR RECREATION SEGMENT AT THE ONSET OF COVID AND UNPLANNED DISRUPTIONS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC AT SEVERAL OTHER BUSINESSES ADJUSTED EBITDA DECLINED 34% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 TO 67.5 MILLION NEARLY 50 MILLION OR THREE QUARTERS OF THAT TOTAL OCCURRED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AS REVENUE THROUGHPUT AND MARGINS IMPROVED SEQUENTIALLY THROUGH THE PERIOD ROD MENTIONED THE NUMBER OF STRUCTURING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO RIGHTSIZING THE ORGANIZATION THIS INCLUDED DECENTRALIZING THE PARTS BUSINESS FROM THE CORPORATE CENTER BACK INTO THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES AND SUN-SETTING LESS PROFITABLE BRANDS AND DEALER RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO THE TOTAL STRUCTURAL COST SAVINGS EXECUTED THROUGH OUR FISCAL YEAR END ARE EXPECTED TO DELIVER A TOTAL OF $10 MILLION ANNUALLY TURNING TO SLIDE EIGHT FULL YEAR NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS 56 MILLION COMPARED TO 53 MILLION OF NET CASH PROVIDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD CASH GENERATED WAS PRIMARILY TO IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS RECEIVED WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ALL ASPECTS OF NETWORKING CAPITAL INCLUDING REINFORCING THE DISCIPLINES NEEDED TO REACH OPTIMAL INVENTORY LEVELS BALANCING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE TERMS AND ALIGNING MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES WITH A MODEL THAT COLLECTS A GREATER AMOUNT OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS THAT WORKING CAPITAL AT OCTOBER 31ST 2020 WAS 355 MILLION COMPARED TO 373 MILLION AT THE END OF FISCAL 2019 NOW THAT'S AS OF OCTOBER 31ST WAS 331 MILLION INCLUDING 11 MILLION CASH ON HAND VERSUS 377 MILLION AT THE END OF FISCAL 2019 AT FISCAL YEAR END THE COMPANY MAINTAINED AMPLE LIQUIDITY WITH 283 MILLION AVAILABLE

SPARTAN ACQUISITION IN THE FISCAL FIRST QUARTER OF 2021 WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL ATTAIN THIS TARGET YOU MAY ALSO RECALL THAT OUR TERM LOAN EXPIRES IN APRIL 2022 WE WILL BE WORKING WITH OUR BANKING PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE UPCOMING MONTH TO OPTIMIZE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE WE DO NOT PLAN TO ISSUE GUIDANCE TODAY DUE TO RECENT RECURRENCE OF COVID-19 CASES GLOBALLY OR WITHIN OUR BUSINESS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES REMAINS A TOP PRIORITY CONTACT TRACING TESTING AND MEASURES TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS COME WITH UNCERTAIN STAFFING LEVELS THAT IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS THE CDC HAS ISSUED AND CONTINUES TO UPDATE NEW DIRECTIVES THAT WE FOLLOW UNDER THESE CONDITIONS OUR CUSTOMER'S ABILITY TO TRAVEL INSPECT VEHICLES FOR ACCEPTANCE CREATES UNCERTAINTY OF DELIVERY AND REVENUE RECOGNITION TIMING UNTIL WE CAN REASONABLY PREDICT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THESE CHANGES WE FEEL IT WOULD NOT BE PRUDENT TO GIVE A RANGE OF ESTIMATES HOWEVER WITH THE EMERGENCE OF VACCINES WE HOPE TO HAVE BETTER CLARITY WHEN WE HOST OUR VIRTUAL INVESTOR AND ANALYST DAY IN APRIL THAT ROD REFERENCED PLEASE SAVE THE DATE ON APRIL 15TH WHEN WE PLAN TO PROVIDE A DEEPER LOOK AT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING MODEL AND PROVIDE IMMEDIATE TERM TARGETS IF WE FEEL THAT THE OPERATING LANDSCAPE HAS BECOME MORE PREDICTABLE WE EXPECT TO ALSO PROVIDE FULL YEAR GUIDANCE WE WILL EXTEND A FORMAL INVITATION TO THIS EVENT SOON WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO ROD SO I GUESS UH WE GET JUST A FEW CLOSING COMMENTS THEN YEP SO UM YOU KNOW THE THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 HAS BEEN A CHALLENGING FOR THE REV GROUP AND OUR EMPLOYEES IN MANY REGARDS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A NUMBER OF INTERNAL CHANGES AS WE'VE MOVED TOWARDS THE FUTURE WE SOLD A BUSINESS PURCHASE AND AND INTEGRATED A BUSINESS DURING THE TIME IN WHICH THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT AS YOU ALL KNOW HAS BEEN VERY AND OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE I'M PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS WE HAVE ACHIEVED IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF CHANGE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED OUR BUSINESS CONTINUE TO HAVE A RELATIVELY HEALTHY BACKLOGS AND WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THESE SUPPORT REVENUE GROWTH IN THE UPCOMING YEAR AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IMPORTANTLY UH I AM VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE DONE THE OTHER DAY THEY THEY'VE THEY'VE PUT THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'VE DELIVERED ON DEMAND THEY CAN TO DELIVER ON OUR COMMITMENTS AND DELIVER TO OUR CUSTOMERS UNDER SOME VERY ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES UH AS AS WE LOOK TO SUPPORT THE FIRST RESPONDERS IN IN IN OUR COUNTRY SO I'M VERY PLEASED I WANT TO THANK THEM PUBLICLY FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE AND WITH THAT I THINK WE'LL HOLD <INAUDIBLE> HAVE A Q AND A WITH AN OPEN MIC SO QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS THANK YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD A CONFIRMATION TONE WILL INDICATE YOUR LINE IS IN THE QUESTION QUEUE YOU MAY PRESS STAR TWO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE YOUR QUESTION FROM THE QUEUE AND FOR PARTICIPANTS USING SPEAKER EQUIPMENT IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO PICK UP YOUR HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE STAR KEY PLEASE ASK ONE QUESTION AND ONE FOLLOW-UP QUESTION AND THEY WILL REACH YOU FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OUR FIRST QUESTION IS FROM JERRY RUTLEDGE WITH GOLDMAN SACHS PLEASE PROCEED YES HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND UH CONGRATULATIONS ON A REALLY STRONG PERFORMANCE YEAR HEY JERRY THANKS THANK YOU UM UH WHAT REALLY UH STOOD OUT WAS THE MARGIN PERFORMANCE IN THE RV BUSINESS AND YOU ALLUDED TO UH MAKES HELPING UH I'M WONDERING IF WE JUST STEPPED THROUGH YOU KNOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THE YEAR OVER YEAR UM MARGIN EXPANSION MUCH OF THAT WAS IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS PRICING MAKES AND DO WE THINK ABOUT THE MAKES UH TAILWIND AS BEING SUSTAINABLE FROM HERE YEAH JERRY AS AS I SAID IN UH IN UH THE UM MY MY PREPARED REMARKS YOU KNOW THE MIX REALLY HELPS US AND I THINK WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF CLASS A THOSE ARE DOUBLE DIGIT PERFORMING BUSINESSES SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MIX THERE OUR MIX WAS UM DOWN UM CLASS A AND UM WE REALLY HAD TWO THINGS HELPING US FROM A TAILWIND PERSPECTIVE THE FACT THAT UH WE HAD A LARGER MIX AND THOSE MORE PROFITABLE BUSINESS BEING THE CLASS B CS AND TOW-ABLES AND CLASS A ACTUALLY HAD A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF DIESEL PRODUCT WITHIN THE QUARTER WHICH IS A MORE PROFITABLE THAN THE GAS PRODUCT SO SO EVEN THOUGH WE SAY COVID A LOT OF THE FURNITURE ISSUES WE'VE HAD THAT WE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY WERE ON OUR GAS UNIT LINES AND SO EVEN WITHIN CLASS A WE HAD A MARGIN PICKUP FROM THE CONCENTRATION OF DIESEL WITHIN THE QUARTER WHICH WE WOULD EXPECT TO MORE FLATTEN OUT TO A REASONABLE NORMALIZED RATE GOING FORWARD AND OF COURSE AS CLASS A CONTINUES TO DEVELOP IT'LL GET MORE TO THE 40 60 SORT OF SPLIT THAT WE TRADITIONALLY HAVE SEEN WITHIN THAT GROUP SO IT REALLY IS JUST A MATTER OF THE AMOUNT THAT WE SOLD WITHIN THOSE OTHER PRODUCT CATEGORIES PLUS THE MIXED BENEFIT AND OF COURSE AS YOU SAW WITHIN THE RV ITSELF THE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT THEY HAD DROVE UH YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT 650 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT THEIR SALES WE ACTUALLY DOWN- AND AS WE- GO AHEAD SORRY PLEASE GO AHEAD YEAH I WAS SAYING THAT SALES ARE ACTUALLY DOWN YEAR ON YEAR RIGHT SO THEY ACTUALLY WE'RE ABLE TO DELIVER A PROFIT THAT'S A QUARTER VERSUS LAST SO THAT WAS MAJORITY OF THAT BENEFIT WAS FROM PRODUCTIVITY OKAY AND THEN FIRE AND EMERGENCY IN <INAUDIBLE> OCALA UM IT TURNED THE CORNER UH CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW UH THE PRODUCTION RATES HAVE CONTINUED INTO DECEMBER HAVE YOU CONTINUED TO RAMP HIGHER OR WAS IT 40% INCREASE ESSENTIALLY GET YOU THROUGH A NORMALIZED RUN RATE AND WHEN DO WE SEE- OKAY -FROM AN ACCOUNTING STANDPOINT SO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS FLOWING THROUGH TO THE FULL EXTENT WELL I DO THINK THIS IS ROD WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN IN THAT LOCATION UH BUT THERE'S STILL OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO EVEN DO MUCH BETTER THERE SO WE AS MARK MENTIONED IN HIS EARLIER DISCUSSION YOU KNOW WE'VE GOTTEN BACK TO MORE OF A STANDARD INDUSTRY LEAD TIMES WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THROUGHPUT ON BOTH AERIALS AND PUMPERS IN THAT PLANT AND WE BELIEVE THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUED MARGIN EXPANSION THROUGH PRODUCTIVITY SO WHILE WE WERE PLEASED WITH THE PATH WE'RE ON AND IN SEEING THIS THING MOVE AND GET AND BE ABLE TO GET LOOK AT OUR BACKLOG GET TO WHAT WE THINK IS A MORE OF A STANDARD LEAD TIME UH WE WE DO STILL BELIEVE THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE OUR EFFICIENCIES IN THAT PLANT AND GET A MAR- AND GET MARGIN EXPANSION OF THAT BUSINESS SO THAT'S JUST WORK IN FRONT OF US SO- THANK YOU YEP THANKS JERRY OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM JAMIE <INAUDIBLE> PLEASE PROCEED HI GOOD MORNING UM I GUESS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ONE I THINK YOU NOTED ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE YOU EXPECTED TO SEE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR JUST A CLARIFICATION I'M ASSUMING THAT'S YOU KNOW NORMALIZED FOR THE DIVEST SHARE SO LOOK AT SORT OF THE 90 MILLION QUARTERLY RUN RATE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING INDIRECT ABOUT GROWTH UM AND I GUESS JUST MY SECOND QUESTION CAN YOU JUST GIVE MORE COLOR UM OBVIOUSLY THE OUTLOOK ON THE UH ON THE BUS SIDE OR THE SCHOOL BUS SIDE IS IS IS SOMEWHAT UH YOU KNOW UNCERTAIN UM AS YOU TALK TO CUSTOMERS CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT BUYING TRENDS IN THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR WHAT WOULD BE THE MAJOR DRIVERS WHAT WOULD THEY NEED TO SEE TO COME BACK IN THE MARKET AND JUST SORT OF YOU KNOW THE OVERALL AGE AGE OF THE FLEET THANKS WELL I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS ROD YOU KNOW THE FEEDBACK WE HAVE FROM FROM IN-MARKET OR FROM DEALER PARTNERS IS THAT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING AND CERTAINLY AROUND SCHOOL OPENINGS OR SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPEN STAYING OPENING THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE DRIVING FACTOR IN IT AND RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST TREMENDOUS UNCERTAINTY AROUND THAT IF THE BACK HALF OF THIS YEAR IS GOING TO SHAPE OUT DEFINITELY OBVIOUSLY WITH THE EMERGENCE OF THE OF THE THE MULTIPLE VACCINES AND I THINK WHAT'S OUR REAL DRIVE FOR UH FOR PEOPLE TO GET BACK IN SCHOOL FROM THE PUBLIC I THINK THAT'S THE THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL THAT THAT'S MAKES PROMISE WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE I THINK THE TAILWINDS WILL HELP US GET WHERE WE NEED TO BE WE'RE GONNA KNOW I THINK BY THE TIME WE GET TO GET TOGETHER IN APRIL WE'RE GOING TO KNOW HOW THAT SHAPES OUT BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY FOR US TO LOOK FORWARD AND PROJECT WHAT THAT SCHOOL BUS MARKET'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE NOT KNOWING WHAT THE IMPACTS OF COVID IS GOING TO BE UNTIL WE SEE THE SUCCESS RATE ON THIS VIRUS AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND THEN FURTHER UH MOVING INTO THE INTO THE INTO THE SPRING WHEN OUR YOU KNOW WE TYPICALLY SEE APRIL MAY BEING WHEN WE START GETTING SIGNIFICANT ORDERS AND DELIVERIES SO THAT'LL BE A TIMEFRAME WE'RE GOING TO KNOW BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT CLEAR IT'S JUST TREMENDOUS UNCERTAINTY EVERYBODY'S KIND OF AWAITING UH THAT THAT THAT TIME PERIOD SORRY AND THEN JUST THE THE COMMENTARY ON REVENUES FOR COMMERCIAL MIX ASSUMING IT EXCLUDES THE DIVESTITURE SO LOOK AT THE 90 MILLION QUARTERLY RUN RATE CORRECT AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE CORPORATE EXPENSE LINE YOU KNOW AS AS WE LOOK TO TO 2021 ANY COLOR THERE THANKS YEAH SO YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE COMMERCIAL EXACTLY RIGHT EXCLUDING THE 90 MILLION AND THEN UH AND THE UM AND THE CORPORATE OF COURSE OUR PARTS WAS PART OF THE CENTRALIZED SO THAT FIVE MILLION DROPS RIGHT TO THE CORPORATE LINE SO YOU COULD SEE THAT FIVE MILLION DROP THAT'S WHERE THAT WAS TRADITIONALLY SHOWN TO OUR CENTRALIZED PARTS BUSINESS OKAY GREAT THANK YOU YEP THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM COURTNEY YAKAVONIS WITH MORGAN STANLEY PLEASE PROCEED HI THANKS GOOD MORNING GUYS UM- MORNING COURTNEY JUST <CROSSTALK> BACK ON THE COMMENTS UH YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE A MIXED SHIFT IN RECREATION NEXT YEAR I THINK YOU SAID YOU EXPECT YOU KNOW IN LINE WITH THE INDUSTRY WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS THAT'S ABOUT 20% BUT I THINK YOU HAD SAID THAT YOU WERE EXPECTING MID SINGLE DIGIT MARGINS AND I THINK WE'VE HISTORICALLY BEEN SEEING MORE HIGH SINGLE DIGITS OUT OF THAT SEGMENT SO I'M JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I FULLY UNDERSTOOD UM WHAT YOU WHAT YOU WERE THINKING THE MIX SHIFT IMPACT UH WOULD HAVE ON ON 2021 GIVEN THAT CLASS A HAS BEEN WEAK FOR SOME TIME NOW YEAH WE'VE TRUTHFULLY SEEN MID SINGLE DIGITS SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE DETERMINED AS MID RIGHT FIVE UH FIVE TO 7% SO THAT'S PROBABLY IN LINE WHAT WE'VE HISTORICALLY DONE BUT THE MIX SHIFT REALLY IS WHAT I REFERRED TO WITH JERRY'S QUESTION IS UM AGAIN UH AT 40% OF OUR SALES BEING IN THE RV OR OUR CLASS A BUSINESS YOU KNOW THOSE AS YOU KNOW ARE DEPRESSED MARGIN SO THOSE BRING DOWN THE ONES THAT ARE A DOUBLE DIGIT FROM A RUN RATE PERSPECTIVE SO IT'S REALLY THE FACT THAT RV ARE UM WHAT WE CALL RV ARE CLASS A WAS ACTUALLY DOWN FROM A MIX SO AS THEY COME TO THE 40 TO 50% RANGE THERE ARE 40% IN THE QUARTER VERSUS 50% IN THE PRIOR YEAR SO YOU HAD A 10% DROP THERE FROM A MIXED PERSPECTIVE AND SO IT'S REALLY THAT THAT SIMPLE AS FAR AS LOOKING AT THE OTHER THREE BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE IN THAT PORTFOLIO AT DOUBLE DIGIT AND BRINGING IN UH A LOWER SINGLE DIGIT UM MIX FROM THE CLASS A WE'LL ACTUALLY DEPRESS THOSE 10% DOWN TO THE MORE OF THE FIVE TO 7% RANGE OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL UM AND THEN ANY MORE UM SPECIFICITY YOU COULD GIVE US JUST ON COMMERCIAL AND FNE MARGINS AS WE THINK ABOUT IMPACT NEXT YEAR OBVIOUSLY APPRECIATING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON YOUR DELIVERY SCHEDULE BUT ANY HIGH LEVEL THOUGHTS ON THE MARGIN SIDE YEAH I THINK WE SAID UH HIGH SINGLE DIGITS ON THE UH UM FROM THAT WHOLE COMMERCIAL SIDE BUT OBVIOUSLY ON THE CAPACITY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAPACITY THAT'S UM YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE WE'RE STILL WITH THE BACKLOG HERE SO AS I SAID IN MY PREPARED REMARKS WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO A LOT OF THE UNITS THAT WE HAD UH UM DEVELOPED COMING INTO THE UH WHAT OUR NORMAL SELLING SEASON IS DIDN'T UH UH DEVELOP BUT EXITING THE QUARTER WE WERE VERY HAPPY WITH SOME OF THE PROGRESS WE MADE IN OUR BACKLOG IS NOW PERFORMING SO WE SHOULD SEE THE VARIABILITY UH GET OUT OF THERE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL COMMERCIAL SEGMENT WE WOULD EXPECT THE HIGH SINGLE SORT OF WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING COMING IN A QUARTER IF WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE ISSUES THAT WE EXPERIENCED ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE AND LIQUIDATION THAT WE DID ON SOME OF THOSE STOCK UNITS SO WE HAD EXPECTED IT TO GET MORE LIKE WE GUIDED TO OUR LAST TIME MORE THE MID OR THE HIGH SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT OKAY GOTCHA AND THEN I GUESS JUST LASTLY UM YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW CONCERNS ABOUT DELIVERY SCHEDULES FOR NEXT YEAR BUT IF YOU HAD TO JUST HIGHLIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THREE CATEGORIES THAT HAS THE MOST UH VARIABILITY WHERE YOU'RE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT VERSUS THE ONES THAT ARE UM OR THAT YOU FEEL MOST CONFIDENT IN THE DELIVERY SCHEDULES FOR NEXT YEAR JUST JUST SO WE CAN GET A SENSE OF OF WHERE THE REAL RISK IS AND BY BY CATEGORIES YOU MEAN THE BUSINESS UNITS OR THE PRODUCT CATEGORIES UH I GUESS YEAH I GUESS I JUST MEANT YOU KNOW THE- WITHIN THE BUSINESS UNITS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOUR RECREATION THAT CLUB IS YOU KNOW PRETTY STRONG SO DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT'S YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'VE HAD THE MOST CERTAINTY YOU KNOW VERSUS UM SOME OF THE PRODUCT LINES IN FNE AND COMMERCIAL I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE AND I'LL COMMENT THEN MARK CAN CLEAN UP WHAT I SAY I THINK THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IN MARKETS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THE ISSUES I THINK PRIMARILY OBVIOUSLY IN MARKET DEMAND IN THE UH IN THE SCHOOL BUS BUSINESSES IS THE ISSUE ALL THE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SOME LEVEL OF SUPPL- SUPPLIER ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH I THINK RV IS PROBABLY THE ONE THAT WE'VE SEEN THE MOST STOCK OUTS WHICH IS PRETTY CONSISTENT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY UM THE OTHER ELEMENT THAT WE DEAL WITH A LITTLE BIT WHICH IS A TIMING ISSUE NOT A UH IMPACT PROBABLY WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR IT'S JUST THE INSPECTIONS THAT HAVE TO TAKE PLACE IN AMBULANCE AND FIRE AROUND GETTING A BUS OFF THE LOT OR A TRUCK OR AN AMBULANCE OFF THE LOT RELATED TO COMPLETING FINAL INSPECTIONS BY GETTING PEOPLE TO THE SITE THAT'S A REAL ISSUE THAT WE WE WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH IN TERMS OF UM YOU KNOW UH REVENUE RECOGNITION CAUSE THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER FOR US TO TO CONVERT THE BUS SO I THINK YOU KNOW IN IN IN SCHOOL BUS IS CERTAINLY IS UM IT'S IN MARKET DEMANDS THERE'S SOME SUPPLIER ISSUES THAT ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME FOR THE MOST PART BUT THEY ARE THEY THEY DO POP UP AND WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THAT UH AND THEN THE LAST THING WOULD BE THAT THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INSPECTIONS WHICH IS YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR YOUR EMERGENCY SEGMENT IS WHERE WE SEE THAT AND MARK I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING NO I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK AS WE SAID PREVIOUSLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN HERE WITH COVID AS PEOPLE CONVERTED LIKE PEOPLE WORKING FROM HOME WE EXPECTED THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD UH ADOPT VIRTUAL INSPECTIONS FOR OUR AMBULANCE AND FIRE TRUCKS AND AS EXITING COVID OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE COME BACK TO WANTING TO SEE THEIR TRUCKS IN PERSON AND WITH THE RESUR- RESURGENCE HERE WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY'LL GO BACK TO VIRTUAL BUT WE HAVE SHIFTED BACK TO WANTING TO DO IN-PERSON INSPECTIONS SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM GOING BACK TO VIRTUAL SO OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOME FLUX THERE IF PEOPLE WOULD GO BACK TO VIRTUAL INSPECTIONS DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE COVID ENVIRONMENT BUT WE ARE BACK TO OUR TRADITIONAL AS ROD REFERRED TO ACTUALLY SEEING THE UNITS BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE YARD SO THAT WE CAN REVENUE THEM AND THAT'S REALLY THE DELAYS THAT I WAS SPEAKING TO OF IT'S REALLY OUR CUSTOMERS COMING IN AND INSPECTING THE UNITS AND APPROVING THEM FOR SURE SHIPMENT GREAT THANKS AS A REMINDER JUST DIAL STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM RAJ PATEL WITH JEFFERIES PLEASE PROCEED HEY THANKS FOR TAKING THE QUESTION UM QUICK ONE ON FNE MARGINS UM WHAT'S THE ANTICIPATED FNE MARGIN EXPANSION ONCE ALL THE PRODUCTION INEFFICIENCIES ARE SORTED OUT UM WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NEW MARGIN PROFILE LOOKS LIKE IN A NEW NORMAL YEAH UH FROM A FIRE PERSPECTIVE OBVIOUSLY AS ROD HAS REITERATED MULTIPLE TIMES WE'RE STILL IN A MULTIPLE ENDINGS JOURNEY HERE SO AS HE'S UH REFERRED TO ON THE E-ONE UM WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO WE'RE SEEING PROGRESSION BUT UM OF COURSE WE HAVE OTHER FACILITIES WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO TOO THAT WE'RE GONNA ADDRESS AS I SAID IN MY PREPARED REMARKS THAT WE'RE STILL EXPECTING TO BE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS UH AT THE END OF THIS JOURNEY BUT WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT RIGHT SO OF COURSE WE'RE NOT GIVING GUIDANCE HERE BUT AGAIN IT'S STILL IN A MULTIPLE UH YEAR PERSPECTIVE TO GET TO THAT 10 SO WE'RE JUST UM HAPPY TO SEE THE PROGRESSION HERE THAT WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE QUARTER AND OBVIOUSLY UH OUR FORWARD-LOOKING UH WE'LL PROVIDE MORE GUIDANCE UH IN UH IN APRIL YEAH I THINK <CROSSTALK> THERE'S THERE'S YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AND AND AND HOW YOU WALK WALK DOWN THAT WHAT MARK REFERRED TO IS A MULTI <INAUDIBLE> JOURNEY WHEN YOU COME INTO THE ROLE YOU THERE'S THERE'S SOME QUICK THINGS YOU CAN DO TO GET POPPED IN AND GET IMPROVEMENT AND THEN IT'S ABOUT BUILDING CAPABILITIES AND I MENTIONED FROM AN OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE STANDPOINT YOU KNOW STANDING UP THE LEAN CAPABILITIES AND AND AND CENTER LED TYPE ACTIVITIES THAT GET IMPLEMENTED IN THE PLANTS AROUND UH CI AROUND PURCHASING UH BUILDING ENGINEERING CAPABILITIES TO GET IN DESIGNED COSTS TO THE EBE UH THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THAT YOU GOT THIS CAPABILITY BUILDING BUT THEY THE GOOD THING IS IS THAT IT'S A CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT CONTINUALLY IMPROVED PROCESS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE GETTING AT THAT EVERY DAY BY BUILDING PIPELINES TO GO EXECUTE AGAIN SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW COMING OUT OF OUR OPERATING MODEL DISCUSSION OF STANDING UP THOSE CAPABILITIES AND BUILDING OUT THOSE TEAMS AND DOING THE CERTIFICATIONS THAT MARK TALKED ABOUT THROUGH LEAN THAT ARE GOING TO YIELD BENEFIT TO US FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME THINGS THAT DID DID NOT EXIST NOW WE'RE STA- WE'RE STANDING UP THOSE CAPABILITIES AND BRINGING ON ROB TO LEAD OUR PURCHASING ORGANIZATION AND GET FOCUSED ON THAT SIGNIFICANT SPEND UH I THINK IT'S GOING TO YIELD A GREAT BENEFIT TO US TOO SO THOSE WILL ALL CONTRIBUTE TO A MARGIN EXPANSION STORY NOT ONLY IN EMERGENCY BUT ACROSS THE BUSINESS AND SO THAT'S UH BUT BUT IT DOES TAKE WORK TO STAND IT UP BUT IT STARTS WITH ORGANIZING AND ALIGNING AND THEN INVESTING IN THOSE CAPABILITY BUILDING AND THEN DRIVING IT THROUGH PROCESS RIGOR EACH EACH EACH DAY EACH WEEK EACH MONTH THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM <INAUDIBLE> WITH BAIRD PLEASE PROCEED THANKS SO MORNING GUYS UM A QUESTION ON- GOOD MORNING -A QUICK QUESTION ON CHASSIS UM AS AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR CHROME PRODUCTION PLANNING BASED ON YOUR BACKLOG ARE THERE ANY PORTIONS OF YOUR BUSINESS WHERE YOU'RE GETTING A SENSE THAT YOU'RE HAVING EITHER CHALLENGES OBTAINING CHASSIES OR UH THE THE DELIVERY TIMELINES ARE EXTENDED UM AND AND LOOK I MEAN I'M I'M THINKING SPECIFICALLY AROUND AMBULANCES AND AND SOME OF THE STUFF THAT RECREATION AS WELL LIKE YOU KNOW CLASS BS AND SO ON YEAH NO <INAUDIBLE> UH I'M GLAD TO SAY AND UH WE WE WERE NOT EXPERIENCING THOSE IN FACT UM YOU KNOW WE'VE AND WE'VE HAD A PRETTY GOOD SUPPLY CHAIN FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE SO I WAS HAPPY THIS QUARTER NOT TO BE TALKING ABOUT CHASSIS UH SHORTAGES FOR ONCE UH EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY MY SECOND ONE <LAUGH> SO I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD THAT CONSISTENTLY SO WE'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THAT IN FACT UH YOU KNOW IN THE RV SIDE ESPECIALLY WE UM YOU KNOW WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THE UH I RUN RATES WERE GOING TO BE AND ACTUALLY ORDERED AHEAD SO WE'RE ACTUALLY UM UM SITTING WITH UH PLENTY OF CHASSIS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND IN THAT BUSINESS AND THEN ON THE AMBULANCE SIDE WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY UH ISSUES FROM A CHASSIS PERSPECTIVE AND WE'VE BEEN GETTING OUR APPROPRIATE ALLOCATIONS FROM OUR OE PARTNERS OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL AND THEN MAYBE MY MY FOLLOW-UP UM SORT OF STICKING WITH WITH THIS TEAM UH HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT STEEL PRICES AND RAW MATERIAL INFLATION IN 2021 UM W- W- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE STEPS THAT YOU'RE TAKING TO MITIGATE THOSE BECAUSE UH OBVIOUSLY HISTORICALLY UM THIS HAS BEEN AN AREA WHERE WE'VE SEEN SOME TROUBLE IN PRIOR YEARS THANK YOU SO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY ON THE PARTS OF OUR BUSINESS WHICH LARGE PART OF THE BUSINESS IS BUILD OUT A BACKLOG OF YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S ALWAYS THE THE THE ISSUE YOU'RE TRYING TO OFFSET INFLATION WITH YOUR EFFICIENCY EFFORTS CAUSE YOU YOU YOU PURCHASE PRICE IS ESTABLISHED ON A BACKLOG BASED BUSINESS SO WE'RE MANAGING THAT OBVIOUSLY A BIG PART OF WHAT WHAT ROB'S UH EFFORTS IS GOING TO BE IS IS TO LOOK AT NEW PURCHASING TO BE ABLE TO OFFSET OFFSET THAT WITHIN A FISCAL FISCAL YEAR SO WE CAN CYCLE THROUGH AND GET UH THE MARGINS THAT WE NEED ON A PRICE COST BASIS BUT UH SO IT'S IT'S A LOT AROUND DRIVING EFFICIENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO OPTIMIZE OUR COST STRUCTURE TO HAVE ANY LEAKAGE THAT DOES COME THROUGH INFLATION INTO A BACKLOG BASED BUSINESS WE CAN OFFSET THROUGH OTHER OTHER MEANS AND MARK I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANNA ADD ANYTHING TO THAT OR I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M WORKING PERSONALLY WITH ROB ON AND MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THOSE INFLATIONARY FACTORS AS WE GO THROUGH 2021 AS WELL AS OUR AGREEMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLY BASE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT ROB CAN ACCLIMATE IT TO AND WE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A HEIGHTENED FOCUS UH IN THOSE BUSINESSES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE LONGER BACKLOGS WE'VE OBVIOUSLY COME OUT WITH SOME PRICE INCREASES AS OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SO WE'RE MANAGING THAT WITH THE UH SUPPLY BASE AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS I DO THINK ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE WORKING ON IS IS TRYING TO GET IN FRONT OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT PRICE PRICE AS A FUNCTION OF INFLATION AND TO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A PRICE INCREASE OR SETTING A PRICE IN THE MARKET THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE BUILD CYCLE OF WHEN THAT THAT VEHICLE WILL GET BUILT SO YOU REFLECT SOME INFLATIONARY CHARACTERISTICS IN YOUR COSTING IN THE BUSINESS <INAUDIBLE> MOST OF OUR

There was an initial hypothesis that growth would be achieved by implementing a consolidated centralized parts business stemming from some in-market synergies. That growth did not materialize. Our businesses inherently know our customers and products and have the institutional knowledge to answer questions and deliver results to our customers more efficiently. Further, the realignment will create a five million dollar annual structural cost savings combined outcome of reducing complexity for our customers the unrealized growth and what did end up being achieved. Creating a duplicate cost structure during the decision to make this change. this decision was the result of a careful examination of how to efficiently serve our customers and simplify our operations. commercially, there are few aspects of our operating model where we would move more firmly to a centrally led operation and becoming an operating company. these include development development of a centrally led activities related to operational excellence and commercial excellence or scaling of capabilities and processes will value creation for our shareholders. many of these capabilities include development of a centrally led activities related to operational excellence and commercial excellence or scaling of capabilities and processes will value creation for our shareholders. many of these capabilities include development of a centrally led activities related to operational excellence and commercial excellence or scaling of capabilities and processes will value creation for our shareholders. many of these capabilities include development of a Have been discussed by management previously but have lacked the commitment and rigor to yield sustainable improvements that create value we are focused on changing that and have made investments in new personnel and technologies to our operating model to build the disciplines necessary to drive sustainable improvements in performance as part of our operational excellence we are building capabilities to improve data-based decision making, simplify operations, and improve efficiencies on our balance sheet this includes discipline review and controls of corporate costs Manufacturing overhead, labor, and direct materials. it requires increased capabilities focused on engineering, manufacturing operations, supply chain, and purchasing. to accelerate the change process and create best-in-class operations, we have made several management changes. there are a couple that i'd like to highlight today. first, we've expanded the role of our commercial president, brian prary, to include the role of senior vice president of operations. in this role, brian leads our manufacturing execution. second, we've created a new role of operations excellence, which is responsible for driving operational excellence and continuous improvement across all of our manufacturing operations. operational excellence and supply chain brian is a master black belt in six sigma aline sensei and has extensive background in manufacturing operations and purchasing making him the ideal person to build out our center of excellence operational efforts he is well positioned to take on this dual role while continuing to lead our commercial segment in addition we have hired david blasovsky as vice president and chief supply officer rob joins regroup having recently led honeywell's And was honeywell's corporate chief procurement officer at cpo at honeywell he managed an eighteen billion dollar annual spend portfolio as well as leading three thousand procurement global procurement specialists rob has a very broad industrial background from aerospace automotive paint and coatings and it includes logistics he has had executive leadership roles with expo logistics dallas parker group and alcoa he rings the rev group both the vision and the execution Capabilities to build the best-class global sourcing organization we're looking for and purchasing supply chain organization combined with a sense of urgency to do this at a pace rob has only been in the position at rev for a few weeks but he's taken an exhaustive look at our infrastructure and is quickly identifying a list of opportunities i am very pleased to have rob join our team and i look forward to the impact that he will have on our business performance in my nine months since joining rev there have been challenges some that were expected and some that were unexpected we have We've implemented much change during that time, and we began to see sequential improvements in our results. we have much work remaining in the months ahead, but i am encouraged by the progress to date. i look forward to sharing more about the plans and the path forward with you during our analyst investor day that we're planning for april with that, i'm now going to turn over to mark for details on our fourth quarter segment performance. mark thanks for adding and good morning, everyone. please turn to page four of the slide deck as i review our segment level performance. Segment fourth quarter sales were three hundred and thirty million, a twenty three percent increase compared to prior year this includes approximately seventy five million of sales attributable to our acquisition of a spartan er that occurred earlier in the year excluding spartan, organic segment sales decreased six percent from the fourth quarter of last year while organic fire sales were relatively flat we shipped fewer ambulance units due to the lingering impacts of covid although down from prior year north america american ambulance deliveries increased twenty one percent sequentially and order trends continue to remain strong as municipalities and federal stimulus dollars prioritize health and safety needs kearns act stimulus dollars remain available for ambulance units delivered through the twenty twenty one calendar year end continuing an important driver of demand for our f and e segment within the fire division throughput increased sequentially once again at our e one plant in oklahoma. Unit production was up forty four percent year over year, demonstrating the benefits of lean programs and operating disciplines that were deployed over the second half of the year. Bring in lean expertise allowed a dual track of affecting immediate change while allowing time to develop leadership, train internal resources and build a pipeline of opx projects that will sustain continuous improvement. We plan to follow this model of deploying lean assistance where we feel there will be an immediate impact. while training our internal teams at all businesses through a lean academy that is designed to deliver annual throughput and cost out targets f and e's segment adjusted ebitda was fourteen point eight million in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty compared to seven point four million in the fourth quarter of twenty nineteen the increase was primarily due to the improvements in e one just mentioned in the acquisition of sparton r&d amphenol's ebitda was relatively flat with the prior year Despite the decrease in sales due to product productivity improvements that increased margins most notably at our largest manufacturing location in orlando sparton contributed four million adjusted ebitda to the effie segment within the quarter which completes three quarters of integration that exceeded expectations the addition of this world-class chassis manufacturing business provides a center of excellence that will be leveraged across our fire businesses the addition of this world-class chassis manufacturing business provides a center of excellence that will be leveraged across our fire businesses the addition of this world-class chassis manufacturing business provides a center of excellence that will be leveraged across our fire businesses the addition of this world-class chassis manufacturing business provides a center of excellence that will be leveraged across our fire businesses the addition of this world-class chassis manufact brands creating further opportunities for manufacturing efficiencies within the segment spartan is now integrated into the f n e segment operationally and we do not plan to call out its individual contribution in the future total f n e backlog was nine hundred and sixty six million up sixteen percent year over year this includes backlog acquired from spartan and strong ambulance order intake throughout the fiscal year including the fourth quarter a decline in legacy fire backlog log is largely the result of increased throughput at the okla plant and a decrease in fire industry unit orders that occurred from the onset of covid through approximately september of twenty twenty industry orders during that period declined over twenty five percent since that time and during the final two months of our fiscal twenty twenty our order rates improved to levels on par with fiscal year twenty nineteen fire backlog remained strong and now reflects competitive industry lead Times, an ambulance backlog is at a record high which provides a solid base for sales growth and conversion to earnings within the f and e segment. we currently expect year over year f and e revenue improvement versus this year's softness related to covid absenteeism and inspection delays which occurred primarily in the second and third fiscal quarters at this time absent no recurrence of the virus or additional government restrictions we feel confident that we will convert to earnings more efficiently and with improved incremental margins. margins turning to slide five commercial segment fourth quarter sales were ninety one million a decrease of fifty six million compared to the prior period which included approximately fifty seven million from the shuttle businesses divested in early twenty twenty the organic decline in sales was related to lower sales at all businesses within the segment year over year school bus sales declined fourteen percent in the fourth quarter which is a significant improvement to the prior period. Quarterly decline of thirty one percent and puts our fiscal second half twenty twenty sales ahead of reported declines in industry registrations for the same period municipal transit sales decreased forty percent first the prior year primarily due to delivery schedule adjustments to a large order to accommodate the needs of our customer that we disclosed in our fiscal third quarter the change extended the delivery timeline through fiscal twenty twenty one and there have been no further changes to that contract Specialty markets remained depressed with sales down forty percent versus last year while this is an improvement from the third quarter's decline of fifty percent the sales were primarily existing stock units built to order cancellations or delivery or delays that needed significant rework to meet customer specifications turning to segment adjusted ebitda for the commercial segment commercial segment adjusted ebitda was six point four million Down sixty one percent, first the prior year period, which included one million ebitda related to divested shuttle bus businesses the decline in ebitda was primarily the result of the sales decline in all businesses as well as the inefficiencies related to the rework of stock units within the specialty division although the stock unit rework had a negative contribution to performance in the quarter, given the severe end market declines in this business, we took the opportunity to right size what had become an inflated stock unit. Inventory within the bus division despite revenue declines in both school and municipal markets these businesses were able to continue to flex production with demand and contributed high single digit ebitda margins commercial segment backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was two hundred seventy four million down fourteen percent versus the prior year quarter which contained eighty six million of shuttle bus backlog excluding shuttle bus and an eighteen percent organic backlog Increase is the result of an increase in specially-divided orders within the fourth quarter in timing of a large municipal transit order that entered backlog in the first quarter this year, partially offset by decreased school bus school bus orders. The increased specialty orders were for both terminal trucks and street sweepers. This quarter marks the best order intake since fiscal first quarter two thousand and nineteen. We have been aggressively pursuing new contracts and new contracts. Renewals in these markets, winning a large rental company contract for street sweepers and advancing in the bid process for terminal trucks at several national accounts. last month, we were excited to announce a partnership with hyster yale group to develop electric and hydrogen-powered terminal trucks to reduce emissions and increase efficiency and productivity. we are targeting the end of our fiscal year to have the initial prototypes available for market testing with mammoet. In our specialty markets, a longer cycle municipal transit backlog, we feel the commercial segment is in a position to grow revenue despite uncertainty surrounding the science, the timing of a full-time return to the classroom, and impacts on school bus demand. As COVID nineteen vaccines become more widely spread, there is reason to be optimistic that decisions reopen schools and districts will benefit our peak selling season for school buses. Given the cost-out activities that we took this year across all of our commercial segment, businesses we expect increased volume in specialty and potentially school buses to convert at solid incremental margins we anticipate the overall variability of twenty twenty commercial segment bottom line margin performance will dissipate in twenty twenty one absent any new government directives that may impact end markets employer attendance or delivery acceptance the near term potential for this segment remains in the high single digit ebitda margin profile Turning to page six, recreation segment sales of one hundred ninety four million were up twelve percent versus last year, reflecting strong wholesale shipments and retail demand for class b, class c, and towable units. class a shipments were down mid single digits versus last year, as production was limited by supply chain constraints primarily in gas units. we feel the backlog and productivity and production capacity are in place to support higher shipments. Despite shipping fewer class a units, award-winning product introductions continue to take market share, resulting in higher retail demand, increased pricing, and lower discounting and allowances. Recreation segment ebitda adjusted ebitda was twenty point five million for the quarter, an increase of twelve million or one hundred seventy five percent from the prior year. Adjusted ebitda margin of ten point four percent. reflects a high reflects the higher sales mix of non-class a products within the quarter as well as the impact of operating leverage and productivity improvements achieved across all categories with sequential and year-over-year margin gains despite lower class a unit sales, profitability increased over six hundred and fifty basis points versus fourth quarter two thousand and nineteen and for a business that had recently struggled to break even, it was encouraging to see profitability reach levels. That are not attained over the past two years we expect to continue this momentum by driving efficient manufacturing practices and commercial activities focused on dealer wins and market share gains that would deliver sustainable performance not only during this up-turn and demand but across all parts of the demand and stocking cycles segment backlog increased two hundred twenty percent year over year to five hundred forty million which reflects strong order intake across all rv categories over the past two years. Six months. the past two quarters were historic highs for orders by a substantial margin and our current backlog is nearly double that of any point in recreation's segment history. we feel this supports the current industry thinking that wholesale shipments will be up twenty percent or more in calendar twenty twenty one and that our product portfolio, niche market placements, and iconic brands land us in a strong position to participate in that growth as we move forward we expect the sales mix of products to Normalize if class a production and delivery schedules improve and therefore would expect segment margins in the mid single digits versus ten percent achieved in q four on slide seven consolidated full year net sales declined five percent year over year to two point three billion in a challenging year that included expansion of production activities at our recreation segment at the onset of covid and unplanned disruptions related to the pandemic at several other businesses adjusted bda declined thirty four percent compared to fiscal twenty nineteen to sixty seven point five million nearly fifty million or three quarters of that total occurred in the second half of the year as revenue, throughput, and margins improved sequentially through the period rod mentioned the number of restructuring activities related to right sizing the organization this included decentralizing the parts business from the corporate center back into the individual businesses and sunsetting less profitable brands and dealer relationships portfolio the total structural cost savings executed through our fiscal year end are expected to deliver a total of ten million dollars annually turning to slide eight full year net cash provided by operating activities was fifty six million compared to fifty three million of net cash provided by operating activities in the prior year period cash generated was primarily a rate to improvements in accounts receivable and inventory management as well as an increase in customer deposits received we will continue to work all aspects of networked capital, including reinforcing the disciplines needed to reach optimal inventory levels, balancing accounts receivable and payable terms, and aligning more of our businesses with a model that collects a greater amount of customer deposits networked capital at october thirty first twenty twenty was three hundred fifty five million compared to three hundred seventy seven million at the end of fiscal twenty nineteen net debt as of october thirty first twenty twenty was three hundred fifty five million compared to three hundred seventy seven million at the end of fiscal twenty nineteen First was three hundred thirty one million including eleven million cash on hand versus three hundred seventy seven million at the end of fiscal twenty nineteen at fiscal year end the company maintained ample liquidity with two hundred eighty three million available under our abl revolving credit facility we may recall that our term loan amendment effective in april of last year reverts to a net leverage ratio of five point two five times with certain addbacks related to the sparton acquisition in the fiscal first quarter of twenty nineteen Twenty one we are confident that we will obtain this target. you may also recall that our term loan expires in april twenty twenty two. we will be working with our banking partners throughout the upcoming months to optimize our capital structure. we do not plan to issue guideds today due to the recent recurrence of covid nineteen cases globally within our business across the country. the safety of our employees remains the top priority. contact tracing, testing and measures are in place. To prevent the spread of the virus, come with uncertain staffing levels that impact our businesses and supply chain partners. the cdc has issued and continues to update new directives that we follow. under these conditions, our customers' ability to travel and inspect vehicles for acceptance creates uncertainty of delivery and revenue recognition timing until we can reasonably predict the potential impacts of these changes. we feel it would not be prudent to give a range of estimates. however, with the emergence of vaccines, we hope to mitigate these impacts. have better clarity when we host our virtual investor and analyst day in april that rod referenced. please save the date on april fifteenth when we plan to provide a deeper look at our business and operating model and provide immediate term targets. if we feel that the operating landscape has become more predictable, we expect to also provide full year guidance. we will extend a formal invitation to this event soon. with that, i'll turn it back over to rod so i guess Closing comments then so um you know the fiscal year twenty twenty has been a challenging for the rev group and our employees in many regards we have gone through a number of internal changes as we've moved towards the future we sold a business purchase it and integrated a business during that time in which the external environment as you all know has been very and often unpredictable i'm i'm pleased with the progress we have achieved in the short amount of time given the amount of change we have experienced our businesses continue to have relatively healthy backlogs And we simply believe they support revenue growth in the coming year. most importantly, i'm very pleased with what our employees have done. every day they they've put themselves in a situation where they've delivered on, dare i say it, to deliver on our commitments and deliver to our customers under some very adverse circumstances as we we look to support the first responders and in our country. so i'm very pleased to want to thank them publicly for what they've done. and with that, i think we'll hold it over and have a q and a with an open mic. thank you. Thank you. if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue and for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. please ask one question and one follow-up question and then re-queue for additional questions. our first question is from... jerry ritchie with gouldman sax please proceed yes, yes, a good morning everyone and congratulations and a really strong performance here hey, jerry thanks, thanks, what really stood out was the margin performance in the rv business and you alluded to mix helping i'm wondering if you just stepped through, you know, looking at the year over year margin expansion much of that was improved productivity, how much of that was pricing mix? And do we think about the mix tailwind as being sustainable for here? yeah, as i said in the in the my my prepared remarks, you know, the mix really helps us and i think we've always said that, you know, outside of class a, those are double digit performing businesses. so when you look at the mix there, our mix was down on class a, and we really had two things helping us from a tailwind perspective the fact that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that We had a larger mix in those more profitable businesses of being the class b c's and towables in class a actually had a high concentration of diesel product within the quarter which is more profitable than the gas product so so even though we say covid a lot of the furniture issues we've had that we talked about previously were on our gas units lines and so even within class a we had a margin pickup from the concentration of diesel within the quarter which we would expect to more flatten out to a reasonable normalized level Going forward and of course as class a continues to develop it'll get more to the forty sixty sort of split that we traditionally have seen within that group. so it really is just a matter of the amount that we sold within those other product categories plus the mix benefit and of course as you saw within rv itself the productivity improvements that they had drove a you know significant part of that six hundred fifty basis point improvement and as we eric go ahead, please go ahead yeah, i'm saying the sales are actually down here and right, right so they actually were able to deliver a profit that's a quarter versus last, so that was majority of that benefit was from productivity and then in firing in emergency, nice to see ocala turn the corner. can you talk about how the production rates have continued into december? have you continued to ramp higher? or was it a forty percent? increase essentially gets you to the normalized run rate and when do we see from an accounting standpoint the lower per unit costs flowing through to the full extent well i do think this is ray we have made considerable progress in that location but there's still opportunity for us to do much better there so we is as martin mentioned in his earlier discussion and we've gotten back to more of a standard industry lead times we continue to work on throughput on both aerials and pumpers in that plant And we believe there are opportunities for continued margin expansion through productivity. so while we are pleased with the path we're on and and we're in seeing this thing move and give and be able to get look at our backlog and get to what we think is a more standard lead time of we we still believe there's opportunity to improve our efficiencies in that plant and get our margins and get margin expansion in that business. so that's just work in front of us. so thank you. thank you. our q and a session will begin shortly. thank you. our q and a session will begin shortly. thank you. our q and a session will begin shortly. thank you. our q and a session will begin shortly. thank you. our q and a session will begin shortly. thank you. our q and a session will begin shortly. thank you. our q and a question is from jamie cook with credit suisse. please proceed. hi, good morning. i guess a couple of questions. one, i think you noted on the commercial side you expected to see growth here every year. just a clarification, i'm assuming that's, you know, normalized for the divested shares, so look at sort of the ninety million quarterly run rate when you're talking about direct about growth. and, i guess, is just my second question. can you just give more color obviously the outlook on the bus side or the school side? The side is is is somewhat you know uncertain as you talk to customers can you just talk about how they're thinking about buying trends in the latter part of the year what would be the major drivers what would they need to see to come back in the market and just sort of you know the overall age age of the fleet thanks well i think that this is right i you know the feedback we have from in markets or from dealer partners is that the whole thing certainly around school openings or schools is that the major drivers what would they need to see to come back in the market and just sort of you know the overall age age of the fleet thanks well i think that this is right i you know the feedback we have from in markets or from dealer partners is that the whole thing certainly around school openings or schools is that the major drivers what would they need to see to come back in the market Opening, staying open, that's that, that's the driving factor in it, and right now, there's just tremendous uncertainty around that, is the back half of this year is going to shape out differently, obviously, with the emergence of the multiple vaccines and and i think what's our real drive for for people to get back in school, the public, i think that's that's pretty clear that people want to go back to school, that that makes promise, we've got a couple of things there, i think could be tailwinds to help us get where we need to be, we're going to know, i think by about time we get to get together in april We're gonna know how that shapes up. But right now, there's just too much uncertainty for us to look forward and project what that school bus market's gonna look like not knowing what the impacts of covid's gonna be until we see the success rate on this virus and what that looks like and then and then moving into the into the spring when our we you know we typically see april may being when we start getting significant orders and deliveries. So that'll be a timeframe we're gonna know but it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's uncertain everybody's kind of awaiting that that that time period sorry and then just the commentary on revenues for commercialization assuming it excludes the divestitures so look at the ninety million quarterly run rate and then my last question how to think about the corporate expense line you know as as we look to twenty twenty one any color there thanks yeah so you're right on that commercial exactly right excluding the ninety million and then on the On the corporate, of course, parts was part of the centralized so that five million drops right to the corporate line, so you could see that five million drop that's where that was traditionally shown as a centralized parts business okay, great, thank you yeah, thank you our next question is from courtney yacovinos with morgan stanley. please proceed hi, thanks good morning, guys just a follow-up The comment you know appreciate that there will be a mix shift in recreation next year. I think you said you expect you know in line with the industry wholesale shipments up about twenty percent but i think you had said that you were expecting mid single digit margins and i think we've historically been seeing more high single digit margins out of that segment. So just wanted to make sure i've fully understood what you were thinking the mix shift impact would have on twenty twenty one. Given that class a's been weak for some time now yeah, we've traditionally seen mid single digits. so, you know, what we determine as mid, right, five to five to seven percent. so that's probably in line with what we've historically done. but the mix shift really is what i referred to with jerry's question is again at forty percent of our sales being in the arv or our class a business. you know, those as you know are depressed margins. so those bring down the ones that are a double digit. From a run rate perspective, so it's really the fact that our v, our what we call our v, our class a, was actually down from a mix, so as they come more to the forty to fifty percent range, i'd be forty percent in a quarter versus fifty percent in the prior year, so you had a ten percent drop there from a mix perspective. and so it's really that that simple as far as looking at the other three businesses that we have in that portfolio at double digit and bringing in a lower single digit mix from a mix perspective. Class a will actually depress those ten percent down to the more of the five to seven percent range. okay, that's helpful. and then any more specificity you could give us just on commercial and ethane margins as we think about impact next year, obviously appreciating that it's going to be dependent on your delivery schedule, but any high-level thoughts on the margin side? From the whole commercial side, but obviously, on the capacity, if you're talking about capacity, that's you know, that's one we're still with the backlog here. So, as i said, my prepared remarks, we took the opportunity to a lot of the units that we had developed, coming into the what our normal selling season is, didn't develop, but exiting the quarter, we were very happy with some of the progress we made and our backlog is now performing so we should see the variability get out of there. when we look at the total commercial segment, we would expect the high single sort of what we were expecting coming in a quarter if we wouldn't have had the issues that we experienced on the commercial side and the liquidation that we did on some of our stock units. so we would expect it to get more like we guided to last time, more of the mid or the high single digits for the commercial segment. okay, got it. and then i guess just lastly, you mentioned concerns about delivery schedules for next year. but if you had to just highlight what are the three Categories that have the most variability or your most concerned about versus the ones that are or that you feel most confident in the delivery schedules for next year just just so we can get a sense of of where the real risk is in by categories you mean the business units or the product categories i yeah i guess i just meant within the business units you know obviously your recreation that's pretty strong so do you feel like that's that's pretty strong You know, where you have the most certainty you know, versus some of the product lines in, for example, and commercial i think that, you know, the i'll comment and let mark clean up what i say. i think that when you think about in markets that are affected by the the issues, i think primarily obviously in market demand in the in the school bus businesses is the issue all the businesses that are subject to some level of supplier issues that we're dealing with. i think r v is probably the one that we've seen. the most stock outs which is pretty consistent across the industry the other element that we deal with a little bit is the timing issue not a impact probably within the fiscal year is just the inspections that have to take place in ambulances and fire around getting a bus off the lot or a truck or an ambulance off the lot related to completing final inspections by getting people to the site that's a real issue that we we've been dealing with in terms of revenue recognition cause that's a real issue that we we've been dealing with in terms of revenue recognition cause that's a real issue that we we've been dealing with in terms of revenue recognition cause that's a real issue that we we've been dealing with in terms of revenue recognition cause that's a real issue that we we've been dealing with in terms of To happen in order for us to to convert the bus so i think you know in in school buses it certainly is is it's in market demand there's some some supply issues that are spread throughout that we've been able to overcome for the most part but they are they do pop up and and we have to work through that and and then the last thing would be the businesses that are subject to inspections which is you know your your emergency segment is where we see that at mark i don't know if you want to add anything no i think that's right i think as we said previously one of the things that we thought would happen here is it's in market demand there's some some supply issues that are spread throughout that we've been able to overcome for the most part but they are they do pop up and and we have to work through that and and then the Covid as people converted like people working from home we expected that more people would adopt virtual inspections for our ambulances and fire trucks. and as exiting covid our customers have come back to wanting to see their trucks in person and which is a resurge here we're hoping that they'll go back to virtual but we have shifted back to wanting to do in-person inspections so we haven't seen them going back to virtual so obviously there is some flux there if people would go back to virtual Inspections, depending on what happens with the covid environment. but we are back to our traditional, as robert referred to, actually seeing the units before they leave the the yard so that we can revenue them. and that's really the delays that i was speaking to. it's really our customers coming in and inspecting the units and approving them for shipment. great, thanks. as a reminder, this star one on your telephone keypad, if you would like to ask a question, our next question Is from raj patel with jeffries. please proceed. hey, thanks for taking the question. quick one on f and e margins. what's the anticipated f and e margin expansion once all the production and efficiencies are sorted out. what do you think the new margin profile looks like in a new normal? Reiterated multiple times, we're still in a multiple-ending journey here. So as he's referred to on the e1, we still have a lot of work to do. We're seeing progression, but of course, we have other facilities within the portfolio, too, that we're going to address, as they say, in my prepared remarks. So we're still expecting to be in the double digits at the end of this journey, but we're still working through that, right? So of course, we're not given guidance here, but again, it's still in a multiple-year perspective to get to that ten. We're just happy to see the progress here that we've seen throughout the quarter and obviously our forward looking we'll provide more guidance in april. yeah, i think it's a success. there's there's yeah, you know, when you think about operational improvements and and how you walk down that what mark referred to as a multi-year journey when you come into the role you're there's some quick things you can do to get pop and get an improvement and then it's about building capabilities and i mentioned from an operational excellence standpoint you know, there's some quick things you can do to get pop and get an improvement and then it's about building capabilities and i mentioned from an operational excellence standpoint you know, there's some quick things you can do to get pop and get an improvement and then it's about building capabilities Standing up the lean capabilities and and center led type activities that get implemented in the plants around ci around purchasing building engineering capabilities to get design costs through viae those are the things that that you have to do for capability building but the good thing is that it's a continual improvement continual improve process where you're going to be getting at that every day by building pipelines to go execute against so we're in the process right now coming out of our operating model discussion of standing up the lean capabilities and and center led type activities that get implemented in the plants around ci around purchasing building engineering capabilities to get design costs through viae those are the things that that you have to do for capability building but the good thing is that it's a continual improvement continual improve process where you're going to be getting at that every day by building pipelines to go execute against so we those capabilities and building out those teams and doing the certifications that mark talked about through lean that are going to yield benefit to us for a very, very long time. things that did not exist now we're standing up those capabilities and bringing on rob to lead our purchasing organization and get focus on that significant spend i think it's going to yield great benefit to us too. so those all contribute to a margin expansion story not only in emergency but across the business and so that's a but it does take work to stand it up. it starts with organizing. The lining and the investing in those capability building and then driving it through process rigor each, each day, each week, each month that's helpful, thank you our next question is from mr. dobry with baird, please proceed thanks, good morning, guys a big question on chassis is, as you're looking at your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your from production planning based on your backlog are there any portions in your business where you're getting a sense that you're having either challenges obtaining chassis or the delivery timelines are extended and look, i mean, i'm thinking specifically around ambulances and in some of the stuff in recreation as well, like you know, class b's and so on no, no, miguel, i'm glad to say and we we're not experiencing those. in fact, you know, we've we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we've had we pretty good supply chain from that perspective. so i was happy this quarter not to be talking about chassis shortages for once, even though it's only my second one so i know you've heard that consistently. so we've been very happy with that. in fact, you know, in the rv side especially, we um we took advantage of what the our run rates were going to be and actually ordered ahead. so we're actually sitting with plenty of chassis from that perspective and in that business. and then on the ambulance side, we haven't had any issues from a chassis perspective. we've been getting our appropriate allocations from our oe partners. okay, that's helpful. and then maybe my follow-up sort of sticking with this theme, how do you think about steel prices and raw material inflation in twenty twenty one? what are some of the steps that you've taken and mitigate this because obviously historically this has been a big issue. Area where we've been some trouble in prior years. thank you so i mean, obviously, on the parts of our business, which large part of our businesses build out a backlog you know, there's always the, the, the issue you're trying to offset inflation with your efficiency efforts because you you've your purchase prices established on a backlog based business. so we're managing that obviously, a big part of what rob's efforts are going to be is to look at new purchasing and be able to offset that within a fiscal year. So we can cycle through and get the margins that we need on a price-cost basis. but so it's a lot around driving efficiency to make sure that that we're doing everything we can to optimize our cost structure to to have any leverage that does come through inflation into a backlogged business, we can offset through other other means. and mark, i don't know if you want anything to that or not. i think that's right. and that's one of the things that i am working personally with rob on, make sure we understand those inflationary factors as we go through twenty twenty one as well as our agreements with our supply base. That's one of the things that the robots can acclimate to, and we're there's obviously a heightened focus in those businesses where we don't have the longer backlogs. we've obviously come out with some price increases as our competitors have. so we're managing that with the supply base as well as our customers. i do think one of the things, you know, many things we're working on is is trying to get in front of how we think about price, price as a function of inflation and to make sure when you think about a price increase, or setting a price, that we're setting a price that reflects the function of inflation. In the market, that you're thinking about the build cycle of when that that vehicle will get built so you reflect some inflationary characteristics in your costing in the business and in value. most of our businesses have done that to some degree, but that's a something i think that we got to get great around because when you're working on a backlog-based business and you're doing deliveries you got to be thinking about the inflationary times that you're in and making sure that you're you're costing that vehicle to such a degree that by the time you're doing the deliveries you've got to be thinking about the inflationary times that you're in and making sure that you're you're costing that vehicle to such a degree that by the time you're doing the deliveries you've got to be thinking Or your you're shipping the vehicle that you've anticipated any inflationary costs and your price and cost absolutely i understand that i guess i'm just wondering based on what you know today do you believe you're you're going to be in a position where you can be neutral from a price cost standpoint going forward or should we try to bake in some kind of a headwind thank you yeah, i think based on the data we have now relative to price cost, the efficiency efforts that we've got in the business should yield some cost savings. Is a minimum neutrality in our performance going forward in the fiscal year. appreciate it. good luck. thanks, mike. as a reminder, to star one on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question. we will pause for a brief moment to pull for a final question. there are no more questions at this time. i would like to turn the conference back over to rod for closing comments ok, great, well, thank you again for joining and i appreciate the questions. you know, it's again, i want to take a moment as we close out a fiscal year and a nine month period for myself and then think about all the changes that we've made both in process and structure and people to thank our team for for what's been a pretty whirlwind year considering all the external factors that we've had to deal with. Situations that all of us have dealt with, on top of that new leadership coming in and expecting to do things a different way and maybe change some thinking. i want to compliment our leadership team and also thank our frontline employees and in what they've done to serve our customers and also serve this nation in getting these necessary vehicles out and out to our communities. so again, i appreciate your time today. i look forward to seeing you all in april when we'll have a deeper discussion around where we're taking this business going forward. have a great day. have a great day. Thank you, this does conclude today's conference. you may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."

ON TO OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES DURING OUR SECOND QUARTER ANALYST CALL I DISCUSSED THE RETURN TO NORMAL BUSINESS LEVELS FOR A COUPLE OF OUR LARGE TRANSPORT CUSTOMERS THAT TEMPORARILY CURTAILED OPERATIONS AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC AND THAT WE WERE NOT SEEING ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS WITH OUR TRANSPORT CUSTOMERS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER 2020 OUR TRANSPORT REVENUES AND VOLUMES WERE ABOVE THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019 AND ON A YEAR-TO-DATE COMPARISON BETWEEN YEARS OUR TRANSPORT REVENUES HAVE ERASED THE SECOND QUARTER 2020 IMPACT AND ARE NOW FLAT YEAR-OVER-YEAR WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG INTEREST IN NATURAL GAS FROM BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS CAPITAL SPENDING TO EX- EXTEND OUR SERVICE TO REACH NEW CUSTOMERS IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER BEHIND OUR INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES GUIDANCE FOR 2020 AS WE DESCRIBED LAST QUARTER DESPITE THE PANDEMIC WE'RE SEEING POSITIVE ECONOMIC SIGNS ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT PARTICULARLY IN TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA AS AN EXAMPLE IN THE AUSTIN AREA THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 100 NEW BUSINESS RELOCATIONS OR EXPANSIONS ANNOUNCED THUS FAR IN 2020 WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE OVER 14,000 ADDITIONAL NEW JOBS THIS INCREASE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ACROSS OUR TERRITORIES HAS RESULTED

CONTINUED PROVIDING SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITH MINIMAL DISRUPTIONS FINALLY IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE ONE GAS EMPLOYEES AND GIVE EACH OF THEM A SPECIAL THANK YOU FOR THEIR CONTINUED PROFESSIONALISM UNDER STRESS RESOLVE WHEN THERE IS NO CLEAR END IN SIGHT AND POISE IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC BY RELYING ON THE VALUES THAT WE ANCHOR OUR COMPANY TO AS WE ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES AND THAT FACE OUR BUSINESS THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING OPERATOR WE'RE NOW READY FOR QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION YOU MAY SIGNAL BY PRESSING * 1 ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU ARE USING A SPEAKER PHONE PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU'RE MUTE FUNCTION IS TURNED OFF TO ALLOW YOUR SIGNAL TO REACH OUR EQUIPMENT AGAIN THAT IS * 1 TO ASK A QUESTION AND WE'LL PAUSE FOR JUST A MOMENT TO ALLOW EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNAL ALL RIGHT AND THE FIRST QUESTION IS FROM RICHARD CICIARELLI WITH BANK OF AMERICA HEY GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY WE CAN GOOD MORNING RICHARD HEY THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION UM I WAS JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU GUY ARE- ARE THINKING ABOUT UM COVID IN- INTO PEAK WINTER HEATING SEASON HERE AND I REALIZE OGS HAS THE HIGHER PROPORTION OF RESIDENTIAL VERSUS C&I TRANSPORT CUSTOMERS BUT HOW ARE YOU UH THINKING ABOUT FACTORING THE LINGERING IMPACT ESPECIALLY WITH THE RESURGENCE OF CASES AS YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT YOUR 2021 OUTLOOK AND THE MOVING PIECES AND MAYBE JUST ALSO COMMENT ON UH THE EQUITY NEEDS UH INTO NEXT YEAR AS WELL RICHARD IT'S SID LET ME START AND THROW TO CURTIS FOR THE COMMERCIAL PART OF THAT QUESTION AND THEN CARON CAN COME IN ON THE END IN TERMS OF THE FINANCING QUESTION WE HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR WINTER UH SINCE MARCH WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT WE WOULD SEE A SECOND WAVE AND THAT WE WOULD SEE SOME CO-MINGLING OF COVID AND THE FLU SO OUR MEDICAL PROTOCOLS WERE BUILT WITH THAT IN MIND UH WE HAVE NOT SEEN CONSTRAINTS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORIES AND OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE DONE A REMARKABLE JOB OF PROACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD PROVIDE THEM WITH THE BEST MEDICAL ADVICE TO KEEP THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR CUSTOMERS SAFE BUT ALSO TO ALLOW US TO TAMP DOWN ANY WIDESPREAD UH UNAVAILABILITY OF EMPLOYEES IN ANY OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORIES SO WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE WELL PREPARED UM WE DON'T SAY THAT SPIKE IN THE BALL ON THE 50 WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A CHALLENGING TIME AHEAD OF US BUT WE THINK WE'RE AS WELL PREPARED AS WE CAN BE SO LET ME TOSS TO CURTIS TO RESPOND TO THE COMMERCIAL QUESTION SO RICHARD ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE OF THINGS AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A VERY HIGH PERCENT OF OUR- OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE BEING RESIDENTIAL UM AND THEN ABOUT 12% THAT'S OUR TRANSPORT CUSTOMERS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT UH I NOTED IN MY COMMENTS IS THAT WE'RE REALLY NOT SEEING AN IMPACT AT THIS POINT FROM OUR TRANSPORT CUSTOMERS SO WE'VE SEEMED TO HAVE RETURNED TO A NORMAL LEVEL OF OPERATIONS AND HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED THE GAP WITH THE ACTIVITY WE SAW IN THE THIRD QUARTER CLOSING THE GAP FROM UH WHAT WE SAW DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE OF THINGS I THINK WE'RE WELL PREPARED IN OUR CUSTOMER CALL CENTERS TO PRE- UH TO HANDLE THE CALL VOLUME THAT WE TYPICALLY RUN INTO THIS TIME OF THE YEAR ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE MORATORIUMS BEING LIFTED WHEN THEY WERE UH THE END OF MAY FOR OKLAHOMA AND KANSAS AND A LITTLE BIT LATER IN TEXAS IS THAT WHILE THOSE MORATORIUMS WERE IN PLACE SID'S OPERATIONS TEAMS WERE ABLE TO DIVERT THOSE RESOURCES TO HANDLE A LOT OF OUR OTHER NORMAL ANNUAL ACTIVITIES AND TO GET SOME OF THOSE THINGS- GET AHEAD OF THOSE ACTIVITIES SUCH THAT WHEN THE MORATORIUMS WERE LIFTED WE WERE ABLE TO FOCUS MORE OF OUR RESOURCES ON THE DISCONNECT PROCESS WHICH HELPED WITH OUR COLLECTIONS THROUGH THAT PERIOD SO UM SEVERAL UH FACTORS THAT WE HAD TO- TO REMAIN AGILE TO HANDLE DURING THE YEAR BUT UH COOPERATION AND THE WORK BETWEEN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS TEAMS HELPED US WORK THROUGH THAT PART OF IT TO BE READY WHEN WE COULD AGAIN RESUME DISCONNECTS AND THAT'S HELPED OUR OVERALL PROCESS THE LAST PIECE I WOULD SAY IS UM AS CARON TALKED ABOUT WE DO HAVE THE REGULATORY ACCOUNTING ORDERS IN EACH OF OUR JURISDICTIONS UH WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES FOR INCREASED EXPENSES AS WELL AS AREAS WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DECREASE EXPENSES UM SO THAT- AND CONTINUE TO ACCUMULATE THOSE UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO UH GO THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS TO BEGIN RECOVERY OF THOSE SO I'LL PICK UP ON THE FINANCING QUESTION WE HAVE NOT UPDATED OUR LONGER TERM GUIDANCE FOR FINANCING WHICH CURRENTLY IS THAT WE ANTICIPATE $850 MILLION TO $900 MILLION OF NET FUNDS <INAUDIBLE> OR WITH ABOUT A QUARTER OF THAT BEING EQUITY UH WHEN WE ISSUE OUR GUIDANCE FOR 2021 WHICH WE EXPECTED TO DO PROBABLY SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR WE'LL PROVIDE A CLOSER LOOK ON WHAT 2021 LOOKS LIKE OKAY GOT IT THAT'S UH THAT'S VERY HELPFUL APPRECIATE ALL THE COLOR THERE AND MAYBE JUST UH SWITCHING GEARS HERE OBVIOUSLY WITH UH ELECTIONS ON TOP OF MIND JUST CURIOUS HOW UH YOU'RE- YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DECARBONIZATION GOALS AND JUST GIVEN REALLY SOME OF THE UM POTENTIAL FOR ELECTRIFICATION IN BUILDINGS AND SOME OF THE SUPPLY AND COST CONSTRAINTS ON THE RNG SIDE I MEAN IS THAT REALLY THE SOLUTION OR- OR IS GREEN HYDROGEN POTENTIALLY A MORE LIKELY CANDIDATE JUST- JUST MAYBE CURIOUS IF YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME THOUGHTS UH OVERALL ON TIMING AND WHEN WE CAN SEE MORE FORMAL ADOPTION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION RICHARD UM THIS IS CURTIS AGAIN SO ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT EFFORTS WE'VE HAD AROUND RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS UM THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND DEVELOPERS THAT WE'RE TALKING TO UM SOME ALREADY CAPTURED RNG AND USE IT FOR ALTERNATIVE USES WHAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO BRING TO THE TABLE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE COMMERCIAL ECONOMICS OF THAT CAPTURED GAS SO BY BRINGING IT INTO OUR SYSTEM AND GETTING IT TRACKED THROUGH TO BE USED AS REPLACEMENT FOR DIESEL OR OTHER PRODUCTS THROUGH COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS AND SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE IN A POSITION THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS AS WE MOVE INTO NEXT YE- <INAUDIBLE> WE'VE PROVEN UH UM THE COMMERCIAL ABILITY OF THOSE PROJECTS AND WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE GAS STANDARDS AND EVERYTHING THAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO TO BRING THAT PRODUCT INTO OUR SYSTEM SO AGAIN WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THAT WE'RE ALSO UH IN AN H2@SCALE PROJECT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AND SOME OTHER PARTIES INCLUDING THE DOE TO RUN SOME DIFFERENT SCALE PROJECTS UM CONVERTING OR PRODUCING HYDROGEN BOTH FROM RENEWABLE POWER AS WELL AS FROM LANDFILL GAS AND THEN USING THAT- THAT HYDROGEN THAT'S PRODUCED TO RUN A COMPUTER CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AS WELL AS PROVIDE FUEL FOR HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO THAT PROJECT JUST STARTED EARLIER IN THE MID-PART ACTUALLY OF 2020 SO IT'S ABOUT A THREE-YEAR PROJECT BUT <INAUDIBLE> PROMISING RESULTS COME OUT OF THAT I'M GOING TO TURN IT TO SID AND HE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE OPERATIONS SIDE ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF HYDROGEN <INAUDIBLE> YEAH RICHARD THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION UM AS YOU KNOW THERE IS A COMMERCIAL COMPONENT TO THIS AN RND COMPONENT AS YOU POINT OUT BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS UH THAT COMPANIES NEED TO CONSIDER AS- AS EMERGENT OPPORTUNITIES LIKE HYDROGEN START TO BE DEVELOPED WE HAVE TWO WORKING GROUPS IN PLACE CURRENTLY ONE IS LOOKING AT TECHNICAL ISSUES INCLUDING THE ENGINEERING IMPLICATIONS THERE WILL BE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AROUND HYDRODEN- HYDROGEN USE AND THERE ARE ALSO SOME SYSTEM INTEGRITY IMPLICATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN INTRODUCE HYDROGEN AT THE PROPER BLENDING RATE AND HANDLE THAT SAFELY IN TERMS OF CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON SAFETY OF OUR SYSTEM THE SECOND IS AN- A REALLY INTERESTING WORKING GROUP THAT'S LOOKING AT THE GAS SUPPLY IMPLICATIONS A HYDROGEN IS A DIFFERENT MATERIAL TO COMPRESS AND TRANSPORT AND SO THE LOCATION OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COMES INTO PLAY WE'RE SCOPING ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW AND EXCITED ABOUT CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH FOR- FOR ALL THE COLOR THERE UH THAT'S ALL I HAD ALL RIGHT ONCE AGAIN THAT IS * 1 TO ASK A QUESTION IF YOU FIND YOUR QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED YOU MAY REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE QUEUE BY PRESSING * 2 THE NEXT QUESTION IS FROM AND I APOLOGIZE IF I SAY THIS INCORRECTLY AGA- UH <UNK> WITH UBS GOOD MORNING MORNING AGA C- COULD YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON BAD DEBT AND HOW IS IT TRENDING THIS YEAR AS WE HEAD INTO WINTER SURE GOOD MORNING AGA THIS IS CARON SO WE'RE STILL UH AS CURTIS DESCRIBED SOME OF OUR COLLECTIONS ACTIVITY UH THAT'S STILL- THAT'S STILL AT PLACE SO WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE COVID IMPACT CERTAINLY BY A LONG STRETCH WE CURRENTLY UM ARE $8.8 MILLION AT BAD DEBT EXPENSE THROUGH THE NINE MONTHS THAT COMPARES TO $4.6 MILLION LAST YEAR SO WE'RE UP ABOUT $4 MILLION YEAR-OVER-YEAR AND AGAIN WE JUST WORK TO MONITOR THE SITUATION WE- UH THERE ARE STILL MORA- MORATORIUMS IN PLACE IN SOME OF THE SERVICE AREAS AND SO UNTIL WE GET COMPLETELY BACK TO NORMAL COLLECTIONS ACTIVITIES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO REALLY DETERMINE WHAT THE IMPACT HAS BEEN AND UH HOW THE CHANGE IN KANSAS RELATED TO ELIMINATING STATE INCOME TAXES FROM RATES COULD IMPACT ONE GAS' CASH FLOW GOING FORWARD IT ISN'T EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS IT'S NOT A- NOT A LARGE IN OUR OVERALL TAX PICTURE THE ELIMINATION OF THE STATE INCOME TAX IS NOT A LARGE EVENT <INAUDIBLE> THE LAST QUESTION FROM ME TO FOLLOW-UP ON RICHARD'S QUESTION ON DECARBONIZATION IS THERE A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN PLACE TO INVEST IN RNG ACROSS YOUR JURISDICTIONS WE HAVE TARIFFS ESTABLISHED TO POTENTIALLY COVER SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN RNG ANY COLOR WOULD BE HELPFUL SURE AGA THIS IS CURTIS RNG IS ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATED IN THE TARIFFS IN TEXAS IT IS A RECOVERABLE GAS COST THERE UM SO THAT- THAT WAS- THAT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONTEMPLATED AS- AS PART OF THE GAS SUPPLY PICTURE IN OKLAHOMA THERE WAS LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IN THE LAST SESSION TO COMPEL THE COMMISSION TO STUDY RNG AND TO LOOK AT WAYS TO BRING RNG INTO THE OKLAHOMA GAS SUPPLY WITH THE PANDEMIC STARTING THAT WAS NOT A BILL THAT WAS CONSIDERED

Operating costs for the third quarter were point eight million dollars higher compared to the same period last year. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a one point five million increase in employer-related costs, off-setting a portion of those cost increases is a reduction in expenses of dollars for travel and employee training costs that have been impacted by the pandemic. We have not recorded any regulatory assets for financial accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting orders received in all jurisdictions that allow us to defer for regulatory purposes certain net increases and expenses and lost revenues due to COVID-19.

We have no plans to issue equity for the remainder of twenty twenty. NOW: ALTERNATIVE DECISIONS FOR OUR REGULATORY AND COMMERCIAL UPDATE. THANK YOU KAREN AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. FIRST I'LL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF RECENT REGULATORY ACTIVITY AND THEN PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES. KANSAS GAS SERVICE FILED A GAS SYSTEM A LIABILITY SURCHARGE OR G S R S THAT SEEKS AN INCREASE IN RATE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCURRED DURING THE PERIOD COVERING JULY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THROUGH JUNE TWENTY TWO AN ORDER FROM THE K C S I IS EXPECTED IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH NEW RATES GOING INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY TEXAS GAS SERVICE FILED THEIR RATE CASE IN DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN FOR ALL CUSTOMERS IN THE CENTRAL T AND GULF COAST SERVICE AREAS SEEKING A RATE INCREASE AND REQUESTING TO CONSOLIDATE THE TWO SERVICE AREAS. IN AUGUST, THE RAILROAD COMMISSION APPROVED ALL TERMS OF A TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATION OF THE CENTRAL TEXAS SERVICE AREA AND THE GULF COAST SERVICE AREA INTO A NEW GULF SERVICE AREA. THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF OUR STRATEGY TO CONSOLIDATE JURISDICTIONS WHICH ARE It is a benefit to customers due primarily to a more efficient process. With this latest consolidation, we now have five jurisdictions in Texas, down from ten at the time of spin-off in two thousand and fourteen. Moving on to our commercial activities, during our second quarter analyst call, I discussed the return to normal business levels for a couple of our large trades. Transport customers that had temporarily curtailed operations at the start of the pandemic and that we were not seeing any other significant disruptions with our transport customers. For the third quarter twenty twenty, our transport revenues and volumes were above the same period in twenty nineteen and on a year-to-date comparison between years, our transport revenues have erased the second quarter twenty twenty impact and are now flat year over year. WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG INTEREST IN NATURAL GAS FROM BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS CAPITAL SPENDING TO EXTEND OUR SERVICE TO REACH NEW CUSTOMERS IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER BEHIND OUR INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES GUIDANCE FOR TWENTY TWENTY AS WE DESCRIBED LAST QUARTER DESPITE THE PANDEMIC WE'RE SEEING POSITIVE ECONOMIC SIGNS ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT PARTICULARLY IN TEXAS AND OHIO There have been over one hundred new business relocations or expansions announced thus far in twenty twenty which are expected to provide over fourteen thousand additional new jobs. This increase in economic activity across our territories has resulted in continued growth in our customer base. To date, we have averaged approximately twenty four thousand more sales customers than the same period last year. This increase includes the connection of... Eighteen thousand six hundred new customers compared with fourteen thousand six hundred new customers in the same period last year or a twenty seven percent increase over last year's figures. As I described during our last two quarterly analyst calls, the impact of the moratoriums on disconnects for non-payment by our customers which expired in may in oklahoma and kansas and early october in some areas of texas. HAS ALSO IMPACTED OUR AVERAGE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND NOW I'LL TURN IT OVER TO SID FOR AN UPDATE ON OPERATIONS THANKS CURTIS OUR TEAM IN THE FIELD CONTINUES TO ADOPT WELL TO THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WITH MAINTENANCE AND COMPLIANCE WORK ON OR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN REMAINS UNINTERRUPTED AND WE SEE NO FORWARD CONSTRAINTS TO OUR PLANNED WORK THANKS TO STABLE PERFORMANCE BY OUR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TEAM RELATED TO MATERIALS AND CONTRACTOR RE SOURCES AS CAREN MENTIONED WHILE OUR CAPITAL SPEND WAS LOWER THIS QUARTER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF LAST YEAR THE ISSUE IS TIMING RATHER THAN PERFORMANCE WE HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH THE CADENCE OF CAPITAL EXECUTION YEAR TO DATE WITH MORE CONSISTENT CAPITAL SPEND QUARTER TO QUARTER THAN LAST YEAR DUE TO FAVORABLE WEATHER AND IMPROVED PLANNING BY OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT ENGINEERING AND FIELD OPERATIONS TEAMS WE REMAIN ON TRACK TO MEET OUR CAPITAL EXP AND NOW I'LL TURN IT OVER TO PIERCE THANK YOU KAREN FERGUSON AND SID THE PANDEMIC HAS CHANGED MANY THINGS FOR MANY PEOPLE OUR HOMES HAVE BECOME THE PLACE WHERE WE SPEND MORE AND MORE TIME OUR CUSTOMERS TAKE COMFORT IN THE WARMTH OF OUR THAT OUR PRODUCT PROVIDES ESPECIALLY AS WE HEAD INTO COLDER WEATHER AS WE NEAR THE END OF THE YEAR IT'S NATURAL TO REFLECT ON HOW WE HOW FAR WE'D COME FOR ME Three things stand out: our resilience, adaptability, and commitment to safety. Our performance this year demonstrates the resilience of our business model and the continued value of natural gas as a preferred energy source for homes and businesses. This year, we were able to grow our customer base, improve system integrity, and establish a remote workforce amidst great adversity. CHALLENGES BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC OUR INDUSTRY IS ACCUSTOMED TO FRONT-LINE RESPONSE ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION WE QUICKLY IMPLEMENTED ADDITIONAL SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND NEW PROCESSES DESIGNED TO KEEP OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR CUSTOMERS SAFE DURING THE PANDEMIC THANKS TO THE ADAPTIBILITY AND DILGENCE OF EACH EMPLOYEE WE HAVE CONTINUED PROVIDING SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITH MINIMAL DISRUPTIONS FINALLY, IN CLOSING, I'D LIKE To the one gas employees and give each of them a special thank you for their continued professionalism under stress, resolve when there's no clear end in sight, employees in the face of uncertainty. We'll get through this pandemic by relying on the values that we anchor our company to as we address the challenges and that face our business. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Operator, we're now ready for questions. ALL RIGHT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION YOU MAY SIGNAL BY PRESSING STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU WERE USING A SPEAKER PHONE PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR MUTE FUNCTION IS TURNED OFF TO ALLOW YOUR SIGNAL TO REACH OUR EQUIPMENT AGAIN THAT IS STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION AND WE WILL PAUSE FOR JUST A MOMENT TO ALLOW EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNAL ALRIGHT, AND THE FIRST QUESTION IS FROM RICHARD CICERO WITH BANK OF AMERICA.\n\nHEY, GOOD MORNING. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK?\n\nWE CAN. GOOD MORNING, RICHARD.\n\nHEY, THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION. UM, I WAS JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU GUYS ARE AR ARE THINKING ABOUT COVID AND INTO PEAK WINTER HEATING SEASON HERE AND I REALIZE O G S HAS A HIGHER PROPORTION OF RESIDENTIAL VERSUS C N I TRANSPORT CUSTOMERS BUT HOW ARE YOU THINK FACTORING THE LINGERING IMPACT ESPECIALLY WITH THE RESURGENCE OF CASES AS YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT YOUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUTLOOK AND THE MOVING PIECES AND MAYBE JUST ALSO COMMENT ON THE EQUITY NEEDS INTO NEXT YEAR AS WELL RICHARD IT HAS LET ME START AND THROW IT TO CURTIS FOR THE COMMERCIAL PART OF THAT QUESTION AND THEN KAREN CAN COME IN ON THE END IN TERMS OF THE FINANCING QUESTION WE HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR WINTER SINCE MARCH WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT WE WOULD SEE A SECOND WAVE AND THAT WE WOULD SEE SOME COMMINGLING OF COVID AND THE FLU SO OUR MEDICAL PROTOCOLS WERE BUILT WITH THAT IN MIND WE HAVE NOT SEEN CONSTRAINTS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORIES AND OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE DONE A REMARKABLE JOB OF PROACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD PROVIDE THEM WITH THE BEST MEDICAL ADVICE TO KEEP THEM AND Families and our customers are safe but also to allow us to tamp down any widespread unavailability of employees in any of our service territories. So we feel like we're well prepared. We don't say that spiking the ball on the fifty. We recognize that there is a challenging time ahead of us but we think we're as well prepared as we can be. So let me toss this to Curtis to respond to the commercial question. We know we have a very high percent of our customer base being residential and then about twelve percent that's our transport customers. One of the things that i noted in my comment is that we're really not seeing an impact at this point from our transport customers. So we seem to have returned to a normal level of operations and have actually closed the gap with the activity we saw on the third quarter closing the gap from what we saw during the second quarter. This year, I'm on the residential side of things. I think we're well prepared in our customer call centers to handle the call volume that we typically run into this time of the year. One of the good things about the moratoriums being lifted when they were at the end of May for Oklahoma and Kansas and a little bit later in Texas is that while those moratoriums were in place, our operations teams were able to divert those resources. To handle a lot of our other normal annual activities and to get some of those things, get ahead of those activities such that when the moratoriums were lifted, we were able to focus more of our resources on the disconnect process, which helped with our collections during that period. So several factors that we had to remain agile to handle during the year, but cooperation and the work between our commercial operations teams helped this process. THROUGH THAT PART OF IT TO BE READY WHEN WE COULD AGAIN RESUME DISCONNECTS AND THAT'S HELPED OUR OVERALL PROCESS THE LAST PIECE I WOULD SAY IS THAT BARRAN TALKED ABOUT WE DO HAVE THE REGULATORY ACCOUNTING ORDERS IN EACH OF OUR JURISDICTIONS I WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES FOR INCREASED EXPENSES AS WELL AS AREAS WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DECREASE EXPENSES SO THAT AND CONTINUE TO ACCUMULATE THOSE UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO I will pick up on the financing question. We have not updated our longer-term guidance for financing, which currently is that we anticipate $850 million to $900 million of net financing needs with about a quarter of that being equity. When we issue our guidance for 2021, which we expect to do probably sometime at the first of the year, we will provide a closer look on what 2021 looks like. AH, THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. APPRECIATE ALL THE COLOR THERE. AND MAYBE JUST SWITCHING GEARS HERE OBVIOUSLY WITH THE ELECTIONS ON TOP OF MINE. JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DECARBONIZATION GOALS AND JUST GIVING REALLY SOME OF THE POTENTIAL FOR ELECTRIFICATION IN BUILDINGS AND SOME OF THE SUPPLY AND COST CONSTRAINTS ON THE R AND D SIDE. I MEAN, IS THAT REALLY THE SOLUTION OR OR IS GREEN HYDROGEN POTENTIALLY A MORE LIKELY CANDIDATE? JUST MAY Overall, on timing and when we can see more formal adoption of these technologies. Another good question, Richard. This is Curtis again. So, on the commercial side, I've talked before about efforts we've had around renewable natural gas. There are several different projects and developers that we're talking to. Some already capture RNG and use it for alternative uses. What we may be able to bring to the table is what we may be able to bring to the table is what we may be able to bring to the table is what we may be able to bring to the table is what we may be able to bring to the table is what we may be able to bring to the table is what we may be able to bring to the table is what we may be able to bring to the table is what we may be able to bring to the table is what we may be able to Table is the opportunity to improve the commercial economics of that captured gas. So by bringing it into our system and getting it tracked through to be used as replacement for diesel or other products through compressed natural gas. And so we're continuing to explore and hopefully will be in a position that we have some of those projects as we move into next year. We've proven the commercial. ABILITY OF THOSE PROJECTS AND WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE GAS STANDARDS AND EVERYTHING THAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO TO BRING THAT PRODUCT INTO OUR SYSTEM. SO AGAIN, WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THAT. WE'RE ALSO IN AN H2 TO SCALE PROJECT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS THAT'S IN OTHER PARTIES INCLUDING DOE TO RUN SOME DIFFERENT SCALE PROJECTS OF CONVERTING OR PRODUCING HYDROGEN BOTH FROM RENEWABLE POWER AS WELL AS FROM LANDFILL GAS AND THEN USING THAT THAT HYDROGEN THAT'S PRODUCED TO RUN A COMPUTER CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AS WELL AS PROVIDE FUEL FOR HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO THAT PROJECT JUST STARTED EARLIER IN THE MID PART ACTUALLY OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S ABOUT A THREE YEAR PROJECT BUT IT'S PROMISING RESULTS COME OUT OF THAT THEN I'M GONNA TURN IT TO SIT AND HE CAN TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WH Discussion Sides Analyzing the Facts of Hydrogen Yet, Richard, thank you for the question. As you know, there is a commercial component to this, an R and D component, as you point out. But there are also some practical implications that companies need to consider as, as emergent opportunities like hydrogen start to be developed. We have two working groups in place currently. One is looking at technical issues, the other is looking at business opportunities. Including the engineering implications, there will be policies and procedures around hydrogen hydrogen use and there are also some system integrity implications to make sure that you can introduce hydrogen at the proper blending rate and handle that safely in terms of continuing to focus on safety of our system the second is an a really interesting working group that's looking at the gas supply implications hydrogen is a different material to PROCESS AND TRANSPORT AND SO THE LOCATION OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COMES INTO PLAY WE'RE SCOOPING ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW AND EXCITED ABOUT CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE COLOUR THERE THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ALL RIGHT ONCE AGAIN THAT IS STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION IF YOU FIND YOUR QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED YOU MAY REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE CUE BY PRESSING STAR TWO The next question is from, and I apologize if I say this incorrectly, Agha Moghaddam with UBS. Good morning. Good morning. Agha, could you give us an update on Bed Bath and Beyond and how is it trending this year as we head into winter? Sure. Good morning, Agha. It's Karen. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? SOME MORTUARIES IN PLACE IN SOME OF THE SERVICE AREAS AND SO UNTIL WE GET COMPLETELY BACK TO NORMAL COLLECTIONS ACTIVITIES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO REALLY DETERMINE WHAT THE IMPACT HAS BEEN AND HOW THE CHANGES IN KANSAS ARE RELATED TO ELIMINATING STATE INCOME TAXES FROM RATE WHICH COULD IMPACT WYOMING'S CASH FLOW GOING FORWARD The overall tax picture the elimination of the state income tax is not a large event. The last question for me to follow up on is richard's question on the carbonization is there a regulatory framework in place to invest in r and g across your jurisdictions we have parts established to potentially cover some additional costs related to investments in r and g and economies of scale. It is actually contemplated in the tariffs in Texas. It is a a recoverable gas cost there so that that that was that has previously been contemplated as as part of the gas supply picture in Oklahoma. There was legislation introduced in the last session to compel the commission to study r and g and to look at ways to to bring r and g into the Oklahoma gas supply. With the pandemic starting, that was not a bill that was considered all the way through session but outside of that, the Oklahoma corporation commission has opened up a notice of inquiry looking at several different energy questions, one of which is renewable natural gas and the way that the state and the commission should deal with that product. So there are efforts underway at the state levels also. NOT MUCH AT THIS POINT IN KANSAS BUT THE OTHER TWO STATES ARE A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG IN THAT REGARD THANK YOU FOR REACHING THE CALLER AND SAYING THANK YOU AGAIN ALL RIGHT AND ONCE AGAIN THAT IS STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION AND IT APPEARS THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. MISTER LOSSY, I'D LIKE TO TURN IT BACK TO YOU FOR ANY ADDITIONAL OR CLOSING REMARKS. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FOR YOUR INTEREST IN ONE GAS. OUR QUIET PERIOD FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER STARTS WHEN WE CLOSE OUR BOOKS IN EARLY JANUARY AND EXTENDS UNTIL WE RELEASE EARNINGS IN FEBRUARY. WE'LL PROVIDE DETAILS ON THE CONFERENCE CALL LATER DATE.

LIQUIDITY POSITION I WILL NOW HAND THE CALL BACK TO JEAN-MARC THANK YOU PETER LET'S TURN TO SLIDE 1 I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING THAT IS CORE TO OUR BUSINESS SUSTAINABILITY IN EARLY JULY WE PUBLISHED OUR 2019 BUSINESS AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON OUR WEBSITE I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT A FEW HIGHLIGHTS FROM 201 SAFETY IS OUR FIRST PRIORITY OUR TARGET IS TO REDUCE OUR RECORDABLE CASE RATES BY 10% YEAR AFTER YEAR BETWEEN 2016 AND 2019 A RECORDABLE CASE RATE DECREASED BY 27% AND WE ARE TRENDING VERY WELL THIS YEAR THIS MEANS THAT MORE OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE RETURNING HOME INJURY-FREE EVERY DAY WE ALSO IMPROVED OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY 6.40% COMPARED TO A 2015 BASELINE THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF 100,000 METRIC TONS OF CO2 SAVINGS EVERY YEAR FURTHER WE INTRODUCE A 2025 TARGET TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION INTENSITY BY 25% AGAINST THE 2015 BASELINE WE HAVE A DETAILED PLAN TO ACHIEVE THIS TARGET AS MANY OF YOU KNOW RECYCLING IS A CORE COMPETENCY AT CONSTELLIUM ALUMINUM IS INFINITELY RECYCLABLE WITH 75% OF ALL ALUMINUM EVER PRODUCED STILL IN USE TODAY MUSCLE SHOALS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST RECYCLERS OF ALUMINUM CANS GLOBALLY WITH THE CAPACITY TO RECYCLE OVER 20 BILLION CANS EVERY YEAR AT NEUF-BRISACH WE ALSO RECYCLE THE EQUIVALENT OF 12 BILLION BEVERAGE CANS EVERY YEAR AS A COMPANY CONSTELLIUM RECYCLED OVER 560,000 METRIC TONS OF EXTERNALLY SOURCED ALUMINUM SCRAP IN 201 I AM ALSO PROUD THAT THIRD PARTIES ARE RECOGNIZING CONSTELLIUM FOR OUR SUSTAINABILITY ACHIEVEMENTS THE ALUMINUM STEWARDSHIP INITIATIVE OR ASI IS AN INDUSTRY-LED INITIATIVE TO DRIVE SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE ALUMINUM VALUE CHAIN FROM PRODUCERS TO CUSTOMERS IN 2019 WE RECEIVED ASI CERTIFICATIONS FOR SINGEN'S CASTING AND ROLLING OPERATION AND WE BEGAN PRODUCING ASI-CERTIFIED COILS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS FROM SINGEN IN 202 WE ALSO RECEIVED ASI CERTIFICATION OF OUR NEUF-BRISACH FACILITY UNDER PROVISIONAL COVID CONDITIONS IN 202 WE ACHIEVED THE ECOVADIS PLATINUM RATING WHICH IS AWARDED TO THE TOP 1% OF COMPANIES ASSESSED WORLDWIDE WE RECEIVED AN ESG RATING OF AA FROM MSCI PLACING US IN THE TOP 5% OF OUR SECTOR OVERALL WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL YEAR ON OUR SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES IN 2019 AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR PROGRESS ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVES NOW LET'S TURN TO SLIDE 16 AND DISCUSS OUR END MARKETS WE BELIEVE OUR BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS ACROSS END MARKETS GEOGRAPHIES AND CUSTOMERS IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE DURING CHALLENGING TIMES LIKE THESE I'LL START WITH THE PACKAGING MARKET PACKAGING IS A CORE MARKET FOR CONSTELLIUM AND REPRESENTED 38% OF OUR LTM REVENUE WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG DEMAND IN NORTH AMERICA AND STABLE DEMAND IN EUROPE FURTHER EVIDENCED THAT THIS MARKET IS BOTH RECESSION RESILIENT AND SECULAR GROWTH WE BELIEVE THE PACKAGING MARKET AS LONG-TERM SECULAR GROWTH TAILWINDS DRIVEN BY CUSTOMER PREFERENCE FOR ALUMINUM CANS OUR CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW CAN LINES WITH SEVERAL ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NORTH AMERICA JUST ANNOUNCED IN THE LAST WEEK THESE ADDITIONAL LINES SHOULD DRIVE INCRE- INCREMENTAL DEMAND FOR CAN SHEET IN THE YEARS TO COME THE CONSUMER PREFERENCE TREND IS ONLY ONE OF THE TAILWINDS FOR CAN SHEET IN EUROPE THE DEMAND FOR CAN SHEET CONTINUES TO GROW BASED ON SUBSTITUTION OF ALUMINUM FOR STEEL IN THE US WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE GROWTH OF AUTO BODY SHEET DEMAND TO TIGHTEN SUPPLY TO THE PACKAGING MARKET OVER THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM NOW LET'S MOVE TO AUTOMOTIVE OVER OVER LONG TERM AUTOMOTIVE REMAINS A SECULAR GROWTH MARKET FOR ALUMINUM CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO PREFER LARGER VEHICLES WITH REGULATIONS AIMED AT INCREASING FUEL EFFICIENCY AND REDUCING EMISSIONS THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO LIGHTWEIGHT IN ADDITION WE EXPECT HYBRID AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO CONTINUE TO GAIN SHARE OF THE FLEET THESE VEHICLES ARE ALUMINUM INTENSIVE DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF LIGHT WEIGHTING TO ACHIEVE THEIR RANGE OBJECTIVES CONSTELLIUM IS WELL POSITIONED TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF THIS CIRCULAR SHIFT TO ALUMINUM IN AUTOMOTIVE AND THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THE FLEET MOVING TO MORE RECENT TRENDS AUTOMOTIVE OEMS BEGAN CURTAILING PRODUCTION IN MARCH AND LARGELY RESUMED PRODUCTION IN MAY WHILE DEMAND FROM OUR CUSTOMERS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN JUNE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED UNEVEN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES AND COVID-19 HOTSPOTS WHILE WE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AUTOMOTIVE DEMAND IN THE BACK HALF OF 2020 THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION AT THE OEM LET'S TURN NOW TO AEROSPACE AEROSPACE REPRESENTED 15 OF OUR LTM REVENUES THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR AEROSPACE REMAINS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE EFFECTS FROM COVID-19 AND THE 737-MAX AEROSPACE OEMS HAVE REDUCED BUILD RATE AND IT IS UNCLEAR HOW LONG BUILD RATES WILL REMAIN AT THESE LEVELS WE EXPECT AEROSPACE SHIPMENTS IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER OF 2020 WILL BE LOWER THAN THE LEVEL IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 202 IN TID WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND IN NICHE PRODUCTS IN A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF MARKETS OVER THE LONG TERM IN THE NEAR TERM THE DEFENSE AND RAIL MARKETS REMAIN STRONG BUT MOST INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION MARKETS REMAIN WEAK THESE MARKETS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE HEALTH OF THE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN AND TO WHAT EXTENT THESE MARKETS WILL REBOUND IN CLOSING I AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE CONSTELLIUM TEAM FOR THEIR TIRELESS EFFORTS DURING THIS TRYING TIME WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO OPERATIONAL EXECUTION HARVESTING THE BENEFITS OF OUR INVESTMENTS DISCIPLINE CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT DEBT REDUCTION AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATION WITH THAT JOANNA WE WILL NOW OPEN THE Q&A SESSION THANK YOU SIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION AT THIS TIME PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN THE NUMBER ONE ON YOUR TOUCH-TONE TELEPHONE IF YOUR QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED OR YOU WISH YOURSELF UH TO REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE QUEUE PLEASE PRESS THE POUND KEY YOUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF CHRIS TERRY FROM DEUTSCHE BANK YOUR LINE IS OPEN CHRIS IF YOU ARE ON MUTE UNMUTE CHRIS YOU LINE IS NOW OPEN HI JEAN-MARC AND PETER CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH WE CAN GOOD MORNING CHRIS GOOD MORNING UM THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION UM THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO START WITH WAS JUST THE UTILIZATION RATES AND THE COMMENTS FROM 1Q YOU SORT OF STEPPED THROUGH HOW YOU SAW UTILIZATION IN EACH OF THE DIVISIONS FOR 2Q AND THEN PERHAPS FOR 3Q AND 4Q APPRECIATE YOU DON'T HAVE GUIDANCE BUT I WONDERED WHETHER YOU COULD MAYBE CONCEPTUALLY TALK THROUGH UM 3Q VERSUS 4Q AND JUST VERSUS 2Q OR ANY COMMENTS YOU COULD MAKE ON THE DIVISIONS AS AN UPDATE FROM LAST QUARTER THANKS SURE CHRIS SO I'LL START WITH THE MARKETS AND THEN GONNA OF TRANSLATE IT INTO WHAT IT CAN MEAN FOR THE DIVISIONS RIGHT OR THE BUSINESS UNITS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR VERSUS THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR RIGHT YOU SEE PACKAGING ROUGHLY 10% DOWN YOU SEE UH AUTOMOTIVE 50% DOWN YOU SEE AEROSPACE 40% DOWN RIGHT ROUGHLY AND THE OTHER MARKETS AND EACH MARKET IS ABOUT 25% DOWN THIS IS MADE OF VERY DIFFERENT DYNAMICS RIGHT SO IN PACKAGING WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS 95% UTILIZATION THERE WAS A BIT OF A DROP UH ESPECIALLY IN APRIL WITH ALL THE LOCKDOWNS IN EUROPE UH REDU-REDUCTION IN UH CANNED CONSUMPTION AND ALL THAT BUT THAT HAS COME BACK PRETTY STRONG AND THE US CONTINUES TO BE QUITE STRONG SO WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW PACKAGING AGAIN RECESSION RESILIENT UH SECULAR GROWTH AND WE'RE PRETTY UH CONFIDENT FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND WE LOOK AT THE Q2 AS BEING A KIND OF AN ABNORMAL QUARTER BECAUSE OF ALL THAT HAPPENED UH IN APRIL AND A LITTLE BIT IN MAY IF I LOOK AT AUTOMOTIVE UH IT HAS RE-SNAPPED BACK I MEAN I THINK WHEN WE TALKED ON Q1 WE'RE TALKING OF 20% UTILIZATION AS WE WERE SPEAKING AND NOW WE'RE AT ABOVE 80% RIGHT IF YOU DO THE AVERAGE OF 20 AND 80 YOU- YOU GET TO 50 WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT WE EXPERIENCED IN THE SECOND HALF IN TERMS OF REDUCTION IN THEIR SHIPMENTS IT IS UM YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE IT CAN BE STRONGER THAN 80% UH GOING FORWARD WE CERTAINLY ARE RUNNING VERY WELL IN JULY BUT WE'VE SEEN UH THAT THIS UH RESTART HAS BEEN WITH ALL KINDS OF FITS AND STOPS RIGHT SO YOU GOT UPSTARTS YOU'VE GOT SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS YOU'VE GOT UH UH DIFFICULTIES IN BRINGING PRODUCTS FROM MEXICO UH BUILDING UH TRUCKS IN TEXAS IT'S CHALLENGING SO YOU'VE GOT ALL THOSE UH YOU KNOW OPERATIONAL ISSUES THAT ALL OF US IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAVE TO DEAL WITH UH BUT CLEARLY THE DEMAND SEEMS TO BE YOU KNOW WELL IN EXCESS OF UH 80% OF WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR SO THAT- THAT'S ENCOURAGING AND HOPEFULLY UH YOU KNOW COVID-19 DOESN'T UH THROW TOO MUCH OF A WRENCH IN THAT UH GOOD TREND IF I LOOK NOW AT AEROSPACE WHERE WE WERE RUNNING AT AROUND 60% IN THE QUARTER UH WE EXPECT MORE PAIN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND I THINK THE- THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT'S A LONG SUPPLY CHAIN UM AND THE CUSTOMERS UH YOU KNOW MOVE A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWLY IN TERMS OF UH ADJUSTING THEIR ORDERS UH AND THAT- THAT IS CREATING A BIT OF A OF A LAG IN TERMS OF UH HOW- HOW MUCH PAIN WE TAKE WE ARE IN VERY UH DETAILED DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS IN A VERY COLLABORATIVE FASHION TO LOOK AT WHAT THE SECOND HALF OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE AND WHY CONTRACTUALLY WE COULD FORCE SOME VOLUMES ON US THAT'S NOT OUR TYPE WHAT THEY DON'T NEED WE DON'T WANT TO FORCE ON THEM SO WHAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH IS UH TAKING MORE PAIN NOW IN THE SECOND HALF SO THAT 2021 WE START WITH A CLEAN SLATE SO WE WOULD EXPECT SOME REDUCTION IN THE OPERATING RATES IN AEROSPACE IN UH IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR SO IF YOU TRANSLATE ALL THAT INTO WHAT IT MEANS FOR UH THE DIFFERENT BUS I WOULD EXPECT PARP PACKAGING AND AUTOMOTIVE TO BE BETTER I WOULD EXPECT AS&I AUTOMOTIVE UH STRUCTURES ESSENTIALLY TO BE BETTER IN THE SECOND HALF AND WOULD EXPECT A&T TO BE A MORE CHALLENGE IN THE SECOND HALF YEAH THANKS THANKS SO MUCH AND YOU SORRY NO GO AHEAD I- I'LL JUST SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON PACKAGING SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE VOLUMES ARE DOWN AT YOU KNOW AROUND ABOUT 10% I THINK YEAR ON YEAR AND YOU'RE SAYING MUSCLE SHOALS IS DOING WELL IT SEEMS LIKE THE US IS GOING GOING WELL I THINK CROWN YESTERDAY MENTIONED THAT SOUTHERN EUROPE WAS WEAK CAN YOU JUST COMMENT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ABOUT PACKAGING IN THE EU REGION IS IT WAS IT DOWN IN THE QUARTER BECAUSE OF DEMAND OR BECAUSE YOU HAD FACILITIES OFFLINE AND MAYBE YOU COULD QUANTIFY SOME OF THE EU IMPACTS YEAH I THINK SO- SO THE REASON I'M UH SAYING MORE THAN 90% OR 95% WHATEVER AND THAT'S 100% IS EXACTLY BECAUSE OF SOME UH WEAKNESS IN EUROPE RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S GOT TO DO WITH UH UH BOTH UH YOU KNOW THE- THE- THE REDUCTION IN UH ACTIVITY IN SOUTHERN EUROPE I MEAN A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE UH ECONOMIES THAT ARE BASED ON TOURISM AND YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE BEST YEAR FOR TOURISM AS WE ALL KNOW UH AND UH WE ARE SEEING YOU KNOW THERE'S LITTLE CLUSTERS AND HOTSPOTS SO EVERYBODY'S A BIT YOU KNOW VIGILANT AS THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT SO THAT IS WEIGHING DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON UH CANNED CONSUMPTION IN EUROPE YES OKAY AND- AND JUST SORRY I HAD UH ONE FOLLOW-UP ON- ON UH ON- ON WORKING CAPITAL SPECIFICALLY I JUST WANTED MAYBE PE- PETER IF YOU COULD TALK THROUGH THE YOU KNOW THE 2Q MOVING PARTS OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE STEPPED THROUGH THOSE WATERFALL CHARTS AND YOU'RE GETTING COST DOING A GREAT JOB ON THE COST SIDE I JUST WONDERED IF YOU'RE COMING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ON THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR UM AND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE THAT ON WORKING CAPITAL UH- SURE IN TERMS OF UH YOU'RE SAYING POSITIVE FOR THE FULL YEAR YOU'VE ALREADY OBVIOUSLY HIT THE POSITIVE NUMBER AT THE HALFWAY POINT SO JUST- JUST WONDERING IF YOU TALK THROUGH THE MOVING PARTS OF WORKING CAPITAL SURE HAPPY TO DO IT AND JUST FOR CONTEXT SO UM THE SECOND QUARTER AS WE SAID LAST UH QUARTER WE- WE WOULD UH USE WORKING CAPITAL AND WE IN FACT BURNED 63 MILLION OF WORKING CAPITAL IN THE UM IN Q2 AND FOR THE FIRST HALF WE'RE POSITIVE 2 SO BASED ON WHERE WE SIT TODAY I THINK IT'S UH PLAUSIBLE TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW WITH AUTO RAMPING WITH PACKAGING UH KIND OF CONTINUING TO RAMP BACK UP UH THAT- THAT WE COULD LOSE SOME GROUND IN THE IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR SO UH NOT A HUGE NEGATIVE BUT WE COULD SEE WORKING CAPITAL BEING UH USED IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR UM BUT CHRIS I WOULD SAY THAT UH WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN SPITE OF THAT THAT WE UH WE CAN ACHIEVE A FREE CASH FLOW POSITION THANKS THANKS PETER THAT'S UH THAT'S IT FOR ME THANK YOU OKAY GOOD YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF JOSH SULLIVAN FROM THE BENCHMARK COMPANY YOUR LINE IS OPEN HEY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING JOSH YEAH JUST A QUESTION YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU THINKING YOU KNOW ANY TARIFFS ON CANADIAN ALUMINUM YOU KNOW HAVE YOU INCREASED ANY INVENTORY EXPECTING THAT OR- OR- OR JUST WHAT SHOULD WE BE THINKING ON THAT FRONT OF THAT IF THAT COMES TO FRUITION YEAH WELL I MEAN WE BELIEVE IT'S A MISGUIDED UH MEASURE IF IT HAPPENS RIGHT WE- WE'VE LOBBIED AGAINST IT IN THE PAST WE GOT IT REMOVED IT MAY COME BACK UM WE THINK IT'S MISGUIDED AND IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WHICH IS OVER CAPACITY FROM CHINA FROM A NON-MARKET ECONOMY THAT DOESN'T PLAY BY THE SAME RULES AS WE DO NOW THAT SAID IF IT HAPPENS IT'S GOT A VERY LIMITED IMPACT ON US SO I REMIND YOU THAT UH WE PASS THROUGH THE METAL UM COST ESSENTIALLY TO UH MOST OF OUR CUSTOMERS THERE MAY BE A LITTLE UH THE SECTION OF THE BUSINESS WHERE WE CANNOT REPRICE IMMEDIATELY WHEN IT HAPPENS UH BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE WE MAY GAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ON SCRAP UH RECYCLING AS WELL SO NOT MUCH OF AN IMPACT FOR US UH THE REASON WE'RE AGAINST IT IS MUCH MORE A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN FREE AND FAIR TRADE THAN REALLY A PROBLEM FOR OUR UH FINANCES OR OUR E- ECONOMIC UH OUTCOME GOT IT AND THEN JUST ON- ON THE CANNED SHEET FRONT YOU KNOW CAN YOU REMIND US OF YOU KNOW WHEN THE YOU KNOW YOU- YOUR LARGER CONTRACTS ARE- ARE UP FOR RENEGOTIATION AND THEN JUST ANY COMMENT AROUND YOU KNOW PRICING STRENGTH YEAH SO WE UM SO WE DON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS OF EXACTLY WHICH CONTRACTS MATURE WHEN UH BUT UH YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT A FEW RENEWALS COMING IN UH AROUND THE UH 22 HORIZON UH WE ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS UH AND I THINK THE PRICING ENVIRONMENT IS UH I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS A MILDLY POSITIVE IN THE US AND WIDELY NEGATIVE IN EUROPE BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFIC SITUATION NOW I REMIND YOU THAT CONTRACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS TAKE A LOT OF TIME HERE AND UH WHILST WE YOU KNOW I SAY IT'S MILDLY POSITIVE HERE AND MILDLY NEGATIVE THERE BETWEEN NOW AND WHENEVER WE ACTUALLY INK A CONTRACT THINGS MAY CHANGE UH BUT I THINK IT'S A PRETTY BENIGN ENVIRONMENT AND OUR PRODUCT IS IN DEMAND UH I'LL BRAG A LITTLE BIT OUR QUALITY AND OUR SERVICE IS VERY MUCH RECOGNIZED MUSCLE SHOALS HAS DONE A TERRIFIC JOB IN UH OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS UH AND IS A VERY STRONG PLAYER IN THE MARKET NOW VERY RECOGNIZED QUALITY SERVICE-WISE NEUF-BRISACH HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO WE HAVE UH STRONG POSITIONS AND I'M UH LOOKING AT THE FUTURE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF UH CONFIDENCE GREAT THANK YOU THAT'S IT THANKS THANKS JOSH YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF DAVID GAGLIANO FROM BMO CAPITAL MARKETS YOUR LINE IS OPEN GREAT THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS UM FIRST OF ALL I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION ON THE NUMBERS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER DID YOU SAY THERE WAS A $15 MILLION ONE-TIME BENEFIT INCLUDED IN THE $81 MILLION ADJUSTED EBITDA LINE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THE UH FOR THE LABOR BENEFIT I THOUGHT IT WAS A COVID-19 STATE AID BENEFIT IS THAT INCLUDED IN <CROSSTALK> YEAH THAT'S INCLUDED IN ADJUSTED EBITDA BUT IT'S NOT A ONE-OFF AND IT CONTINUES THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS <INAUDIBLE> OR SHORT-TIME WORK AND THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS CONTINUE THROUGH 2020 AND IN SOME CASES INTO 202 OKAY SO WE SHOULD ASSUME ABOUT A $15 MILLION QUARTERLY BENEFIT THOSE PROGRAMS EACH QUARTER WELL NO BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN DAVID IS REMEMBER SO IN THE SECOND QUARTER WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE SIDELINES RIGHT BUT AS WE RAMP UP THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS OF THAT I THINK YOU SHOULD ASSUME THAT UH IN THE BUSINESSES THAT IT YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA SO PACKAGING FOR EXAMPLE WHERE WE HAD SOME BENEFIT IN- IN UH Q2 WE SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW BASICALLY VERY LIMITED IF- IF ANY BENEFIT IN- IN- YEAH Q3 AND UH YOU KNOW AUTOMOTIVE WHICH SHOULD FADE AWAY AND- AND AEROSPACE WILL HAVE SOME CONTINUING GIVEN THE OPERATING UTILIZATION RATE THERE BUT IT'LL BE A MUCH LOWER NUMBER TO GIVE YOU AN INDICATION I WE MENTIONED ABOUT PEOPLE BEING UH YOU KNOW UNEMPLOYED DURING THE QUARTER AT THE TROUGH WHICH IS BEHIND US UH WE HAD 6,000 PEOPLE UNDER SOME KIND OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OR YOU KNOW TEMPORARY LAYOFF NOW WE ARE AT LESS THAN 2,000.0 SO IT'S- IT'S CLOSED DRA- DRAMATICALLY YEAH AND- AND DAVID JUST TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE THE UH YOU KNOW IF YOU GET TO THE FOURTH QUARTER THE NUMBER MIGHT BE SOMETHING LIKE 25 OF THAT RIGHT JUST BASED ON THE UTILIZATION RATE JUST ROUGH NUMBER OKAY THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPFUL THANK YOU AND THEN JUST IN TERMS OF THE UM YOU KNOW THE- THE- THE INDIVIDUAL UH AND MARKET COMMENTARY ON THE AEROSPACE SIDE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE OR HAS BEEN YOU KNOW THE HIGHEST MARGIN BUSINESS UM AND- AND YOU KNOW JUST IN TERMS OF THE OUTLOOK COMMENTARY YOU- YOU- YOU FRAMED OBVIOUSLY UH TWO SEGMENTS UP ONE SEGMENT DOWN BUT YOU KNOW THE DOWN SEGMENT IS- IS AGAIN THE HIGHEST MARGIN SEGMENT I DIDN'T REALLY GET A CENSUS TO ORDER MAGNITUDE OF THE DOWN NUMBER VERSUS THE UP NUMBERS CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A SENTENCE TO YOU KNOW DO YOU BELIEVE THAT AEROSPACE WILL COMPLETELY OFFSET THE RECOVERY IN AUTO AND- AND PACKAGING UM IN THE SECOND HALF OR- OR- OR A BIT MORE UH YOU KNOW COLOR ON MAGNI- ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ON THE ON THE DECLINE IN AEROSPACE WOULD BE HELPFUL SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL UH DAVID BECAUSE WE'RE AS WE SPEAK IN A VERY ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A CALL THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE JOINTLY WITH THEM AS I MENTIONED WE'VE GOT CONTRACTS WHEREBY WE CAN FORCE THEM TO TAKE SOME PRODUCT UH WHICH THEY WILL TAKE AND PAY FOR ALL BUT THEN THEY DON'T NEED IT THE FOLLOWING YEAR RIGHT SO THEY ALL THEY ALL THE INVENTORY THEY ARE HOLDING BACK SO WE ARE LOOKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEM IN TERMS OF WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THEY NEED WHICH BY THE WAY I DON'T THINK THEY FULLY KNOW NOW UH AND IT'S NO CRITICISM OF THEM I MEAN IT'S VERY UNUSUAL TIME AND ONCE WE KNOW WHAT THEY NEED AND WE LOOK AT WHAT CUTS DO WE TAKE THEN I COULD ANSWER YOUR QUESTION POSSIBLY AT THIS STAGE I CANNOT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE WILL BE FOR SURE MORE PAIN IN UH IN UH OTHER STRUCTURES AND THEN THE YOU KNOW THOSE STRUCTURES IN AEROSPACE MY APOLOGIES AEROSPACE NOW THE OTHER THING TOO IS THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT ANY PERIOD IN THE RECENT PAST THE SECOND HALF IS ALWAYS W- WEAKER THAN THE FIRST HALF RIGHT IN AEROSPACE SO- RIGHT THAT- THAT'S SOMETHING TO FACTOR IN AS WELL OKAY AND JUST M- MY LAST RELATED QUESTION IS UM THE- THE- THE I THINK YOU MENTIONED I THINK AVERAGE UTILIZATION RATES FOR AEROSPACE RELATED UM DEMAND IN THIS IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS AROUND 60% CORRECT <INAUDIBLE> FACILITIES IS THAT RIGHT WHAT IS THAT NUMBER NOW UH WE'RE RUNNING STILL AROUND THAT NUMBER BUT I WOULD EXPECT IT TO UH GO DOWN MAYBE TO 50% THAT KIND OF RANGE OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT'S HELPFUL THANKS VERY MUCH OKAY YEAH IT'S VERY UH IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY WE'RE NOT EXPECTING IT TO GO DOWN TO 30% RIGHT EVEN THAT'S- THAT'S NOT UH NOT ON THE HORIZON YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF CURT WOODWORTH FROM CREDIT SUISSE YOUR LINE IS OPEN YEAH HI GOOD MORNING HI CURT HI CURT UH PETER FIRST QUESTION ON- ON THE €100 MILLION OF COST REDUCTIONS HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD YOU VIEW AS STRUCTURAL AND THEN YOU KNOW I GUESS JUST IN GENERAL IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF COSTS YOU THINK YOU COULD TAKE OUT OF THE BUSINESS THIS YEAR ON A PERMANENT BASIS CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON- ON THOSE EFFORTS UM SO UM IF WE LOOK IF WE LOOK AT THE UH I MEAN SO THE BIGGEST PIECE OF THAT HUNDRED MILLION UH IS RELATED TO LABOR RIGHT SO X AND THAT'S- THAT'S PROBABLY LABOR'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW HALF OF THAT HUNDRED MILLION SO UH WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE ARE REALLY CLOSELY LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKELY TO BE LIKE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SIZE OUR LABOR FORCES ACCORDING TO THAT SO UH IN THAT REGARD I THINK WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME UH KIND OF PERMANENT SAVINGS BUT REMEMBER AS WE UH KIND OF RAMP UP THE OPERATIONS UH WE DO EXPECT SOME OF THAT COST IS GONNA COME BACK RIGHT SO UM YOU KNOW I'D SAY IT'S HARD TO GIVE A- A REALLY PRECISE NUMBER O- ON THAT CURT IT'S UH IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE YEAH OKAY UM KURT IF I MAY ADD UH WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HORIZON 22 RIGHT AND ONE OF THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WAS TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE UM LEAN OUR ORGANIZATION WITHOUT LOSING COMPETENCIES CAPABILITIES BUT HOW DO WE LEAN AND MAKE THE ORGANIZATION STRONGER AND I THINK WHAT COVID-19 IS DOING TO US UH AND I GUESS TO MANY OTHER COMPANIES OUT THERE IS ACCELERATE THE NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT MAY HAVE TAKEN MORE TIME TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO ALONG THE LINES THAT PETER WAS UH SAYING I THINK WE'LL COME OUT OF THIS WITH SOME PERMANENT COST REDUCTIONS AND AS WE RAMP UP WE WILL NOT RAMP UP AND INJECT BACK 100 MILLION OF COSTS UH HOW MUCH YOU KNOW WI- WILL REMAIN TO BE SEEN BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY UH LEARNING AS WE'RE DOING AND WE'RE JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF IT NOW BUT UH WE WILL DEFINITELY EMERGE OUT OF THAT LEANER AND STRONGER YEAH AND THERE'S CERTAIN CATEGORIES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE PROFESSIONAL FEES SUBCONTRACTORS WHERE YOU KNOW KIND OF AS WE WORK WITHOUT THESE BECAUSE THOSE ARE YOU KNOW KIND OF BIG CATEGORIES OF REDUCTION I THINK WE UH WERE ABLE TO UH TO KIND OF LIVE WITHOUT A LOT OF THAT GOING FORWARD SO- SO YEAH I THINK THERE- THERE'S- THERE'S DEFINITELY A P- PIECE OF THAT THAT WE CAN CARRY FORWARD SURE AND THEN JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE THAT ARE NOT- NOT TRIVIAL THEY'RE QUITE REVEALING RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT A VERY STRONG UH YOU KNOW R&D AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT ORGANIZATION WHICH IS YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE CENTRALLY LOCATED AND THEN GO AND UH HELP PLANTS AND UH HISTORICALLY A LOT OF THE WORK WAS DONE BY PEOPLE GOING TO THE LOCATION NOW OBVIOUSLY IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL ANYWHERE AND A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH A REMOTE INTERACTION UH VIDEO CONFERENCE BUT EVEN WHEN YOU GO TO A- TO A PLANT AND YOU LOOK AT I GOT A PROBLEM AND I NEED TO UH IMPROVE UH THE SPEED ON THIS MILL WE'VE HAD PEOPLE YOU KNOW INTERACTING BY THE <INAUDIBLE> BIT ON A FACETIME AND UH GOING INTO UH LOOKING INTO THE- THE ROLLER UH THE- THE- THE ROLLING MILLS UH BY FACETIME WITH A UH TECHNICAL ADVISOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET AND THAT WORKS ACTUALLY FINE WHICH WE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE SO IN THE FUTURE WHAT YOU'RE GAINING HERE IS WELL YOU'RE SAVING TRAVEL TIME WHICH IS NOT VERY GOOD FOR THE AEROSPACE BUSINESS BUT ALSO YOUR SAY YOU'RE- YOU'RE THE BECAUSE YOU'RE SAVING THE COST YOU'RE SAVING THE TIME WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE CAN BE ON SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS WHILST HISTORICALLY WITHIN A WEEK YOU KNOW IT TAKES A WEEK TO GET TO THE PLANT WHERE YOU GET THE JOB DONE SO I THINK WE'RE- WE ARE GOING TO DISCOVER A FEW NEW WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS IN OUR UH YOU KNOW SPACE THAT ARE GOING TO BE QUITE INTERESTING IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK IT'S GONNA HELP US INJECT MORE BRAIN AND TALENT UH REMOTELY WITH MORE UH- MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> <INAUDIBLE> YEAH AND CURT YOU KNOW AS WE GO FORWARD WE'LL UH WE MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU MORE COLOR ON THIS BUT YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY IT COMES ACROSS THAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING HARD AT TAKING STRUCTURAL COSTS OUT AND IN THE SHORT TERM UH THE OBJECTIVE IS WE WANNA BE YOU KNOW KIND OF FREE CASH FLOW POSITIVE THROUGH THIS CRISIS UM AND SO THAT WE DON'T TAKE ON ANY INCREMENTAL DEBT IDEALLY AND IN THE LONGER TERM WE WANT TO EMERGE WITH A YOU KNOW KIND OF MUCH STRONGER EARNINGS POWER SO WE'RE FOCUSED ON EXACTLY THAT AND- AND UH YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE MORE TO SAY AS- AS WE PROGRESS OKAY NOW THAT- THAT'S HELPFUL AND THEN YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE- THE FREE CASH FLOW UM YOU KNOW DYNAMICS YOU MENTIONED I THINK A $73 MILLION IMPACT FROM UH FACTORING THIS QUARTER OR OTHERWISE YOU'D BE FREE CASH FLOW POSITIVE WHICH IS PRETTY- PRETTY POSITIVE GIVEN YOUR UTILIZATION RATE AND NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 95% UTILIZATION AND PACKAGING OVER 80% AND AUTO AND IT SEEMS LIKE AUTO SHOULD MOVE HIGHER ONCE SUPPLY CHAINS GET MORE NORMALIZED SO YOU KNOW 75% OF YOUR BUSINESS IS COULD BE CLOSE TO 90% UTILIZATION IN A COUPLE MONTHS I GET THAT ARROW IS WEAKER UM BUT IT WOULD SEEM LIKE FROM A FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION STANDPOINT UM YOU KNOW UNLESS WORKING CAPITAL WOULD BE A MAJOR NEGATIVE YOU- YOU SHOULD BE GENERATING DECENT FREE CASH IN THE- THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR CAN YOU CAN YOU COMMENT AT ALL ON FREE CASH FLOW POTENTIAL IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR YEAH SURE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION SO WE WON'T PUT A SPECIFIC NUMBER ON IT BUT UH WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GENERATE FREE CASH FLOW UM FOR THE FULL YEAR UM AND YOU KNOW THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW GENERATE SOME FREE CASH FLOW BUT IT DEPENDS A LOT ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH TRADE WORKING CAPITAL AS I SAID WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW THE RAMP OF THESE BUSINESSES SO WE WANT TO BE A LITTLE CAUTIOUS UNTIL WE SEE THE PACE OF THE RAMP UM AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RAMP UM BUT AGAIN FOR THE FULL YEAR WE- WE REMAIN CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN GENERATE FREE CASH FLOW OKAY AND THEN JUST FINAL QUESTION ON ARROW JEAN-MARC YOU HAD A COMMENT ON I GUESS WORKING WITH THE OEMS TO CREATE UH YOU SAID A CLEAN SLATE ENTERING 202 SO YOU KNOW IS THAT UM STATEMENT KIND OF REFLECTING THE FACT THAT THE OEMS CUT VERY QUICKLY AND I ASSUME THERE'S SORT OF AN EXCESS INVENTORY ISSUE THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH OR IN GENERAL IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND SO YOU KNOW UM HYPOTHETICALLY YOUR- YOUR VOLUMES WOULD BE BELOW THE ACTUAL BUILD RATE TO HELP THEM CLEAR INVENTORY SO THEN WHEN YOU GET INTO 2021 YOU KNOW THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS IN IS IN A PRETTY GOOD POSITION AND YOU KNOW CONTRACTUALLY YOU SAID YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FORCE IT ON THEM BUT THEN YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO HELP THEM MANAGE THAT DO THEY DO YOU GET ANY- ANYTHING IN RETURN I.E YOU KNOW PRICE BENEFIT OR YOU KNOW THIS IS KIND OF EVERYONE HELPING EACH OTHER JUST A LITTLE BIT UNDERSTANDING OF KIND OF WHAT YOU MEANT BY THE CLEAN SLATE COMMENT WELL YEAH UH NO FAIR QUESTION SO UM I THINK I'VE COMMENTED IN THE PAST ON THE FACT THAT I THOUGHT THAT THE SHIPMENTS WE'RE MAKING INTO THE UH TO THE OEMS RIGHT INTO THE SUPPLY CHAIN WERE ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN WHAT THE BUILD RATES WERE WARRANTING AT THE TIME AND OBVIOUSLY THE BUILD RATES ARE GOING DOWN VERY SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN SO NOW SO THE- THE PAIN WE'RE GONNA TAKE IN THE SECOND HALF I THINK IS NOT GOING TO CURE ALL THE UH YOU KNOW UH INVENTORY BUILD-UP IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN FIRST OF ALL UH BUT I THINK WHAT THAT DOES IS IT POSITIONS US FOR 2021 THAT DOESN'T SHOW FURTHER DETERIORATION THAT'S WHAT WE'RE- WE'RE INTO RIGHT AND WE WANT TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE- WHERE WE SUPPLY BY AND LARGE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS BEING BUILT RIGHT SO THAT- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHETHER WE GET THERE FULLY I DON'T KNOW BUT CERTAINLY WE ARE AIMING TO BE BETTER IN ' 21 THAN WHAT THE SECOND THE NINE MONTHS OF UH YOU KNOW POST- COVID UH WILL BE IN UH A&T THAT'S- THAT'S ONE OF THE GOALS UM IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GETTING FROM UH THE OEMS UH WE'VE GOT VERY STRONG DEEP STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM UH I'VE COMMENTED ALSO IN THE PAST FROM THE FACT THAT WE'RE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL AND I THINK IT'S UH EVIDENCED BY THE 10-YEAR CONTRACT WE'VE SIGNED WITH AIRBUS I MEAN UH 10-YEAR IS A LONG DURATION NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE AND UH WE DID IT UH BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR BOTH UH COMPANIES FOR BOTH BUSINESSES AND WE DIDN'T DO IT AS A REACTION TO COVID OR WHATEVER RIGHT I MEAN THAT WAS REALLY THE DESIRE TO CEMENT THE STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES SO WE'RE LOOKING PAST THE CURRENT CRISIS THE CURRENT CRISIS WE'VE GOT TO GET ALL IN THE SAME BOAT OR IN THE SAME AIRCRAFT AND UH PUT US IN THE SAME PLACE WORK TOGETHER TO OVERCOME THE CRISIS AND WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW IF I DO THAT YOU GIVE ME A BIT MORE PRICE OR WHATEVER I THINK IT'S JUST A RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN THE WIN-WIN PARTNERSHIP AND WE DO SOME UH THINGS THAT HELP THEM AND THEY'LL DO SOME THINGS THAT HELP US IN THE FUTURE WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE IN THE PAST AND THAT'S ALREADY UH THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED AND THAT'S CONTINUING OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF MATTHEW FIELDS FROM BANK OF AMERICA YOUR LINE IS OPEN HEY JEAN-MARC HEY PETER UM ONE ON THE ON THE MARKETS AND THEN ONE ON THE BALANCE SHEET PLEASE UM SO YOU KNOW SAW THAT CAN VOLUMES WERE DOWN ABOUT 11% BUT UM YOU KNOW NORSK UH REPORTED CANNED VOLUMES UP 11% I THINK YOU GUYS FACE RELATIVELY THE SAME MARKETS IN EUROPE CAN YOU CAN YOU SORT OF POINT TO WHY MAYBE THEY'RE HAVING MORE SUCCESS ON THEIR CAN VOLUMES WAS IT WAS IT ENOUGH FOR NEUF-BRISACH BEING DOWN ISSUE OR- OR A MARKET ISSUE OR WHAT LIKE WHAT CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT DISCREPANCY FOR US PLEASE SURE IT'S MAINLY I BELIEVE I MEAN I CANNOT COMMENT ON THEIR UH SPECIFIC UH SITUATION BUT IN- IN OUR CASE THE MAIN REASON WAS THAT WE HAD TO TAKE DOWN NEUF-BRISACH FOR A FULL WEEK AND THEN RAMP IT UP GRADUALLY I REMIND YOU THAT NEUF-BRISACH WAS AT THE CENTER OF A HOT SPOT OF THE FIRST UH REAL HOT SPOT IN FRANCE UH AND THAT WAS A VERY UH VERY TERRIBLE CONDITIONS FOR UH YOU KNOW SECOND HALF OF MARCH SO IN MARCH WE CONTINUED TO SHIP OUT OF FINNISH GOODS BUT THEN WE HAD TO REPLENISH THE UH THE- THE FINNISH GOODS AND THAT REALLY TOOK DOWN OUR UH YOU KNOW OUR SHIPMENTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER BUT WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL NOW OKAY THAT'S UH THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I EXPECTED UM AND ON THE BALANCE SHEET IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT UM A DECENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING FROM- FROM FRANCE AND UM AND OBVIOUSLY SWITZ- SWITZERLAND AND- AND GERMANY UM YOU SAID IT WAS PARTIALLY GUARANTEED BUT IT'S ALSO SECURED CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A- A UM A- A- A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SORT OF WHAT IT'S SECURED BY IS IT INVENTORY OR IS IT SORT OF PPE AND THEN TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT GUARANTEED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT WELL IT UH DEPENDS ON THE FACILITY BUT THE BIG ONE THE FRENCH ONE IS SECURED ON- ON UH UH PP&E UM AND UH IN THE CASE OF THE GERMAN ONES ONE OF THEM IS SECURED AND ONE OF THEM IS UNSECURED AND THE SWISS ONE IS UNSECURED UM AND UH THE GUARANTEES WHAT THE WAY THEY WORK IS THEY GUARANTEE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE PRINCIPAL SO UH IT'S A NORMAL SYNDICATE OF BANKS WITH UH IN THE CASE OF FRANCE I THINK THE GUARANTEE IS FOR 70% OF THE UH OR SORRY 80% PERCENT OF THE IN THE CASE OF FRANCE OF THE UM OF THE PRINCIPAL BALANCES GUARANTEED BY THE BY THE FRENCH STATE IN THE CASE OF GERMANY I THINK IT'S UH 80% TOO SO JUST- JUST FOR- FOR OUR PURPOSES AS CREDIT ANALYSTS 80% OF THAT FRENCH LOAN IS- IS SORT OF NON-RECOURSE TO YOU WELL AGAIN IT'S UH IT IS IT IS RECOURSE TO US UH WHAT I THINK T- T- THE POINT IS- IS THAT IF YOU'RE A LENDER SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IN THE SYNDICATE OF BANKS AND YOU UH ARE LENDING SAY 50% YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IS FOR 10 OH SORRY 50% 50 MILLION YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IS FOR 10 OF THAT RIGHT SO THE IT'S THE BANKS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE GUARANTEE NOT- NOT THE COMPANY OKAY SO YOU STILL HAVE TO DELIVER ON THE COMMITMENTS TO THE BANKS YEAH ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY OKAY BUT ONE THING <CROSSTALK> YEAH I'M SORRY GO AHEAD THE- THE GOVERNMENT IS IN FACT STOPPING THE LOAN FOR YOU IT'S NOT STOPPING THE LOAN FOR- FOR THE BANKS EXACTLY EXACTLY BUT ONE THING TO YOU KNOW KIND OF I THINK IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT IS YOU KNOW OUR- OUR INTENT IN PUTTING THIS LIQUIDITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET WAS TO REMOVE ANY QUESTION ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAD E- ENOUGH LIQUIDITY AS WE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING AND BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE IN THE SECOND QUARTER WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE USING THIS SO THE FRENCH FACILITY WE HAD TO DRAW JUST BY THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT BUT IT JUST SITS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS CASH AND UH THE GERMAN FACILITY THAT WE'VE NOW SIGNED UP IN JULY YOU KNOW WE DON'T EXPECT TO DRAW THAT UH THE DD UH THE DELAY DRAW TERM LOAN WE HAVEN'T DRAWN THAT UH AND THE SWISS FACILITY UH WE DON'T HAVE THAT DRAWN IN- IN MOST INSTANCES SO- AND THE WAY WE BENEFIT FROM THE STATE GUARANTEE IS THROUGH UH VERY CHEAP INTEREST RATES YEAH THAT'S RIGHT RIGHT SO- THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT CHEAP MONEY AND THAT- THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO US WE DON'T THINK WE NEED THE MONEY SO WE'RE NOT GONNA TO PAY A LOT OF UH INTEREST FOR IT YEAH EXACTLY THAT AND IT OBVIOUSLY WAS AN INDUCEMENT FOR THE BANKS TO LEND RIGHT NOW FAIR ENOUGH AND THAT'S UH YOU KNOW I THINK THE FRENCH FACILITY IS WHAT 2.50% EFFECTIVELY AT THIS POINT YEAH YEAH THAT'S THE CODE ALL RIGHT SO YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO PAY THAT OFF QUICKLY YOU KNOW GIVEN YOUR- YOUR BONDS ARE KIND OF TWICE THAT RIGHT UH NO- NO THAT'S RIGHT NOW REMEMBER THE- THE UH THE USE OF THE CAP THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF THE CAPITAL RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN'T USE THAT CAPITAL TO GO AND UH BUY BACK BONDS IN THE MARKET SO IT'S REALLY MEANT TO BE FOR UH YOU KNOW KIND OF OPERATING NEEDS OF A COMPANY BUT YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE A WE DON'T HAVE A STRONG INCENTIVE TO- TO REPAY THAT OKAY AND THEN IT- BUT- BUT WHAT WE WILL WHAT WE WILL DO IS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME COST TO IT RIGHT SO AS WE UH KIND OF EMERGE FROM THE CRISIS AND HAVE A LITTLE MORE VISIBILITY THEN WE'LL UNWIND THOSE FACILITIES OKAY THAT'S UH THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANKS FOR ALL THE COLOR AND- AND GOOD LUCK IN THE BACK HALF THANK YOU THANK YOU YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF SEAN WARNOCK FROM DEUTSCHE BANK YOUR LINE IS OPEN HEY GUYS THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS AND UH REALLY GREAT JOB ON TRANSPARENCY AND COSTS HERE UH BOTH VERY HELPFUL THANKS SEAN UM JUST WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BIG PICTURE IF YOU LOOK AT THE AUTO MARKET UM THERE ARE SORT OF PROJECTIONS OUT IN THE MARKET THAT WILL HAVE ABOUT YOU KNOW 25% UH DECLINE IN NEW CARS THIS YEAR YOU KNOW MOSTLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE WEREN'T PRODUCING BACK IN MARCH/APRIL UM IF YOU LOOK AT THE USED AUTO MARKET YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN PRETTY STRONG AS WE'VE USED PRICES REALLY UH YOU KNOW RISING EVEN ABOVE LAST YEAR UM YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT HOW PRODUCTION'S BEEN INCREASING AND DEMAND IS INCREASING THERE UM YOU KNOW TO KIND OF GET TO DOWN 25% YOU KNOW YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE SOME PRETTY STRONG GROWTH IN- IN 3Q AND THREE-FOUR SO I- I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS DO YOU SEE THAT MARKET AS POTENTIALLY INFLECTING SOON UM YOU KNOW WITH DEMAND PULLING THROUGH BASED ON- ON A LACK OF CARS AND IF YOU CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE COLOR WHAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE THAT'D BE VERY HELPFUL YEAH SO UM I MEAN THE OLDER BOOK IS STRONG THERE'S NO QUESTION IT'S ABOVE THE 80% THAT I'M MENTIONING RIGHT UH BUT WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE BIT CAUGHT UH YOU KNOW BY CUSTOMERS UH JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO TELLING US UH WE NEED PRODUCT TOMORROW AND THEN TELLING US THE NEXT DAY THE PLANT IS SHUT DOWN RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY VIGILANT RIGHT SO I HOPE I- I THINK THE END DEMAND IS THERE I THINK THAT'S TRUE IN THE US THAT'S TRUE IN EUROPE RIGHT THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE INJECTED A LOT OF MONEY IN THE HANDS OF CONSUMERS RIGHT THROUGH THE UH THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OF YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SHAPES AND FORMS THAT YOU SEE ON BOTH CONTINENTS AND THAT IS YOU KNOW PRETTY GOOD FOR UH END DEMAND AT THE END OF THE DAY SO I HOPE IT'S GONNA BE UH IT'S GONNA MATERIALIZE INTO AND THE OLDER BOOK WE HAVE IS GOING TO BE ACTUALLY REAL ORDERS AND SHIPMENTS IN WHICH CASE IT COULD BE BETTER UH BUT YOU KNOW I'VE UH WE- WE- WE- WE'VE SEEN FITS AND STARTS YOU SEE UH PLANTS RESTARTING AND THEN UH SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE UH THERE'S UH COVID INFECTIONS OR YOU SEE PEOPLE HAVING UH TROUBLE UH STASHING YOU KNOW THE FULL SHIFT BECAUSE THERE'S UH UH TOO MANY CASES IN THE IN THE HOT SPOTS SO I- I- I- I- IT'S STILL FRAGILE I MEAN IT LOOKS UH QUITE GOOD BUT IT'S STILL FRAGILE RIGHT THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU JEAN-MARC I GUESS THAT'S A GOOD LEAD INTO THE NEXT QUESTION SO WHEN- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS UM YOU KNOW WE- WE'VE HAD SOME SHUTDOWNS UM WE'VE HAD THINGS COME BACK ONLINE DO YOU DO YOU FEEL THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR CEOS ARE- ARE GETTING MORE CONFIDENT IN THEIR ABILITY TO STAY ONLINE THEY'RE GETTING BETTER IN TERMS OF PROTOCOLS AND SORT OF ADVANCING UP THE CURVE THERE EAH I- I WOULD THINK SO I THINK ALL OF US HAVE UH MADE UH TREMENDOUS UH EFFORTS TO UH PROVIDE THE PROPER ENVIRONMENT FROM UH FOR OUR UH EMPLOYEES UH IT'S VERY INTERESTING I- I WAS COMMENTING ON THE- THE YOU KNOW HALF OF A PERCENT OF OUR E- EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY COVID UH CONFIRMED UM WE HAVE HAD NO NEW CASE CONFIRMED CASE IN EUROPE SINCE THE MIDDLE OF MAY WOW SO I THINK THIS IS SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE TAKE RESPONSIBILITY UH IN THEIR DAILY LIVES RIGHT BECAUSE IT GOES BEYOND WHAT THEY DO WITHIN OUR FACTORIES OR DURING THE EIGHT HOURS OR 10 HOURS WHATEVER THAT THEY WORK WITH US UH YOU CAN HAVE AN IMPACT AND I THINK YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE WEAR MASKS WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH UH OUTSIDE UH WHICH PEOPLE UH THEY- THEY COME ACROSS I THINK IT MAKES A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE UH SO I HOPE THE REALITY WILL SLOWLY OR MORE- MORE THAN SLOWLY UH SETTLE IN AND UH AND GOOD PRACTICES WILL UH GET THAT UH VIRUS A- AWAY FROM US UH SOONER RATHER THAN LATER AND I THINK- GOT YOU PEOPLE ARE SEEING THE- THE CONFIDENCE BUILDING UP I MEAN IT'S HUMAN NATURE YOU NEED TO BE AFFECTED TO TAKE STEPS AND I THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS WHERE IN MANY PLACES PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING AFFECTED BEFORE THEY TAKE STEPS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT CHINA I MEAN CHINA IS YOU KNOW GOING EXTREMELY STRONG UH YOU KNOW IT'S A SMALL OPERATION FOR US BUT WE ARE ABOVE BUDGET ABOVE LAST YEAR RIGHT UH YOU LOOK AT EUROPE NO N- NEW CASES ARE REALLY UH ON A DOWNWARD TREND EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SOME CLUSTERS HERE AND THERE AND WE'RE SEEING A STRONGER UH RECO- REBOUND AND I HOPE THIS IS COMING UH TO US IN THE US THROUGHOUT THE US THAT'S GREAT THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR JEAN-MARC AND I- I HOPE EVERYBODY'S SAFE AND WELL OVER THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH UM AND- AND GOOD LUCK THANK

one billion euros of the roughly five hundred million euro decline in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year two thirds was related to lower shipments and one third was related to lower

Volume was a headwind of forty-one million euros in the quarter. Packaging shipments fell by twelve percent primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in march of our noxburgaz plant in france due to covid nineteen. Shipments to the north american canned meat market increased slightly year over year. Automotive shipments increased slightly year over year. Admissions declined fifty four percent compared to last year as many of our automotive oem customers curtailed production for april and most of may price and mix was a headwind of two million euros costs were a tailwind of twenty one million euros due to strong broad based cost control with labor and maintenance as important contributors metal costs were neutral in the quarter as we faced difficult year over year comparisons Year-over-year comps UBCI supply chain challenges and lower metal prices FX translation was a tailwind of one million euros now turn to slide ten and let's focus on the A&T segment adjusted ebitda of thirty one million euros decreased by fifty one percent compared to last year volume was a headwind of forty six million euros on lower airspace and TID Shipments.

At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was four point four times and our net debt was two point two billion euros, slightly lower than our net debt position at the end of twenty nineteen. We remain very committed to capital discipline. We reduced our twenty twenty capex targets to approximately one hundred seventy five million euros, a ninety six million euro reduction from twenty nineteen. THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY WE SPENT THIRTY TWO MILLION EUROS LESS IN KAPEX THAN IN THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR OUR FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WAS NEGATIVE THIRTY THREE MILLION EUROS DURING THE QUARTER AS A CONSEQUENCE OF LOWER ACTIVITY OUR FACTORED RECEIVABLES WERE LOWER THAN THE LEVELS THAT WE HAVE MAINTAINED IN RECENT QUARTERS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR FREE CASH FLOW BY SEVENTY THREE M EXPECT THE REVERS TO OCCUR AS ACTIVITY LEVELS INCREASE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF FACTORING THE COMPANY ACTUALLY GENERATED POSITIVE FREE CASH FLOW IN THE SECOND QUARTER WHICH IS A VERY IMPRESSIVE OUTCOME IN MY VIEW OUR FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE FIRST HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY WAS FIFTY FOUR MILLION EUROS AS JEAN MARK NOTED EARLIER WE EXPECT TO GENERATE POSITIVE FREE CASH FLOW IN TWENTY TWENTY BASED ON OUR CURRENT VIEW OF MARKET CON Generating free cash flow is a firm priority, and we remain committed to deleveraging. As you can see in our debt summary on the bottom left-hand side of the page, we have no bond maturities until 2024. During the quarter, we refinanced the remaining two hundred million of our four and five eights percent notes due 2021 with three with three hundred twenty-five million dollars of five and five eights percent notes due 2021. Due to twenty twenty eight twenty twenty eight while we initially planned to repay the twenty ones with free cash flow we felt it was prudent to remove this near term maturity given the favorable debt market conditions notably this was the lowest a coupon dollar bomb that constellation has ever priced a considerable achievement in the midst of a pandemic as a result of our financing activities thus far in twenty twenty eight we now expect cash Investment of one hundred fifty to one hundred sixty million euros our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was nine hundred forty nine million euros at the end of the second quarter as jean marc noted we added fifty million euros to this balance in july and we remain very comfortable in our liquidity position i will now hand the call back to jean marc thank you peter let's turn to site fifteen i want to highlight some Something that is core to our business sustainability in early july we published our twenty nineteen business and sustainability report which you can find on our website i'd like to point out a few highlights from twenty nineteen safety is our first priority our target is to reduce our recordable case rate by ten percent year after year between twenty sixteen and twenty nineteen our recordable case rate decreased by twenty seven percent AND WE ARE TRENDING VERY WELL THIS YEAR THIS MEANS THAT MORE OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE RETURNING HOME INJURY FREE EVERY DAY WE ALSO IMPROVED OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY SIX POINT FOUR PERCENT COMPARED TO A TWENTY FIFTEEN BASELINE THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF CO2 SAVINGS EVERY YEAR FURTHER WE INTRODUCED A TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TARGET TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INTENSITY RECYCLING BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AGAINST THE TWENTY FIFTEEN BASELINE AND WE HAVE A DETAILED PLAN TO ACHIEVE THIS TARGET AS MANY OF YOU KNOW RECYCLING IS A CORE COMPETENCY AT CONSOLIDATED ALUMINUM ALUMINUM IS INFINITELY RECYCLABLE WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL ALUMINUM EVER PRODUCED STILL IN USE TODAY MUSSALLAH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST RECYCLERS OF ALUMINUM CANS GLOBALLY WITH A CAPACITY TO RECYCLE OVER TWENTY BILLION CANS EVERY YEAR AT NUFRIZAC WE ALSO RECYCLE THE EQUIVALENT OF TWELVE BILLION BEVERAGE CANS EVERY YEAR AS A COMPANY CONSTELLY RECYCLED OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF EXTERNALLY SOURCED ALUMINIUM SCRAP IN TWENTY NINETEEN I AM ALSO PROUD THAT THIRD PARTIES ARE RECOGNIZING CONSTELLY FOR OUR SUSTAINABILITY ACHIEVEMENTS THE ALLUMINIUM STEWARDSHIP INITIATIVE OR A S I IS AN INDUSTRY LED INITIATIVE TO DRIVE SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE ALUMINIUM VALUE CHAIN FROM PRODUCERS TO CUSTOMERS IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE RECEIVED A S I CERTIFICATIONS FOR ZINGEN'S CASTING AND ROLLING OPERATIONS AND WE BEGAN PRODUCING A S I CERTIFIED COILS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS FROM ZINGEN IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ALSO RECEIVED A S I CERTIFICATION OF OUR NUF PRIZAC FACILITY UNDER PROVISIONAL COVID CONDITIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ACHIEVED THE ECOVADIS PLATINUM RATING WHICH IS AWARDED TO THE TOP ONE PERCENT OF COMPANIES ASSESSED WORLDWIDE AND WE RECEIVED AN E S G RATING OF DOUBLE A FROM M S C I PLACING US IN THE TOP FIVE PERCENT OF OUR SECTOR OVERALL WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL YEAR ON OUR SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR PROGRESS ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVES NOW LET'S TURN TO SLIDE SIXTEEN AND DISCUSS OUR END MARKETS WE BELIEVE OUR BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS ACROSS END MARKETS, JURISDICTIONS, AND CUSTOMERS IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE DURING CHALLENGING TIMES LIKE THESE I'LL START WITH THE PACKAGING MARKET PACKAGING IS A CORE MARKET FOR CONSTELLYUM AND REPRESENTS THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR L T M REVENUE WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG GROWTH IN LONG DEMAND IN NORTH AMERICA AND STABLE DEMAND IN EUROPE FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT THIS MARKET IS BOTH RECESSION RESILIENT AND SECULAR GROWTH FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT THIS MARKET IS BOTH RECESSION RESILIENT AND SECULAR GROWTH FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT THIS MARKET IS BOTH RECESSION RESILIENT AND SECULAR GROWTH FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT THIS MARKET IS BOTH RECESSION RESILIENT AND SECULAR GROWTH FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT THIS MARKET IS BOTH RECESSION Driving incremental demand for can sheet in the years to come the consumer preference trend is only one of the tailwinds for can sheet in Europe the demand for can sheet continues to grow based on substitution of aluminum for steel in the US we continue to expect the growth of auto body sheet demand to tighten supply to the packaging market over the medium to long term NOW LET'S MOVE TO AUTOMOTIVE OVER THE LONG TERM, AUTOMOTIVE REMAINS THE SECULAR GROWTH MARKET FOR ALUMINUM CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO PREFER LARGER VEHICLES WITH REGULATIONS AIMED AT INCREASING FUEL EFFICIENCY AND REDUCING EMISSIONS THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO LIGHTWEIGHT IN ADDITION WE EXPECT HYBRID AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO CONTINUE TO GAIN SHARE OF THE FLEET THESE VEHICLES ARE ALUMINUM INTENSIVE DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF COSTELLIUM IS WELL POSITIONED TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF THIS SECULAR SHIFT TO ALUMINUM IN AUTOMOTIVE AND THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THE FLEET MOVING TO MORE RECENT TRENDS AUTOMOTIVE OEMS BEGAN CURTATING PRODUCTION IN MARCH AND LARGELY RESUMED PRODUCTION IN MAY WHILE DEMAND FROM OUR CUSTOMERS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN JUNE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED UNEVEN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES AND COVID NINETEEN HOT SPOTS WHILE WE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AUTOMOTIVE DEMAND IN THE BACK HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTIONS AT THE OEM LET'S TURN NOW TO AEROSPACE AEROSPACE REPRESENTED FIFTEEN PERCENT OF OUR L T M REVENUES THE NEAR TERM OUTLOOK FOR AEROSPACE REMAINS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE EFFECTS FROM COVID NINETEEN AND THE SEVEN THREE SEVEN MAX AEROSPACE OEMS HAVE REDUCED BUILD RATES AND IT IS UNCLEAR HOW LONG BUILD RATES WILL REMAIN AT THESE LEVELS WE EXPECT AEROSPACE SHIPMENTS IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY WILL BE LOWER THAN THE LEVEL IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY IN T I D WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND IN EACH PRODUCT IN A DIVERSIFIED RANGE OF MARKETS OVER THE LONG TERM IN THE NEAR TERM THE DEFENSE AND RAIL MARKETS REMAIN STRONG BUT MOST INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION MARKETS REMAIN WEAK THIS MARKET IS DEPENDENT UPON THE HEALTH OF THE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN AND TO WHAT EXTENT THIS MARKET WILL REBOUND IN CLOSING I AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE CONSTELLIUM TEAM FOR THEIR TIRELESS EFFORTS DURING THIS TRYING TIME WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO OPERATIONAL EXECUTION HARVEST IMPROVING THE BENEFITS OF OUR INVESTMENTS DISCIPLINED CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT DEBT REDUCTION AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATION WITH THAT JOANNA WE WILL NOW OPEN THE Q AND A SESSION THANK YOU SIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION AT THIS TIME PLEASE PRESS FARDER THAN THE NUMBER ONE ON YOUR TOUCH TONE TELEPHONE IF YOUR QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED OR YOU WISH YOURSELF TO REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE QUEUE PLEASE PRESS THE POWER BUTTON Your first question comes from the line of Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chris, if you are on you please unmute. Chris, your line is now open. PHONE RINGING HI THERE IS YOUR MARK AND PETER CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH WE CAN GUD MORNING GRIFF THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION UM GUD MORNING THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO START WITH WAS JUST THE UTILIZATION RATES AND THE COMMENTS FROM ONE QUE YOU SORT OF STEP THROUGH HOW YOU SAW UTILIZATION IN EACH OF THE DIVISIONS FOR TWO QUE AND THEN PERHAPS FOR THREE QUE AND FOUR QUE APPRECIATE YOU DON'T HAVE GUIDANCE WONDERED WHETHER YOU COULD MAYBE CONCEPTUALLY TALK THROUGH THREE Q VERSUS FOUR Q AND JUST VERSUS TWO Q OR ANY COMMENTS YOU COULD MAKE ON THE DIVISIONS AS AN UPDATE FROM LAST QUARTER THANKS CHRIS SO I'LL START TO THE MARKETS AND THEN KIND OF TRANSLATE IT INTO WHAT IT CAN MEAN FOR THE DIVISIONS, RIGHT? BUSINESS UNITS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR VERSUS THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR YOU SEE PACKAGING ROUGHLY TEN PERCENT WE SEE AUTOMOTIVE FIFTY PERCENT DOWN, YOU SEE AEROSPACE FORTY PERCENT DOWN, RIGHT ROUGHLY AND THE OTHER MARKETS AND EACH MARKET IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DOWN THIS IS MADE OF VERY DIFFERENT DYNAMICS, RIGHT SO IN PACKAGING WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS NINETY FIVE PERCENT UTILIZATION THERE WAS A BIT OF A DROP ESPECIALLY IN APRIL WITH ALL THE LOCKDOWNS IN EUROPE REDUCTION IN A CAN CONSUMPTION AND ALL THAT BUT THAT H BACK PRETTY STRONG AND THE U S CONTINUES TO BE QUITE STRONG SO WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW PACKAGING AGAIN RECESSION RESILIENT SECULAR GROWTH AND WERE PRETTY CONFIDENT FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND WE LOOK AT Q2 AS BEING A KIND OF AN ABNORMAL QUARTER BECAUSE OF ALL THAT HAPPENED IN APRIL AND THE LITTLE BIT IN MAY I THINK WHEN WE TALKED ON Q1 WE WERE TALKING OF TWENTY PERCENT UTILISATION AS WE WERE WELL Speaking and now we're at above eighty percent, right? And if you do the average of twenty and eighty, you get to fifty, which is about what we experience in the second half in terms of reduction in their shipments. It is, um, it seems like it can be stronger than eighty percent going forward. We still are running very well in July, but we've seen that this restart has been with all kinds of fits and starts, right? So YOU HAVE UPS STORES, YOU HAVE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS, YOU HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN BRINGING PRODUCTS FROM MEXICO, BUILDING TRUCKS IN TEXAS IS CHALLENGING. SO YOU HAVE ALL THOSE YOU KNOW OPERATIONAL ISSUES THAT ALL OF US IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT CLEARLY THE DEMAND SEEMS TO BE YOU KNOW WELL IN EXCESS OF EIGHTY PERCENT OF WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR. SO THAT THATS ENCOURAGING AND HOPEFULLY COVID NINETEEN DON In that good trend if we look now at aerospace where we are running at around sixty percent in the quarter we expect more pain in the second half of the year and i think the reason for that is it's a long supply chain and customers you know move a little bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their orders and that that is creating a bit of a lag in terms of how much pain we take WE ARE IN VERY DETAIL DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS IN A VERY COLLABORATIVE FASHION TO LOOK AT WHAT THE SECOND HALF OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE AND WHILE CONTRACTUALLY WE COULD FORCE SOME VOLUMES ON US THAT'S NOT OUR TYPE WHAT THEY DON'T NEED WE DON'T WANT TO FORCE ON THEM SO WHAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH IS TAKING MORE PAIN NOW IN THE SECOND HALF SO THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE START WITH A CLEAN SLATE SO WE WOULD EXPECT SOME R In a in a second half of the year so if you translate all that into what it means for the different buys i would expect bob packaging and automotive to be better i would expect a s and n automotive structures essentially to be better in the second half and i would expect the t to be a more challenged in the second half thanks thanks so much Sorry, I just sort of follow up on packaging specifically where the volumes are down, you know, around about ten percent, I think, year on year and you're saying muscle shirts is doing well. It seems like the US is going, going well. I think Crown yesterday mentioned that southern Europe was weak. Can you just comment a little bit further about packaging in the EU region? Is it, was it down in the quarter because of demand or because you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had to have, you had FACILITIES OFF LINE AND MAYBE YOU CAN QUANTIFY SOME OF THE EUROPEAN IMPACTS YEAH I THINK SO SO THE REASON IM SAYING MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OR FIFTY NINE PERCENT OR WHATEVER IT ISNT A HUNDRED PERCENT IS EXACTLY BECAUSE OF SOME WEAKNESS IN EUROPE RIGHT AND I THINK ITS GOT TO DO WITH BOTH YOU KNOW THE REDUCTION IN ACTIVITY IN SOUTHERN EUROPE I MEAN A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE ECONOMIES THAT ARE BASED ON TOURISM AND THAT IS NOT THE WELL KNOW AND WE ARE SEEING YOU KNOW THERE'S LITTLE CLUSTERS AND HOT SPOTS SO EVERYBODY'S A BIT YOU KNOW VIGILANT AS THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT SO THAT IS WEIGHING DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON CANNABIS CONSUMPTION IN EUROPE YES PETER IF YOU COULD TALK THROUGH THE YOU KNOW THE TWO Q MOVING PARTS OBVIOUSLY YOU STEP THROUGH THOSE WATERFALL CHARTS AND YOU'RE GETTING COSTS DOWN DOING A GREAT JOB ON THE COST SIDE I JUST WONDERED IF YOU'D COME A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN ON THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE OF IT ON WORKING CAPITAL IN TERMS OF YOU'RE SAYING POSITIVE FOR THE FULL YEAR YOU'VE ALREADY OBVIOUSLY HIT THE Sure, happy to do it. And just for context, so on the second quarter, as we said last quarter, we we would use working capital. And we in fact burned sixty three million of working capital in the um q two and for the first half were positive twenty four so based on where we sit today i think it's plausible to think that you know with auto ramping with packaging kind of continuing to ramp back up WE COULD LOSE SOME GROUND IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR. SO NOT A HUGE NEGATIVE BUT WE COULD SEE WORKING CAPITAL BEING A USE IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR. BUT CHRIS I WOULD SAY THAT WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN SPITE OF THAT THAT WE WE CAN ACHIEVE A FREE CASH FLOW POSITION. THANKS THANKS FEDA THAT'S GREAT FOR ME THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT QUESTION The question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the Benchmark Company. Your line is open. Hey, good morning. Good morning, Josh. Just a question, Josh, how are you thinking, you know, any tariffs on Canadian aluminum? Have you increased any inventory expecting that, or just what should we be thinking on that front if that comes to fruition? Yeah, well, we believe it's a misguided measure if it happens, right? We've lobbied against it. Entered in the past, we got it removed, it may come back. We think it's misguided, and it doesn't address a problem which is overcapacity from China, from a non-market economy that doesn't play by the same rules as we do. Now, that said, if it happens, it's got a very limited impact on us. I'll remind you that we pass through the metal costs essentially to most of our customers. There may be a little section of the business where we do. CANNOT REPRICE IMMEDIATELY WHEN IT HAPPENS BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE WE MAY GAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ON SCRAP RECYCLING AS WELL SO NOT MUCH OF AN IMPACT FOR US THE REASON WE'RE AGAINST IT IS MUCH MORE A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN FREE AND FAIR TRADE AND REALLY A PROBLEM FOR OUR FINANCES OR OUR ECONOMIC OUTCOMES You know, your larger contracts are up for renegotiation and then just any comment around, you know, pricing and strength. Yeah, so we see so we don't go into the detail of exactly which contracts mature when but you know that we've got a few renewals coming in around the twenty two horizon we are making good progress and i think the pricing environment is i would describe it as mildly positive in the us and mildly positive in europe.

Mercedes-Benz has always been so we have a strong position and I'm looking at the future with a great deal of confidence. Great, thank you. Thank you, George. Your next question comes from the line of B of D. The audio contains a mix of male and female voices speaking in different languages. The male voice is speaking in English, while the female voice is speaking in Spanish. The male voice is speaking about a specific topic, while the female voice is responding to a question. The male voice is calm and measured, while the female voice is excited and enthusiastic. The audio also contains some background noise. BUT IT'S NOT A ONE OFF AND IT CONTINUES THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS CORPORATE ARBITRAGE OR SHORTAGE PARTIAL OR SHORT TIME WORK AND THESE GUARANTEED PROGRAMS CONTINUE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY AND IN SOME CASES INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE OH YEAH SO WE SHOULD EXPECT ABOUT A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR QUARTERLY BENEFIT FROM THOSE PROGRAMS EACH QUARTER YEAH YEAH BECAUSE WHAT'LL HAPPEN DAVID IS REMEMB AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS OF THAT. SO I THINK YOU SHOULD ASSUME THAT IN THE BUSINESS THAT IT YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA SO PACKAGING FOR EXAMPLE WHERE WE HAD SOME BENEFIT IN IN Q2 WE SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW BASICALLY VERY LIMITED IF ANY BENEFIT IN Q3 AND AUTOMOTIVE WHICH SHOULD FADING AWAY AND AEROSPACE WILL HAVE SOME CONTINUING GIVEN THE OPERATING UTILISATION RATE THERE BUT IT'LL BE A MUCH LOWER NUMBER ABOUT PEOPLE BEING UNEMPLOYED DURING THE QUARTER AT THE TRUFFLE WHICH IS BEHIND US WE HAD SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE UNDER SOME KIND OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OR TEMPORARY LAYOFF NOW WE ARE AT LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND SO IT'S CLOSED DRASTICALLY YEAH AND DAVID JUST TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE THE YOU KNOW IF YOU GET TO THE FOURTH QUARTER THE NUMBER MIGHT BE SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT RIGHT JUST BASED ON THE TRENDS W BUT JUST IN TERMS OF THE UTILIZATION RATE JUST ROUGH NUMBER OH THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPFUL THANK YOU AND THEN JUST JUST IN TERMS OF THE UM YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL AND MARKET COMMENTARY ON THE AEROSPACE SIDE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE BEST OR HAS BEEN THE HIGHEST MARGIN BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW JUST IN TERMS OF THE OUTLET COMMENTARY YOU FRAMED OBVIOUSLY TWO SEGMENTS UP ONE SEGMENT DOWN BUT YOU KNOW THE DOWN SEGMENT IS I DIDN'T REALLY GET A SENSE OF ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF THE DOWN NUMBER VERSUS THE UP NUMBERS. CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A SENSE TO YOU DO YOU BELIEVE THAT AEROSPACE WILL COMPLETELY OFFSET THE RECOVERY IN AUTO AND PACKAGING IN THE SECOND HALF OR A BIT MORE YOU KNOW COLOR ON MAGNITUDE OF THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ON THE DOWN IN AEROSPACE WOULD BE HELPFUL WE HAVE TO MAKE JOINTLY WITH THEM AS WE MENTIONED WE'VE GOT CONTRACTS WHEREBY WE CAN FORCE THEM TO TAKE SOME PRODUCTS WHICH THEY WILL TAKE AND PAY FOR BUT THEN THEY DON'T NEED IT THE FOLLOWING YEAR RIGHT SO THEY HOLD THE INVENTORY THEY ARE HOLDING THE BACKS SO WE ARE LOOKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEM IN TERMS OF WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THEY NEED WHICH BY THE WAY I DON'T THINK THEY FULLY KNOW NOW AND IT'S NO CRITICISM OF THEM I LET'S LOOK AT WHAT CUTS DO WE TAKE THEN I COULD ANSWER YOUR QUESTION POSSIBLY AT THIS STAGE I CANNOT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE WILL BE FOR SURE MORE PAIN IN A IN A AUTO-STRUCTURES AND THEN THE EAR IN AUTO-STRUCTURES IN AEROSPACE MY APOLOGIES AEROSPACE NOW THE OTHER THING TOO IS THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT ANY PERIOD IN THE RECENT PAST THE SECOND HALF IS ALWAYS WEAKER THAN THE FIRST HALF RIGHT IN AER So that's something to factor in as well. Okay and just my last related question is um, I think you mentioned average utilization rates for airspace related demand in the second quarter was around sixty percent at your facilities. Is that right? What is that number now? We're running still around that number, but I would expect it to go down. Maybe to fifty percent, that kind of range. Okay, all right, that's helpful. Thanks very much. Yeah, so it's important to say we're not expecting it to go down to thirty percent, right, even that's not on the horizon. Speakers, your next question comes from the line of Kurt Woodward from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. MORNING PETER FIRST QUESTION ON THE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS OF COST REDUCTIONS HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD YOU VIEW AS STRUCTURAL AND THEN YOU KNOW I GUESS JUST IN GENERAL IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF COSTS YOU THINK YOU COULD TAKE OUT OF THE BUSINESS THIS YEAR ON A PERMANENT BASIS CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON ON THOSE EFFORTS A HUNDRED MILLION IS RELATED TO LABOUR RIGHT? SO AND THAT'S PROBABLY LABOUR'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW HALF OF THAT HUNDRED MILLION. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE ARE REALLY CLOSELY LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS AND WHAT IT'S LIKELY TO BE LIKE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SIZE OUR LABOUR FORCES ACCORDING TO THAT. SO IN THAT REGARD I THINK WE WOULD EXPECT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF PERMANENT SAVINGS BUT REMEMBER AS WE KINDA RAMP UP THE OPERATIONS WE DO EXPECT SOME OF THAT COST IS GOING TO COME BACK RIGHT SO YOU KNOW I'D SAY IT'S HARD TO GIVE A REALLY PRECISE NUMBER ON THAT KURT IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE AND ONE OF THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WAS TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE LEAN OUR ORGANIZATION WITHOUT LOOSING COMPETENCIES CAPABILITIES BUT HOW DO WE LEAN AND MAKE THE ORGANIZATION STRONGER AND I THINK WHAT COVID NINETEEN IS DOING TO US AND I GUESS TO MANY OTHER COMPANIES OUT THERE IS ACCELERATE THE NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT MAY HAVE TAKEN MORE TIME TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO ALONG LINES THAT PETER WAS SAYING I THINK WE'LL COME OUT OF THIS With some permanent cost reductions and as we ramp up, we will not ramp up and inject back a hundred million of costs how much you know we will remain to be seen because we are really learning as we are doing and we are just in the middle of it now but we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger and there are certain categories like for example professional fees subcontractors where you know kind of as we work without these because those are your KIND OF BIG CATEGORIES OF REDUCTION I THINK WE WERE ABLE TO KIND OF LIVE WITHOUT A LOT OF THAT GOING FORWARD SO SO YEAH I THINK THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY A PIECE OF THAT THAT WE CAN CARRY FORWARD THERE ARE EXAMPLES THAT ARE NOT TRIGGERED THEY ARE QUITE REVEALING RIGHT SO WE HAVE A VERY STRONG R N D AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT ORGANIZATION WHICH IS YOU KNOW R N D AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT ORGANIZATION WHICH IS YOU KNOW R N D AND TE A LOT OF THE WORK WAS DONE BY PEOPLE GOING TO THE LOCATION NOW OBVIOUSLY IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL ANYWHERE AND A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH A REMOTE INTERACTION VIDEO CONFERENCE BUT EVEN WHEN YOU GO TO A TO A PLANT AND YOU LOOK AT I GOT A PROBLEM AND I NEED TO IMPROVE THE SPEED ON THIS MILL WE HAVE PEOPLE YOU KNOW INTERACTING BY THE MILL PULLEY ON A FACE TIME AND GOING INTO LOOKING INTO THE ROLLING MILLS BY FACETIME WITH A TECHNICAL ADVISOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET AND THAT WORKS ACTUALLY FINE WHICH WE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. SO IN THE FUTURE WHAT YOU'RE GAINING HERE IS WELL YOU'RE SAVING TRAVEL TIME WHICH IS NOT VERY GOOD FOR THE AEROSPACE BUSINESS BUT ALSO YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR Y Interventions while historically within a week you know it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done so i think we're going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our our space that are going to be quite interesting in the future and i think it's going to help us inject more brain and talent remotely with more activity HOPEFULLY IT COMES ACROSS THAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING HARD AT TAKING STRUCTURAL COSTS OUT AND IN THE SHORT TERM THE OBJECTIVE IS WE WANT TO BE YOU KNOW KIND OF FREE CASH FLOW POSITIVE THROUGH THIS CRISIS AND SO THAT WE DON'T TAKE ON ANY INCREMENTAL DEBT IDEALLY AND IN THE LONGER TERM WE WANT TO EMERGE WITH A YOU KNOW KIND OF MUCH STRONGER EARNINGS POWER SO WE'RE FOCUSED ON EXACTLY THAT AND AND YOU WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY AS WE PROG Okay, now that that's helpful. And then, in terms of the pre-cash flow, you know, dynamics, I mentioned I think it's seventy three million dollar impact from backing this quarter or otherwise you'd be pre-cash positive, which is pretty, pretty positive given your utilization rate. And now you're talking about ninety five percent utilization and packaging over eighty percent, an auto, and it seems like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized. So You know, seventy five percent of your business is could be close to ninety percent utilization in a couple of months. I get that arrow is weaker but it would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint you know, unless less working capital would be a major negative, you you should be generating decent free cash in the back half of the year. Can you comment at all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year? Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. So we won't put a specific number on it. BUT WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GENERATE FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE FULL YEAR AND YOU KNOW THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR I THINK THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT WE CAN GENERATE SOME FREE CASH FLOW BUT IT DEPENDS A LOT ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH TRADE WORKING CAPITAL AS WE SAID WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW THE RAMP OF THESE BUSINESSES SO WE WANT TO BE A LITTLE CAUTIOUS UNTIL WE SEE THE PACE OF THE RAMP AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RAMP BUT AGAIN FOR WE REMAIN CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN GENERATE FREE CASH FLOW okay and then just one final question on Aero, Jean-Marc, you had a comment on i guess working with the oems to create you set a clean slate entering twenty twenty one so is that statement kind of reflecting the fact that the oems cut very quickly and i assume there's sort of an excess inventory issue that they're dealing with or are generally in the supply chain and so you know is that statement kind of reflecting the fact that the oems cut very quickly and i assume there's sort of an excess inventory issue that they're dealing with or are generally in the supply chain and so you know is that statement kind of reflecting the fact that the oems cut very quickly and i assume there's sort of an excess inventory HYPOTHETICALLY, YOUR VOLUMES WOULD BE BELOW THE ACTUAL BUILD RATE TO HELP THEM CLEAR INVENTORIES. SO WHEN YOU GET INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU KNOW THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS IN A PRETTY GOOD POSITION. THEN YOU KNOW CONTRACTUALLY YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T GONNA FORCE IT ON THEM BUT THEN YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA HELP THEM MANAGE THAT DO THEY DO YOU GET ANYTHING IN RETURN IE YOU KNOW PRICE BENEFIT OR YOU KNOW IT'S JUST Well, yeah, no fair question. So, I think I've commented in the past on the fact that I thought that the shipments were making into the o.e.n. right into the supply chain were actually higher than what the build rates were warranting at the time. And obviously, the build rates are going down very significantly. So, now, the pain we're going to take in the second half, I think, is not going to be two. PURCHASE ALL THE INVENTORY BUILD UP IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN FIRST OF ALL BUT I THINK WHAT THAT DOES IS IT POSITIONS US FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT DOESN'T SHOW FURTHER DISSOLUTION THAT'S WHAT WE'RE INTO RIGHT THAT WE WANT TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE WHAT WE SUPPLY IS BY AND LARGE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS BEING BUILT RIGHT SO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHETHER WE GET THERE FREE I DON'T KNOW BUT CERTAINLY WE ARE AIMING BETTER IN TWENTY ONE THAN WHAT THE SECOND NINE MONTHS OF POST COVID WILL BE IN A N T THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE GOALS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE O E N S WE'VE GOT VERY STRONG DEEP STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM I'VE COMMENTED ALSO IN THE PAST ON THE FACT THAT WE'RE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL AND I THINK IT'S EVIDENCE BY THE TEN YEAR CONTRACT WE HAVE WITH THEM Working with airbus. I mean, tenure is a long duration, never happened before and we did it because it was a right thing to do for both companies, for both businesses. And we didn't do it as a reaction to covid or whatever, right. I mean, that was really the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies. So we're looking past the current crisis. The current crisis, we've got to get all in the same boat or in the same airplane. AND PUT US IN THE SAME PLACE, WORK TOGETHER TO OVERCOME THE CRISIS AND WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW IF I DO THAT YOU GIVE ME A BIT MORE PRICE OR WHATEVER I THINK IT'S JUST A RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN A WIN-WIN PARTNERSHIP AND WE DO SOME THINGS THAT HELP THEM AND THEY DO SOME THINGS THAT HELP US IN THE FUTURE WHICH HAVE ALREADY DONE IN THE PAST AND THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED AND THAT'S CONTINUING Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields from Bank of America. Your line is open. Hey, Mark, hey, Peter. One on the markets and then one on the balance sheet, please. So, you know, saw that can volumes were down about 11 percent. But you know, Norsk reported can volumes up 11 percent. I think you guys face relatively the same markets in Europe. Can you can you sort of point to a point? Maybe they're having more success on their can volumes was it, was it an NFT for sale being down issue or or a market issue or what like what can you just explain that discrepancy for us please so it's mainly i believe i mean i can't comment on their specific situation but in our case the main reason was that we had to take down nftxyz for a full week and then ramp it up gradually i remind you that nftxyz was at the center of a hot spot of the first real nfts A SHORT PHRASE THAT DESCRIBES THE CONDITIONS OF SHIPPING OUT OF FINLAND IN THE SECOND HALF OF MARCH. Funding from from France and and obviously Switzerland and and Germany you said it was partially guaranteed but it's also secured can you just give us a a a better understanding of sort of what it's secured by is it inventory or is it sort of p and e and then to what extent is it guaranteed by the French government well it depends on the facility but the big one the French one is secured on p and e And in the case of the German ones, one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured, and the Swiss one is unsecured. And the guarantees, what the way they work is they guarantee a certain percentage of the principal. So it's a normal syndicate of banks with, in the case of France, I think the guarantee is for seventy percent of the, or sorry, eighty percent of the, in the case of France, of the principal balance. GUARANTEED BY THE FRENCH STATE IN THE CASE OF GERMANY I THINK IT'S EIGHTY PERCENT TOO JUST JUST FOR OUR PURPOSES AS CREDIT ANALYSTS EIGHTY PERCENT OF THAT FRENCH LOAN IS IS SOMEWHAT NON RECOURSE TO YOU WELL AGAIN IT'S IT IS RECOURSE TO US WELL WHAT I THINK THE POINT IS IS THAT IF YOU'RE A LENDER SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IN THE SYNDICATE OF BANKS AND YOU'RE JUST Are lending say fifty percent your responsibility is for ten or sorry fifty percent fifty million your responsibility is for ten of that right so it's the banks that benefit from the guarantee not not the company okay so you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks yeah absolutely yeah but one thing that yeah i'm sorry i'm sorry but one thing that the government isn't fact-stopping the loan for you It's stopping the loan for the banks. Exactly, exactly. But one thing to, you know, kind of, I think, is a really important point is, you know, our, our intent in putting this liquidity on the balance sheet was to remove any question about the fact that we had enough liquidity. As we said from the beginning, and based on the performance in the second quarter, we do not anticipate using this. So the French facility, we had to, DRAW JUST BY THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT BUT IT JUST SITS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS CASH AND THE GERMAN FACILITY THAT WE'VE NOW SIGNED UP IN JULY YOU KNOW WE DON'T EXPECT TO DRAW THAT D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D That's right cheap money and that was important to us we don't think we need the money so we're not going to pay a lot of interest for it yeah exactly that and it obviously was an inducement for the banks to lend right now fair enough and that's i think you the french facilities what two and a half percent effectively at this point yeah yeah that code That's right, no, no, that's right. Now, remember the the use of the capital, there are some limitations on the use of the capital, right? So, for example, we can't use that capital to go in buyback bonds in the market. So, it's really meant to be for you know kind of operating needs of the company. But, yeah, you're right, we don't have any. We don't have a strong incentive to repay that. But, but what we will, what we will do is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME COST TO IT, RIGHT? SO AS WE KINDA EMERGE FROM THE CRISIS AND HAVE A LITTLE MORE VISIBILITY THAN WE WILL UNWIND THOSE FACILITIES OH, THAT'S THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANKS FOR ALL THE COLOR AND AND GOOD LUCK IN THE BACKGROUND THANK YOU THANK YOU YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF SHAUN WORRICK FROM DEUTSCHE BANK YOUR LINE IS OPEN HEY GUYS THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS AND REALLY GREAT JOB ON TR SEEING COSTS HERE ARE BOTH VERY HELPFUL JUST WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BIG PICTURE IF YOU LOOK AT THE AUTO MARKET THERE ARE SORTS OF PROJECTIONS OUT THERE THAT WILL HAVE ABOUT YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DECLINE IN NEW CARS THIS YEAR YOU KNOW MOSTLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE WEREN'T PRODUCING BACK IN MARCH APRIL AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE USED AUTO MARKET YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN PRETTY STRONG AS A BLEW WITH USED PRICES REALLY Y How production's been increasing and demand is increasing there you know to kind of get to down twenty five percent you know you'd have to have some pretty strong growth in three q and three four so i guess what i'm asking is do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon you know with demand pulling through based on a lack of cars and if you can provide a little color what you're seeing there that would be very helpful yeah so the older book is STRONG THERE'S NO QUESTION IT'S ABOVE THE EIGHTY PERCENT THAT I'M MENTIONING RIGHT BUT WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE BIT CLOSED YOU KNOW BY CUSTOMERS JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO TELLING US WE NEED PRODUCT TOMORROW AND THEN TELLING US THE NEXT DAY THE PLANT IS SHUT DOWN RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY VIGILANT RIGHT AND I HOPE I THINK THE END DEMAND IS THERE I THINK THAT'S TRUE IN THE US THAT'S TRUE IN EUROPE RIGHT THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE INJECTED A L CONSUMERS, RIGHT THROUGH THE PARTICULAR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OF YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SHAPES AND FORMS THAT YOU SEE ON BOTH CONTINENTS AND THAT IS YOU KNOW PRETTY GOOD FOR AN END DEMAND AT THE END OF THE DAY SO I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE A IT'S GOING TO MATERIALIZE INTO THE OLDER BOOK WE HAVE IS GOING TO BE ACTUALLY REAL ORDERS AND SHIPMENTS IN WHICH CASE IT SHOULD BE BETTER BUT YOU KNOW I'VE WE HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE W FITS AND STARTS YOU SEE PLANTS RESTARTING AND THEN SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S A COVID INFECTION OR YOU SEE PEOPLE HAVING A TROUBLE STAFFING YOU KNOW THE FALSE SHIFT BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY CASES IN THE HOT SPOTS SO IT'S STILL FRAGILE I MEAN IT LOOKS QUITE GOOD BUT IT'S STILL FRAGILE RIGHT THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU JOHN MAGGIN GUESS IT'S A GOOD LEAD IN TO THE NEXT QUESTION SO When you think about your customers you know we've had some shutdowns you know we've had things come back online do you do you feel that your customers and their ceos are getting more confidence in their ability to stay online or getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curve there yeah i would think so i think all of us have made tremendous efforts to provide the proper environment for our employees It's very interesting. I was commenting on the, you know, half of percent of our employees have been affected by covid confirmed. we have at no new case confirmed case in europe since the middle of may. so i think it's saying something about the fact that when people take responsibility in their daily lives, right? It goes beyond what we do. WE DO IT IN OUR FACTORIES OR DURING THE EIGHT HOURS OR TEN HOURS WHATEVER THAT THEY WORK WITH US YOU CAN HAVE AN IMPACT AND I THINK YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE WEAR MASKS WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WITH PEOPLE THEY THEY COME ACROSS I THINK IT MAKES A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE SO I HOPE THE REALITY WILL SLOWLY OR MORE THAN SLOWLY SETTLE IN AND AT GREAT PRACTICES WILL GET THAT VIRUS AWAY FROM US SOONER RATHER THAN LATER AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE CONFIDENCE BUILDING UP. I THINK IT'S HUMAN NATURE YOU NEED TO BE AFFECTED TO TAKE STEPS AND I THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS WHERE IN MANY PLACES PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING AFFECTED BEFORE THEY TAKE STEPS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT CHINA I MEAN CHINA IS YOU KNOW GOING EXTREMELY STRONG YOU KNOW IT'S A SMALL OPERATION FOR US BUT WE ARE ABOVE BUDGET ABOVE LAST YEAR Someone is speaking in a foreign language.

MECHANISMS WE HAVE INCLUDING INCENTIVES TO ACCELERATE SYSTEM UPGRADES IN MISSOURI AND ALABAMA AND REALTIME BRICK-MAKING IN ALABAMA ARE KEY TO TIMELY RECOVERY AND SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION EARNINGS GROWTH AND BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE TO REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS AS YOU KNOW FROM OUR DISCUSSION LAST QUARTER IN MISSOURI WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH A NUMBER OF <INAUDIBLE> CASES DECIDED BY THE MISSOURI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION GOING BACK TO 2016 THAT HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND APPEALED BY THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC COUNSEL AND RESULTED IN ADVERSE APPELLATE COURT RULINGS LATE LAST YEAR AT THE TIME OF THE APPEAL COURT ORDERS WE SAID WE WOULD PURSUE ALL AVENUES LEGISLATIVE JUDICIAL AND REGULATORY TO PRESERVE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN THE SAFETY RELIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR PIPELINE SYSTEM WHILE ACHIEVING TIMELY RECOVERY THE START OF THE MISSOURI LEGISLATIVE SESSION IN JANUARY WE WORKED TO INTRODUCE BILLS IN BOTH THE HOUSE AND SENATE TO CLARIFY THE ISRS STATUTE AS IT RELATES TO THE ELIGIBILITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE SPEND FOR ACCELERATED RECOVERY THE SENATE BILL PASSED EARLY MARCH ON MAY 6TH THE HOUSE PASSED THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE SENATE BILL GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VERSIONS PASSED IN EACH CHAMBER THE LEGISLATION WILL NOW GO TO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO RECONCILE THE TWO VERSIONS MEANWHILE WE HAVE CONTINUED TO FILE NEW ISRS REQUESTS INCLUDING ONE IN EARLY FEBRUARY LATE LAST MONTH WE THE STAFF OF THE MISSOURI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AND THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC COUNSEL REACHED THE UNANIMOUS STIPULATION AND

INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION RIDER OR AIM AND ARE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THE THRESHOLD NUMBER OF MILES REPLACED THIS YEAR IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE <INAUDIBLE> IN 2021 LIKE WE WERE SEEING THIS PAST YEAR WITH THAT I'LL TURN THE CALL OVER TO STEVE RASCHE FOR A FINANCIAL REVIEW AND UPDATE GOOD MORNING AND LET ME ADD MY WISHES FOR GOOD HEALTH AND SAFETY TO EVERYONE AND A HUGE SHOUT OUT TO ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND OUR OWN TEAM WHO CONTINUE TO SERVE BRAVELY EVERY DAY LET ME COVER OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUS AND AN UPDATE TO OUR TARGETS FOR THE SECOND HALF OF OUR FISCAL 202 TURNING TO OUR RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER WE DELIVERED CONSOLIDATED NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS OF $144 MILLION DOWN $3.90 MILLION FROM LAST YEAR OUR GAS UTILITY POSTED EARNINGS OF JUST OVER $144 MILLION DOWN $2.40 MILLION FROM LAST YEAR AS A RESULT OF WARMER WEATHER AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS AS MARKETING DELIVERED EARNINGS OF JUST OVER $5 MILLION DOWN JUST OVER $1 MILLION FROM LAST YEAR AS HIGHER VOLUMES FROM OUR EXPANSION WERE OFFSET BY LESS FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND HIGHER COSTS AND WE SAW HIGHER EARNINGS FROM THE SPIRE STL PIPELINE WHICH ENTERED SERVICE LAST QUARTER A LOWER LOSS FROM FU- SPIRE STORAGE REFLECTING THE BENEFITS OF OUR OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER CORPORATE COSTS LOOKING AT OUR PER SHARE RESULTS COURIER EARNINGS OF $2 AND 75 CENTS PER SHARE WERE DOWN 15 CENTS FROM LAST YEAR REFLECTING LOWER EARNINGS AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK ISSUED OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS I'D OFFER TWO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FIRST AS SUZANNE MENTIONED WE SAW LIMITED FINANCIAL IMPACT FROM THE CORONAVIRUS THIS QUARTER SINCE IT REALLY DIDN'T HIT OUR SERVICE TERRITORY IS IN UNTIL MID-MARCH OR IN THE FORWARD IMPACT IN A FEW MINUTES AND SECONDLY AS REFLECTED HERE NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS CONTINUES TO INCLUDE ALL ISRS REVENUES OR SAYING IN ANOTHER WAY EXCLUDING THE PROVISION WE BOOKED FOR GAP PURPOSES FOR THIS QUARTER ISRS REVENUE IS SUBJECT TO A PROVISION FOR $2.20 MILLION INCLUDING INTEREST BRINGING THE CUMULATIVE PROVISION AT MARCH 31 TO $16.90 MILLION OVERALL WHETHER THIS QUARTER WAS WARMER THAN NORMAL BY 11% IN MISSOURI AND BY 26% IN ALABAMA COMPARED TO LAST YEAR'S COLDER WEATHER WE SAW MARGINS AND MISSOURI DECLINE BY $3 MILLION AS SLIGHTLY LOWER RESIDENTIAL VOLUME METRIC MARGINS WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER NET ISRS REVENUES COMBINED WITH A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN COMMERCIAL MARKETS OUR SOUTHERN UTILITY SHOWED MARGIN GROWTH AS LOWER DEMAND WAS OFFSET BY ANNUAL RATE INCREASES MARGINS WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS OF NORMAL WEATHER AND MITIGATION MECHANISMS THAT OFFSET THAT EXPOSURE AGAIN IN OUR SOUTHERN SERVICE TERRITORY'S THE MECHANISMS LARGELY WORKED AS PLANNED IN MISSOURI HOWEVER WE SAW A $7 MILLION NEGATIVE IMPACT TO MARGINS AGAINST NORMAL WEATHER CONSISTING OF TWO COMPONENTS FIRST WNAR THIS NEW WEATHER NORMALIZATION TOOL WAS INTRODUCED IN OUR LAST RATE PROCEEDING AND SHOULD ENSURE THAT WE GET THE RIGHT RECOVERY OF THE RESIDENTIAL VOLUME METRIC CHARGE NOT OVER COLLECTING IN COLD PERIODS NOT UNDER COLLECTING IN WARMER ONES WHILE THE MECHANISM DID ADDRESS A PORTION OF OUR WEATHER DEFICIENCIES THIS QUARTER WE ESTIMATE THAT IT WAS INEFFECTIVE BY 6% OR ROUGHLY $5 MILLION SECONDLY WE SAW A SHORT FALL IN COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL MARGINS THAT DO NOT HAVE WEATHER MITIGATION IN MISSOURI EVEN FOR SMALLER MORE WEATHER SENSITIVE CUSTOMERS TOTAL IMPACT HERE WAS ABOUT $2 MILLION WE CLEARLY HAVE SOME WORK TO DO BOTH WORKING WITH OUR REGULATORS TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR WEATHER MITIGATION AND OUR NEXT MISSOURI RATE PROCEEDING AND TWO GENERATING EARNINGS FROM OTHER SOURCES IN THE BACK HALF OF 2020 TO OFFSET SOME OF THIS HAPPEN THERE WERE TWO OTHER KEY VARIANCES THIS QUARTER O&M EXPENSES AND OTHER EXPENSES AS OUTLINED HERE ON SLIDE 1 TOTAL O&M EXPENSES AS REPORTED WERE DOWN $12.60 MILLION AND ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A HISTORY OF COST CONTROL THIS REDUCTION REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF A REGULATORY DEFERRAL OF A PENSION REMEASURED CHARGE WITH THE OFFSETTING EXPENSE RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSES AS SHOWN HERE EXCLUDING THIS ADJUSTMENT OUR RUN RATE UTILITY O&M WAS UP $2.90 MILLION OR 2.60% DUE TO HIGHER OPERATIONS AND EMPLOYEE COSTS THE REMAINING O&M EXPENSES REPRESENT HIGHER MARKETING COSTS DUE TO OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND A COST OF SPIRE STL PIPELINE WHICH IS NOW IN OPERATIONS THE OTHER KEY VARIANCES IN OTHER EXPENSES WITH A RUN RATE INCREASE AFTER THE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE PEASANT PENSION RE-MEASUREMENT OF $6.50 MILLION REFLECTING TWO ITEMS FIRST PRIOR YEAR SPIRE STL PIPELINE AFUDC WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS IS NOW INTER-OPERATING NUMBERS AND SECONDLY A $3.60 MILLION SWING IN RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS HELD THE SUPPORT ON NON-QUALIFIED BENEFIT PLANS NOT SURPRISINGLY THIS YEAR WE SAW UNREALIZED LOSSES THIS QUARTER COMPARED TO A MUCH STRONGER EARNING STREAM IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 201 I WOULD NOTE THAT THE EXPLANATION OF ALL COST VARIANCES CONTRIBUTION MARGINS AS WELL AS OUR REVIEW OF OUR YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE APPENDIX TO THIS PRESENTATION FOR YOUR REFERENCE YOU KNOW SINCE THE HEALTH CRISIS BEGAN WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION HEARKENING BACK TO OUR FLIGHT BOOK FROM THE GREAT RECESSION WE MOVED AGGRESSIVELY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR BANK GROUP TO DRAW ON OUR CREDIT FACILITY IN MID-MARCH AS THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET BECAME UNECONOMIC IN LATE MARCH WE SECURED $150 MILLION TERM LOAN TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY AND WE STAND IN A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION WITH TOTAL AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY AT MARCH 31 OF $661 MILLION AND A SOLID LONG-TERM CAPITALIZATION AS WELL IN FACT WE ISSUED EQUITY EARLY IN THE QUARTER WITH PROCEEDS OF JUST UNDER $10 MILLION AS WE TURN TO THE CORONAVIRUS IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS A BIT OF PERSPECTIVE ROUGHLY 70% OF OUR EARNINGS AND MARGINS ARE RESIDENTIAL AND THE CURRENT HEALTH CRISIS FIT NEAR THE END OF THE WINTER HEATING SEASON WHERE WE EARN A MAJORITY OF OUR RETURN AS A RESULT WE'VE BEEN RELATIVELY INSULATED SO FAR FROM THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WE ARE WATCHING CLOSELY OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER FIRMS WHO ARE BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE OF THE CURRENT SHUTDOWN AND WE ARE TRACKING THE INCREMENTAL COSTS THAT THE ACTIONS THAT STEVE AND SUZANNE TOUCHED ON A FEW MINUTES AGO NOW NONE OF US HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL TO PREDICT HOW THIS SITUATION WILL PLAY OUT BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW TODAY INCLUDING DATA AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS WE'VE CONSTRUCTED A FORECAST OF KEY IMPACTS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT CONTINUATION OF THE DOWNTURN THROUGH THIS QUARTER AND THEN A SLOW RAMP UP IN ACTIVITY THAT WILL STRETCH AT LEAST THROUGH THE REST OF CALENDAR 2020 FROM AN OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT NORMAL WEATHER OR RETURN OF NORMAL COLLECTION ACTIVITIES DISCONNECTION AND LATE PAYMENT FEES AS WELL AS MINIMAL DISRUPTION FOR OUR CONSTRUCTION CREWS BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS WE HAVE ESTIMATED THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL IMPACTS AS A RESULT OF OUR MORATORIUM ON FEES WE ANTICIPATE LOSING FEE REVENUE OF ROUGHLY $1.90 MILLION WE HAVE UM SEEN SOME DECLINE IN OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL MARGINS REFLECTING BOTH THE TEMPORARY SHUTDOWNS OF LARGE MANUFACTURERS AND THE ANTICIPATED LOWER DEMAND FROM OUR SMART COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS WE ESTIMATE THAT IMPACT TO BE APPROXIMATELY $2.20 MILLION WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN ANY APPRECIABLE CHANGE IN OUR RESIDENTIAL MARGINS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT CLOSELY HOWEVER WE ARE ANTICIPATING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BAD DEATHS IN THE COMING QUARTERS TO ESTIMATE OUR EXPOSURE WE WENT BACK TO OUR RECORDS FOR THE LAST RECESSION IN 2008 AND 2009 WHEN WE SAW BAD DEBT EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE INCREASE ABOUT 20 BASIS POINTS OVER NORMAL LEVELS FLYING THAT EXPERIENCE TO OUR CURRENT BOOK OF BUSINESS RESULTS UH IN AN ESTIMATED EXPOSURE OF THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS AND OF COURSE WE'RE TRACKING OTHER UH DIRECT COSTS INCLUDING THE COST OF PP&E ENHANCED FACILITY CLEANING EMPLOYEE COSTS FOR LOST TIME AMONG OTHERS WE ARE PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES TO OFFSET THESE HEADWINDS INCLUDING IDENTIFYING THOSE COSTS THAT WOULD NATURALLY BE LOWER AS A RESULT OF STAY AT HOME ORDERS SUCH AS TRAVEL AND WE'RE FINDING ADDITIONAL OPERATING EFFICIENCIES WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH OUR REGULATORS AS STEVE MENTIONED BOTH AS WE HAVE BEEN UH TO DEAL WITH THE IMMEDIATE IMPACTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR BUSINESS UH DURING THE QUARTER AND NOW DISCUSSING POTENTIAL REGULATORY TREATMENT OF THE INCREASED COSTS INCLUDING BAD DEBTS AND THE COST OF RESPONDING TO THE HEALTH CRISIS AND HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS RECOVER STEPPING BACK OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON A CURRENT VIEW OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE PROVIDED SENSITIVITIES ON EACH OF THESE KEY EXPOSURES TO GAUGE THE IMPACT UNDER A DIFFERENT SETS OF ASSUMPTIONS LOOKING FORWARD WE REMAIN ON SOLID GROUND AND ARE FOCUSED ON GROWTH AS STEVE MENTIONED WE'VE UPGRADED OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENT TARGET FOR THE YEAR TO $640 MILLION IN ADDITION WE'VE UPDATED OUR FIVE-YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT TARGET NOW THROUGH 2024 TO $2.80 BILLION THAT LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IS DRIVEN BY UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES AND SHOULD DRIVE RATE-BASED GROWTH OF BETWEEN 7% AND 8% FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD IN ADDITION WE REAFFIRM OUR LONG-TERM NET ECONOMICS PER SHARE GROWTH TARGET OF 4% TO 7% AND GIVEN THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE RESOLUTION OF OUR MISSOURI DISRUPTS RECOVERY WE'LL CONTINUE TO REFRAIN FROM BPS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 AT THIS TIME AND FINALLY OUR FINANCING PLANS REMAIN ON TRACK WITH ONLY MODEST EQUITY NEEDS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 202 SO IN SUMMARY WE'RE IN SOLID SHAPE AND REMAIN FOCUSED ON DELIVERING FOR ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS WITH THAT LET ME TURN IT BACK OVER TO YOU SUZANNE THANK YOU STEVE AND STEVE AS WE CLOSE TODAY'S PRESENTATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE STRENGTH OF OUR COLLECTIVE ENERGY BUYERS UTILITIES HAVE BEEN OPERATING FOR MORE

YOU WELL AND TRUST THAT YOU WILL STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY NOW WE'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS WE WILL NOW BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION TO ASK A QUESTION YOU MAY PRESS STAR THEN ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU ARE USING A SPEAKERPHONE PLEASE PICK UP YOUR HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE KEYS TO WITHDRAW YOUR QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN TWO AT THIS TIME WE WILL PAUSE MOMENTARILY TO ASSEMBLE OUR ROSTER THE FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM RICHIE CI- CICIARELLI WITH BOFA SECURITIES PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY GOOD MORNING UH HOPE EVERYONE'S HEALTHY AND SAFE TODAY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING MY QUESTIONS UM JUST HAD A COUPLE HERE ON ISRS UM CAN YOU JUST GO OVER THE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO VERSIONS OF THE THE HOUSE AND SENATE BILL AND AND WHERE YOU ULTIMATELY EXPECT THAT THAT TO LAND UH ONCE IT GETS RECONCILED AND THEN ON THE UM RECENT SETTLEMENT UM WITH THE ISRS FILING WHERE I GUESS WHAT CHANGED THIS TIME AROUND WITH THE OPC WHERE YOU WERE ABLE TO GARNER A SE- A SETTLEMENT THERE HI RICHIE THIS IS STEVE LINDSEY UM AND I APPRECIATE YOU CALLING IN THIS MORNING UH ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION RELATIVE TO THE LEGISLATION IN IN TERMS OF THE CONTENT OF OUR PORTION THERE'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE BILLS WHAT YOU HAVE ARE SOME SOME THINGS THAT THAT GET ATTACHED UH AS AS THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND SO REALLY UH WE'RE FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH THOSE BILLS AND AGAIN IF YOU GO BACK TO WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH UH IT'S TO REALLY REINFORCE WHAT THE INTENT OF THE STATUTE WAS WHEN IT WAS PUT IN PLACE OVER 15 YEARS AGO WHICH IS UH AROUND INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES PARTICULARLY AROUND BARE STEEL AND CAST IRON UH AND AND TO REALLY JUST KIND OF CAUGHT IT BY SOME OF THAT IN TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO AND THAT'S WHY WHEN IT GOES BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR RECONCILIATION UH THERE'LL BE SOME CLEANUP RELATIVE TO THE THINGS THAT ARE ATTACHED THERE UH RELATIVE TO YOUR YOUR SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE STIPULATION I THINK WE'VE JUST BEEN WORKING COLLECTIVELY UH AND AND AGAIN WE WE FELT THIS WAY ALL ALONG THAT THAT THE PIPE THAT WE'VE BEEN REPLACING UH MEETS ALL THE REQUIREMENTS RELATIVE TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES INCLUDED IN THE ISRS PROGRAM UH EVEN TO THE FACT THAT WE STILL AGREE THAT THAT THE PLASTICS THAT WE'VE BEEN REPLACING ARE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO UPGRADE OUR SYSTEM UH BUT THIS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE BARE STEEL AND CAST IRON AND DID THEY MEET THOSE CRITERIA WE'RE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE BUT I THINK UH IN TERMS OF THE REASON THAT WE GOT TO THIS IS BECAUSE WE CONTINUED TO WORK TOGETHER TO TO STRONGLY SUPPORT AGAIN THE INTENT OF OF WHY WE'VE BEEN REPLACING THIS PIPE AROUND SAFETY RELIABILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF OPERATING OUR SYSTEMS SO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S PROGRESS IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY AND AGAIN EVEN WITH THE CASES THAT ARE STILL THERE UH WE'LL CONTINUE TO PRESENT EVIDENCE UH AND HOPEFULLY MAKE OUR CASE AROUND THE PIPE THAT HAD BEEN REPLACED IN PREVIOUS YEARS UH IS THE SAME CRITERIA THAT WE'RE USING GOING FORWARD GOT IT THANK YOU THAT'S THAT'S VERY HELPFUL UM AND THEN JUST AROUND YOUR YOUR CAPEX PROFILE UM I THINK YOU MIGHT'VE BEEN BEEN ONE OF THE FEW COMPANIES THAT RAISED THEIR SPENDING THIS YEAR FOR 202 UM JUST CURIOUS WHAT'S GIVEN YOU THE INCREASED COMPETENCE TO EX- EXECUTE ON ON THE PLAN THIS YEAR UM GIVEN THE THE HEADWINDS WITH WITH COVID-RELATED PRESSURES HEY RICHIE THIS IS STEVE GREAT QUESTION UM A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL I GUESS THE DOWNSIDE UH THE WARMER WEATHER THAT HAS IMPACTED OUR MARGINS IS IT DOES GIVE US UH A LITTLE BIT BETTER UH WORKING CONDITIONS ON OUR CAPITAL SPEND AND AS AS STEVE TALKED ABOUT WE HAD A STRONG UH WINTER SEASON AND NOW WE'RE HEADING INTO THE THE HEART OF OUR CAPITAL SPEND SO I THINK THAT'S POINT NUMBER ONE AND THEN NUMBER TWO YOU KNOW UH PLAYBOOK FOR UTILITIES AS WE LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BEST UM TRY TO OFFSET BOTH UH THE HEADWINDS FROM WEATHER AND ALSO THE HEADWINDS FROM CORONAVIRUS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT UM RAMPING UP OUR CAPITAL SPEND IS ONE OF THOSE ACTIVITIES IT'S CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT HELPS GET US BACK TO WORK UH AND WE'RE DOING IT WITH THE COOPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THE LEADERS THROUGHOUT OUR STATES AND OUR JURISDICTIONS AND I THINK IT'S JUST HELPING US TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE DOING THE RIGHT THING BY UPGRADING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE'RE ALSO DOING IT IN A WAY THAT'S GONNA MAKE US MORE RESILIENT AS WE GO FORWARD SO I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY JUST AN EVOLUTION OF ALL THOSE THINGS AND AGAIN YOU'VE SEEN US RAMP UP AND AND RAMP DOWN IN THE PAST AND WE THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RAMP UP A LITTLE BIT AND AND RICHIE THIS IS UM THE OTHER STEVE LET ME FOLLOW UP FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE I WOULD LIKE TO REINFORCE THAT AS WE AND AGAIN WHILE THIS PAST QUARTER WAS ONLY REALLY SEVERAL WEEKS UH IN TERMS OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD UH WE NEVER STOPPED WORKING UH AND AND YOU'LL HEAR SOME BUSINESSES TALK ABOUT RETURN TO WORK UH WE TALKED ABOUT MORE OF THE TRANSITION AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM A CONSTRUCTION AND CAPITAL PERSPECTIVE UH WE WE REALLY DIDN'T TAKE OUR FOOT OFF THE GAS WE OBVIOUSLY CHANGED SOME OF OUR PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES RELATIVE TO PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND AND TO BE QUITE HONEST WE LIMITED GOING INTO CUSTOMER'S HOMES TO DO UH SERVICE UH TIE OVERS AND CHANGE OVERS WE'LL GO BACK AND DO THAT BUT BUT AGAIN IN TERMS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND WILL CONTINUE TO THAT REALLY DIDN'T SLOW DOWN AND THAT'S A GREAT TRIBUTE TO OUR OUR OUR FRONTLINE AND BOYS THE MANAGEMENT THAT'S OUT THERE THAT THAT REALLY PUT YOU KNOW PULLED TOGETHER IF YOU THINK ABOUT OUR THREE STRATEGIC AREAS OF FOCUS ONE OF THOSE IS INNOVATION AND WE GOT INNOVATIVE IN THE WAY WE'RE CONTINUING TO THINK ABOUT OUR WORK THE OTHER PART I WOULD JUST WANNA REINFORCE IS THAT UH OUR CAPITAL FOR THESE TYPE PROGRAMS IS FAIRLY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS OUR THREE MAJOR OPERATING AREAS IN TERMS OF THE SIDE OF MISSOURI WEST AND ALABAMA UH AND SO WE'RE NOT JUST IMPACTED IN ONE AREA IN TERMS OF <INAUDIBLE> AND UPPER BACK WE'RE FA- FAIRLY EVENLY SPREAD EVEN WITH THE NEW BUSINESS AS WELL SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT UH INCREASE THAT WE SAW A YEAR-TO-DATE OF OF NEARLY 10% THAT ARE REFERENCED THAT'S PRETTY EVENLY SPREAD ACROSS ALL OF OUR OPERATING COMPANIES WHICH I THINK GIVES US UH A GOOD BALANCE AS WELL YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE IT ALL RIGHT THAT'S ALL I HAD THANKS THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MICHAEL WEINSTEIN WITH CREDIT SUISSE PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING HI HI HEY I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GUYS HAVE A BETTER SENSE AT ALL UH HOW WHETHER LEGISLATION WOULD PRECLUDE UH THE NEED FOR A RULING AT THE SUPREME COURT OR NOT YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW AFTER CONFERRING WITH YOUR OWN LAWYERS AND MAYBE OUTSIDE COUNSEL UM MICHAEL THIS IS STEVE THE THE THE SUPREME COURT OPPORTUNITY AT LEAST FOR THAT UM THE RULING THAT CAME OUT OF THE APPELLATE COURT UM HAS ALREADY PASSED THEY THEY UM OPTED NOT TO TAKE THE UM- OH I GET IT THE APPEAL THAT WE END THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION WENT FORWARD SO REALLY THE THE LEGISLATION UM THAT STEVE LINDSEY TALKS ABOUT IS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR A LONGER TERM FIX WE OBVIOUSLY ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH UH MISSOURI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION THE STAFF THE OPC AND THE OTHER INTERVENERS TO UM NOT ONLY CRISPIN <INAUDIBLE> UP THE UM THE SUPPORT FOR OUR FILINGS UH BUT THEN ALSO TO GET TO A MORE UNIFIED VIEW GOING FORWARD OF WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND I I WOULD JUST SAY TOO THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHEN WE STARTED THIS JOURNEY WE PURSUED A REGULATORY LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL OUTCOME AND SO ALL THREE OF THOSE PATHS SO UH WE'RE ON TRACK WITH WHAT WE STRATEGICALLY SET OUT TO BEGIN WITH UH WHAT'S THE JULY 16TH DECISION THAT WE'RE WAITING ON WHAT IS THAT OKAY SO UH SO THIS WOULD BE A D- THIS IS ON THE CASES THAT WERE REMANDED BACK TO THE COMMISSION SO ONCE THEY GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION UH THEY IN ESSENCE HAVE 120 DAYS TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THOSE CASES THAT THAT DID NOT GO THROUGH TO THE SUPREME COURT SO SO YOU'VE GOT SEVERAL MOVING PARTS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE AND REGULATORY BUT BUT THAT IS ON THE CASES THAT WERE UNDER APPEAL THAT HAVE BEEN REMANDED BACK TO THE COMMISSION OH THOSE DEC- THE DECISION YOU'RE REFERENCING THERE IS THE DECISION BY THE REGULATORS RIGHT ON THE <INAUDIBLE> RIGHT <CROSSTALK> YEAH UH THIS IS IT'S BEEN REMANDED BACK TO THE MISSOURI COMMISSION YES GOT IT I GOT IT OKAY AND ON THE GUIDANCE THE LONG-TERM GUIDANCE THE BASE YEAR IS STILL 2019 <LAUGH> OR IS THERE A BASE YEAR <LAUGH> <LAUGH> YEAH YOU KNOW I I I CHUCKLE MICHAEL IT'S A FAIR QUESTION I I THINK THE ANSWER IS IF YOU LOOK AT OUR CAPITAL SPEND PROGRAM OVER FIVE YEARS AND DRIVING RATE-BASED GROWTH OF 7% TO 8% WE EXPECT THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRIVE THE KIND OF GROWTH THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THE LONGTERM OVER THE BOTTOM LINE I CHUCKLE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL DEALING WITH AND WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND I KNOW OUR PEERS ARE BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN ON THOSE CALLS A LOT OF TIME DEALING WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION YEAH AND THE FULLNESS OF TIME AS WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR 2020 WE'LL FIND A WAY TO REBASE AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AND OUR CUSTOMERS GET THROUGH THIS YEAR AND WE DO IT IN A FASHION THAT WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT SO THAT WHEN WE HIT 2021 AND BEYOND WE'RE HITTING IT AT FULL STEAM WITH OUR CUSTOMERS COMING ALONG FOR THE RIDE YEAH THAT WOULD BE MY UNDERSTANDING I MEAN I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LOOK THROUGH 2020 AS A ABNORMAL YEAR SO THAT'S JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT <CROSSTALK> IT'S DEFINITELY TO BE AN ABNORMAL YEAR <LAUGH> YEAH <LAUGH> YEAH I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK THROUGH THIS YEAR UM ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH GUYS AND STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY THANKS <CROSSTALK> AGAIN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN ONE THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM BRIAN <UNK> WITH <INAUDIBLE> PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING BRIAN GOOD MORNING BRIAN HEY JUST CURIOUS ON THE UM WEATHER NORMALIZATION UH MECHANISM IN MISSOURI UH THAT WAS UM YOU KNOW INEFFECTIVE WHAT YOU KNOW STRUCTURALLY WHAT MADE IT INEFFECTIVE AND WHAT WOULD YOU NEED TO DO IT IN IN IN SO FAR AS UH YOU KNOW FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH UH REGULATORS AND/OR UH UH YOU DURING YOUR NEXT RATE CASE UH TO FIX IT OR CAN IT BE PERFECT ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD MORNING THIS IS STEVE LINDSEY THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AND UH I WISH I KNEW ALL THE ANSWERS TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A VERY COMPLEX FORMULA UH I THINK THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS IS WE HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE NOW THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE WHICH IS POSITIVE UH IT DID HELP BUT IT DIDN'T COMPLETELY ADDRESS THE THE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UH WEATHER OBVIOUSLY AND AND AND THE VOLUMES AND THE REVENUE SO BUT I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE PIECES TO IT ONE IS AND I THINK THAT STEVE MENTIONED THIS UH FIRST OF ALL IT DOES NOT EVEN INCLUDE UH THE SMALL COMMERCIAL CLASS AND SOME OF THOSE OTHERS THAT ARE REALLY WEATHER SENSITIVE AND LOOK AND BEHAVE A LOT LIKE THE RESIDENTIAL CLASS SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OPPORTUNITY THAT IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER WEATHER NORMALIZATION MECHANISMS IN THE COUNTRY THEY DO INCLUDE THAT SO SO THAT'S CLEARLY AN OPPORTUNITY THE OTHER IS THAT IT'S IT'S NOT LINEAR AND AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS EVERY DAY ISN'T THE SAME EVERY WEEK ISN'T THE SAME AS YOU GO THROUGH THE MONTH SO YOU COULD HAVE SOME OUTCOMES THAT SHOW RESULTS <INAUDIBLE> DAYS THAT DIDN'T REALLY TRANSLATE TO THE WAY GAS LOAD FROM A CUSTOMER'S PERSPECTIVE SO I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITY AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AND AGAIN IT'S A IT'S A START UH IT'S NOT PERFECT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE THINK WE'LL BE ABLE UH TO MAKE A PRETTY STRONG PRESENTATION AS TO WHERE THE DEFICIENCIES ARE BECAUSE AGAIN THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE RISK UH AS AS STEVE INDICATED UH IF IT'S TOO COLD WE SHOULDN'T BENEFIT IF IT'S TOO WARM WE SHOULDN'T BE HARMED AND IT'S REALLY TO TRY TO TIGHTEN THAT BAND AND AND WHAT WE WOULD LOOK TO DO GOING FORWARD IS TO TIGHTEN THE BAND EVEN CLOSER THAN THAN WHAT IT IS NOW GOT IT AND AND RE- REMIND ME WHAT PERCENT OF THE OVERALL BILL IS A FIXED CHARGE YEAH YOU KNOW AND THAT THAT ROUGHLY DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW THE THE TYPE OF YEAR THAT YOU'RE HAVING BUT IT COULD BE 25% UH 20% TO 25% I THINK UH BASED ON A RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER AND AGAIN THAT THAT HAS VARIABILITY OBVIOUSLY BASED ON THE TYPE OF WINTER THAT YOU HAVE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE VOLUMETRIC FEES COMES DOWN OKAY GREAT AND UM JUST ON UM THE SUPREME COURT DENIAL OF YOUR REQUEST FOR REHEARING REMIND REMIND ME HOW HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REVENUES IS THAT AND WHEN MIGHT THAT IMPACT UH NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS IS IT AFTER A COMMITTED DECISION SO UH THE LITTLE PART OF JULY OR YOU KNOW FROM A A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE DO YOU YOU NOW HAVE I DON'T KNOW MORE CLARITY AS TO UM YOU KNOW THE THE THE RECOVERY OR OF THOSE COSTS UH YOU KNOW UH I'M CURIOUS TO WHEN A PROVISION MIGHT BE TAKEN AGAINST NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS UM YEAH BRIAN THIS IS STEVE RASCHE THERE'S A THERE'S A DETAILED CHART IN THE APPENDIX TO OUR PRESENTATION THAT YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHICH REALLY OUTLINES THE VARIOUS LAYERS OF UH ISRS UH THE TOTAL PROVISION THAT IS THE TOTAL OF ALL THE COLLECTIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE RULINGS THAT WERE UM THAT ARE PART OF THE APPELLATE COURT DECISION AND THEN THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION NOT TO TAKE IT ON ARE $16.90 MILLION AND THAT UH WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT ON THOSE AND WE'RE COLLECTING UH TWO MILLION AND CHANGE EVERY QUARTER UM SO UP UNTIL THE TIME THAT THE MISSOURI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION MAKES A FINAL DETERMINATION WE WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT THOSE UM COLLECT THOSE FUNDS I WOULD POINT OUT THERE ARE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THAT OF THAT 16.9 MILLION PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH UH UH THE UM CONCLUSION WHETHER UM <INAUDIBLE> BARE STEEL WAS WORN OUT AND DETERIORATED AND ANOTHER COMPONENT ABOUT UM INCIDENTAL PLASTICS THAT ARE REPLACED UH ALONG WITH LONGER LINES OF THE UH THE CAST IRON OF BARE STEEL AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION IS GOING TO HAVE TO WEIGH IN BASED UPON THE REMAND FROM THE APPELLATE COURT ON EACH ONE OF THOSE AND WHEN THEY REACHED THEIR DECISION AND THAT'S THAT JULY 15TH UM DATE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEN THE COMMISSION WILL NOT ONLY DECIDE ON THE ON HOW TO HANDLE EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL ISRS DETERMINATIONS BUT IT WILL ALSO HAVE UH DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT UM DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT THE THE AMOUNTS WILL BE REFUNDED TO THE EXTENT THEY DETERMINED THERE'S A REFUND OR IF THE THE AMOUNTS WILL BE USED IN SOME OTHER FASHION AND THE COMMISSION HAS FULL RIGHTS TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE HOW THEY WANT TO HANDLE THAT SO AGAIN THAT'S AT THAT POINT ONCE WE HAVE A DETERMINATION FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION THEN I THINK WE'RE WE'RE UH OBVIOUSLY OBLIGATED TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS CALCULATION AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE REVENUES ARE NOW NOT GOING TO BE EARNED UH REVENUES OR EARNINGS AND THEN WE WOULD ADJUST OUR ECONOMICS MEASURE AT THAT POINT AND JUST TO KEEP IT IN PERSPECTIVE OF THE 69 A LITTLE OVER $4 MILLION OF THAT UM IMPACTS OUR CURRENT YEAR VAST MAJORITY OF IT WAS THE INITIAL PROVISION THAT WE BOOKED UM AT FOR THE LAST FISCAL YEAR OKAY GOT IT UNDERSTOOD AND THEN UH JUST ON THE THE EQUITY UH IF IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY YOU ISSUED 10 MILLION OF EQUITY IN THE FISCAL SECOND QUARTER AND THAT SATISFIED YOUR NEEDS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR UM NO I MEAN IF YOU GO TO OUR OUR GUIDANCE PAGE YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE UM WE HAVE A GUIDED RANGE OF UM OF EQUITY OF $50 TO $100 MILLION UH IS OUR TOTAL NEED FOR THE YEAR SO IN THE FIRST QUARTER WE KNOCKED OUT ROUGHLY UH 10 MILLION OF THAT AT THE LOW END UM AND AND THE BEAUTY OF WHERE WE STAND IS WE WE DO HAVE AN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR RATING AGENCIES WE WE DO HAVE SOME UH LEVERAGE AND SOME UM CUSHION IN OUR OUR CREDIT METRICS WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS LOOKING AT SO UM WE DO BELIEVE THAT UH WE WILL BE IN THE EQUITY MARKETS LATER THIS YEAR AS LONG AS THE MARKETS CONTINUE TO REBOUND IN AN ORDERLY FASHION BUT IT'S NOT ANYTHING WE HAVE TO DO BUT I THINK OUR PREFERENCE IS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN STRONG CREDIT METRICS AND A BALANCED CAPITAL STRUCTURE THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO GET IN THE RANGE OF THE EQUITY THAT WE'VE GUIDED UM IN OUR LONGTERM GUIDANCE OKAY AND THEN THE THE FEBRUARY UH STIPULATION UH ON 11.1 MILLION REVENUES UH UNDER ISRS IS THAT WHAT YOU FILED FOR BOY UH WE FILED FOR UM THE THE REASON WHY I'M STRUGGLING UH BRIAN IS THAT WE FILED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT NUMBERS BECAUSE WE FILED FOR UH AMOUNTS THAT HAD NOT BEEN AWARDED FOR PLASTICS AND PRIOR FILINGS UM I I THINK THE BEST NUMBER TO THINK ABOUT UM IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS OUR NET EXPECTATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WERE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE FILING IT WAS PROBABLY IN UH I DON'T HAVE IT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IT WAS IN THE HIGH 11 SORT OF CLOSE TO $12 MILLION RANGE AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE EXPECT AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY GET BECAUSE OUR ISRS FILINGS GENERALLY INCLUDE 45 TO 60 DAYS WORTH OF FORECAST AT CAPITAL SPEND AND SO THAT ALWAYS GETS TRUED UP IN A RATE CASE AND AND THAT IS CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS UH IN THIS FILING FOR ISRS I'M SORRY OKAY AND WHEN DOES THE MISSOURI LEGISLATURE END THIS YEAR WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF WRITING THE PLAYBOOK AS WE GO RIGHT NOW UH THERE'S PROBABLY AT LEAST UH ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS OF SESSION UH I KNOW THAT AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS NOT A SPECIAL SESSION THIS WAS JUST TO START UP AGAIN AND WE WERE UH WE WERE VERY PLEASED TO BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE LEGISLATION AS BEING CONSIDERED BUT UH WE WE CAME OUT OR OR AS WE TALKED ABOUT WE'RE OUT OF BOTH CHAMBERS AND NOW WE'RE IN RECONCILIATION SO SO WE KNEW THAT OURS IS MOVING FORWARD AT A PACE THAT THE AT LEAST WE'RE WE'RE PLEASED SO FAR OKAY GOT IT THANK YOU SO MUCH RIGHT THANKS THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM <INAUDIBLE> PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD MORNING UM LOTS HAVE BEEN ASKED AND ANSWERED SO JUST A FEW FOLLOW UPS AND CLARIFICATION IF I COULD UM JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT LAST QUESTION SO WE'LL GET A LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BY THE END OF THE MONTH IF THAT'S SUCCESSFUL THEN CAN YOU DOES THAT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON SORT OF THE JULY OUTCOME IN YOUR OPINION WELL I W- I WOULD SAY THAT IT DOESN'T DIRECTLY BECAUSE IT IS UH UH LOOKING FORWARD BUT I THINK IT WHAT IT DOES IS IS GIVE SOME UH HOPEFULLY GUIDANCE TO THE COMMISSION THAT THAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN AGAIN OPERATING UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THOUGH FOR OVER 15 YEARS HAS BEEN VALIDATED UH AND HAS BEEN CLEANED UP IF YOU WILL AND THIS LEGISLATION AGAIN WE THINK UH THAT EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN DOING FROM THIS POINT FORWARD FROM WHEN THE PROGRAM WENT INTO PLACE UH HAS BEEN HAS MET THOSE REQUIREMENTS I THINK THIS REINFORCES THAT SO HOPEFULLY FROM THE COMMISSIONS PERSPECTIVE THEY CAN USE THAT AS AS AS PART OF THEIR DECISION-MAKING IN THAT THE THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE BEEN UPGRADING DOES MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS OKAY AND UM I'M I'M SURE EVERYONE ON THE PHONE IS AWARE OF IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR A HOUSE TO PRODUCE A BILL AND THEN THE SENATE SENT OVER TO THE OTHER CHAMBER THIS IN THIS CASE THE SENATE THEY PRETTY MUCH WRITE IT THE SAME WAY BUT NOT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY SO THEN THE COMMITTEES ARE CREATED AND AS STEVE SAID IT GOES TO CONFERENCE SO THAT THEY CAN SETTLE THOSE THOSE DIFFERENCES SO THAT'S THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL AT ALL IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS RIGHT UM LET ME JUST ASK THIS YOUR BILL'S NOT ATTACHED OR IT DOESN'T INCLUDE OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD BE CONTROVERSIAL PER SE SO IF IT COULD GET TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK I THINK HE'S IN- I WOULDN'T CALL IT I WOULDN'T CALL IT CONTROVERSIAL BUT LIKE A LOT OF BILLS YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE WRITTEN IN ONE CHAMBER FOR A SPECIFIC NEED AND THEN IT GOES TO THE OTHER CHAMBER AND THE OTHER CHAMBER ADDS OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS INSTANCE SO THAT'S WHEN THE TWO COMMITTEES COME TOGETHER IN CONFERENCE AND SORT OF CLEAN THE BILL UP TO UM AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON OKAY UM I THINK YOU REFERENCED UH ADDITIONAL UH INVESTMENT IN STORE OR IN STORAGE FOR 10 MILLION HOW MUCH MORE IS TO GO THERE <INAUDIBLE> THIS IS STEVE WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT WHAT OUR LONGTERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN IS OBVIOUSLY GIVEN SOME OTHER THINGS WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON YOU KNOW WE'RE CLEARLY UM VERY PLEASED WITH THE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF THE STORAGE FIELD THIS WINTER AND YOU SAW THAT IN THE IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS AND WE BUT WE HAVEN'T YET COME UP WITH THE LONGER RANGE PLAN BUT WHAT OUR COMMITMENT TO UH TO OUR INVESTORS AND TO YOU ALL IS THAT WE'LL CONTINUE TO BRING YOU ALONG FOR THE JOURNEY AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT THAT WE ARE GONNA SPEND BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT CALL UM THAT'S THE $10 MILLION THAT WE UM INCREASED IN OUR UM IN OUR CAPITAL SPEND TARGET FOR THIS YEAR OKAY AND THEN UM JUST KIND OF GOING BACK TO THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE WEATHER MITIGATION AND I KNOW UM YOU GUYS ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT DOES THAT WILL THAT HAVE TO WAIT REALLY UNTIL YOU GO THROUGH YOUR NEXT RATE CASE IN ORDER TO BE IMPROVED OR COULD IT BE IMPROVED BEFORE THEN THAT WOULD BE UH YES SO SO YOUR UM YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS BASICALLY HOW TO ANSWER IT IT IS A PART OF THE OVERALL RATE UH RATE STRUCTURE AND SO THAT WILL BE PART OF OUR NEXT RATE FILING YES WHICH I WOULD SAY AGAIN THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL THE KEY REQUIREMENTS OF UH A RATE CASE IS TO SET REVENUE REQUIREMENT AND RATE DESIGN AND IT'S RARE VERY RARE FOR COMMISSIONS TO TAKE UP EITHER RATE DESIGN OR REVENUE REQUIREMENT OUTSIDE OF A RATE CASE IT DOES OCCUR UM BUT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S VERY RARE AND I WOULD JUST ADD ON I GET A LITTLE BIT OF THE FLOOR HERE IT'S IT'S NOT UNUSUAL EITHER FOR THESE MITIGATION MECHANISMS TO BE IN PLACE AS A STARTING POINT BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPLEX AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS THAT EVEN WHEN THEY'RE IN THOSE CLASSES PEOPLE USE ENERGY IN DIFFERENT WAYS EITHER ALL HEATING OR SOME ARE MORE YEAR ROUND AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO THEY'RE THEY ARE A BIT COMPLEX SO I LIKE STEVE AND STEVE MENTIONED I WAS GLAD TO SEE THE

I'd like to begin by acknowledging that we're all adjusting to a new normal. as we focus on staying safe and healthy during the coronavirus, we're living in a world of video calls, facetime, webcams, working from home, wearing face masks, and washing our hands a lot. and we're connecting in new ways. like you, many of us aren't in our offices and aren't able to see one another face to face. in fact, today is the second time in nearly two years that i'm speaking to you remotely. That steve rashie steve lindsey and i have been in the same location rest assured that we're distancing and disinfecting and getting the job done it's not easy to stay connected in times like this it's fire connecting with us should feel like a handshake at the front door but without the ability to actually shake someone's hand we found ourselves leaning into other expressions of caring and friendship like how we listen how we check in Our elderly neighbors how we smile and wave a load of strangers it's how our crews stop work take off their hats and put their hands over their hearts when a funeral procession drives by these moments of connection and caring inspire the good in all of us and provide the energy it takes to walk through a time like this a time when some communities are impacted more than others but none go untouched a time when we understand How essential our service is and how people count on us to deliver a time when safety has an expanded meaning and personal protective equipment becomes an everyday necessity but it's fire it's easier for us to pivot we have a very clear mission that guides us answer every challenge advance every community and enrich every life through the strength of our energy you see we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we believe we We are called to answer this and every challenge that arises we know that people rely on our energy every day and that we are an essential service we know that we cannot let our customers and communities down and we know that safety is a core value a value at the heart of every decision it's because of this deeply held belief that we set in motion a broad range of protective steps to address the coronavirus health crisis and its economic impacts And our customers while passionately protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities we began an early march by activating our incident support team or the a s t a cross-functional team of twenty five leaders from operations and all our shared services the a s t has been needing nearly every morning to discuss challenges solve issues and coordinate actions from hr policies to supply chain access to p p e and impact to employees customers and operations by the middle of march we activated the highest level of our crisis response plan by convening our crisis management team or ctm i asked steve lindsey to lead this team as fire eagle's chief operating officer steve immediately gathered all of our chief officers and business unit presidents to quickly make executive decisions around broad ranging challenges steve will talk more about this in a moment From my perspective, i'd like to say that it's been inspiring to watch the a s t and c m t work together. we bring a collection of expertise to our conversations from the very professional perspective of fire's leadership to our external involvement with the american gas association and our first-hand conversations with medical experts via the many hospital boards we serve on. together, we are careful to balance the needs of our many stakeholders, including you. we are a community that communicating early and often with all employees and customers we are connecting regularly with our board and keeping our governors, legislators, and regulators informed every step of the way most importantly, the cmt is keenly aware of the impact our decisions have on people and everything we do our goal is to flatten the curve and help control the spread of coronavirus while safely and reliably providing energy for our customers and communities Goodness, our largest operations are in missouri and alabama areas of the country that have been minimally impacted by the pandemic. in fact, only eleven of our thirty five hundred employees have tested positive for the coronavirus and all but one person is back to work. so as we work to meet the challenges created by the coronavirus, we remain focused on our strategy to deliver growth and value by growing organically, investing in infrastructure. Advancing through innovation we continue to take steps to ensure that we remain strong both financially and from an operations perspective we'll hear more on that from steve and steve when they discuss our capital spending including investments in new business and infrastructure upgrades as well as our updated capex forecast that supports our long-term growth outlook as reported in our earnings announcement this morning our second quarter net economic earnings per share was below last year and our f y twenty plan as steve rashi will discuss in more detail the results were driven by lower margins due to warmer weather across our footprint margins that were not fully mitigated by regulatory mechanism however our results were minimally impacted by the coronavirus and finally we'll spend some time updating you on our process as we continue to pursue favorable regulatory outcomes across our jurisdictions and to focus on the issuer case and firings in missouri. with that, i'll turn the call over to steve lindsey to discuss our results and coronavirus response in more detail. thank you, suzanne. i want to begin by acknowledging the outstanding efforts of our employees during the difficult times brought on by the coronavirus and the resulting economic shutdown. you're providing great service to our customers while taking extra care to ensure their health, safety, and wellbeing as well as your own and helping to support our communities in this time of need. and we all thank you very much. suzanne mentioned, we quickly activated the cemt with ten primary areas of focus. this morning, i'd like to take a moment to outline the steps we've taken to address the coronavirus and live it's impact on three of those areas: our employees, customers, and communities. keeping these stakeholders healthy, safe, and supported is more than a priority for us. it's a core value, who we are, and what we aspire to. for our employees, we have educated everyone on healthy practices and encouraged people to follow the advice of the experts, including the cdc. and other public health organizations our guidelines include staying home when not feeling well, frequent handwashing, social distancing, and other best practices we implemented policies to help employees handle the impacts of the coronavirus, including taking care of family members or dealing with children being home from school an example of this is the implementation of our emergency leave program for our field workers and technicians we have taken extra safety precautions to protect them and our customers we pre screen a customer's premises To ensure that no one is sick or symptomatic before we allow our workers to enter a home or business and we equip our employees with personal protective equipment. for our office based employees we implemented a work from home policy starting in march and extending through may along with work from home and social distancing we've also implemented related policies to eliminate all nonessential travel as well as group meetings and gatherings and across our company we stepped up the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing our work locations currently We're developing work transition plans that include reopening offices and facilities for our customers. we are first and foremost focused on making sure they are well-served and that they continue to be well-served. and that we continue to provide safe and reliable energy that they've come to rely on regardless of the situation at hand. help reduce customer contact and limit the potential for spreading the illness. postpone work that wasn't time-critical or urgent and to help our customers through what is surely a difficult time financially. We work with our regulators to suspend involuntary disconnections and late fees through the end of may while also expanding customer bill assistance programs. as a company, we have pledged five hundred thousand dollars matching gift to augment the contributions made by customers and employees into our dollar help program. thousands of customers have already signed up to give, and their matched gifts total more than three hundred thousand dollars so far. similarly, we have donated two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to local area food pantries and meal programs. Programs from alabama to wyoming, we're helping provide about six hundred fifty thousand meals for families struggling to make ends meet during this time. we also led an effort with other companies to donate and set up laptops for children in limited-income schools so they're able to learn from home. since we're all in this together, we've been coordinating and staying in close communications with various state and local government bodies, health care organizations, and industry groups to ensure that we're doing most good by leveraging our collective energy and resources. while we've been hard at work to address the impacts of the coronavirus and serve our customers well, we've also remained focused on our business objectives centered on growing our company. we continue to invest in organic growth and infrastructure upgrades across our utilities for the first half of fiscal twenty twenty we invested thirty five million dollars in new business, keeping pace with last year's record levels of investment and new premises activations as you can see, our investment in our utilities is expanding here to date. We've invested two hundred and seventy nine million dollars focused on new business and pipeline replacement that's up twenty four million dollars or nearly ten percent over the first half of last year on the gas related business side our spending is actually down year over year largely reflecting the completion of the spire stl pipeline for the full year of fiscal twenty twenty we've increased our planned capital spend to six hundred and forty million dollars up thirty million dollars from our prior forecasted investment about eighty eight percent Our two thousand and twenty spend will be on our gas utilities with two thirds of the increase or about twenty million dollars attributable to utility investments. we also plan to invest ten million dollars in the third quarter at spire storage. regulatory mechanisms we have, including incentives to accelerate system upgrades in missouri and alabama and real time brake making in alabama are key to timely recovery and support infrastructure modernization, earnings growth and better environmental performance. Performances through reduced methane emissions. as you know from our discussion last quarter in missouri, we have been working through a number of isrc cases decided by the missouri public service commission going back to twenty sixteen that have been challenged and appealed by the office of public counsel and resulted in adverse appellate court rulings late last year. at the time of the appeal court orders, we said we would pursue all avenues, legislative, judicial, and regulatory to preserve the ability to continue investing in the safety, reliability, and environmental performance of our operations. and environmental performance of our pipeline system while achieving timely recovery. the start of the missouri legislative session in january we worked to introduce bills in both the house and senate to clarify the isrc statute as relates to the eligibility of infrastructure upgrade spend for accelerated recovery. the senate bill passed early march on may sixth the house passed the substitution of the senate bill given the differences between the versions passed in each chamber the legislation will now go to conference committee Reconcile the two virgins meanwhile, we have continued to file new israel requests including one in early february late last month, we, the staff of the missouri public service commission and the office of public counsel reached an unanimous stipulation and agreement subject to the missouri psc approval that would result in an eleven million dollar annualized increase in israel's revenue regarding the cases subject to the appeals court ruling these have been remanded back to the missouri public service commission for final resolution following the denial of our request for the missouri supreme court review in mid march the commission has a hundred and twenty days or until the middle of july to render a decision including whether any refund is required for anyone who would like more detail on the various isrs cases there's a table in the appendix of our slide presentation today finally in alabama we have been implementing new off-system sales and capacity release program that went into effect december first we're also continuing to pursue the benefits of the accelerated and advanced payment program. infrastructure modernization rider or aim and are on track to achieve the threshold number of miles replaced this year in order to qualify for the roe eater in twenty twenty one like we received this past year with that, i'll turn the call over to steve rashy for a financial review and update good morning and let me add my wishes for good health and safety to everyone and a huge shout out to all of our first responders, health care workers, and our own team who continue to serve bravely every day. quarterly results, the financial impact of coronavirus and an update to our targets for the second half of our fiscal twenty twenty. turning to our results for the quarter, we delivered consolidated net economic earnings of one hundred and forty four million dollars, down three point nine million dollars from last year. our gas utility posted earnings of just over one hundred and forty million dollars, down two point four million dollars from last year, as a result of warmer weather and losses on investments. Marketing delivered earnings at just over five million dollars, down just over one million dollars from last year, as higher volumes from our expansion were offset by less favorable market conditions and higher costs. And we saw higher earnings from the spire stl pipeline, which entered service last quarter, a lower loss from spire storage, reflecting the benefits of our operational improvements, and slightly higher corporate costs. Looking at our per share results, current year earnings are... Two dollars and seventy five cents per share are down fifteen cents from last year reflecting lower earnings as well as the impact of preferred and common stock issued over the last twelve months i'd offer two additional comments first as susan mentioned we saw limited financial impact from the coronavirus this quarter since it really didn't hit our service territories until mid march more on the forward impact in a few minutes and secondly as reflected here Net economic earnings continues to include all istroum revenues or, saying it another way, excluding the provision we book for gift purposes for this quarter istroum revenues subject to a provision were two point two million dollars including interest bringing the cumulative provision at march thirty one to sixteen point nine million dollars overall whether this quarter was warmer than normal by eleven percent in missouri and by twenty six percent in alabama compared to last year's colder weather. weather we saw margins in missouri decline by three million dollars as slightly lower residential volumetric margins were offset by higher net distress revenues combined with a significant drop in commercial margins our southern utilities showed margin growth as lower demand was offset by annual rate increases margins were also significantly below our expectations of normal weather and mitigation mechanisms that offset that exposure again in our southern service territory the mechanisms largely worked as planned in missouri, however, we saw a seven million dollar negative impact on margins against normal weather consisting of two components first w n a r this new weather normalization tool was introduced in our last rate proceeding and should ensure that we get the right recovery of the residential volumetric charge not overcollecting in cold periods not undercollecting in warmer ones while the mechanism did address A portion of our weather deficiencies this quarter we estimate that it was ineffective by six percent or roughly five million dollars. secondly, we saw a shortfall in commercial and industrial margins that do not have weather mitigation in missouri even for smaller, more weather sensitive customers. total impact here was about two million dollars. we clearly have some work to do both working with our regulators to improve the effectiveness of our weather mitigation and our next missouri rate. Proceeding and two generating earnings from other sources in the back half of twenty twenty to offset some of this headwind there were two other key variants this quarter o and m expenses and other expenses as outlined here on slide thirteen total o and m expenses as reported were down twelve point six million dollars and although we have a history of cost control this reduction reflects the benefit of a regulatory derogation of a pension remeasurement charge with the offsetting expense Recorded in other expenses as shown here excluding this adjustment our run rate utility o and m was up two point nine million dollars or two point six percent due to higher operations and employee costs the remaining o and m expenses represent higher marketing costs due to our business growth and the cost of the spar stl pipeline which is now in operations the other key variables in other expenses with a run rate increase after the adjustment for the pension remediation of 2009 are the other expenses with a run rate increase after the adjustment for the pension remediation of 2009 are the other expenses with a run rate increase after the adjustment for the pension remediation of 2009 are the other expenses with a run rate increase after the adjustment for the pension remediation of 2009 are the other Eight point five million dollars reflecting two items first prior year s p r s t l pipeline a u f d c which no longer exists as now in our operating numbers and secondly a three point six million dollars swing in returns on investments held to support our non-qualified benefit plans not surprisingly this year we saw unrealized losses this quarter compared to a much stronger earning stream in the first quarter of twenty nineteen i am I would note that the explanation of all cost variations, contribution margins, as well as our review of our year-to-date results are included in the appendix to this presentation for your reference. you know, since the health crisis began, we've been focused on our liquidity position, parking back to our playbook from the great recession. we moved aggressively with the assistance of our bank group to draw on our credit facility in mid-march as the commercial paper market became un-economic. in late march, we secured a hundred million dollars. Fifty million dollar term loan to provide additional liquidity and we stand in a strong financial position with total available liquidity at march thirty one of six hundred and sixty one million dollars and a solid long term capitalization as well in fact we issued equity early in the quarter with proceeds of just under ten million dollars as we turn to the corona virus impacts on our operating results a bit of perspective roughly seventy percent of our earnings and margins are residential And the current health crisis hit near the end of the winter heating season where we earn a majority of our return. as a result, we've been relatively insulated so far from the economic downturn. we are watching closely our commercial and industrial customers, especially the smaller firms who are bearing the brunt of the current shutdown. and we are tracking the incremental costs of the actions that stephen and suzanne touched on a few minutes ago. now, none of us have a crystal ball to predict how this situation will play out. Situation will play out based on what we know today including data and regional economic projections we've constructed a forecast of key impacts based upon the following assumptions from an economic standpoint continuation of the downturn through this quarter and then a slow ramp up in activity that will stretch at least through the rest of calendar twenty twenty from an operational standpoint normal weather or return of normal collection activities disconnected And late payment fees as well as minimal disruption for our construction crews based on these assumptions, we have estimated the following financial impacts. as a result of our moratorium on fees, we anticipate losing fee revenue of roughly one point nine million dollars. we have seen some decline in our commercial and industrial margins, reflecting both the temporary shutdowns of large manufacturers and the impact of the moratorium on fees. AND THE ANTICIPATED LOWER DEMAND FROM OUR SMARTER COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS WE ESTIMATE THAT IMPACT TO BE APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN AN APPRECIABLE CHANGE IN OUR RESIDENTIAL MARGINS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT CLOSELY HOWEVER WE ARE ANTICIPATING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BAD DEBTS IN THE COMING QUARTERS TO ESTIMATE OUR EXPOSURE WE WENT BACK TO OUR RECORDS FOR THE LAST RECESSION IN TWO TH revenue increases about twenty basis points over normal levels, applying that experience to our current book of business results in an estimated exposure of three and a half million dollars. and of course, we're tracking other direct costs, including the costs of pp&e, enhanced facility cleaning, and employee costs for lost time, among others. we are pursuing opportunities to offset these headwinds, including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result of these headwinds, including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result of these headwinds, including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result of these headwinds, including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result of these headwinds, including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result of these headwinds, including identifying those costs that would naturally Stay at home orders such as travel and we're finding additional operating efficiencies we're also working with our regulators as steve mentioned both as we have been to deal with the immediate impacts to our customers and our business during the quarter and now discussing potential regulatory treatment of the increased costs including bad debts and the cost of responding to the health crisis and helping our customers recover stepping back Our estimates are based upon a current view of the economic recovery, and as you can see, we have provided sensitivities on each of these key exposures to gauge the impact under a different set of assumptions. looking forward, we remain on solid ground and are focused on growth. as steve mentioned, we've upgraded our capital investment target for the year to six hundred forty million dollars. in addition, we've updated our five-year capital investment target now through twenty twenty. Forty four to two point eight billion dollars. that level of investment is driven by utility infrastructure upgrades and should drive rate based growth of between seven and eight percent for the forecast period. in addition we reaffirm our long term net economics per share growth target of four percent to seven percent and given the current uncertainty surrounding the resolution of our missouri isaurus recovery will continue to refrain from pfs guidance for fiscal year twenty twenty at this time. and finally our financing plans remain on track with only modest equity needs for the remainder of twenty twenty so in summary we're in solid shape and remain focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders with that let me turn back over to you susan thank you steve and steve as we close today's presentation i think it's important to take a moment to acknowledge the strength of our collective energy bp's utilities have been operating for more than a hundred years In sixty years thanks to great leadership, great partnership and a legacy of hardworking, caring employees we have survived wars, the great depression, weather disasters and the nineteen eighteen influenza pandemic. the law of successful history and with the support of our investors, our communities and our public policy leaders we will work our way through the impact of the coronavirus. we'll do it together and we'll do it in a way that brings sustain long-term VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS, CUSTOMERS, AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE BEFORE WE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO THANK FIRE'S EMPLOYEES MANY WHOM ARE LISTENING TO THIS WEBCAST I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORK AND I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT ONE ANOTHER OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE LIVE AND WORK IN YOU MAKE ME PROUD EVERY DAY AND I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THE WAY YOU RALLY TO ANSWER CHALLENGES YOU ARE LEADERS Helpers, you are heroes. you understand that fundamentally energy exists to help people and you give your all to deliver energy safely, reliably and with all your heart. to the investors and analysts on the call today, we like to thank you for your investment and the trust you place in us. on behalf of our board of directors, our executive team and our employees, we take that trust very seriously, especially during these uncertain times. We look forward to seeing you again soon either as part of the upcoming virtual aga financial forums or other virtual conferences and road shows in the months ahead of course we look forward to the time when we can once again meet face to face until then we wish you well and trust that you will stay safe and healthy now we will take your questions TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU ARE USING A SPEAKER PHONE PLEASE PICK UP YOUR HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE KEYS TO WITHDRAW YOUR QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN TWO AT THIS TIME WE WILL PAUSE MOMENTARILY TO ASSEMBLE OUR ROSTER THE FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM RICHARD CICERELLI WITH B I A SECURITIES PLEASE GO AHEAD hey, good morning. hope everyone's healthy and safe today. appreciate you taking my question. just had a couple here on isis. can you just go over the difference between the two virgins of the house and senate bill and where you ultimately expect that to land once it gets reconciled and then on the recent settlement with the isis filing where i guess what change this time around with obc where you were able to BERNERS SETTLEMENT THERE HEY RICHIE THIS IS STEVE LINDSAY AND I APPRECIATE YOU CALLING IN THIS MORNING ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION RELATIVE TO THE LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF THE CONTENT OF OUR PORTION THERE'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE BILLS WHAT YOU HAVE IS SOME THINGS THAT GET ATTACHED AS THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND SO REALLY WE'RE FARLEY CONSISTENT WITH THOSE BILLS AND AGAIN IF YOU GO BACK TO WHAT THEY'RE TRYING Statue when it was put in place over fifteen years ago, which is around infrastructure upgrades, particularly around bare steel and cast iron and to really just kind of codify some of that in terms of the language. so i don't think there's a lot of difference between those two and that's why when it goes back to the committee for reconciliation there'll be some cleanup relative to the things that are attached there relative to your your second part of the question in terms of the stipulation. i think we've just been working collectively and again, we felt this way all along that the pipe is the way That we've been replacing meets all the requirements relative to what needs to be part of the infrastructure upgrades included in the esource program even to the fact that we still agree that that the plastics that we've been replacing are much more efficient way to upgrade our system but this primarily focused on the bare steel and cast iron and did they meet those criteria we're providing additional evidence but i think in terms of the reason that we got to this is because we continued to work together to to strongly support again the intent of while we've been replacing this pipe around say RELIABILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF OPERATING OUR SYSTEM. SO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S PROGRESS IF YOU WANNA LOOK AT IT THAT WAY AND AGAIN EVEN WITH THE CASES THAT ARE STILL THERE WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND HOPEFULLY MAKE OUR CASE AROUND THE PIPE THAT HAS BEEN REPLACED IN PREVIOUS YEARS IS IS THE SAME CRITERIA THAT WE'RE USING GOING FORWARD Just curious, what's given you the increased confidence to execute on the plan this year given the headwinds with covid-related pressures? hey, richie, this is steve. great question. a couple of things. first of all, i guess the downside of the warmer weather that has impacted our margins is it does give us a little bit better working conditions on our capital spend. and as steve talked about, we had a strong Winter season and now we're heading into the heart of our capital spend so i think that point number one and then number two, you know, a playbook for utilities as we look at how we can best try to offset both the headwinds from weather and also the headwinds from coronavirus that we talked about ramping up our capital spend is one of those activities. it's clearly something that helps get us back to work and we're doing it with the cooperation and understanding of the leaders throughout our states and our jurisdictions. and i think Just helping us to ensure that not only are we doing the right thing by upgrading our infrastructure, but we're also doing it in a way that's going to make us even more resilient as we go forward. so i think it's really just an evolution of all those things. and again, you've seen us ramp up and ramp down in the past, and we think this is an opportunity for us to ramp up a little bit more. and richie, this is the other steve. let me follow up on an operational perspective. i would like to reiterate that as we, and again, this past quarter was only really several weeks, In terms of the measurement period we never stopped working and you'll hear some businesses talk about return to work we talk about it more as a transition and if you think about it from a construction and capital perspective we we really didn't take our foot off the gas we obviously changed some of our processes and procedures relative to personal protective equipment and to be quite honest we've limited going into customers homes to do service tie overs and change overs we'll go back and do that but but again in terms of the infrastructure that we've been working on and will continue to do so That really didn't slow down, and that's a great tribute to our our frontline employees, the management that's out there, that that really pulled together, if you think about our three strategic areas of focus one of those is innovation, and we got innovative in the way we're continuing to think about our work the other part i would just want to reinforce is that our capital for these site programs is fairly evenly distributed across our three major operating areas in terms of the east side, missouri west, and alabama and so we're not just impacted in one area in terms of ratcheting up and Back, we're fairly evenly spread, even with the new business as well. So if you think about that increase that we saw a year to date of nearly ten percent that we referenced, that's pretty evenly spread across all of our operating companies, which i think gives us a good balance as well. you added, thank you very much. i appreciate the call. that's all i had. the next question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse. please go ahead. Morning. hey. i was wondering if you guys have a better sense at all how whether legislation would preclude the need for a ruling of the supreme court or not. you know, at this point, after conferring with your own lawyers and maybe outside counsel. michael to steve. the supreme court opportunity, at least for the rulings that came out of the appellate court has already passed. they To take the the appeal that we and the public service commission put forth. so really the legislation that steve lindsey talked about is the best opportunity for a longer term fix. we obviously are continuing to work with the missouri public service commission, the staff, the opc, and the other interveners to not only crisp up the the support for our filings but also to get to a more unified view going forward of what makes sense for our customers. And i would like to say, too, that it's consistent with when we started this journey, we pursued a regulatory legislative and judicial outcome, and so all of those paths, so we're on track with what we strategically set out to begin with. what's the july sixteenth decision that we're waiting on? what is that? okay, so this would be a, this is on the cases that were remanded back to the commission. so once they go back to the public service commission, so In essence have a hundred and twenty days to make a decision based on those cases that did not go through to the supreme court. so you've got several moving parts that are going on here from the legislative perspective and regulatory but but that is on the cases that that were under appeal that have been remanded back to the commission all those cases the decision you're referring to is the decision by the regulators right on the remanded back to the commission yes i got it i got it and on the guidance the long-term guidance the base here is still two thousand and nineteen? are you a base here? yeah, you know, i chuckle, michael, it's a fair question. i think that the answer is if you look at our capital spend program over five years and driving rate base growth at seven to eight percent, we expect that we should be able to drive the kind of growth that we talked about in the long term over the bottom line. i chuckle because we're all dealing with and we've spent a lot of time and i know our peers are because you've been on those calls. A lot of time dealing with the current situation and in the fullest of time as we understand what's happening in and in the current year twenty twenty we'll find a way to rebase and make sure everybody understands. but right now we're just trying to make sure that we and our customers get through this year and we do it in a fashion that we feel good about so that when we hit twenty twenty one and beyond we're hitting it at full steam with our customers coming along for the ride. yeah, that would be my understanding. i mean, i think a lot of people are trying to look through twenty twenty as a normal year. That's definitely going to be an abnormal year. Yeah, I think a lot of people would like to look through this year. Alright, thank you very much, guys. And stay safe and healthy. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Again, if you have any questions, please press star then one. The next question comes from brian russo with guardian daily. Please go ahead. Hey, just curious on the weather normalization mechanism in missouri that was quote unquote ineffective what you know structurally what made it ineffective and what would you need to do in so far as further discussions with regulators and or during your next rate case to fix it or can it ever be fixed? PERFECT ALRIGHT WELL GOOD MORNING MORNING THIS IS STEVE LINDSAY THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AND I WISH I DID DO ALL THE ANSWERS TO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY COMPLEX FORMULA I THINK THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS IS WE HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE NOW THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE WHICH IS POSITIVE IT DID HELP BUT IT DIDN'T COMPLETELY ADDRESS THE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WEATHER OBVIOUSLY AND IN THE VOLUMES AND THE REVENUE SO THERE It does not even include the small commercial class and some of those others that are really weather sensitive and look and behave a lot like the residential class. so that's one opportunity that if you look at other weather normalization mechanisms in the country they do include that so that's clearly an opportunity the other is that it's not linear and what i mean by that is every day isn't the same every week isn't the same as you go through the month so you could have some outcomes that show results of degree days that didn't really translate to the way gas flowed from a customer's perspective so I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITY AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AGAIN IT IS IT'S A START IT'S NOT PERFECT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE A PRETTY STRONG PRESENTATION AS TO WHERE THE DEFICIENCIES ARE. BECAUSE AGAIN THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE RISK AS STEVE INDICATED IF IT'S TOO COLD WE SHOULDN'T BENEFIT IF IT'S TOO WARM WE SHOULDN'T BE HARMED AND IT'S REALLY TO TRY TO TIGHTEN THAT BAND AND WH Bill is a fixed charge. you know, and that, that roughly depends on, you know, the type of year that you're having, but it could be twenty five percent, twenty to twenty five percent, i think, based on a residential customer. and again, that has variability, obviously, based on the type of winter that you have, because that's where most of the volumetric piece comes in. so, okay, great. and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, FOR REHEARING REMIND REMIND ME HOW HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REVENUES IS THAT AND WHEN MIGHT THAT IMPACT NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS IS IT AFTER A COMMISSION DECISION SO THE LITTLE PART OF JULY OR YOU KNOW FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE DO YOU NOW HAVE MORE CLARITY AS TO WHAT THE RECOVERY OR OF THOSE COSTS You know, i'm curious to when a provision might be taken against our net economic earnings. yeah, brian, this is steve rash. there's a there's a detailed chart in the appendix to our presentation that you can take a look at which really outlines the various layers of isurus. the total provision that is the total of all the collections that are included in the rulings that were are part of the appeal. court decision and then the supreme court's decision not to take it up, and that we continue to collect on those and we're collecting at two million in change every quarter. so up until the time that the missouri public service commission makes a final determination, we will continue to collect those, collect those funds. i would point out there are various components of that of that sixteen point nine million dollars, and part of it has to do with the that that sixteen point nine million dollars, and part of it has to do with the that that sixteen point nine million dollars, and part of it has to do with the that that sixteen point nine million dollars, and part of it has to do with the that that sixteen point nine million dollars, and part of it has to do with the that that sixteen point nine million dollars, and part of it has to do with the the conclusion whether cast iron and bare steel is worn out and sterilized and another component about incidental plastic that is replaced along with longer lines of the cast iron and bare steel and the public service commission is going to have to weigh in based upon the remand from the appellate court on each one of those and when they reach their decision and that's that july fifteenth date that we've been talking about then the commission will not only decide on The on how to handle each of those individual issuer determinations, but it will also have to determine whether or not um determine whether or not the amounts will be refunded to the extent they determine there's a refund or if the amounts will be used in some other fashion. and the commission has full right to be able to decide how they want to handle that so again that's at that point Once we have a determination from the public service commission, then i think we were obviously obligated to take a look at our net economic earnings calculation, and to the extent that those revenues are now not going to be earned revenues or earnings, and that we would adjust our net economics measure at that point. and just to keep it in perspective, if the sixteen ninth, a little over four million dollars, that that impacts our current year, the vast majority of it was the initial provision that we booked. Add for the last fiscal year. okay, got it. understood. and then just on the, the equity. if i heard you correctly, you issued ten million of equity in the fiscal second quarter and that satisfies your needs for the entire year? no, i mean, if you go to our, our guidance page, you can see that we have we have a guided range of of equity of fifty to one hundred million dollars as our total need for the year. so In the first quarter we knocked out roughly ten million of that at the low end and and the beauty of where we stand is we we do have that we're in ongoing discussions with our rating agencies we we do have some leverage in some cushion in our credit metrics which are the ones that everybody's always looking at so we do believe that we will be in the equity markets later this year as long as the markets continue to rebound in an orderly fashion but it's not Anything we have to do, but i think our preference is, in order to maintain strong credit metrics and a balanced capital structure, that it would be appropriate for us to get in the range of the equity that we've guided in our long-term guides. okay. and then, the february stipulation on eleven point one million revenues under issuer's is that what you filed for? The reason why i'm struggling, brian, is that we filed for a lot of different numbers because we filed for amounts that had not been awarded for plastics in prior filings. i think the best number to think about in terms of what was our net expectation in terms of what we were going to get out of the filing, it was probably and i don't have it off the top of my head, it was in the high elevenths or low twelfth million dollar range. and there's always some difference between what you expect and what you get. Between what we expect and what we actually get because our isis filings generally include forty five to sixty days worth of forecasted capital costs and so that always gets trued up in a rate case and and that is clearly what happened in this in this filing for isis i'm sorry and when does the missouri legislature end this year well you know we're kind of writing the blame book as we go right now There's probably at least another couple of weeks of session i know that again this is this is not a special session this was just to start up again and we were we were very pleased to be included as part of the legislation as being considered but we we came out or as we talked about we're out of both chambers and now we're in reconciliation so so we view that ours is is moving forward at a pace that at least we're we're pleased so far Thank you. the next question comes from selman akic with stifel. please go ahead. thank you. good morning. lots have been asked and answered, so just a few follow-ups and clarifications, if i could. just following up on that last question, so we'll get a legislative response, one way or another, by the end of the month. if that's successful, then can you? does that have any impact on Sort of the july outcome, in your opinion? well, i would say that it doesn't directly, because it is a a looking forward. but i think what it does is, is gives some hopefully guidance to the commission that that what we've been again operating under the assumptions of for over fifteen years has been validated and has been cleaned up, if you will, in this legislation. again, we think that everything we've been doing from this point forward, from when the program went into place has met those requirements. I think this reinforces that. so hopefully from the commission's perspective, they can use that as as part of their decision making in that the the infrastructure that we've been upgrading does meet these requirements. and i'm sure everyone on the phone is aware but it is it's not unusual for a house to produce a bill and then the senate is sent over to the other chamber that is in this case the senate they pretty much write it the same way but not exactly the same way so then the committees are created and as steve said it goes to conference so they can settle those those differences so that's that's not unusual at all in the legislative process right um let me just ask this your bill is not attached or it doesn't include other things that would be controversial per se so if it could get to the governor's desk i think he'd have to call it controversial but like a lot of bills you know they're written in one chamber for a specific need and then it goes to the other chamber and the other chamber amends it i wouldn't call it controversial but like a lot of bills you know they're written in one chamber for a specific need and then it goes to the other chamber and the other chamber amends it i wouldn't call it controversial but like a lot of bills you know they're written in one chamber for a specific need and then it goes to the other Other elements, which is just what happened in this instance. So that's when the two committees come together in conference and sort of quote, quote, quote the bill up to and that's where we are and again, that's not uncommon. I think you referred to additional investment in store or in store for ten million. How much more is there to go? Yeah, it's tom, this is steve. We're still in the process of figuring out what our long-term development plan is. obviously given on some other things we've been focused on you know we're clearly very pleased with the operational performance of the storage field this winter and you saw that in the improved operating results and we but we haven't come up with the longer range plan but what our commitment to our investors and to you all is that we'll continue to bring you along for the journey and so as we think about the amount that we are going to spend between now and the next call that's the ten million dollars that we increase In our in our capital spending target for the year okay and then just kind of going back to the ineffectiveness of the weather mitigation and i know you guys are looking at ways to improve that does that will that have to wait really until you go through your next rate case in order to be improved or could it be improved before then that would be yes so your question basically has an answer to it it is part of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview of the overview all rate rate structure, and so that would be part of our next rate filing. yes, i would say again that that's not unusual. the two requirements of a rate case are set revenue requirement and rate design. and it's very rare for commissions to take up either rate design or revenue requirement outside of a rate case. it does occur, but it's very rare. and i would add on, i get a little bit of the floor here. it's not unusual either for these mitigation mechanisms to be in place. it's not unusual either for these mitigation mechanisms to be in place. it's not unusual either for these mitigation mechanisms to be in place. it's not unusual either for these mitigation mechanisms to be in place. it's not unusual either for these mitigation mechanisms to be In place as a starting point because they are complex and there are different classes of customers and even within those classes, people use energy in different ways, either all heating or some more year round and those sorts of things. So they're a bit complex. So like Steve and Steve mentioned, I was glad to see the commission work with us and start and we'll continue to refine as we file cases over time. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Again, if you have a question, please press star, then one. the next question comes from richard sunderland with j. p. morgan. please go ahead. hi, good morning. just just one for me today. thanks for taking the time. be the s t l. pipeline additional capacity if i miss this earlier, apologies, but any Update on discussions around contracting that and i would imagine there have been some impacts from covid, maybe expectations at this point, if any yeah, thank you for the question. you know, we will continue to look for opportunities, but right now, first of all, i want to confirm that it did go into service and served this side of the state very well as we went through the winter. we will continue to operate that pipeline the way it was designed to do and access gas from the gas These are to bring to this side for our customers here. again, as opportunities emerge, but i think a lot of those opportunities have probably been been put on standstill right now as we're going through some of these challenges. but as those opportunities are out there, we will continue to pursue those with the additional capacity so just to follow up real quick, the opportunities as you see them, would those potentially be as soon as say, twenty twenty one, or is this more of a long-dated opportunity to Put additional contracts in place and then i guess eventually add compression yeah so yeah good question we've shared with you in the past we absolutely can add compression to the pipeline and again i want to echo steve's comment from an operational perspective the pipeline has performed very well this past winter even i mean it's against the backdrop of a warmer winter but we were able to exercise that pipe pretty well and it from pressure and flows AND SO FORTH THAT OPERATED AGAIN VERY WELL THERE IS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND WE CAN'T ADD COMPRESSION AND THERE IS A MARKET AND I SUSPECT SOME OF THAT'LL DEPEND ON HOW THE NATURAL GAS AND INDUSTRY PLAYS OUT OVER TIME THERE'S BEEN A LOT GOING ON IN OUR INDUSTRY AS FAR AS WELLS AND LOCK INS AND SUPPLY SOURCES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO WE'LL SORT THAT OVER TIME THAT THE PIPELINE OPERATIONALLY AND THERE IS THE MARKET SITTING BEHIND IT SO WE'LL SEE H Plays up. Thanks for the update. yeah, thanks. again, if you have a question, please press star, then one. At this time, there are no further questions, so this concludes our question and answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to scott dudley for any closing remarks. well, thank you all for joining us. i know it's a busy earnings day. we're going to be around throughout the rest of the day and we'll look forward to catching up with many of you then. thanks and be safe. the conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect"

INITIATIVE WE FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO NOT ONLY STAY THE COURSE BUT CAPITALIZE ON THE REBOUNDING ECONOMY WHERE AND WHEN IT OCCURS AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN THE CALL OVER TO FRANK FRANK THANK YOU MARY I I WILL START BY PROVIDING SOME MORE DETAIL ON THE THIRD QUARTER SPEAKING ON A SAME-STATION BASIS AND FOLLOW THAT WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COLOR ON NON-OPERATING ITEMS IN Q3 TOTAL REVENUE WAS 196.4 MILLION DOWN 29.4% FROM Q3 2019 BUT AN INCREASE OF 34.5% OVER Q2 TOTAL REVENUE AS MARY NOTED ON A MONTH BASIS WE SAW TOTAL REVENUE IMPROVEMENT AS THE QUARTER PROGRESSED WITH SEPTEMBER REVENUE 35% HIGHER THAN JUNE SPOT AND NETWORK MARKETS PERFORMED COMPARABLY IN THE QUARTER DOWN IN THE LOW 30S VERSUS 2019 WITH DIGITAL SLIGHTLY OFFSETTING THOSE RESULTS UP 2% DRIVEN BY OUR PODCASTING BUSINESS WHICH WAS UP NEARLY 50% ON AN ENTIRELY ORGANIC BASIS DIGITAL DOLLARS REPRESENTED OVER 10% OF REVENUE IN THE QUARTER POLITICAL SPEND ACCELERATED AS THE QUARTER WENT ON FINISHING AT 5.8 MILLION VERSUS 1.7 MILLION IN Q3 2019 AND 3.6 MILLION IN Q3 2018 OF NOTE THIS WAS A RECORD QUARTER FOR POLITICAL AND WE'RE ON TRACK FOR ANOTHER RECORD QUARTER IN Q4 MOVING DOWN TO P&L EXPENSES DECLINED BY 42 MILLION OR 19% DRIVEN BY BOTH REDUCTIONS AND BEARABLE COST RELATED TO THE REVENUE DECLINES AND ACTIVE FIXED-COST REDUCTIONS AS MARY MENTIONED WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT TO REA- REALIZE MORE THAN 85 MILLION IN BENEFITS IN TOTAL THIS YEAR FROM OUR FIXED-COST ACTIONS TO DATE OF THESE MORE THAN 25 MILLION WERE ACHIEVED IN Q3 AND MORE THAN 15 MILLION WILL BE ACHIEVED IN Q4 BROKEN DOWN BETWEEN TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT EFFECTS ABOUT 19 MILLION OF THE 85 MILLION RELATE TO PERMANENT ACTIONS WHICH HAVE AN ANNUAL <INAUDIBLE> EXPENSE BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY 36 MILLION THE AMOUNT OF THE TEMPORARY COST THAT WILL RETURN OVER TIME WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON REVENUE RECOVERY IN 2021 PUTTING REVENUES AND EXPENSE TOGETHER FOR THE QUARTER EBITDA FINISHED AT 20.4 MILLION NORMALIZING FOR M&A ACTIVITY WE ONCE AGAIN GREW OUR CASH BALANCE BY 3.5 MILLION IN THE QUARTER BRINGING TOTAL FREE CASHFLOW GENERATION YEAR-TO-DATE EXCLUDING M&A AND THE ABL DRAW TO MORE THAN 45 MILLION ACHIEVING THIS OUTCOME DESPITE THE PANDEMIC IS THE RESULT OF POSITIVE EBITDA GENERATION RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL AND REDUCED CAP-BACKS AS WE SAID ON OUR LAST CALL WE CUT OUR 2000 AND TW- 2020 CAP-BACK SPEND PROJECTION TO 17 MILLION AND WITH 4 MILLION SPENT IN Q3 WE ARE ON TRACK TO DELIVER THAT OUR CASH TAXES THIS YEAR HAVE ALSO BEEN MATERIALLY REDUCED FROM THE COMBINATION OF LOWER OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND CARES ACT BENEFITS SO IN Q3 WE RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION OF TAX REFUNDS RELATED TO TAXES PAID IN 2019 I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IN Q4 WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS COMING FROM INCREASED REVENUES <INAUDIBLE> BOND INTEREST PAYMENT AND THOUGH SMALL AN ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENT RELATED TO THE GAIN ON THE TOWER SALE WILL CAUSE US TO BURN SOME PORTION OF THE FREE CASH FLOW GENERATED YEAR-TO-DATE WE WERE PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE ABOUT A MONTH AGO THE INITIAL CLOSING OF THE TOWER TRANSACTION WHICH PROVIDED A CASH INFLOW OF 202.3 MILLION UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS 64 MILLION THE NET PROCEED FROM THE

BONDS AT PAR THE TENDER OFFER WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ON NOVEMBER 3RD WE DO EXPECT TO HAVE SUBSEQUENT CLOSINGS FOR THE REMAINING PROCEEDS FROM THE TOWER TRANSACTION BY THE END OF THE FIRST HALF OF 2021 ADDITIONALLY FOR TAX PURPOSES THE GAIN IN THE TRANSACTION WILL LARGELY BE OFFSET BY ANTICIPATED NET OPERATING LOSSES THIS YEAR THAT DEBT NOW HAS BEEN REDUCED BY MORE THAN 330 MILLION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND BY MORE THAN 585 MILLION OR 46% SINCE THE QUARTER THAT WE EMERGED FROM BANKRUPTCY AS A REMINDER WE DO NOT HAVE FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE CONVENANCE IN EITHER OUR TERM LOAN OR BONDS AND THEY DO NOT MATURE UNTIL 2026 AS MENTIONED ON PREVIOUS CALLS WE'RE ALSO STILL WORKING THROUGH THE POTENTIAL MONETIZATION OF THE VALUABLE PIECE OF PROPERTY IN NASHVILLE THAT WE HOPE TO BRING

Doon we executed on our expense reduction plan realizing over twenty five million of fixed cost savings in the quarter with the expectation of delivering more than eighty five million in two thousand and twenty we generated positive ebida and cash from operations for the quarter bringing year to date free cash flow excluding mna and the abl draw to over forty five million we strengthened our balance sheet significantly completing the initial closing of our tower sale Speakback transaction finishing the quarter with over three hundred and fifty million of cash a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to reinvestment and or additional pay down while the environment remains uncertain we now have the resources and flexibility to respond to opportunities that might arise from the disruption and invest in areas that will drive growth while continuing to improve our balance sheet on virtually all metrics our third quarter results represented a significant Increased revenue from hughes two same station revenue finished down twenty nine percent year over year but as i mentioned, improved sequentially each month in terms of total dollars in the spot market which is arguably the best indicator of the overall health of the core radio business we saw year over year improvement each month both inclusive and exclusive of political dollars like last quarter, our diary markets which were less affected by the pandemic shutdowns outperformed our Dpm markets political as you might expect was clearly very strong as our footprint overlapped nicely with swing states we had five point eight million of political revenue in the quarter which was a new high water mark for a third quarter and had benefited from that spending pace through the election government spending also contributed positively in the quarter and while still negative versus last year financial general services and professional services also outperformed other categories digital as a whole posted another quarter of growth while streaming and local digital marketing services remained pressured in the difficult macro climate podcasting more than offset those declines up nearly fifty percent in the quarter podcasters casting delivered record quarterly revenue reflecting our particularly strong news talk portfolio and our highest ever download count over a hundred and two million in september up forty seven percent year over year also in the quarter we launched the new marketplace minute a short form three times a day briefing that highlights the most important stories about money, business, and economy developed in partnership with american public media the marketplace minute is distributed across smart speakers, broadcasting, and podcasting marking the first time any public media company has partnered with a commercial audio company to extend its reach the minute marketplace minute also serves as a great example of our effective use of partnerships to create. Exciting new content for podcast audiences on the expense front we mentioned last quarter that we were targeting approximately eighty five million of fixed cost reductions for the year including permanent reductions on an annual run rate of thirty six million more than twenty five million of these fixed cost savings were achieved in q three and we anticipate realizing more than fifteen million in q four many of these savings resulted from difficult decisions mandated by the pandemic induced revenue Declines however others reflect changes in the way we expect to conduct our business in the future informed by new ways of operating developed during the pandemic and or developed to meet our evolving business needs for example we have consolidated some sales management and are in the process of centralizing our sales marketing research and insights efforts into one group that services the entire organization as opposed to the more fragmented ad channel configuration. it was previously in place lastly, we continued to find new ways to streamline business processes, particularly in non-revenue producing functions with the benefit of these cost takeouts and tight working capital management we delivered positive free cash flow for the second straight quarter during the pandemic we further added to our cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transactions which brought our quarterly cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transactions which brought our quarterly cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transactions which brought our quarterly cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transactions which brought our quarterly cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transactions which brought our quarterly cash position with proceeds from the initial Cash balance to more than three hundred and fifty million these significant cash reserves not only provide a security with which to navigate the unpredictability of the months ahead but also the capability and flexibility to act on creative opportunities that may come our way looking ahead as we move into the fourth quarter we continue to see positive momentum in bookings driven largely by political but also reflecting underlying improvement across all revenue streams Current pacing is down in the mid teens versus last year with political providing about a four hundred and fifty basis point benefit. we remain guarded about the finish to the year given the recent acceleration of coronavirus infections across the country potential shut down measures and reaction to that and the generally uncertain macro environment. so for the remainder of the fourth quarter and likely well into two thousand and twenty one while we hope for continued improvement our performance will remain the same. highly sensitive to the shape and pace of external events however it goes without saying that we remain unrelentingly disciplined and focused on continuing to re-engineer the business to maximize revenue and reduce our costs that said given our liquidity position more efficient expense profile and growth initiatives we feel comfortable about our ability to not only stay the course but capitalize on the rebounding economy where and when it happens Hers and with that, i'll turn the call over to frank frank thank you, parry i will start by providing some more detail on the third quarter speaking on a same station basis and follow that with some additional color on non operating items in q three total revenue was a hundred ninety six point four million down twenty nine point four percent from q three two thousand and nineteen an increase of thirty four point five percent over q two total revenue As Mary noted, on a monthly basis, we saw a total revenue improvement as a quarter progressed. The September revenue was thirty five percent higher than June. Spot and network markets performed comparably in the quarter, down in the low thirties versus two thousand nineteen, with digital slightly offsetting those results up to two percent. Driven by our podcasting business, which was up nearly fifty percent on an entirely organic basis. Digital dollars represented over ten percent of our revenue. Percentage of revenue in the quarter political spending accelerated as the quarter went on, finishing at five point eight million versus one point seven million in q3 two thousand and nineteen and three point six million in q3 two thousand and eighteen of note, this was a record quarter for political and we're on track for another record quarter in q four moving down to the p n l expenses climbed to forty two million or nineteen percent driven by both reductions and variations Costs related to the revenue declines and active fixed cost reductions as mentioned, we continue to expect to realize more than eighty five million in benefits in total this year from our fixed cost actions to date of these more than twenty five million were achieved in q3 and more than fifteen million will be achieved in q4 broken down between temporary and permanent effects about nineteen million of the eighty five million relate to permanent actions Which have an annualized expense benefit of approximately thirty six million the amount of the temporary costs that will be returned over time will largely depend on revenue recovery in two thousand and twenty one putting revenues and expenses together for the quarter even out to a twenty point four million normalizing for m n a activity we once again grew our cash balance by three point five million in a quarter bringing total free cash generation for the year to date up to Including m n a and the a b l draw to more than forty five million achieving this outcome despite the pandemic is a result of positive e v i d a generation rigorous management of working capital and reduced cap ex as we said on our last call we cut our two thousand two thousand twenty cap ex spend projection to seventeen million and with four million spent in h three we are on track to meet that goal our cash taxes this year have also been materially reduced When the combination of lower operating performance and cares act benefits so in q3 we received approximately two point five million of tax refunds related to taxes paid in two thousand nineteen i would also note that in q4 working capital requirements coming from increased revenues are deferred bond interest payments and those small but estimated tax payments related to the gain on the tower sale will cause us to burn some portion of the free cash flow generated Near to date we were pleased to announce about a month ago the initial closing of the tower transaction which provided a cash inflow of two hundred and two point three million under our debt agreements sixty four million of the net proceeds from the assets being sold and not leased back are required to pay down debt pro rata subject to a twelve month grace investment period ninety six million of the proceeds from assets being sold and leased back were required to pay down debt immediately as such concurrent with the closing. We paid down forty nine million of the term loan at par and on monday october fifth we launched a tender offer for forty seven point two million of senior secured bonds at par the tender offer was successfully completed on november third we do expect to have subsequent closings for the remaining proceeds from the tower transaction by the end of the first half of two thousand and twenty one additionally for tax purposes the gain on the transaction will largely be offset by anticipated net operating losses this year additionally for tax purposes the gain on the transaction will largely be offset by anticipated net operating losses this year Net debt now has been reduced by more than three hundred and thirty million since the beginning of the year and by more than five hundred and eighty five million or forty six percent since a quarter that we emerged from bankruptcy as a reminder we do not have financial maintenance covenants in either our term loan or bonds and they do not mature until two thousand twenty six as mentioned on previous calls we are still working through the potential monetization of the valuable precious property national and we hope to DERING TO MARKET WHEN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ACTIVITY APPROACHES MORE TYPICAL LEVELS LASTLY I WANTED TO NOTE SOME NEW DISCLOSURES OR TANK YOU RELATED TO THE N C D B A based on the cancellation of march madness in two thousand and twenty we believe the rights fees of two thousand and twenty season are not payable to n c d b a the n c d b a however chose to terminate the contract based on non-payment of those fees on september twenty eighth two thousand and twenty we and the n c d b a Filed competing lawsuits with regard to the disputes surrounding the agreement while it is always for the contract disputes to escalate to litigation and litigation can be unpredictable we believe in the merits of our position at this stage we are unable reasonably to estimate the impact of the ultimate litigation but we will keep you informed as it progresses with that we can now open the line for q and a operator thank you to ask a question you will need to press store one on your telephone keypad that is store one to withdraw your question press the pound or the hash key please stand by while we compile the q and a roster and your first question comes from michael kapitsky nobel capital market thank you for taking the question Ones, first of all, i was wondering if you had mentioned that you have, obviously, now a large cash position it was and you indicated that you may not use all of that cash to pay down debt. so i'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about uses of cash and then also if there are emn opportunities what you may be looking at sure, hi mike you know, i think we characterize it as our huge cash position has put us in a fantastic position The mission to be defensive about the uncertainty that exists, but as you point out, also opportunistic in ways that we can use cash to drive value. so, obviously, paying down debt remains a huge priority and we know there's a great return to use our cash that way. however, you know, should interesting opportunities come our way, we're open to considering that, whether in radio or otherwise. but we do recognize the high bar for expected returns. and i was just kind of giving you an overview of what we're doing. Some thoughts about cue four and in the pacing's there can you just kind of give us a little bit of a color on maybe spot versus network what you're seeing in digital just kind of give us a little bit more color on the on the individual line items in cue four first let me comment about cue three then i'll give you a little more color on cue four so cue three had a very nice recovery both in both in both the spot and the network what you're seeing in digital just kind of give us a little bit more color on the on the individual line items in cue four spot in the network markets and as you heard in my prepared remarks, they perform comparably. but i will say that in the third quarter, the national spot improved considerably from the second quarter as we get into a more normalized environment. in the fourth quarter, both channels are progressing nicely and are benefiting in the network from the return of the nfl, which we're pleased with. The national markets are stronger if you look at the local markets, so part of the benefits we're getting in the local markets is clearly political, which displaces to some extent some of the local business. so the trends at this point we're seeing is fairly strong, but it's mainly driven by the script, and we're being cautious with regard to the pandemic and the spread and the impact on the rest of the quarter. How does the bookings look as you go into december, which is outside of the political realm of, you know, what you may have gotten for in in october and november? at this point, we'll just this comment on pacing as of this date and you'll have more color obviously at our earnings call next year. okay, fair enough. that's all i have. thank you. You will need to press store one on your telephone keypad that is store one to withdraw your question press the pound or the hash key please stand by while we compile the q and a roster there are no questions at this time ok Thanks, everybody. Thanks, everybody for joining our call today. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LEVEL WHICH BASED ON CONSTRUCTION SPENDING READINGS SINCE MID 2018 FOR SUPPORTING THE POSITIVE DYNAMICS THEME FOR THIS SEGMENT UNTIL FEBRUARY 2020 ON THE MIDTERM THOUGH WE EXPECT A REBOUND BASED ON POTENTIAL STIMULUS MEASURES FROM THE GOVERNMENT RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR DUE TO ITS INFLUENCE ON EMPLOYMENT AND THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE THANK YOU BILL TO CONCLUDE THE U.S REGION I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT WE ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT THE ROLE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WILL PLAY ON THE RECORD OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND IN THAT SENSE WE EXPECT THE COORDINATE INITIATIVES TO BE DEVELOPED AROUND THAT SECTOR MOVING ON TO COLUMBIA I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE PRICE IMPROVEMENT ACHIEVED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR TOGETHER WITH THE EFFICIENCIES IN THE <INAUDIBLE> CAPTURES IN THE SECOND HALF OF LAST YEAR WHICH LED TO AN INCREASE IN EBITDA MARGIN EVEN IN THE SCENARIO OF LOWER VOLUMES AS A RESULT OF THE QUARANTINE TOM WILL NOW PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLOR ON THIS REGION THANK YOU JUAN AND GOOD MORNING DURING THE QUARTER WE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTING OUR STRATEGY TO RECOVER VOLUME WHICH LED TO AN INCREASE IN SERVICE OF NEARLY 13.5% VERSUS THE SAME QUARTER OF LAST YEAR WITH A TEMPORARY LOSS OF VOLUME VOLUMES WERE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE QUARANTINE INCLUDING COLOMBIA FROM MARCH 25TH ON WHICH COST A REDUCTION EQUIVALENT TO 8% OF THE BUSINESS WORKING DAYS IN THE FIRST QUARTER THROUGH THE QUARANTINE WE WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE DISPATCHES TO SOME ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE SUCH AS TUNEL DE LA LINEA <UNK> AND A FEW MINING PROJECTS AS WELL AS SOME EXPORTS FROM OUR CARTAGENA PLANT CEMENT FROM READY MIX DISPATCHES DECREASED 13.9% AND 19.5% RESPECTIVELY ON A YEARLY BASIS IN LINE WITH THE PRICE IMPROVEMENT OUR EBITDA POSTED A 15% GROWTH DURING THE QUARTER RESULTING ALSO FROM LOWER MAINTENANCE EXPENSES AS WELL AS FOR MY CONTINUED EFFORT TO RENEGOTIATE SUPPLY CONTRACTS FROM <INAUDIBLE> WHICH LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF ENERGETIC OF 8.8% VERSUS THE SAME PERIOD OF 2019 I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EMPHASIZE ON THE EBITDA MARGIN IMPROVEMENT OF 4.3% WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SCENARIO OF LOWER VOLUMES IN RELATION TO THE RESTARTING OF OUR OPERATION TO THE DATE OF THESE CALL WE HAVEN'T STARTED OUR MILLS OF CARTAGENA RIO CLARO TOLU AND YUMBO AS WE ROLL OUT 17 OF OUR READY MIX PLANTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE WILL ADJUST OUR OPERATIONS NETWORK AS REQUIRED BY THE GROWTH OF DEMAND ALWAYS FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING ALL THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE THE HEALTH OF OUR EMPLOYEES CONTRACTORS CLIENTS AND SUPPLIERS ON THE DEMAND SIDE WE EXPECT FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT DURING THE MONTH OF MAY AS CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WILL BE ABLE TO FULLY RESTART THEIR OPERATIONS AND HAVE THEIR STORES YOU KNOW BECOME AVAILABLE IN LINE WITH DEMAND FOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS OUR CLIENTS FROM THE INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENDURE THE QUARANTINE MEASURES BY IMPLEMENTING A STRICT CONTROL ON THEIR COST AND THEREFORE ARE READY TO RESTART THEIR PROJECTS TO THE DATE OF THESE REPORT IMPORTANT PROJECTS SUCH AS TUNEL DEL TOYO PACIFICO ONE TWO AND THREE AND RUTA DEL SOL ONE TWO HAVE ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY RESTARTED THEIR CEMENT AND READY MIX CONSUMPTION IN TERMS OF COMPETITION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER THE MARKET EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN CLINICAL AND CEMENT INPUTS OF 45 AND 56% RESPECTIVELY WHEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF LAST YEAR ADDITIONALLY BETWEEN MARCH AND APRIL THE INPUT PRICE HAS INCREASED 17% DUE TO THE DEVALUATION OF THE COLOMBIAN PESO WHICH ADDS MORE SPACE FOR CONTINUING OUR VOLUME RECOVERY STRATEGY ONCE THE MARKET GOES BACK TO MORE NORMAL STANDARDS THANK YOU TOM I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE EARLY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN PREVENTING THE INCREASING THE CONTAGION CURVE WITHIN THE COUNTRY WHICH FOR OUR FRENCH OUR BELIEF OF OUR PROMPT RECOVERY ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY MOVING ON TO THE CARIBBEAN AND CENTRAL AMERICA I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE SAW ON EBITDA MARGIN WHEN COMPARED TO THE LAST QUARTER OF LAST YEAR DESPITE THE FACT THAT OUR TWO BIGGEST OPERATIONS PANAMA AND HONDURAS WERE CLOSED IN THE LAST WEEK OF THE QUARTER DUE TO THE CORONA CRISIS CAMILO WILL PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE REGION THANK YOU JUAN AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WAS POSITIVE IN TERMS OF MARKET DYNAMICS WITH COUNTRIES LIKE HONDURAS AND DOMINICAN REPUBLIC DURING JANUARY FEBRUARY AND MID MARCH FROM THE SECOND WEEK OF MARCH ON WE HAD SEVERAL AFFECTATIONS IN DEMAND IN BOTH COUNTRIES DUE TO THE LOCK DOWNS DECLARED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THESE LOCK DOWNS HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY LIFTED TO THE DATE OF THIS CALL ON APRIL WE SAW VOLUMES IN HONDURAS AND DOMINICAN REPUBLIC OF AROUND 40% OF OUR REGULAR MONTH PANAMA CONTINUED TO HAVE CHALLENGING MARKET DYNAMICS DURING THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE YEAR THAT WORSENED ON MARCH WITH COVID IMPACT ON THE DEMAND AND THE LATER QUARANTINE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT WE EXPECT A LOCKDOWN MEASURE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR TO BE LIFTED BEFORE MID MAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH PUBLIC STATEMENTS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THAT SENSE A REOPENING FROM OUR FACILITY AROUND THAT DATE HAITI ON THE OTHER SIDE CONTINUED ITS POSITIVE TREND IMPROVING PRICES IN 7.1% IN VOLUMES AND 11.1% VERSUS THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 OVERALL WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN BOTH THE EBITDA AND THE EBITDA MARGIN WHEN COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 OF 5.9% AND 1.2% RESPECTIVELY UNFORTUNATELY THESE RESULTS WERE STILL LOWER THAN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 IN PART DUE TO THE QUARANTINE MEASURES BUT MOSTLY DUE TO THE OVERALL MARKET CONDITIONS IN PANAMA AND THE FACT THAT PRICES IN HONDURAS CONTINUE TO BE LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF 2019 AS A RESULT CEMENT VOLUMES DECREASED 4.1% AND READY-MIX VOLUMES DECREASED 34.1% WHEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 THIS LOWER VOLUMES LED TO A DECREASE OF 16.9% IN THE REVENUES AND 33.5% ON EBITDA DURING THIS QUARTER WE CONTINUED TO WORK ON OBTAINING FURTHER EFFICIENCIES ON ENERGETICS ON OUR LOCAL OPERATIONS I HONDURAS FOR INSTANCE WE INAUGURATED A SOLID FUEL STORAGE IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO RECEIVE BIGGER AMOUNTS OF FUEL AND THEREFORE IMPROVE THE PURCHASE PRICE WE ALSO SUPPLIED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR 11.6% OF THE ENERGY FROM OUR PIEDRAS AZULES PLANT WITH THE SOLAR FARM OPERATED BY CELLCIO WITH LOWER COST TOGETHER WITH ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THIS INITIATIVE LOWERED THE CO2 EMISSIONS FROM OUR ENERGY SUPPLY IN AROUND 1500 TONES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 REINFORCING OUR COMMITMENT TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY WE BELIEVE THAT THE SECOND TRIMESTER OF THIS YEAR WILL CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGING FOR THE REGIONAL BUT MAINTAIN OUR CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM ON THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR DUE TO THE FACT THAT ECONOMIES SUCH AS PANAMA HONDURAS AND PUERTO RICO TOOK EARLY ACTIONS ON LOCK DOWNS AND QUARANTINE MEASURES AND IN THAT SENSE WE EXPECT AN EARLY RECOVERY IN THOSE ECONOMIES THANK YOU CAMILO I WILL ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE EFFORT OF THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT THE LOCAL ECONOMY BY IMPOSING A 30% TARIFF TO THE INPUTS OF CEMENT TO THE COUNTRY WHICH WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPETITIVE SCENARIO OF THE COUNTRY WE EXPECT SIMILAR OTHER STRATEGIES TO BE IMPLEMENTED FROM ALL THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE CARIBBEAN AND IN AMERICAN REGIONS I WOULD LIKE TO REFER NOW TO OUR BALANCE STATEMENT. WE CLOSED THE FIRST QUARTER WITH OUR NET DEBT WITH A RATIO OF FOUR TIMES WHICH IS LOWER TO THE RATIO OF THE LAST QUARTER OF 2019 THESE RESULTS WAS DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT OUR DOLLAR DENOMINATED EBITDA WAS PROPORTIONATELY HIGHER THAN OUR DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT IMPROVING OUR LABORERS RATIO IN A SCENARIO OF SIMILAR INDEBTEDNESS AND EBITDA REGARDING THE COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY MADE FROM LEVERAGING THE COMPANY AND REDUCING OUR NET DEBT TOWARD THE RATIO I WANT TO REASSURE YOU THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS WON'T ALLOW US TO DO THAT AS SOON AS WE WERE EXPECTING WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT WE SOLVE IN THE MEAN TERM THIS TEMPORARY PRIZES HAS BOOSTED OUR CREATIVITY OUR INNOVATIONS AND OUR SAVINGS INITIATIVES AND HAS REINFORCED THE COMMITMENT AND FOR

YOU IN OUR NEXT QUESTION IS JUAN DIAZ <INAUDIBLE> HI GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION I I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS MY FIRST QUESTION IS UM COULD YOU SPEND MORE ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NET DEBT EBITDA PLUS DIVIDENDS RATIO UH IN DOLLARS AND WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD THIS INDICATOR BE INCLUDING IFRS-16 AND USING ADJUSTED TO BE THEN WHAT ARE THE STRATEGIES TO LOWER THIS INDICATOR THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WITH REGARD TO RATING AGENCIES AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS UM WHAT IS THE MEDIUM TERM UH LIQUIDITY STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK CONSIDERING THAT THE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS THAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WERE TO BE SUPPO- SUPPORTED BY THE POSTPONED UH DIVESTITURES UH THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU JUAN CARLOS WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THE FIRST ONE ABOUT THE DEBT-TO- EBITDA RATIO UH THANKS JUAN BUT SO WHAT WHAT EXACTLY IS THE QUESTION WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS FOR EXAMPLE IN WHAT WHAT WHAT I UNDERSTOOD IN THE IN THE THAT UH REPORT FROM THE RATING AGENCIES THEY DON'T UH UH MAKE DECISION ON IFRS-16 OR OR UM AND AND ONE FOR THAT SIDE AND THE OTHER THING WAS ON- OH THANKS NO I GOT IT I GOT IT OKAY OKAY THE <UNK> THE RATING AGENCY <UNK> EXISTING ASSETS <UNK> THE FULLY IFRS 16 IS REALLY SIMILAR IT'S PRETTY SIMILAR BECAUSE OUR RATIO JUST TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DEBT RELATED TO ASSETS PER USE BETWEEN US DIVIDED BY THE DEPRECIATION PLUS AMORTIZATIONS PLUS THE INTEREST BECAUSE OF THESE THESE LEASES IS RIGHT NOW 4 TIMES FOR THE REASON INCLUDING THE IFRS 16 THE RATIO IS REALLY CLOSE TO 4 TIMES THAT WAS THE QUESTION ISN'T IT YES AND AND AND WHAT WERE THE STRATEGIES TO LOWER THESE INDICATORS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR <INAUDIBLE> NOW THROUGH THE YEAR WE SEE THE IDEA WE MENTION ITS OVERLY THE PREDICTABILITY OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE OVERLY VERY COMPLEX FOR THAT REASON WE ARE TAKING ALL THESE MEASURES LIKE CAPEX THE CAPEX CUT AND THE COST SAVINGS UH A LOT OF ALL THE MEASURES IN TERMS OF THE LIQUIDITY YOU ASK WELL WHAT ARE WE DOING OUR CURRENT POSITION IN LIQUIDITY IS ABOUT 500 AND 550 UH TRILLION PESOS UH YOU KNOW TRILLION PESOS NO NO NO BILLION PESOS UH REALLY THE IDEA THE IDEA IS TO END THE SECOND QUARTER WITH ABOUT IN A IN A VERY SPECIAL SCENARIO UH WITH UH WITH ABOUT 300 TRILLION PESOS <INAUDIBLE> BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT JUAN ESTEBAN AND TOMAS BILL AND CAMILO MENTIONED THAT COMPARING THAT VERY SPECULATE SCENARIO WITH IN THE REALITY APRIL WAS BY FAR VERY NICE THAN OUR INITIAL SCENARIOS AND MAY IS GOING BETTER BY BY FAR AS WELL FOR THE REGION WE'RE EXPECTING THAT WE ARE HEADING TO A BETTER POSITION IN TER- IN TERMS OF LIQUIDITY AND WHEN WE WHEN WE MONITOR THE THE CASH POSITION OF THE COMPANY WEEK BY WEEK GOING FORWARD UH DEPENDING ON HOW THINGS WORK YOU KNOW PLAY OUT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT AS CARLOS IS SAYING THAT UH WE WILL BE ABLE TO END THE QUARTER WITH A VERY GOOD CASH POSITION OKAY THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM RODRIGO SANCHEZ WITH DAVIVIENDA CORREDORES YES GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION I I JUST HAVE TWO QUESTIONS UH IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDS ALREADY SECURED OUT OF APRIL CARLOS COVERED ON WHAT WE EXPECT ON THE LIQUIDITY LEVELS UH ARE YOU EXPECTING RECEIVE FURTHER DEBTS INCREASES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE YEAR UM ALSO COULD YOU PLEASE MENTION THE AMOUNT YOU TOO HAVE AVAILABLE TO SECURE CREDIT LINES UM MY SECOND QUESTION IS UH I UNDERSTAND THAT THE SHARES YOU OWN IN GRUPO SURA UH ARE USED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE CREDIT LINES YOU YOU HAVE IN PLACE WOULD YOU BE RESTRAINED TO SELL THEM OR AT LEAST PART OF IT IF YOU IF YOU NEED IT TO DO SO THANK YOU FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE OF THE FOR THE FIRST PART THE QUESTION RODRIGO WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE HIGH LEVEL OF CAPABILITY WE ARE DISBURSING TOMORROW ANOTHER EXTRA $15 MILLION NOW <INAUDIBLE> NOT NOW BUT THAT WILL OPERATE AS UH INSURANCE OF LIQUIDITY <INAUDIBLE> NOW WE DON'T NEED THIS EXTRA LIQUIDITY BUT REALLY IF WE START TO HAVE THIS EXTRA LIQUIDITY IN HANDS UM WE ARE DISBURSING IN THESE EXTRA AMOUNTS THIS IS NOT CONTEMPLATED IN THE FIGURES THAT WE WERE MENTIONING AND WITH THIS NEW CREDIT LINE WE REALLY WILL BE IN A VERY GOOD POSITION OF LIQUIDITY FOR FO VERY FOR FOR MANY MONTHS AND GRUPO SURA IS A COLLATERAL ON CREDIT LINE NO NO NO WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANY COLLATERALIZED EARNINGS SHARES OKAY OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM ALEJANDRO CHAVELA WITH CREDIT SUISSE HELLO GUYS THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION AND UH STAY SAFE UH JUST ON COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS IN COLUMBIA I KNOW YOU ALREADY MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT BUT IF YOU COULD COMMENT A LITTLE BIT WITH REGARDS TO THE TO THE IMPROVEMENT THAT YOU ARE SEEING IN IMPORT PARITY PRICING AND THE SLICED MARKET SHARE THAT YOU HAD IN THE QUARTER UH COULD YOU COMMENT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON WHAT YOU EXPECT COMING FORWARD IN TERMS OF MARKET SHARE OR WHAT ARE YOU SEEING FROM FROM THE MARKET AS A WHOLE WITH WITH THE PRICING INCREASE THAT YOU MADE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ALEJANDRO UH THE MARKET IN COLUMBIA WAS BEHAVING IN A IN A VERY GOOD WAY UNTIL THE UH FIRST HALF OF OF MARCH UH WITH THE UM INCREASE IN DEMAND OF LAST YEAR CLOSE TO 500,000 TONS PLUS THE 7% INCREASE IN DEMAND THROUGH FEBRUARY THE REALITY IS THAT THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE WAS IN MY OPINION A POSITIVE UM NOBODY WAS REALLY COMPETING ON PRICE BECAUSE OF THE HUGE GAP IN PRICING THAT WE HAVE VIS-A-VIS IMPORT PARITY PRICES AND THE INTENTION OF UH UH OF UH EVERYBODY TO REWARD THE COST OF CAPITAL OF THE ASSETS THAT WE HAVE IN IN COLOMBIA UM I WOULD EXPECT THAT SCENARIO TO UM CONTINUE THE SAME WAY GOING FORWARD ONCE THE MARKET START TO TO RECOVER SO WE ARE EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THE THE RISING OF THE MARKET IN APRIL AND IN MAY AND IN OUR OPINION OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION HAS STRENGTH UH IN THIS RESTART OF THE OF THE ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ALIGN WITH OUR CLIENTS ON THE TECHNICAL UM ASSISTANCE THAT WE PROVIDE TO THEM IN OUR OPINION HAVE A SUPERIOR VALUE PROPOSITION FOR THE INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT OF THE MARKET AND WE'RE UH IN MY OPINION THE ONLY CEMENT PLAYER IN COLOMBIA WHO ACCESS DIRECTLY A WIDER RANGE OF HYBRID STORAGE IN THE COUNTRIES WE ARE GOING <UNK> FOR MORE THAN 5,000 HYBRID STORAGE SO IN OUR OPINION OUR VALUE PROPOSITION WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ASSET FOR US GOING FORWARD UH WE DON'T FORESEEN ANY VALID CONTINUED PRICES NO MATTER WHAT SCENARIO OF THE MONTH PLAYS OUT GOING FORWARD THIS WAS TO BE AN SIGNIFICANT GAP IN PRICES VIS-A-VIS

COLUMBIA THIS YEAR AND ALSO THE POTENTIAL THE TARIFFS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED IN PANAMA AND POTENTIALLY IMPLEMENTED IN HONDURAS AS WELL SO I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND UH HOW MUCH UH IMPORTS REPRESENTS FROM EACH OF THOSE MARKETS I MEAN HOW MUCH UH IMPORTERS EITHER CEMENT OR CLINKER WAS PERCENTAGE OF THE COLUMBIA IN THE MARKET AS OF 2019 AND IF CAN SHOW THE SAME NUMBER UH FOR PANAMA AND HONDURAS IT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU UM ANDREAS UH IMPORTING INTO COLOMBIA UH MAINLY CLEAN CARE LAST YEAR WAS UP TO 600,000 POUNDS UH IMPORTING TO HONDURAS AND PANAMA CLOSE TO 8% OF THE MARKET IN EACH OF THOSE MARKETS UH PANAMA CEMENT AND AND HONDURAS AS WELL ON THE THE CEMENT UH IN OUR OPINION UH THE RECENT TRENDS IN OUR ECONOMY TOWARDS UH YOU KNOW SUPPORTING LOCAL INDUSTRIES IS TO PROTECT EMPLOYMENT UH AND ESPECIALLY IN PLACES SUCH AS COLOMBIA WHERE THE PRICES ARE WAY BELOW IMPORT PRICES IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR THE COUNTRY TO UH USE FOREIGN RESERVES TO INPUT CLEAN CARE WHERE WE HAVE UH ENOUGH LOCAL CAPACITY UH TO SUPPLY THE THE INDUSTRY LOCAL INTEGRATED PRODUCERS SO IN OUR OPINION THAT IS A CHANGE THAT WILL PREVAIL GOING FORWARD ANDREAS THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU JUAN ESTEBAN THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM FRANCISCO SUAREZ WITH SCOTIA BANK HI THANK YOU FOR THE CALL THIS MORNING UM I HOPE YOU'RE ALL DO WELL AND HEALTHY AND YOU LOVED ONES UH CONGRATS ON THE NICE

QUESTION ABOUT THE U.S U.S AND MARKET I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE TO UH BILL THE QUESTION YEAH FRANSISCO THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION REGARDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE FEEL LIKE WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE VERY WELL POSITIONED TO TAKE ON MORE OF THAT UH OPPORTUNITY AS IT PRESENTS ITSELF UH WE THINK IT'S GONNA BE MUCH BIGGER GOING FORWARD BUT THE THE REALITY IS AS OF NOW IN Q1-19 WE HAD ABOUT 5% NET REPRESENTED ABOUT 5% OF OUR VOLUME AND IN Q1- 2020 IS REPRESENTING ABOUT 8% OF OUR VOLUME SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON THAT SO WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE PRETTY IN A PRETTY GOOD SITUATION AND AND WE DID SEE SOME INCREASED DEMAND THERE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT OKAY THANK YOU UH SO <UNK> GIVEN AND GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES IN IN DEMAND FROM COVID-19 FROM DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS COMPARED TO OTHERS THAT ARE NOT AS DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS BILL THAT THAT ONE IS FOR YOU I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE SEEING INCREASE IN DEMAND FROM THE LARGE METROPOLITAN AND DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS THAN THE MORE RURAL AREAS IN THE U.S RIGHT YES THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT WILL BE A DIFFERENCE UH JUAN I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE MONITORING THAT AS WE GO BECAUSE THE LOCAL AND THE STATE GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW THEY KIND OF MAKE SOME OF THEIR OWN DECISIONS AND WHERE WE ARE HAVE YOU KNOW REVENUE SOME TOOLS AND WE HAVE UH UH THINGS THAT THAT HELP FUND THE HIGHWAY THE GAS TAX AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEREVER WHEREVER THERE'S DIFFERENCES THERE THERE COULD BE DIFFERENCES IN DEMAND AS WELL BUT WE KEEP AN EYE ON THAT BY STATE YEAH THANKS GOT YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH TAKE CARE THANK YOU AND OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM MIKE DECK WITH DATABASE ANALYSIS UM THANK YOU VERY MUCH UM MY QUESTION IS ON ENERGY COSTS PLEASE UM THEY WERE DOWN I THINK IN COLOMBIA 8.8% IN Q1 WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR ENERGY COSTS IN COLOMBIA PLEASE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR UM SECONDLY IN THE U.S WERE THERE ANY SAVINGS IN ENERGY OR DIESEL COSTS OF SIGNIFICANCE IN Q1 AND AGAIN WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR IF YOU COULD AND THEN FINALLY ON YOUR RESET INITIATIVE DOES IT INCLUDE THE BENEFITS OF LOWER ENERGY COSTS EXPECTED THIS YEAR OR WOULD THEY BE ON TOP OF THE RESET INITIATIVE COST SAVINGS THANK YOU THANK YOU MARK MIKE THE REALITY IS THAT IN COLOMBIA UH ENERGY PRICE IS NOT DECREASING IS NOT DECREASING A SIGNIFICANT WAY FROM LAST YEAR FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE ARE SEEING THEM ON THE SAME LEVEL AS WE HAVE THE FIRST QUARTER OF OF THE YEAR IN THE U.S WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT UH SAVINGS IN DIESEL FROM FROM OUR READY MIX UH SIGNIFICANT UM VERY GOOD VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OF THE THE LOWER PART OF OIL SO IN GENERAL WE ARE FORESEEING NOW MUCH BETTER SCENARIO IN TERMS OF ENERGY PRICES IN ALL OF OUR REGIONS SIMILARLY IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN THE ALL OF THE COUNTRIES ARE OIL UM IMPORTERS AND PET COKE SO THE REALITY IS IN TERMS OF ENERGY COSTS I MEAN THEY WILL BE VERY FAVORABLE GOING FORWARD IN ALL OF THE THREE REGIONS IF TOMAS CAMILO OR BILL WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SPECIFICS OF EACH REGION MORE THAN WELCOME JUAN UH FROM MY PART THIS IS TOMAS RESTREPO UM I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD THE IMPACT OF THIS UH ENERGY COST REDUCTION IN ON OUR VARIABLE COSTS IN COLOMBIA ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT TODAY UH OUR VARIABLE COSTS PER TON INCLUDING PLANTS ARTIFICIAL AT CARTAGENA AND OTHERS SEALING WET PROCESS AT YUMBO SO OUR OUR AVERAGE UH VARIABLE COST IN COLOMBIA IS $20 AND IT GOES VERY VERY MUCH LOWER UH YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE CARTAGENA FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT IS THAT IS A A A GREAT EFFECT OF THE OF OF THE THESE PRICES IN COLOMBIA WE ARE USING MOSTLY COAL UH TODAY OUR OUR GAS IS DENOMINATED IN DOLLARS UH SO BUT BUT THERE IS A VERY GOOD AVAILABILITY OF OF COAL UH AT THIS MOMENT AND UH ARE SLIGHTLY TO DIVERSIFY UH OUR FEW MATERIALS WITH THE UH THE ALTERNATIVE FUELS IT IS ALSO ALSO PAYING BACK AS WE ARE USING UH CHEAP TIRES AND UH YOU KNOW BIOMASS AND OTHER DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUELS AND WE'RE SEEING YOU KNOW GOOD OPPORTUNITIES UH TO TO START USING CARBON UH RESIDUES CONVERTING INTO FUELS FOR THE FOR THE FUTURE SO SO WE ARE SEEING A GOOD UH YOU KNOW A GOOD OUTLOOK IN TERMS OF FUELS FOR FOR THIS YEAR IN COLUMBIA THANK YOU TOM JUAN I CAN COMPLEMENT ON UH ON HONDURAS AND PUERTO RICO WE HAVE UH <INAUDIBLE> IMPLEMENTED THE SOLAR UH GENERATION FIELD IN IN HONDURAS WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST OR LOWER <INAUDIBLE> PRICES OF ENERGY TO THE TO THE LOCAL UM ENERGY THAT'S AVAILABLE SO THEY RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT SAVING UM WE'RE ALSO UM INSTALLING OR OR PUTTING IN OPERATION A A SOLID FUEL STORAGE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY UH WE WERE BEFORE WE WERE BUYING UM UM COKE FROM A LOCAL SUPPLIER AND NOW WE'RE ABLE TO BRING IN UH UM OUR SHIPS OF 30 TO 40,000 TONS WHICH UH GIVES IT A VERY GOOD HANDLE ON NEGOTIATING PRICES WE'RE SEEING PRICES REDUCED UH BY 10 10 TO $15 PER TON SO THAT'S GONNA HAVE ALSO A POSITIVE UH IMPACT ON THE COST OF THE OPERATION AND IN PUERTO RICO WE HAD NEGOTIATED UH COAL LAST YEAR WHICH WAS MUCH DIRECTLY WITH THE PRICES THAT WE WE HAD BEFORE BUT WE EXPECT TO TO HAVE OF COURSE BETTER PRICING DUE TO THE UH FIELDS UH ON THE COMMODITY PRICES DECLINE IN THE FUTURE FOR THE OPERATION UH AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT UH UH IMPLEMENTING OR OR LOOKING AT DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR FOR ENERGY IN COUNTRIES WHICH WE STILL HAVE HIGH COSTS SUCH AS HONDURAS AND PUERTO RICO BECAUSE OTHER OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS UH PANAMA AND DOMINICAN REPUBLIC WE HAVE A VERY COMPETITIVE UM CONSTRUCTION NEGOTIATED WITH LOCAL ENERGY SUPPLIERS THANK YOU JUAN THANK YOU MIKE THANK YOU CAMILO JUAN JUST A COMPLIMENT ON WHAT YOU SAID FOR THE US STANDPOINT WITH WITH RESPECT TO DIESEL I MEAN WE HAVE SEEN SOME MOVEMENTS UM AT THE COMPETITION IN OUR READY MIX BUSINESS BUT AGAIN I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE OF THAT AS THE YEAR GOES ON BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE THE WHOLE SITUATION IN GENERAL THANK YOU BILL THANK YOU FOR THAT CAN I JUST THEN FOLLOW UP IF ALL THOSE SAVINGS UH FROM ALL THOSE FUEL SAVINGS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT ARE THEY IN THE RESET NUMBERS OR ARE THEY ON TOP OF THE RESET NUMBERS THEY WILL BE ON TOP OF THE RESET UH NUMBERS OKAY UH THIS WAS ALSO VARIABLE COST AND WE ARE BASICALLY UM ADDRESSING FIXED COSTS AND TOPICS EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND STAY SAFE THANK YOU AND OUR LAST QUESTION IS JUAN <INAUDIBLE> WITH <UNK> PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING THANK YOU AND COULD YOU PROVIDE UH COULD YOU PROVIDE US WITH AN OVERVIEW FOR THE WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE BUSINESS WE SAW AN INCREASE IN IN INVENTORIES AND AND RECEIVABLES SO CAN YOU TELL US HOW THESE THESE ACCOUNTS ARE ARE BEHAVING THANK YOU

OPERATIONS FROM THE FROM THE LAST 10 DAYS OF MARCH THAT WE HAD COLLECTED ABOUT 90 MILLION PESOS MORE THAN 90 MILLION PESOS DURING APRIL NOT NOT SELLING BUT WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE COLLECTING THE RECEIVABLES AND WE ARE AS WELL FORESEEING TO RISE A PLAN IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF THE INVENTORY YOU KNOW ROUGHLY THREE THREE REGIONS AND THAT IS GOING WELL AS WELL UH FOR THAT REASON THE IDEA IS TO HAVE A A REAL EFFECT AND STRICT CONTROL IN THE IN ALL OF THE THREE LINES OF THE WORKING CAPITAL AND WE CONSIDER THAT WE HAVE THE WE HAVE WE HAVE STRUCTURED A VERY GOOD PLANS IN ALL OF THE THREE

The speaker mentions that certain forward-looking statements and information may be included in their reports and presentations, which are based on the knowledge of current facts, expectations, circumstances, and assumptions about future events. Various factors may cause Argo's future results, performance, or accomplishments to differ from those expressed in this hearing. The forward-looking statements are made today, and Argo does not assume any obligations to update said statements in the future as a result of new information, future events, or any other factors. Today, after the initial remarks, there will be a Q&A session. If you have a question, please press the star key on your telephone keypad followed by the number one key at any time during the conference. We will record these questions and upload them in our web page. It is now my pleasure to call the conference over to Mr. Callaghan. Thank you, Indy, and good morning, everyone. Given the current market situation, I would like to start by giving you an update of the status of our operations today. The U.S. region that represented last year thirty nine percent of our shipment volumes and close to fifty five percent of our consolidated EBITDA continues to do so. Operate under regular standards. Market demand behaved normally until recently. When we started to experience a slowdown in the residential segment mainly related to cement dispatches from our Martinsburg plant on the Caribbean in Central America, we are dispatching cement from all of our facilities except Panama, which is still closed by governmental instructions. In most of these countries, we are experiencing a slowdown in the residential segment mainly related to cement dispatches from our Martinsburg plant on the Caribbean in Central America, we are dispatching cement from all of our facilities except Panama, which is still closed by governmental instructions. In most of these countries, we are experiencing a slowdown in the residential segment mainly related to cement dispatches from our Martinsburg plant on the Caribbean in Central America, we are dispatching In these countries, the demand continues to be affected by the COVID-19 crisis, with the exception of Haiti, which exhibits a satisfactory market performance. The Colombian quarantine was lifted on April 13th for infrastructure and on April 27th for the residential and commercial sectors, allowing us to gradually restart our operations ever since. At the end of April, the retail segment had recovered. EXPERIENCE AT RECOVERY OF FIFTY PERCENT ON ITS DAILY VOLUMES THE INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT ON THE OTHER HAND STARTED MUCH SLOWER GIVEN THE HIGHER COMPLEXITY OF RESTARTING ITS OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF THIS CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS WE HAVE STRUCTURED AND LAUNCHED RESET A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN TO OPERATE THE COMPANY DURING THE NEXT MONTHS RESET WHICH STANDS FOR RESTART SAFE HELPING TO BOOST THE ECONOMY, BRING HOPE AND TRANSFORM LIVES IS A PROGRAM THAT REPRESENTS THE COMPANY TO FACE THE PANDEMIC AND THE LATER GRADUAL MARKET RECOVERY. CRISIS TACKLES THREE DIMENSIONS: HEALTH AND SAFETY, LIQUIDITY AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY DIMENSION WAS BUILT ON OUR I PROMISE PROGRAM TO DESIGN AND PUT IN PLACE ALL THE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. Emphasized to protect our employees, clients, surrounding communities, and suppliers to be able to operate under the COVID-19 outbreaks. We are ready to safely restart operations in those facilities that have still closed or are gradually going back to regular production standards while maintaining and improving the current safety protocols in countries such as the US and Haiti where we have not experienced any. HOLD IN PRODUCTION THE LIQUIDITY I MENTION INCLUDES CASH PRESERVATION AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN OPERATIONAL MODEL BUILT WITH A ZERO BASED BUDGET METHODOLOGY FOR THE REST OF TWENTY TWENTY TO IMPROVE OUR CASH POSITION ARGOS DISBURSED AROUND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SHORT TERM CREDIT LINES AND CONSOLIDATED ALL PAYMENTS RELATED DECISIONS FROM ITS LOCAL OPERATIONS TO HAVE A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THIS The dissolved cash position of the company stood at approximately six hundred and fifteen million pesos as of April the thirtieth. An amount significantly higher than the amount we held at this start of the year. Our new cash-based budget captures efficiencies that amount between seventy-five to ninety million dollars on twenty twenty of which eighty-four percent will be obtained from fixed costs and sixteen percent from gna. On top of that, the company has decided to reduce forty million dollars in capex from the current year on projects that are not necessary to operate under the existing market conditions. The initiatives related to operational excellence aim at achieving the optimal mix of assets, products, services, manpower, and logistics to be deployed according to the evolution of demand in our different markets in this context. The migration towards technological tools of the future, such as Argo One, enables our clients, book contractors, and cement and ready-mix despatches through a digital platform. During March, Argo One accounted for seventy percent, forty-one percent, and thirty-three percent of the cement despatches of Colombia, the US, and Panama, respectively. In relation to the dividends announced to the market on our last earning call for four hundred million dollars, we would like to mention that after careful analysis, the transaction had been postponed based on the uncertainty surrounding the short-term impact of COVID nineteen on the worldwide economy but maintaining our commitment to carry them out as soon as the market returns to better conditions. WE ARE AWARE OF THE IMPACT THAT THIS DECISION HAS ON LEVERAGE RATIOS OF THE COMPANY AND IN THAT SENSE WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH OUR RATING AGENCIES OUR LENDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT OUR DECISIONS GIVEN THE STRONG CASH POSITION OF THE COMPANY ITS LEVERAGE INITIATIVES WHICH HAVE BEEN REDUCED ITS SUPPORT FROM OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND THE PASSIONATE COMMITMENT OF OUR MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT ARGOS IS FULLY PREPARED TO FACE THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE BUILDING DREAMS THAT PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFORM LIVES NOW MOVING TO OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY MENTIONING THAT ALL COMPARISONS ON THIS CALL WILL BE MADE ON THE RESULTS INCLUDING I F R S SIXTEEN AS WE NOW HAVE COMPARABLE FIGURES FOR THE PRESENT YEAR PRESENT The changes in Red Cross despatches and appeals are calculated based on the performa numbers of 1999 which exclude the operations from the Red Cross divestures carried out in the US region during 1999 as well as the land appraisals registered in Colombia last year. The Red Cross despatches reached three point six million tons during the first quarter of 2000, decreasing six point one percent when compared to the same quarter of 1999. Seventeen and remixed dispatches reached two point one million cubic meters, posting a ten point seven percent decrease on a like-for-like basis. These results were affected mainly by the lockdown measures in Colombia and some counties of the Caribbean in Central America, and to a lesser extent to the adverse weather conditions experienced in some regions of the US. Revenues closed in two point two trillion pesos with an annual increase. INCREASE OF ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS DRIVEN MAINLY BY THE EVALUATION OF THE COLOMBIAN PESO THE EVIDENCE ON THE OTHER HAND DECREASES ONE PERCENT ON A LIKE FOR LIKE BASIS IN LINE WITH THE DECLINING VOLUMES EXPERIENCED IN BOTH SEGMENTS DURING THE QUARTER AS A RESULT OF THE SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA AND MOST OF OUR MARKETS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN NOW TO START WITH OUR RESULTS IN THIS REGION To explain the performance of the businesses in the U S and our view for the market. Thank you, Wan, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by providing some color on our volume performance. Cement dispatches posted a slight decrease of one point two percent for the quarter with low single-digit growth in our deep south and Florida cement districts of around three percent and one percent respectively. The Nordic reflected positive dynamics too, but... STARTED TO FACE SOME DETERIORATION IN VOLUMES DURING MARCH DUE TO THE HEALTH CRISIS SITUATION MAINLY IN OUR MID EAST MARKETS FOR THE RED INK BUSINESS WE EXPERIENCE A FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT DECREASE ON A LIKE FOR LIKE BASIS WHEN EXCLUDING THE VOLUME FROM THE PLANTS DIVERTED IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THIS DECREASE IS MAINLY DUE TO ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN MAJOR MARKETS DURING THE QUARTER WHEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST QU Georgia, Dallas, and Houston experienced thirteen, ten, and seven less operational days respectively. On prices, based on healthy market dynamics during the first few months of the year, we achieved an improvement in our ready-mix segment of one point eight percent when compared to the same quarter of last year. Cement prices on the other hand stayed on similar levels to the ones observed in the same quarter of last year. These results are aligned. With our strategy to continue improving in terms of profitability always monitoring market conditions which is going to be key during the rest of the year due to the current challenging circumstances for the construction industry and the economy as a whole even though on a like for like basis decreased by six point one percent affected in part by lower readymix volumes but mostly by higher maintenance expenses of eight point one million dollars for our martinsburg and newberry locations. In terms of the market, I'd like to highlight the resilience of the U.S. demand during the first quarter of the year despite the COVID-19 outbreaks presented throughout the country. Even though construction has remained an essential activity in the near future, we envision a slowdown of the residential and commercial segments based on weak readings of some indicators such as unemployment, housing starts, housing permits, and the architectural billings index. On the civil and infrastructure front, we proceed with a short-term impact due to financial constraints at a state and local government level which, based on construction spending readings since mid-2018, were supporting the positive dynamic seen for this segment until February 2020. On the mid-term though, we expect a rebound based on potential stimulus measures from the government related to infrastructure which would positively impact this segment. RECOGNITION OF THE ROLE INFRASTRUCTURE WILL PLAY ON THE RECORD OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND IN THAT SENSE WE EXPECT GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES TO BE DEVELOPED AROUND THAT SECTOR MOVING ON TO COLOMBIA I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT WE ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT THE ROLE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WILL PLAY ON THE RECORD OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND IN THAT SENSE WE EXPECT GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES TO BE DEVELOPED AROUND THAT SECTOR MOVING ON TO ACHIEVEMENTS ACHIEVED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR TOGETHER WITH THE EFFICIENCIES AND ENERGY CAPTURED IN THE SECOND HALF OF LAST YEAR WHICH LED TO AN INCREASING EVIDENCE OF MARGIN EVEN IN A SCENARIO OF LOWER VOLUMES AS A RESULT OF THE QUARANTINE TOM WILL NOW PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLOR ON THIS REGION THANK YOU JOHN AND GOOD MORNING DURING THE QUARTER WE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTING OUR STRATEGY TO RECOVER VALUE WHICH LED TO Nearly 13.5% versus the same quarter of last year with a temporary loss of volume. Volumes were also affected by the quarantine decreed in Colombia from March 25th on, which cost a reduction equivalent to 8% of the business working day in the first quarter. Through the quarantine, we were able to continue these patches to some essential infrastructure projects such as tunnels de la linea, irrigation, and a few mining projects. Well, are some exports from our Carthage plant. Cement and building nuclei spares decreased thirteen point nine percent and nineteen point five percent respectively on a yearly basis. In line with the price improvement, our revenue posted a fifteen percent growth during the quarter, resulting also from lower maintenance expenses as well as from our continued efforts to renegotiate supply contracts from key materials such as coal which led to a decrease in the quarter. I would also like to emphasize on the easy digestibility of eighty eight percent versus the same period of twenty nineteen. I would also like to emphasize on the easy digestibility of eighty eight percent versus the same period of twenty nineteen.

Moving on to the Panama and Honduras, despite the fact that our two biggest operations were closed during the last week of the quarter due to the coronavirus crisis, Camilo will provide more information on the performance. Thank you Juan and good morning everyone. The first quarter of twenty twenty was positive in terms of market dynamics for countries like Honduras and Dominican Republic during January, February and mid-March. From the second week of March on, we had several affectations in demand in both countries due to the lockdowns declared by local governments. These lockdowns have been partially lifted to the date of this call on April. We saw volumes in Honduras and Dominican Republic of around forty percent. 1 PERCENT OF A REGULAR MONTH PANAMA CONTINUED TO HAVE CHALLENGING MARKET DYNAMICS DURING THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE YEAR THAT WORSTED ON MARCH WITH COVID IMPACT ON THE DEMAND AND THE LATER QUARANTINE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT WE EXPECT THE LOCK DOWN MEASURE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR TO BE LIFTED BEFORE MID MAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH PUBLIC STATEMENTS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT AND IN THAT SENSE A REOPENING FROM OUR FACILITY The trend of improving prices in seven point one percent and volumes in eleven point one percent versus the first quarter of twenty nineteen overall we experienced increases in both the average daily and average daily margin when compared to the fourth quarter of twenty nineteen of five point nine percent and one point two percent respectively unfortunately these results were still lower than the first quarter of twenty nineteen in part due to the quarantine measures but mostly due to the overall market conditions. In Panama and the fact that prices in Honduras continue to be lower than the average price of twenty nineteen as a result cement volumes decreased four point one percent and ready mix volumes decreased thirty four point one percent when compared to the first quarter of twenty nineteen these lower volumes led to a decrease of sixteen point nine percent in the revenues and thirty three point five percent on EBITDA during this quarter we continued to work on obtaining further efficiencies on our operations Energetics on our local operations. In Onduras, for instance, we inaugurated a solid fuel storage in the north of the country that will allow us to receive bigger amounts of fuel and therefore improve the purchase price. We also supplied during the first quarter of the year eleven point six percent of the energy from our Piedras Azules plant with the solar farm operated by Celsius with lower costs together with environmental benefits. This initiative lowered the CO2 emissions from our energy supply in around. 1500 TONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY REINFORCING OUR COMMITMENT TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY WE BELIEVE THAT THE SECOND TRIMESTER OF THIS YEAR WILL CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGING FOR THE REGIONAL BUT MAINTAIN OUR CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM ON THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR DUE TO THE FACT THAT ECONOMIES SUCH AS PANAMA HONDURAS AND PUERTO RICO TOOK EARLY ACTIONS ON LOCKDOWNS AND QUARANTINE MEASURES AND IN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE EFFORT OF THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT THE LOCAL ECONOMY BY IMPOSING A THIRTY PERCENT TARIFF TO THE IMPORTS OF CEMENT TO THE COUNTRY WHICH WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPETITIVE SCENARIO OF THE COUNTRY WE EXPECT SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO BE IMPLEMENTED FROM OTHER GOVERNMENTS IN THE CARIBBEAN AND SOUTH AMERICAN REGION I WOULD LIKE TO REFER NOW TO OUR BALANCE SHEET WE CLOSED THE F In the year 2919, this result was driven by the fact that our dollar-denominated edita was proportionally higher than our dollar-denominated debt, improving our leverage ratio in a scenario of similar indebtedness and edita. Regarding the commitment that we had previously made on the leveraged buyout company and reducing our net debt to edita ratio, I want to assure you that even though the current market conditions won't allow us to do that. AS SOON AS WE WERE EXPECTING WE CONTINUED FOCUS ON OBTAINING THAT RESULT IN THE MIDTERM THIS TEMPORARY CRISIS HAS BOOSTED OUR CREATIVITY OUR INNOVATION AND OUR SAVINGS INITIATIVES AND HAS REINFORCED THE COMMITMENT OF OUR PEOPLE TO ADAPT ADAPTIVE TO THE NEW MARKET CONDITIONS WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED ON OUR LAST EARNINGS CALL TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE UNPRECEDENTED MARKET CONDITIONS Verbal Communication:\n\n\"We are currently going through.

We have more than a quarter of parties interested in the project. We decided to wait a little longer until we have more clarity on the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy. I am fully committed to executing our diversified plan to bring the company to the levels we want. Okay, thank you very much. Our next question is from Paul Shapiro with On Field Investments. Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. I hope that you are all safe. First of all, I would like to clarify a couple of points. I think you mentioned a target of production of CAPEX of 40 million this year. I just would like to understand, is it 40 million less than last year or 40 million less than the guidance that you had given in February? And the second point I would like to clarify is on pricing in Colombia. I think you mentioned an increase in EBITDA. OH HI THIRTY POINT YES OH COULD YOU SPEAK LATER WE'RE LIVING VERY WELL AROUND HERE THANK YOU SO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF POINTS THE FIRST POINT I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY IS ON THE CAPEX YOU MENTIONED REDUCTION OF FORTY MILLION OF CAPEX IN TWENTY TWO IS IT FORTY MILLION OF CAPEX IN TWENTY TWO IS IT FORTY MILLION OF CAPEX IN TWENTY TWO IS IT FORTY MILLION OF CAPEX IN TWENTY TW Less than last year or is it forty million less than the guidance that you gave in February and the second point is on the pricing and in colombia i think you mentioned an increase of thirteen point five percent of prices in Kuwait but you're mentioning fob prices i would like to understand is it your own selling prices or are we talking about import prices? Thank you for your question. I mean, the catechism is the revelation of the forty million dollars. It is the respect of our guidance. Not to last year, it's forty million dollars less. Our guidance is the beginning of the year. I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're trying to say. Could you please rephrase your question or provide more context? The second part of the question was about the pricing in Colombia. You mentioned an increase of thirty percent of Fob prices in Colombia. But just would like to understand whether we are talking about import prices or your own selling prices. I apologize, but I am unable to transcribe the given text as it appears to be a random collection of words and phrases that do not form a coherent sentence or question. Can you please provide me with a specific question or statement that I can assist you with? The gap between the Colombian peso and the U.S. dollar has widened. The reality is that we continue to see all the opportunities to forward the strategy of plastic recycling in Colombia. Nowadays, in terms of U.S. dollars, the plastic industry in Colombia has a value of around $8 billion. The reality is that on average, the Colombian plastic industry has a value of around $8 billion.

Thank you. Agencies and the banks. And in the realities that we've been funding, we've been increasing awareness of the local governments to incentivize the protection of the environment, the protection of employment in the local markets.

We have about three hundred and thirty million dollars of maturities for the rest of the year 2020. So far we have rolled over about a hundred and fifteen million dollars with different tenors up to three years. ROLL OVER A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE LOSS OF THE OTHER FACILITIES THAT WE HAD TO ROLL OVER IN THE CONFERENCE AND REALLY WE WERE IN PERMANENT CONTACT WITH THE DIFFERENT BANKS AND REALLY THE SUPPORT HAS BEEN GREAT OF ALL OF OURS IN THIS THE SECOND PART OF THE QUOTE Question about the waiver we are starting the conversations with the creditors on the creditors because we we are requesting a waiver for the for some next quarters and really this is this is not just a not very well this is not a very general situation In the market right now, the good news is that we remember that in the presentation that really we were in a very big trend in the new decade of the 2000s. We ended March with very close to four times the new decade of the 2000s. Obviously, because of these prices, we are expecting to increase this level of operation and operation ratio. But we are very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very Mischievous about the negotiation with our creditors. That's very clear. Thank you both very much and keep well. Okay. Thank you, Graham. Thank you. Our next question is from Abigail Whelan with Jake Morgan. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had one question on the cost savings. If you can just provide us with more information. COMMENTS ON ON WHERE ARE THESE FIXED COSTS THAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO CUT TO COME FROM AND AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION THAT I HAD WAS IF YOU CAN JUST TELL US WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PRICE INCREASES THAT YOU HAD PLANNED IN THE US FOR APRIL AND AND WHICH PRICE INCREASES YOU HAVE EXECUTED ALREADY AND AND WHICH ONES YOU'RE PLANNING TO DO FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR GOOD MORNING AIDAN AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS I MEAN THE REALITY IS THAT WE HAVE BECOME REALLY GOOD AT OPTIMIZING OUR OPERATIONS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WE HAVE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING FROM COVID NINETY NINE IN OUR OPERATIONS AND WE SEE THE NEED TO CONTINUE ACCELERATING THE OPTIMIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS SAVINGS WILL COME FROM SAVINGS IN NAMES AND SERVICES AND S G N A T TOTALING CLOSE TO BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE ARE FULLY CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT TARGET FOR THE MARTYRS THAT WE ARE FORESEEING GOING FORWARD THOSE SAVINGS WILL COME FROM THE U S AND FROM CENTRAL AMERICA CUBA AND NICARAGUA The speaker is discussing the price scenario in the United States. The speaker mentions that they would like to provide more color about what they have seen in the market. The speaker then asks the listener if they are aware of the price increase in April. The speaker concludes by saying that they had some good success in a couple of markets, mainly in Florida and Dallas. Unfortunately given the situation rolling into the spring we pushed out the increase that was going to be a strong move in April and we're monitoring the situation the best we can to kind of see you know what's happening we're going down with what's happening with the virus and the impact but right now we're looking at something in the late second quarter maybe to push another price increase Thank you.

So, in April, we have the first half of the month was pretty much at full stop. Only you know, a few dispatches for infrastructure projects that were you know, able to continue operating. But by the end of the month, we were already there. REACHING THE THE FORTY PERCENT OF OUR DAILY DISPATCHES SO APRIL APRIL TURNS OUT BETTER THAN WE THOUGHT BASICALLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE QUITE AS MUCH VOLUME AS WE AS WE EXPECTED DURING THE CORONAVIRUS IN THE MONTH OF MAY WE ARE SEEING OUR VOLUMES AROUND THE FIFTY PERCENT OF WHAT THEY USED TO BE IT COULD BE A LITTLE MORE MORE COLOR ABOUT IT WE'RE WE'RE SEEING SURPRISINGLY A GREAT DEAL OF ACTIVITY YOU KNOW COMPARED TO WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING IN THE RETAIL BUSINESS WHICH HAS YOU KNOW BECOME SO FAR THE MAJORITY YOU KNOW THAN EVEN THE INDUSTRIAL DISPATCHES WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW SO AS AS OF MAY THE ELEVENTH When you know that despatches in Bogotá and many other cities and all retail stores around the country should become available and online, we are seeing volumes growing as I said to a little bit more than half of what we were despatching in the previous months. And now, Bill, could you provide us some color about the volumes and the dollars in April, which we are currently lacking? Please, sir, may I ask you a question? Thank you, sir, and thank you for the question. Actually, April was much stronger than we anticipated. I think initially there were some forecasts where it may have weakening demand towards the latter half, but we were pleasantly pleased that our volumes ended very strong. As for May, so far this month, we're seeing another sign of optimism in the least. For the first week our volumes are tracking pretty close to plan and we do see in the future that there's going to be some level of slowdown in the residential segment. I think probably to begin with and then maybe the commercial backlog as it works off it could slow. But at this point it's kind of hard to predict when that might occur because here at this point we thought we may see some slowdown already but we have not. The impact that we've seen is the impact that we've seen. Sorry, I cannot transcribe the audio as there is no verbal communication provided. Can you please provide me with the verbal communication and transcribe it into text? We were able to dispatch around 50% of our budget during the 15 days of opening in April. Panama, as we said, is still closed, and we have zero disbursements, but we have the news that the economy will reopen next week, starting with construction of one of the sectors that reopens. So that's a positive little bit of news. Haiti is at a hundred percent of its budget and has had no disbursements. IMPORTANT FOR THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND THE LAND IS STILL STRONG FOR DOMINICAN REPUBLIC WE DID ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF OUR NORMAL DISPATCHES AND THIS WAS MAINLY DUE TO DISPATCHES TO PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING INVENTORY OR WERE BUILDING OTHER SMALL CONSTRUCTIONS SO THAT'S POSITIVE ALSO FOR DISPATCHES TO PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING INVENTORY OR WERE BUILDING OTHER SMALL CONSTRUCTIONS SO THAT'S POSITIVE ALSO FOR DISPATCHES TO PEOPLE THAT W FOR THE COUNTRY PUERTO RICO WHO HAS WELL HAS HAD A VERY LONG SHUTDOWN BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME REOPENED THE SOME AREAS FOR EXAMPLE SMALL HARDWARE STORES WITH INITIAL DISPATCHES TWO DAYS A WEEK AND THAT ALONG WITH EXPORTS REPRESENTED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE BUDGET SO IT WAS ALSO POSITIVE THAT PUERTO RICO I will reopen the construction sector also starting next week the unions which had also closures in most of the islands the budget was around forty percent as well and then we have suriname with eighteen twenty-five percent of the budget so just a fifteen percent increase french guiana was at a hundred and five percent of the budget so even though that there were measures taken by the government we did not see a decrease I'm sorry, I need more information to transcribe the audio into text. Can you please provide me with the speaker's name and the context of the conversation? 25 to 90 million dollars would it be proportionate all across the us columbia and the caribbean? yes, we are expecting the highest savings in columbia followed by the us and then by the cia alexander. thank you very much. our next question comes from roberto panerai with corriere della sera. thank you. ROBERTO: I'm sorry, we can listen to you. Can you speak louder, please? RECOGNIZE VERBAL COMMUNICATION AND TRANSCRIBE IT INTO TEXT The entrance of a new competitor and the last one the project's destination in Colombia. Thank you. Thank you, Robert, for your report. Our company's presence in Colombia is five percent. We continue deploying with a lot of success our strategy of leading. Price Recovery in the Market We May Have Lost a Very Slight Market Share in Colombia. It Was Growing in Excess of Seven Percent a Month Through the End of February and We Were Very Pleased with the Success of Our Study of Price Recovery. We have to wait until we have more difficulty in the second quarter, but we are very pleased with our market position in Colombia.

They mention that the incidence is currently four times higher than it should be, and they are considering a number of potential interventions to address this issue. They also mention that they are interested in learning more about the syndrome and potential interventions to lower its incidence. NOW THROUGH THE IDEA OF INFINITY THE IDEA LIKE WE ARE MENTIONED OBVIOUSLY THE PREDICTIBILITY OF THE DATA OF THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE THIRD QUARTER OBVIOUSLY RIGHT NOW IS VERY COMPLEX FOR THAT REASON WE ARE TAKING ALL THESE MEASURES LIKE THE CAPEX THE CAPEX CUT AND THE COST SAVINGS AND A LOT OF OTHER MEASURES IN TERMS OF LIQUIDITY YOU ASK AS WELL WHAT ARE WE WHAT OUR CURRENT POSITION IN RECRUITING IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILLION THRILL The scenario we are with is with about three hundred million pesos really, in a very difficult scenario. But it's very important to highlight what gonzalez, tomas, bill, and camacho has mentioned that comparing the current scenario to the reality, april was by far better than our initial scenario. Aunt May is going better by far as well. For that reason, we are expecting that we are ending up in a better position in terms of liquidity. And we will monitor the cash position of the company week by week, depending on how things will play out. I am confident, as Carlos is saying, that we will be able to end the quarter with a very good cash position. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Rodrigo Sanchez with Vivendi Corredores. Yes, good morning. Thank you for the presentation. I also have three questions. In addition to the funds raised, what rate was secured? April and Carlos comment on expected liquidity levels. Are you expecting further increases throughout the rest of the year? Also, could you please mention the amount you still have available to secure grade lines? My second question is, I understand that the shares you own in Groupusaurus are used as collateral for the grade lines you have in place. Will you be reluctant to sell them or at least part of it if you do? DID YOU NEED IT TO DO SO THANK YOU FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION RODERIGO WE ARE WE ARE HIGH LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY WE ARE DEDICATED TO MORALE ANOTHER EXTRA FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT NOW They operate as an insurance of liquidity, really, because really, now, we don't need this extra liquidity. But really, we prefer to have this extra liquidity in our hands. We are investing this extra amount. This is not contemplated in the key that we were mentioning. And with this new key, we are investing this extra amount. This is not contemplated in the key that we were mentioning. And with this new key, we are investing this extra amount. This is not contemplated in the key that we were mentioning. And with this new key, we are investing this extra amount. This is not contemplated in the key that we were mentioning. And with this new key, we are investing this extra amount. This is not contemplated in the key that we were mentioning.

Could you comment a little bit more on what you expect coming forward in terms of market share or what are you seeing from from the market as a whole with the price increase that you made in the first quarter. Thank you very much. Columbia was behaving in a very good way until the first half of March with the increase in the demand of last year close to five hundred thousand tons plus the seven percent increase in demand through February. The realization that the competitive bank schedules were a positive meant that nobody was really competing on prices due to the huge gap in prices that existed. IMPORTANCY PRICES AND THE INTENTION OF EVERYBODY TO REWARD THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE CAPITAL OF THE ASSETS THAT THEY HAVE IN COLOMBIA I WOULD EXPECT THAT SCENARIO TO CONTINUE IN THE SAME WAY GOING FORWARD ONCE THEY MUST START TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE REACTION OF THE MARKET IN APRIL AND MAY WAS EXTREMELY PLEASING WITH THE REACTION OF THE MARKET IN APRIL AND MAY WAS EXTREMELY PLEASING WITH THE REACTION OF THE MARKET IN APRIL AND MAY WAS EXTREMELY PLE AND IN OUR OPINION, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION HAS STRENGTH IN THIS REAL START OF THE ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR CLIENTS AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE PROVIDE TO THEM. IN OUR OPINION, WE HAVE A SUPERIOR VALUE PROPOSITION FOR THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR OF THE MARKET AND WE ARE THE ONLY SEMICONDUCTOR PLAYER IN COLOMBIA WHO ACCESS DIRECTLY A wider range of hardwood flooring is available in the conscious mind, and gum is digested to more than five hundred hardwood stokes. So, in our opinion, our valuable possession will be an important asset for us going forward. We don't foresee any varied continual prices, no matter what scenario of demand plays out going forward. It's just to be significant gap in prices. I want to add that during this quarter we gained market share in the industrial business where we suffered the most by the end of last year, particularly in the renewable mix business. So we are as strong as we've always been in that industrial part of the market. Market share has been mostly focused on the retail business. That's where we have been recovering prices faster. We have gone as usual faster than our competitors in that market. And I think it's pretty much a very good move to have done it before this crisis because otherwise, you know, our competitors will be as well. I WAS SAYING FORCED OR OR INCENTIVIZED BIAS YOU KNOW TO TO RECOVER A VALUE WELL FOR THEIR FOR FOR THEIR COMPANY'S IN A A YOU KNOW A MORE STRESSFUL MARKET SO WE ARE WE ARE POISED YOU KNOW TO TO RECOVER THE MARKET SHARE WIH A HHEALTHIER PRICES YOU KNOW AS WE ARE SEEING TODAY AND AND GREATER PRICES YOU KNOW AS WE ARE SEEING TODAY AND GREATER PRICES YOU KNOW AS WE ARE SEEING TODAY AND GREATER PRICES Y I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? Thank you very much for the presentation. I have two questions. My first question is regarding the distribution of your cash cows. What proportion would you say is fixed and what proportion would you say is variable? And then my second question is regarding the competitive dynamics in Onduras. You mentioned the presentation that you had at price decreases. So I would like to have a little bit more detail on that front. Thank you, Stephen, for your question. The spread of our bovine and fixed cost is more or less fifty-fifty. In terms of Honduras, the reality is that we started to see a dynamic in the market in 2020, January and February were very good months. DEMAND SOMETHINGS WERE GOING WAY BETTER IN HONDURAS AND WITH THE RECORD OF THE MARKET THAT CAMILO MENTIONED IN APRIL YOU STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH VISIBILITY AND WE NEED MORE WEEKS TO REALLY KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO BE LIKE THE NORMAL DEMAND IN HONDURAS AGAIN BUT UP TO NOW WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE DYNAMICS IF THE MARKET CONTINUES RECORDING WE FORESEE AS In which we can start prize-recorded strategies in honduras similar to the one that we are executing in colombia. I don't know, if you would like to add some, some color to my answer. BENEFITS AS WELL IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRIZE IN THE MARKET AND AGAIN STARTING ON DECEMBER FOLLOWING DUE TO THE MIDDLE OF MARCH WE HAD A VERY STRONG DEMAND IN THE COUNTRY WHICH WHICH I THINK IS VERY POSITIVE YOU WILL SEE HOW THE RECOVERY GOES AND WHAT PROGRAMS DO THE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENT TO SORT OF RECOVER THE ECONOMY BUT BUT DEFINITELY CONSTRUCTION SECTOR FOR A COUNTRY LIKE CONGO IS A CRITICAL SECTOR TO START AND TO SECURE AS PART OF THE JOBS FOR THE COUNTRY. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM ANDREA SOTOLO WITH SANTA LUCIA. GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. I FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING. In your comments about a significant decline of cement and cementitious imports in Colombia this year and also the potential tariffs that were implemented in Panama, potentially need to be implemented in Honduras as well. So, I would like to understand how much imports represent from each of those markets. I mean, how much imports represent from each of those markets. I mean, how much imports represent from each of those markets. I mean, how much imports represent from each of those markets. I mean, how much imports represent from each of those markets. I mean, how much imports represent from each of those markets. I mean, how much imports represent from each of those markets. I mean, how much imports represent from each of those markets. I mean, how much imports represent from each of those markets. I mean, how much FOR PANAMA AND HONDURAS WILL BE VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANDREAS. IMPORTS INTO PANAMA MAINLY CLINKER LAST YEAR CLOSE TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS IMPORTS INTO HONDURAS AND PANAMA CLOSE TO EIGHT PERCENT OF THE MARKET IN EACH OF THOSE MARKETS PANAMA CEMENT AND HONDURAS AS WELL ONLY ON THE CEMENT IN OUR OPINION THERE IS A TREND IN OUR COUNTRY TOWARDS YOU KNOW SUPPORTING LOCAL INDUSTRIES JUST TO PROTECT EMPLOYMENT AND ESPECIALLY IN PLACES SUCH AS COLOMBIA WHERE THE PRICES ARE WELL LOWER THAN IMPORTED PRIZES IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THE COUNTRY TO USE IMPORTED RESERVES TO IMPORT PARTIALLY IMPORTED PRIZES I'm sorry, I need more information to accurately transcribe the verbal communication. Can you please provide me with the audio file or a transcript of the conversation? Hi, thank you for the call. Good morning. I hope you're doing well in Hialeah and you're as well as your loved ones. Congrats on the nice performance on margins in Colombia despite the huge drop in volumes. That tells you a little bit about what you're doing. Congrats on that. The questions that I have out on the United States first, what does it take commercially to be ready to be better positioned to sell more? Concrete and reinforced concrete infrastructure project. And secondly, do you think that the overall performance in densely populated regions in the United States might be affected more compared to other regions within the United States? Thank you so much. Thank you, Paco. Thank you for your questions. I am also very pleased with the performance of our business in Colombia. It is to give you an idea of our margins per ton in January, and they are in excess of thirty dollars per ton of erita. The reality is that once they start picking up, we are very confident that the profitability of our operations in Colombia will continue to improve in a significant way to answer your questions. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? In our team, we have about five percent that represented about five percent of our volume. And in Q1 2020, it's representing about eight percent of our volume. So you know, we've been focusing on that. So we feel like we're pretty in a pretty good situation when we do see some increased demand there to be able to take advantage of it. A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN DEMAND FROM COVID NINETEEN FROM DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS COMPARED TO OTHERS THAT ARE NOT AS DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS RECOGNIZE VERBAL COMMUNICATION AND TRANSCRIBE IT INTO TEXT HELP FUND THE HIGHWAY THE GAS TAX THINGS LIKE THAT WHEREVER WHEREVER THERE'S DIFFERENCES THERE THERE COULD BE DIFFERENCES IN DEMAND AS WELL BUT WE KEEP AN EYE ON THAT BY STATE PERFECT GOT IT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK Y Please, they were down, I think, in Colombia, a point eight percent in Q1. What is the outlook for energy costs in Colombia, please, for the rest of the year? Secondly, in the US, were there any savings in energy or diesel costs of significance in Q1? And again, what's the outlook for the rest of the year, if you could? And then finally, on your reset initiative, does it include the benefit of lower energy costs expected this year, or would they? MAYBE ON TOP OF THE RESET INITIATIVE COST SAVINGS THANK YOU THANK YOU MIKE MY REALITY IS THAT IN COLOMBIA ENERGY PRICES HAVE DECREASED IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY FROM LAST YEAR FOR THE REMAINING OF THE YEAR WE ARE SEEING THEM ON THE SAME LEVEL AS WE HAVE BEEN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR IN THE US WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS IN EFFICIENCY FROM The speaker is discussing the energy industry in the United States. They mention that energy prices have decreased in recent years, making it more affordable for consumers. The speaker also notes that the energy industry is constantly evolving and new technologies are being developed to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs. Additionally, the speaker mentions that the energy industry is an important contributor to the U.S. economy and plays a significant role in the country's overall energy production. There will be some very favorable going forward in all of the of the three regions. If you'll pardon me, sir, I'd like to be a little bit more on the specifics of it. It's extreme and more than welcome. One, for my part, this is Colombia. I would just like to add that the impact of these energy cost reductions on a valuable cost in colombia are... VERY SIGNIFICANT AS OF TODAY ARE OUR VALUABLE COSTS PER TON INCLUDING PLANTS ASSETS AT CATARINA AND ORDERS FILLING WET PRODUCTS AT JUMBO SO OUR AVERAGE VALUABLE COST IN COLOMBIA IS TWENTY DOLLARS AND IT GOES VERY VERY MUCH LOWER YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF CATARINA FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT IS THAT IS A GREAT EFFECT OF OF THESE PRICES IN COLOMBIA IS VERY VERY MUCH LOWER YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF CATARINA FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT IS THAT IS A GRE COLOMBIA WE ARE USING MOSTLY COAL TODAY AS A GAS IS NOMINATED IN DOLLARS SO BUT THERE IS A VERY GOOD AVAILABILITY OF COAL AT THIS MOMENT AND OUR STRATEGY TO DIVERSIFY OUR MATERIALS WITH ALTERNATIVE FUELS IS ALSO PAYING BACK AS WE ARE USING CHEAP TIRES AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS YOU KNOW BIOMASS AND OTHER DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUELS AND WE'RE SEEING YOU KNOW GOOD OPPORTUNITIES TO TO START USING URBAN RESIDUES CONVERTING INTO FUELS FOR THE FOR THE FUTURE. SO SO WE ARE SEEING A BIT AH, YOU KNOW, A BIT OF AN OUTLOOK IN TERMS OF FUELS FOR THIS YEAR IN COLOMBIA. ON HONDURAS AND PUERTO RICO: WE HAVE, OF COURSE, DEMONSTRATED THE SOLAR GENERATION FIELD IN HONDURAS WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY. IT HAS A LOWER COST OR LOWER PRICE IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY. WE HAVE ALSO INSTALLED OR ARE PUTTING IN OPERATION SOLAR PANELS IN PUERTO RICO, WHICH HAS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS. A solid field storage in the northern part of the country. We were before we were buying petco from a local supplier and now we are able to bring in ships of about thirty to forty thousand tons which gives us a very good head start on negotiating prices. We are seeing prices reduced by ten to fifteen percent. dollars per ton, so that's going to have also a positive impact on the cost of the operation. and in porto rico, we had negotiated a coal last year, which was much better than the prices that we had before, but we expect to to have of course better pricing due to be fields or the community prices decline in the future for the operation and we're also looking at implementing or are our Looking at different solutions for energy in countries where we still have high costs such as Venezuela and Puerto Rico. There are other countries such as Panama and the Nicaraguan Republic that have very competitive constructs negotiated with local energy suppliers. Thank you. MAN 1: Movement at the pump, especially in our rating business, but again, I think you're correct. You feel like we're going to see more of that as the year goes on, just because of what's happening with the situation in general.\n\nMAN 2: Thank you for that. Can I just then follow up? Are those savings from all those fuel savings you've been talking about? Are they in the reset numbers or are they on top of the reset numbers? They will be on top of the rigid numbers. Those are the savings variable cost and rigid. We are basically addressing a fixed cost and tactics. Excellent. Thank you very much. And stay safe. Hi, good morning. Thank you.

CAPABILITIES TODAY AND TO SUPPORT THE PURSUIT OF NEW TREATMENTS AND VACCINES FOR THE FUTURE AS WE COLLECTIVELY STRIVE TO CONTAIN THIS NOW NO- NOVEL VIRUS DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PROVIDES ESSENTIAL INFORMATION TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ULTIMATELY CURB THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 IDT WAS AN EARLY LEADER IN THIS EFFORT AS THEIR PRIMER AND PROBE KITS PROVIDE A KEY DETECTION COMPONENT IN COVID-19 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS TO DATE IDT HAS SHIPPED KITS TO ENABLE MORE THAN 30 MILLION DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR THE VIRUS IN MARCH CEPHEID LAUNCHED THE FIRST RAPID MOLECULAR TEST RELATED TO COVID-19 THAT PROVIDES HIGHLY ACCURATE RESULTS WITHIN 45 MINUTES WITH A LEADING GLOBAL INSTALL BASE OF MORE THAN 23,000 MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING 5,000 IN THE US CEPHEID'S TESTS ARE BEING DEPLOYED ON THE FRONT LINES TO TEST PATIENTS AND PROTECT HEALTHCARE WORKERS SINCE CEPHEID'S TEST BECAME AVAILABLE THE TEAM HAS SHIPPED APPROXIMATELY 2 MILLION TEST CARTRIDGES AND GOING FORWARD WE NOW EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO SHIP APPROXIMATELY SIX MILLION TESTS PER QUARTER GREATLY EXCEEDING OUR INITIAL EXPECTATIONS RECENTLY PUBLISHED INDEPENDENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT CEPHEID'S TEST PERFORMANCE IS BEST IN CLASS VERSUS OTHER POINT OF CARE PLATFORMS ON THE MARKET TODAY PROVIDING SUPERIOR VIRUS DETECTION WITH ONE OF THE FASTEST TIME TO RESULTS THE MARKET LEADING CALIBER OF CEPHEID'S TEST COMBINED WITH THEIR SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION RAMP UP IS A TESTAMENT TO THIS INNOVATIVE TEAM'S COMMITMENT TO TACKLE THIS GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS HEAD-ON AT BECKMAN COULTER DIAGNOSTICS THE TEAM ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS DEVELOPING ASSAYS TO IDENTIFY ANTIBODIES TO THE VIRUS WE EXPECT THESE ANTIBODY ASSAYS WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN UNDERSTANDING IMMUNITY AND IN TURN IMPROVING THE WORLD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE COVID-19 GOING FORWARD BECKMAN WILL BE LAUNCHING ONE OF THESE ASSAYS SHORTLY A HIGH SENSITIVITY AUTOMATED IGG SEROLOGY TEST THE TEAM PLANS TO RAMP PRODUCTION CAPABILITY TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION TESTS IN MAY AND OVER 30 MILLION TESTS PER MONTH BY THE END OF JUNE THIS ASSAY WILL BE ABLE TO RUN ON BECKMAN'S GLOBAL INSTALL BASE OF MORE THAN 16,000 IMMUNOASSAY ANALYZERS AS WE LOOK AHEAD TOWARD POTENTIAL NEW THERAPEUTICS AND VACCINES FOR COVID-19 PALL AND CYTIVA ARE SUPPORTING BIOTECH RESEARCHERS AND MANUFACTURERS AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO FIND A CURE PALL'S FILTRATION SOLUTIONS ARE DESIGNED INTO THE BIOPRODUCTION PROCESS OF MULTIPLE LEADING VACCINE CANDIDATES AND CYTIVA IS SUPPORTING NUMEROUS VACCINE PROGRAMS IN DEVELOPMENT PROVIDING SPECIFIC PROTOTYPE AFFINITY RESINS AND HELPING THEM PREPARE TO SCALE UP PRODUCTION VOLUMES THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'RE HELPING TO ACCELERATE OUR CUSTOMER'S IMPORTANT PURSUIT OF COVID-19 TESTING TREATMENT PREVENTION AND ULTIMATELY A CURE SPEAKING OF CYTIVA I WANNA TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO OFFICIALLY WELCOME THE TEAM TO DANAHER WE'RE THRILLED TO HAVE THEM ON BOARD WITH THE ADDITION OF CYTIVA WE'VE DOUBLED OUR ANNUAL REVENUE IN THE HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL END MARKET TO MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR LIFE SCIENCE PLATFORM'S ANNUAL REVENUE WITH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE OFFERING ACROSS THE ENTIRE BIOPRODUCTION WORKFLOW WE'RE BETTER ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS WHO ARE WORKING TO DELIVER MORE LIFE-SAVING DRUGS FASTER AND AT A LOWER COST AN IMPORTANT ENDEAVOR THAT'S CERTAINLY ACCENTUATED BY TODAY'S GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS CYTIVA IS OFF TO A GREAT START HERE IN 2020 AND ACHIEVED APPROXIMATELY 10% REVENUE GROWTH IN ITS FIRST QUARTER GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ACQUISITION TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS WE WILL INCLUDE CYTIVA'S PERFORMANCE AS PART OF OUR OVERALL CORE GROWTH REVENUE METRIC BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER SO NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FIRST QUARTER RESULTS SALES GREW 3% TO $4.3 BILLION DRIVEN BY FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT CORE REVENUE GROWTH THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION DECREASED REVENUES BY ONE AND A HALF PERCENT GEOGRAPHICALLY HIGH SINGLE DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH IN THE DEVELOPED MARKETS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGH SINGLE DIGIT DECLINES IN HIGH GROWTH MARKETS REVENUE IN CHINA WAS DOWN MORE THAN 25% AS A RESULT OF EXTENSIVE SHUTDOWNS RELATED TO COVID-19 WHILE JANUARY AND FEBRUARY WERE SOLID ACROSS NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE WE SAW A DOWNTURN IN DEMAND TOWARD THE END OF THE QUARTER WHEN THE PANDEMIC BECAME MORE SEVERE ACROSS THESE REGIONS GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE FIRST QUARTER WAS 56.2% AND OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN WAS 16.1% ADJUSTED DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WERE $1.05 WE GENERATED $694 MILLION OF FREE CASHFLOW A 21% INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR HELPING TO SUPPORT OUR STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION NOW WE'LL TAKE A MORE DETAILED LOOK AT THE RESULTS ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO LIFE SCIENCE REPORTED REVENUE INCREASED ONE AND A HALF PERCENT WITH CORE REVENUE GROWTH OF TWO AND A HALF PERCENT LED BY HIGH SINGLE DIGIT OR BETTER CORE REVENUE GROWTH AT PALL IDT AND BECKMAN LIFE SCIENCES THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO DEVELOP COVID-19 RELATED TESTING AND TREATMENT DROVE DEMAND FOR OUR BIOPROCESSING GENOMIC AND AUTOMATION SOLUTIONS THAT STRONG PERFORMANCE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN OUR MORE INSTRUMENT-ORIENTED BUSINESSES LEICA MICROSYSTEMS AND SCIEX WHICH WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DEFERRALS OF LARGE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT PURCHASES THIS DYNAMIC WAS PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN ACADEMIC RESEARCH AS MOST OF THESE LABS AROUND THE WORLD REMAINED CLOSED DUE TO COVID-19 RELATED SHUTDOWNS MOVING TO DIAGNOSTICS REPORTED REVENUE WAS UP SIX PERCENT WITH EIGHT PERCENT CORE REVENUE GROWTH LED BY VERY STRONG RESULTS IN OUR POINT OF CARE BUSINESSES CEPHEID AND RADIOMETER CEPHEID ACHIEVED MORE THAN 40% CORE REVENUE GROWTH WITH BROAD-BASED STRENGTH ACROSS ALL MAJOR PRODUCT LINES AND GEOGRAPHIES PARTICULAR STRENGTHS IN CEPHEID'S FLU ASSAY WAS DRIVEN BY THE COMBINATION OF A MORE SEVERE FLU SEASON AND INCREASED TESTING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK WE ALSO SAW EARLY STRONG DEMAND FOR CEPHEID'S COVID-19 TEST WHICH RECEIVED USFDA EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION AT THE END OF MARCH OUR RADIOMETER BUSINESS ACHIEVED HIGH TEENS CORE REVENUE GROWTH SURGES IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS BEING TREATED TREATED FOR COVID-19 DROVE DEMAND FOR RADIOMETER'S BLOOD GAS INSTRUMENTS AND TESTS A KEY PARAMETER TO MONITOR IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH THE LARGEST GLOBAL INSTALL BASE OF BLOOD GAS INSTRUMENTS RADIOMETER'S WELL-POSITIONED TO SUPPORT CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS THROUGH THIS UNPRECEDENTED HEALTHCARE CHALLENGE AND BEYOND BECKMAN COULTER DIAGNOSTICS CORE REVENUE DECREASED MID SINGLE DIGITS SOLID PERFORMANCE IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE WAS OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN CHINA AS A RESULT OF THE EXTENSIVE SHUTDOWNS INITIATED IN JANUARY THESE CONTAINMENT MEASURES RESULTED IN VERY FEW PATIENTS GOING TO HOSPITALS FOR TREATMENTS OR PROCEDURES THAT WERE NOT COVID NOT RELATED TO COVID-19 WHICH GREATLY REDUCED CORE LABORATORY TESTING VOLUMES MOVING TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND APPLIED SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REPORTED REVENUE INCREASED ONE PERCENT WITH TWO AND A HALF PERCENT CORE REVENUE GROWTH IN OUR WATER QUALITY PLATFORM MID SINGLE DIGIT CORE REVENUE GROWTH WAS LED BY DOUBLE DIGIT CORE REVENUE GROWTH AT CHEMTREAT OUR WATER BUSINESSES PROVIDE ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS USED TO TEST AND TREAT WATER AROUND THE WORLD A MISSION CRITICAL SERVICE IN ANY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT GOOD DEMAND FOR OUR CONSUMABLES AND CHEMISTRIES CONTINUED WHILE EQUIPMENT SALES DECLINED TOWARD THE END OF THE QUARTER AS THE BROADER MACRO UNCERTAINTY PROMPTED MANY CUSTOMERS AND MUNICIPALITIES TO POSTPONE LARGER EXPENDITURES CORE REVENUE AT OUR PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION PLATFORM WAS DOWN LOW SINGLE DIGITS WITH GROWTH IN MARKING AND CODING OFFSET BY DECLINES IN OUR PACKAGING SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES AT VIDEOJET EQUIPMENT SALES WERE DOWN BUT WE SAW A STRONG DEMAND FOR CONSUMABLES ACROSS CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS MEDICAL AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE END MARKETS AS WIDESPREAD SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS DROVE A SURGE IN CONSUMER PURCHASES SO THE FIRST QUARTER WAS CHALLENGING ON MANY FRONTS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMBINATION OF OUR OUTSTANDING TEAMS DBS DRIVEN EXECUTION AND DIFFERENTIATED PORTFOLIO ENABLED DANAHER TO OUTPERFORM ON A RELATIVE BASIS SO MOVING ON TO WHAT WE SAW IN APRIL THE TRENDS ACROSS OUR END MARKETS THROUGH THE MONTH WERE LARGELY A CONTINUATION OF THE DYNAMICS THAT BEGAN TO TAKE HOLD DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF MARCH WE CONTINUED TO SEE A BIFURCATION ACROSS OUR LIFE SCIENCE END MARKETS COVID-19 RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST 60 DAYS AMONG OUR PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECH CUSTOMERS PARTICULARLY IN AREAS LIKE ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND IMMUNE RESPONSE RESEARCH AND TESTING IN TURN THIS GENERATED STRONG DEMAND FOR OUR BIOPROCESSING GENOMIC AND AUTOMATION SOLUTIONS GOOD MOMENTUM ALSO CONTINUED FOR OTHER NON COVID-19 RELATED BIOPROCESSING DRIVING DEMAND FOR FILTRATION CHROMATOGRAPHY SINGLE USE AND CELL AND GENE THERAPY PRODUCTS HOWEVER MOST ACADEMIC RESEARCH LABS IN THE US AND EUROPE REMAINED CLOSED AND LABS IN CHINA HAVE ONLY RECENTLY STARTED TO REOPEN THESE CLOSURES HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INSTALLATION DELAYS FOR EXISTING INSTRUMENT ORDERS AND IT APPEARS THAT CUSTOMERS ARE HOLDING OFF ON NEW CAPITAL PURCHASES UNTIL THE LABS REOPEN AND THEY FULLY RETURN TO WORK LOOKING ACROSS CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS WE CONTINUED TO SEE VERY STRONG DEMAND THROUGH APRIL FOR MOLECULAR POINT OF CARE AND ACUTE CARE TESTING WHICH IS ALSO DRIVING INCREASED INSTRUMENT PLACEMENTS GLOBALLY THIS CONTRASTED WITH LOWER ACTIVITY IN HOSPITAL LABS AND REFERENCE LABS WHERE THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN ELECTIVE PROCEDURES EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS AND WELLNESS CHECKS CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT TESTING VOLUMES WE ALSO SAW DELAYED ORDERS AND DEFERRED NEW SPENDING ON LARGER CAPITAL EQUIPMENT IN THESE LABS IN THE APPLIED MARKETS THE DIVERGENCE OF DEMAND BETWEEN CONSUMABLES AND EQUIPMENT PERSISTED THROUGH APRIL CONSUMABLES REMAIN SOLID AS CUSTOMERS SUSTAINED ESSENTIAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS LIKE TESTING AND TREATING WATER AND SAFETY PACKAGING CONSUMER PRODUCT GOODS AND MEDICINE BUT EQUIPMENT PURCHASES ARE BEING DELAYED AS MISSION CRITICAL OPERATING EXPENSES ARE PRIORITIZED OVER LARGER CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THE CADENCE OF THESE END MARKET DYNAMICS APPEARS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS WITH THE NEGATIVE IMPACT IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE TRAILING THAT OF CHINA CHINA GRADUALLY IMPROVED IN APRIL AS LOCKDOWNS WERE LIFTED AND BUSINESSES STARTED TO REOPEN AND REVENUE GROWTH WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN INITIAL EXPECTATIONS HEADING INTO THE QUARTER IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE WE BELIEVE THAT THE CLIENTS ARE BEGINNING TO STABILIZE AND EXPECT MODEST SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AS THESE REGIONS BEGIN TO GRADUALLY REOPEN IN LIGHT OF THESE RECENT TRENDS WE EXPECT SECOND QUARTER CORE REVENUE GROWTH INCLUDING CYTIVA TO BE IN THE RANGE OF FLAT TO DOWN 10% SO TO WRAP UP AS I REFLECT ON THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS I AM HUMBLE BY OUR TEAM'S DEDICATION AN INNOVATIVE RESPONSE TO THIS UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS TRUE TO OUR CORE VALUES OUR ASSOCIATES ARE LISTENING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND INNOVATING TO HELP ADDRESS THEIR TOUGHEST CHALLENGES NEVER BEFORE HAVE THESE CHALLENGES BEEN MORE COLLECTIVELY URGENT AND ABUNDANT AND I'M SO PROUD OF HOW OUR ASSOCIATES HAVE RISEN TO THE OCCASION LOOKING AHEAD WE FEEL VERY WELL POSITIONED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMBINATION OF OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO EXCEPTIONAL TEAM DBS-DRIVEN EXECUTION WILL CONTINUE TO DIFFERENTIATE DANAHER IN 2020 AND BEYOND NOW BEFORE WE GO TO Q&A I WANNA ADDRESS THE PRESS RELEASE THAT WENT OUT LAST NIGHT REGARDING OUR UPCOMING CEO TRANSITION AFTER MORE THAN 30 YEARS AT DANAHER INCLUDING THE LAST SIX AS CEO I'VE DECIDED TO BEGIN THE TRANSITION TO RETIREMENT I DO THIS KNOWING THAT DANAHER HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER THE COMBINATION OF OUR PORTFOLIO ENHANCED EXECUTION AROUND INNOVATION AND OUR SEASONED LEADERSHIP TEAM DRIVEN BY THE DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM CREATE A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR CONTINUED OUTPERFORMANCE I HAVE LOVED EVERY DAY OF THE PAST THREE DECADES AND THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE DANAHER CAREER I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO BE PART OF AN INCREDIBLE TEAM I'VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES OF MY CURRENT ROLE TO BE FOCUSED ON DEPLOYING CAPITAL EFFICIENCY ENHANCING THE PORTFOLIO DRIVING INNOVATION AND DEVELOPING TALENT AND I CAN NOW LOOK BACK FONDLY ON THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON ALL THESE FRONTS I PLAN TO SEE THE CORPORATION THROUGH THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT OUR PORTFOLIO AND THE TEAM ARE BOTH IN A FANTASTIC POSITION TO THRIVE IN THE YEARS TO COME MANY OF YOU KNOW RAINER BLAIR WELL FROM HIS DAYS AS PRESIDENT OF SCIEX AND MORE RECENTLY AS OUR EVP LEADING THE EVOLUTION OF OUR LIFE SCIENCE PLATFORM ENHANCING THE PLATFORM'S GROWTH AND MARGIN PROFILE WHILE LEADING THE ACQUISITIONS OF PALL IDT AND CYTIVA TO NAME JUST A FEW THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT RAINER IS THE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD US INTO THE FUTURE WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM AND OUR BOARD I'M CONFIDENT THAT RAINER IS WELL PREPARED TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND CONTINUE CREATING SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS SO WHAT'S NEXT FOR ME WELL FIRST OFF THAT QUESTION IS ONE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS FROM NOW BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SPENDING MORE TIME WITH MY FAMILY AND I'LL CONTINUE TO SERVE ON THE BOARDS OF MEDSTAR HEALTH AND THE COLLEGE OF THE HOLY CROSS I'LL REMAIN IN THE CEO ROLE THROUGH SEPTEMBER 1ST OF THIS YEAR AND I'LL BE AROUND INTO 2021 IN AN ADVISORY ROLE BUT FOR NOW AND AS SOON AS WE'VE FINISHED THIS CALL WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK TO WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT TO DO IN THE COMING MONTHS WITH THAT I'LL TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO MATT SO WE CAN START TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS THANKS TOM THAT CONCLUDES OUR FORMAL COMMENTS CHRISTELLE WE'RE NOW READY FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE OUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF DEREK DE BRUIN WITH BANK OF AMERICA UM HI GOOD MORNING ALL RIGHT DEREK HEY UM SO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS UM AND THEN UH I'LL I'LL CONGRATULATE YOU ON ON THE RETIREMENT I'M JEALOUS BY THE WAY <LAUGH> UH UH UM SO TO START OFF SO CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU'RE EMBEDDING INTO THE GUIDE IN THE 2Q FOR UM COVID RELATED CONTRIBUTIONS I MEAN YOU'RE PRODUCING A LOT OF CEPHEID TESTS YOU KNOW THE SEROLOGIES RAMPING UM I GUESS ARE ALL THOSE TESTS GOING TO BE USED ARE THEY ALL SPOKEN FOR I'M JUST CURIOUS IN TERMS OF RIGIDITY ABOUT UTILIZATION AND SORT OF WHAT'S EMBEDDED INTO THE THE THE GUIDE THANKS SURE OKAY THANKS THANKS DEREK UH HAPPY TO UM WALK YOU THROUGH THAT A BIT SO IF LET'S GO RIGHT TO THE TO THE COVID IMPACT IN Q2 AND AND I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT AS UM LARGELY A TAILWIND THAT PROBABLY REPRESENTS YOU KNOW 500 BASIS POINTS OF UH OF OF OF IMPROVEMENT OR GROWTH THAT'S ASSOCIATED PREDOMINANTLY WITH CEPHEID RADIOMETER AND IDT AND IN TERMS OF THE RELATED QUESTION ABOUT WHAT'S SPOKEN FOR UM YOU KNOW CEPHEID WERE WERE FLAT OUT AT AT CEPHEID UM WE ARE WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY UM BUT EVERY TEST THAT WE PRODUCE EVERY SINGLE DAY UH GETS SHIPPED AND THE DEMAND IS CONTINUING TO BUILD UM RADIOMETER ALSO RUNNING FLAT OUT UM NOT QUITE THE NEED FOR EXPANDED CAPACITY WE HAD THE SURGE CAPACITY WE NEEDED THERE BUT THEY'RE DOING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL UM AND IDT HOLDING ITS OWN AS WELL SO I THINK OVERALL YOU'D CONSIDER CEPHEID RADIOMETER AND IDT CERTAINLY UM CON- CONTRIBUTORS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE UM WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IS THAT THE REST OF THE PORTFOLIO IS YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY DOWN ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO 15% AND THOSE HEAVIER HEADWINDS ARE GONNA COME IN BUSINESSES LIKE LIKE BECKMAN DIAGNOSTICS LEICA BIOSYSTEM A BIT THAT ARE MORE PATIENT VOLUME DEPENDENT AND WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHETHER THAT PATIENT VOLUME YOU KNOW COMING FROM LOOSENING UP OF ELECTRIC PROCEDURES STARTS TO RETURN BUT CERTAINLY THE GREATER BIT OF HEADWIND IS IN THE EQUIPMENT ORIENTED BUSINESS LIKE LMS AND SCIEX AND A AND A BIT OF PID NO DOUBT SO NOW PUTTING ALL THAT TOGETHER YOU THEN PARTIALLY OFFSET THAT WITH WITH PROBABLY A BIT OF POSITIVE FROM PALL AND CYTIVA THAT ARE SHOWING POSITIVE GROWTH THAT'S NOT EXCLUSIVELY COVID RELATED BUT CERTAINLY UH RELATED TO THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AROUND THERAPIES AND VACCINES SO I THINK THAT'S THE WAY I'D I'D SORT OF GENERALLY FRAME UP THE UH THE PLUSES AND THE MINUSES AROUND THE COVID IMPACT IN IN Q2 <CROSSTALK> AND THAT'S MATT HEY DEREK IT'S MATT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE ALSO UM YOU'VE KIND OF UH WE MENTIONED SEROLOGY WE ARE NOT ASSUMING ANYTHING HERE IN THE QUARTER FOR SEROLOGY EVEN THOUGH WE'RE RAMPING UP WITH BECKMAN AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME CAPACITY HERE OUR VIEW IS THAT IT'S JUST A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO REALLY KIND OF TELL YOU KNOW WHAT THE VOLUMES MIGHT LOOK LIKE WHAT UH A NATIONAL TESTING PROGRAM OR ANY OTHER KIND OF LOCAL TESTING PROGRAMS MIGHT LOOK LIKE SO THAT THAT COVID TAILWIND DOES NOT INCLUDE SEROLOGY JUST TO BE CLEAR OH GREAT THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL AND I GUESS JUST ONE QUESTION ON CYTIVA UM AND AND IN GENERAL DID YOU SEE ANY STOCKING IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT ARE YOU ASSUMING FOR ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IN THE CYTIVA STANDALONE BUSINESS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER UM DEREK WE SAW UH YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO TELL WHEN IT'S UH YOU KNOW UH UH ON THE MARGINS UM AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS THERE WAS STOCKING GOING ON THERE UM YOU KNOW GENERALLY WE DON'T DON'T THINK IT WAS PARTICULARLY MATERIAL BUT I TELL YOU CYTIVA IS OFF TO A GREAT START AS I MENTIONED A 10% 10% CORE GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER REALLY STRONG MOMENTUM IN THE CORE BIO-PROCESSING UH BUSINESS AND AND AND THAT'S REALLY DRIVEN BY FOLKS WORKING ON SOLUTIONS TO TO COVID-19 UM AND BUT YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK FORWARD I THINK WE WE WE HAVE REALLY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE <UNK> JUST CLOSED THE THE THE UH THE END OF MARCH 1ST OF APRIL UM WE'RE JUST GETTING IN THERE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT FUNNEL LOOKS LIKE AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S PLENTY OF UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT UM HOW MUCH THAT VOLUME WILL BUILD OVER TIME DEPENDING ON THE THE PRO- PROGRESSION OF THERAPIES AND VACCINES SO I THINK WE'VE GOT AN OUTSTANDING START HERE BUT UM YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF W- WHERE WE ARE FROM A GUIDE PERSPECTIVE ON CYTIVA WE'RE WE'RE STILL TRYING TO SIZE UP WHAT THAT BACKLOG IS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE UM OBVIOUSLY WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN FACE TO FACE WITH THE TEAM YET FROM AN OPERATING REVIEW STANDPOINT GIVEN THE UH THE THE LIMITATIONS WE HERE HAVE HERE ON TRAVEL SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON OBVIOUSLY A GOOD DEAL OF REBRANDING WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO UM WE'RE GONNA STAND IT UP AS A STANDALONE OPERATING COMPANY EXECUTE ON THE TSA AND EXIT THOSE TSA UH WORK STREAMS AND COSTS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE EMBEDDING DBS INTO THOSE INTO THE BUSINESS AND AND WORKING ON OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCE SO WE'LL WE'LL COME WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU AND GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT CYTIVA LOOKS LIKE UH IN THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR ONCE WE GET A LITTLE BIT MORE STABILITY HERE IN TERMS OF UH HOW THE HOW THE BOOKINGS TRENDS LOOK AND UH UH WE ROUND THE CORNER HERE COMING INTO THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR GREAT THANK YOU THANKS DEREK YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF TYCHO PETERSON WITH JP MORGAN GOOD MORNING TYCHO OKAY THANKS GOOD MORNING UH TOM I'LL START WITH THE CONGRATS ON THE TRANSITION IT I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO HEAR FROM YOU WHY WHY NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME I KNOW YOU YOU PLAN THESE THINGS OUT WELL IN ADVANCE BUT YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE WERE CAUGHT A LITTLE BIT OFF GUARD IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC AFTER CLOSING YOUR LARGEST DEALS SO COULD YOU MAYBE JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW LONG THIS TRANSITION HAD BEEN PLANNED AND WHY NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME SURE ABSOLUTELY TYCHO I'D BE HAPPY TO UM YOU KNOW I I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT YOU YOU HAD TO YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO UM MY VERY FIRST YEAR UH IN THE ROLE WHERE UH WE UH ALONG WITH THE BOARD MADE SURE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TALENT DEVELOPMENT ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE ARE UM PROGRESSING IN VARIOUS WAYS THROUGH OUR LEADERSHIP RANKS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND AND AND HAD AN OUTSTANDING CHOICE IN RAINER BLAIR UM TO SUCCEED ME SO THIS HAS VERY MUCH BEEN UM THE CULMINATION OF A SUCCESSION PLANNING PROCESS THAT REALLY HAS GONE ON OVER THE LAST UH OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS UM WE WE ALWAYS WANTED TO TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHEN WE'RE IN A IN A POSITION OF STRENGTH AND I THINK THE COMBINATION OF WHERE WE ARE WITH THE PORTFOLIO AND OUR PERFORMANCE WHERE WE ARE AROUND DRIVING INNOVATION AND GROWTH AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR TEAM AND TALENT REALLY IS WHAT I I THINK MAKES US VERY COMFORTABLE THAT THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY A GOOD TIME UM TO TURN THE REINS OVER IT WAS SUPER IMPORTANT THAT WE GOT CYTIVA CLOSED AND UM AND THAT WE GAVE OURSELVES TIME TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSITION HERE UM OF THE ROLE UM ALLOWS FOR BOTH RAINER AND I TO TO UH CONTRIBUTE TO ENSURING THAT CYTIVA COMES INTO THE ORGANIZATION UM SMOOTHLY SO UM I THINK IT'S REALLY A COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE THINGS UM YOU KNOW I THINK THE THE THE THE DANAHER BOARD WAS UH INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE AROUND THIS ALL ALONG I AM UH I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT ABOUT RAINER AND UM THE THE TALENT AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT HE BRINGS TO THIS ROLE AND UH HE'S JUST GONNA DO A FANTASTIC JOB SO UM WE UH WE ALL FEEL GREAT ABOUT IT OKAY THANKS AND THEN FOR THE FOLLOWUP JUST A QUESTION ON UH ON SOME OF THE LONGER TERM UH COVID RELATED UH TAILWINDS YOU KNOW FOR CEPHEID THERE ARE PRESUMABLY BE LESS RULE IN RULE OUT YOU KNOW FLU TESTING UH TIED TO COVID GOING FORWARD SO I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND THEN HOW YOU THINK ABOUT DURABILITY OF THAT TEST ONCE UH THERE IS A VACCINE ON THE MARKET FOR BECKMAN CURIOUS IF YOU CAN PUT ANYTHING AROUND PRICING UH FOR SEROLOGY AND THEN LASTLY FOR CYTIVA AND PALL JUST CURIOUS HOW MEANINGFUL YOU THINK VACCINE AND THERAPY DEVELOPMENT COULD BE FOR THOSE BUSINESSES YOU KNOW ON A MULTI-YEAR BASIS THANKS SURE THANKS TYCHO UM YOU KNOW THERE'S UH WE'VE GOT A LOT GOING ON AS IT UH AS IT RELATES TO THE THE FUTURE UM IMPACTS OF COVID AND I THINK IN MANY RESPECTS WE'RE PRETTY UNIQUELY POSITIONED BOTH ON THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM UM I THINK IF YOU START WITH FROM A DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PERSPECTIVE UM CEPHEID'S IMPACT ALONG WITH IDT RADIOMETER IN TERMS OF TREATMENT ON THE FRONT LINE UM AS WELL AS BECKMAN IN IN SEROLOGY AND IG- IGG TESTING I THINK THAT THAT'S A PRETTY UNIQUE COMBINATION OF CAPABILITIES NOW YOU ASKED ABOUT THE DURABILITY OF THE CEPHEID TEST I THINK UM YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW WELL WE ARE ONE OF THE WORLD LEADERS IN FLU TESTING AND I THINK AS WE SEE THE FUTURE HERE YOU'RE GONNA YOU'RE GONNA LOOK CLINICIANS ARE GONNA BE LOOK-LOOKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY IN DOING FLU TESTING TO ALSO BE DOING COVID-19 TESTING AND I THINK THE ABILITY TO RUN THOSE TESTS ON THE SAME PLATFORM IN THE SAME CARTRIDGE <INAUDIBLE> SAME CARTRIDGE CONFIGURATION UM IS A REAL ADVANTAGE AND A REAL OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE UH FOR CEPHEID OF COURSE THIS THIS SURGE IN DEMAND NOW IS HAPPENING WE'RE SEEING THAT NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THE TEST CARTRIDGES THEMSELVES BUT IT'S DRIVING UM A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR INSTALL BASE AND SO IN THAT INSTALL BASE HAS GROWN YOU'RE ALSO GONNA SEE THAT INSTALL BASE DRIVING NOT ONLY COVID-19 TESTING BUT JUST CONTINUING TO SUPPORT EXPANDED FLU TESTING AND MARKET SHARE GAINS FOR CEPHEID OVER TIME AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A BROADER SUITE OF TESTS THAT RUN ON THE CEPHEID ARCHITECTURE AND SO THAT'S GONNA BENEFIT AS WELL SO WE THINK THERE'S EXCEPTIONAL DURABILITY UM TO UH TO THE THE CEPHEID ARCHITECTURE IN AN ENVIRONMENT EVEN IN ONE WHERE WE HAVE AND AND GOD WILLING WE WILL HAVE BOTH THERAPIES AS WELL AS UH AS WELL AS VACCINES UM IN TERMS OF YOUR YOUR QUESTION ABOUT BECKMAN AND SEROLOGY YOU KNOW I THINK THE WE THE WAY WE SEE SEROLOGY EVOLVING OVER TIME IS YOU'RE IT'S GONNA BE PRIMARILY DRIVEN OBVIOUSLY WITH THE BLOOD DRAW AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE SEROLOGY TEST THE IGG TESTS INTEGRATED INTO MORE ROUTINE TESTING AND THEREFORE UM THE COST PER TEST IS GONNA BE QUITE REASONABLE UM AND IT'S GONNA BE IN LINE WITH OTHER IMMUNOASSAY TESTS AND UH SO WE TALK ABOUT THE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE 30 MILLION TESTS AS I THINK MATT SAID EARLIER I WOULDN'T BUILD THAT INTO ANY MODELS BUT I THINK IT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FACT THAT UM SEROLOGY TESTING THAT IGG TEST IS GONNA BECOME MORE OF A STANDARD UM IN BASIC TESTING WHEN IT COMES TO UH IMMUNOASSAY SO I THINK A LOT OF A LOT OF TERRIFIC POTENTIAL THERE PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO ADVANCES IN UH IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND POPULATION UH TESTING UM AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY BY PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES UM TO LOOK FOR HOTSPOTS OVER TIME UM IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT CYTIVA AND UM AND AND AND WORK AROUND UH THERAPIES AND VAC- VACCINES I'D SAY BOTH PALL AND CYTIVA ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW PRETTY CRITICAL INPUTS MEANING FILTRATION AND RESINS TO BOTH VACCINE AND THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATES UM RIGHT NOW WE WOULD ESTIMATE THAT THEY'RE GREATER THAN 150 THERAPEUTIC AND VACCINE CANDIDATES TODAY UM AND PALL AND CYTIVA ARE WORKING WITH A MAJORITY OF THOSE IN SOME CAPACITY AND UH SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'LL BE THERE'LL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS BUT WE THINK WE HAVE A A NUMBER OF OF EXCEPTIONAL POSITIONS THERE WITH UH WITH FOLKS THAT ARE LIKELY GONNA BE PART OF THE FUTURE THERAPY UM AND OR UM VACCINE UH ANSWERS SO I THINK A GOOD GOOD SPOT TO BE IN GREAT I APPRECIATE IT AND CONGRATS AGAIN ON THE RETIREMENT THANKS TYCHO YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF VIJAY KUMAR WITH EVERCORE

THANKS MATT AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'D LIKE TO START OFF TODAY BY RECOGNIZING OUR ASSOCIATES AROUND THE WORLD FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME THEIR RESPONSE TO THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS BEEN HUMBLING AND INSPIRING THEY'RE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE OUR FACILITIES ARE UP AND RUNNING SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THEIR ESSENTIAL WORK OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE ALSO BEEN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE AS THIS CRISIS HAS ENFOLD ITS EVERY ONE OF OUR ASSOCIATES CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE TODAY AND IM INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR THEIR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS GIVEN HOW TOP OF MIND THE IMPACT OF THE VIRUS IS WE THOUGHT WE WOULD STRUCTURE THE CALL A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THIS QUARTER BE I'll highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight COVID-19. I'll provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of April and I'll wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming CEO transition at Danaher. We are incredibly fortunate to navigate these turbulent times. POSITION OF STRENGTH WITH A RESILIENT PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES AND AN EXTREMELY TALENTED TEAM AND THE DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM AS OUR DRIVING FORCE THESE RECENT EVENTS HAVE CERTAINLY PRESENTED A NUMBER OF UNFORESEEN CHALLENGES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES BUT THEY HAVE ALSO CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY IN THE UNPRECEDENTED FIGHT AGAINST COVID NINETEEN WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT FRONT LINE HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC TESTING CAPABILITIES TODAY AND TO SUPPORT THE PURSUIT OF NEW TREATMENTS AND VACCINES FOR THE FUTURE AS WE COLLECTIVELY STRIVE TO CONTAIN THIS NOVEL VIRUS DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PROVIDES ESSENTIAL INFORMATION TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ULTIMATELY CURB THE SPREAD OF COVID NINETEEN I D T WAS AN EARLY LEADER IN THIS EFFORT AS THEIR PRIMER AND PROBE KITS PROVIDE A KEY DETECTION COMPONENT IN COVID NINETEEN DIAGNOSTIC TESTS TO DATE I D T HAS SHIPPED KITS TO ENABLE MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR THE VIRUS IN MARCH SEPHIZ LAUNCHED THE FIRST RAPID MOLECULAR TEST RELATED TO COVID NINETEEN THAT PROVIDES HIGHLY ACCURATE RESULTS WITHIN FORTY FIVE MINUTES WITH A LEADING GLOBAL INSTALLED BASE OF MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTS Including five thousand in the US, Sefid's tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect healthcare workers. Since Sefid's tests became available, the team has shipped approximately two million test cartridges and going forward we now expect to be able to ship approximately six million tests per quarter greatly exceeding our initial expectations recently published. Independent Studies Indicate That Sephids Test Performance Is Best In Class Versus Other Point Of Care Platforms On The Market Today Providing Superior Virus Detection With One Of The Fastest Time To Results The Market Leading Calibre Of Sephids Test Combined With Their Significant Production Ramp Up Is A Testament To This Innovative Team's Commitment To Tackle This Global Health Crisis Head On At Beckman Coulter. Diagnostics the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus we expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity and in turn improving the world's ability to manage covid nineteen going forward beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly a high sensitivity automated i g g serology test the team plans to ramp production capability to more than two million TESTS IN MAY AND OVER THIRTY MILLION TESTS PER MONTH BY THE END OF JUNE THIS ASSAYE WILL BE ABLE TO RUN ON BECKMAN'S GLOBAL INSTALLED BASE OF MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND IMMUNOASSAY ANALYZERS AS WE LOOK AHEAD TOWARD POTENTIAL NEW THERAPEUTICS AND VACCINES FOR COVID NINETEEN PAUL AND SITIVA ARE SUPPORTING BIOTECH RESEARCHERS AND MANUFACTURERS AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO FIND A CURE Filltration solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates and Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development, providing specific prototype affinity resins and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes. These are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate our customers' important pursuit of COVID-19 testing, treatment, prevention, and ultimately a cure. Speaking of Sitiva, I want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher. We're thrilled to have them on board. With the addition of Sitiva, we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end market to more than five billion dollars, which represents approximately fifty percent of our life science platform's annual revenue. With a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow. WE'RE BETTER ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS WHO ARE WORKING TO DELIVER MORE LIFE-SAVING DRUGS FASTER AND AT A LOWER COST AN IMPORTANT INVESTIGATE THAT'S CERTAINLY ACCENTUATED BY TODAY'S GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS SITIVA IS OFF TO A GREAT START HERE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND ACHIEVED APPROXIMATELY TEN PERCENT REVENUE GROWTH IN ITS FIRST QUARTER GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ACQUISITION TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS WE WILL OVERALL CORE GROWTH REVENUE METRIC BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER SO NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FIRST QUARTER RESULTS SALES GREW THREE PERCENT TO FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS DRIVEN BY FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT CORE REVENUE GROWTH THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION DECREASED REVENUES BY ONE AND A HALF PERCENT GEOGRAPHICALLY HIGH SINGLE DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH IN THE DEVELOPED MARKETS WAS PART BY HIGH SINGLE DIGIT DECLINES IN HIGH GROWTH MARKETS REVENUE IN CHINA WAS DOWN MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AS A RESULT OF EXTENSIVE SHUTDOWNS RELATED TO COVID NINETEEN WHILE JANUARY AND FEBRUARY WERE SOLID ACROSS NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE WE SAW A DOWN TURN IN DEMAND TOWARD THE END OF THE QUARTER WHEN THE PANDEMIC BECAME MORE SEVERE ACROSS THESE REGIONS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE FIRST QUARTER WAS FIFTY Operating profit margin was sixteen point one percent. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were one dollar and five cents. We generated six hundred and ninety four million dollars of free cash flow. A twenty one percent increase year over year, helping to support our strong financial position. Now we'll take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. Life science, reported revenue increased. ONE AND A HALF PERCENT WITH CORE REVENUE GROWTH OF TWO AND A HALF PERCENT LED BY HIGH SINGLE DIGIT OR BETTER CORE REVENUE GROWTH AT PAUL IDT AND BECKMAN LIFE SCIENCES THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO DEVELOP COVID NINETEEN RELATED TESTING AND TREATMENTS DROVE DEMAND FOR OUR BIOPROCESSING GENOMIC AND AUTOMATION SOLUTIONS THAT STRONG PERFORMANCE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN OUR MORE INSTRUMENT ORIENTED BUSINESSES LIKE A MAGIC Micro systems and syss which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases this dynamic was particularly acute in academic research as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to covid nineteen related shutdowns moving to diagnostics reported revenue was up six percent with eight percent core revenue growth led by very strong results at our point of care business syss Sephadex and radiometer. Sephadex achieved more than forty percent core revenue growth with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Particular strength in Sephadex's flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak. We also saw early strong demand for Sephadex's COVID-19 test, which received U.S. FDA emergency use authorization. RADIOMETER BUSINESS ACHIEVED HIGH TEENS CORE REVENUE GROWTH SURGES IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS BEING TRADED TREATED FOR COVID NINETEEN DROVE DEMAND FOR RADIOMETERS BLOOD GAS INSTRUMENTS AND TESTS A KEY PARAMETER TO MONITOR IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH THE LARGEST GLOBAL INSTALLED BASE OF BLOOD GAS INSTRUMENTS RADIOMETERS WELL POSITIONED TO SUPPORT CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS THROUGH THIS UNPRECEDENTED HEALTH CHALLENGE AND BEYOND FEKMANN KOHLTER DIAGNOSTICS CORE REVENUE DECREASED MID SINGLE DIGITS SOLID PERFORMANCE IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE WAS OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN CHINA AS A RESULT OF THE EXTENSIVE SHUTDOWNS INITIATED IN JANUARY THESE CONTAINMENT MEASURES RESULTED IN VERY FEW PATIENTS GOING TO HOSPITALS FOR TREATMENTS OR PROCEDURES THAT WERE NOT COVID RELATED WHICH GREATLY REDUCED CORE LABORATORY TESTING VOLUMES MOVING TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND APPLIED SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REPORTED REVENUE INCREASED ONE PERCENT WITH TWO AND A HALF PERCENT CORE REVENUE GROWTH IN OUR WATER QUALITY PLATFORM MID SINGLE DIGIT CORE REVENUE GROWTH WAS LED BY DOUBLE DIGIT CORE REVENUE GROWTH AT KEMP TREE OUR WATER BUSINESSES PROVIDE ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS USED TO TEST AND TREAT WATER AROUND THE WORLD A MISSION ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT Good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued while equipment sales declined towards the end of the quarter as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures CORE REVENUE AT OUR PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION PLATFORM WAS DOWN LOW SINGLE DIGITS with growth in marking and coding offset by declines in our packaging solutions businesses AT VIDEOJET Equipment sales were down, but we saw strong demand for consumables across consumer package goods, medical, and food and beverage end markets as wide-spread shelter-in-place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases. So the first quarter was challenging on many fronts, but we believe that the combination of our outstanding team's dbs-driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on DEVELOPED BASIS MOVING ON TO WHAT WE SAW IN APRIL THE TRENDS ACROSS OUR END MARKETS THROUGH THE MONTH WERE LARGELY A CONTINUATION OF THE DYNAMICS THAT BEGAN TO TAKE HOLD DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF MARCH WE CONTINUED TO SEE A BIPHARCATION ACROSS OUR LIFE SCIENCE END MARKETS COVID NINETEEN RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST SIXTY DAYS AMONG OUR PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIO TECH C PARTICULARLY IN AREAS LIKE ANTI VIRAL THERAPIES VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND IMMUNE RESPONSE RESEARCH AND TESTING IN TURN THIS GENERATED STRONG DEMAND FOR OUR BIO PROCESSING GENOMIC AND AUTOMATION SOLUTIONS GOOD MOMENTUM ALSO CONTINUED FOR OTHER NON COVID NINETEEN RELATED BIO PROCESSING DRIVING DEMAND FOR FILTRATION CHROMATOGRAPHY SINGLE USE AND SELL IN GENE THERAPY PRODUCTS HOWEVER Most academic research labs in the U.S. and Europe remained closed and labs in China have only recently started to reopen. These closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders and it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work. Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continued to see very strong demand through April for our products. Molecular point of care and acute care testing which is also driving increased instrument placements globally. This contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs where significant declines in elective procedures, emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes. We also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs. In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through April. Consumables remained solid as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods and medicine. But equipment purchases are being delayed as mission-critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments. The cadence of these end-market dynamics. Appears to be consistent with the spread of the virus with the negative impact in North America and Western Europe trailing that of China China gradually improved in April as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter in North America and Western Europe we believe that the trend is beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months These regions begin to gradually reopen in light of these recent trends. We expect second-quarter core revenue growth, including Saitek, to be in the range of flat to down ten percent. So to wrap up, as I reflect on the events of the last few months, I am humbled by our team's dedication and innovative response to this unprecedented crisis true to our core values. Our associates are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges. Never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant, and I'm so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion. Looking ahead, we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment. We believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio, exceptional teams, and dvs-driven execution will continue to differentiate us. DANAHER IN TWENTY TWENTY AND BEYOND NOW BEFORE WE GO TO Q AND A I WANT TO ADDRESS THE PRESS RELEASE THAT WENT OUT LAST NIGHT REGARDING OUR UPCOMING CEO TRANSITION AFTER MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AT DANAHER INCLUDING THE LAST SIX AS CEO I HAVE DECIDED TO BEGIN THE TRANSITION TO RETIREMENT I DO THIS KNOWING THAT DANAHER HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER THE COMBINATION OF OUR PORTFOLIO ENHANCED EXECUTION Innovation and our seasoned leadership team driven by the Danaher business system create a strong foundation for continued outperformance. I have loved every day of the past three decades and throughout my entire Danaher career I've been privileged to be part of an incredible team. I've always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency enhancing the portfolio. DRIVING INNOVATION AND DEVELOPING TALENT. AND I CAN NOW LOOK BACK FONDLY ON THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON ALL THESE FRONTS. I PLAN TO SEE THE CORPORATION THROUGH THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT OUR PORTFOLIO AND THE TEAM ARE BOTH IN A FANTASTIC POSITION TO THRIVE IN THE YEARS TO COME. MANY OF YOU KNOW RYAN BLAIR WELL FROM HIS DAYS AS PRESIDENT OF SYAX. AND MORE RECENTLY AS OUR E D E P L I I Y I N G DH AH0 E V AH0 L UW1 SH AH0 N AH0 V AA1 R L AY1 F S AY1 AH0 N S P L AE1 T F AO2 R M sil EH1 N SH AH0 N IH0 NG DH AH0 P L AE1 T F AO2 R M Z G R OW1 TH sil AH0 N D M AA1 R JH AH0 N P R OW1 F AY2 L sil HH W AY1 L L IY1 D IH0 NG DH IY0 AE2 K W IH0 Z IH1 SH AH0 N Z AH0 V P AO1 L sil AY1 D IY What's next for me? Well, first off, that question is one for several months from now. But I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family and I'll continue to serve on the boards of Medstar Health and the College of the Holy Cross. I'll remain in the CEO role through September first of this year and I'll be around into twenty twenty one in an advisory role. But for now and as soon as we finish this call. Speaker 1: We will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt so we can start taking your questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Kristel, we're now ready for questions.\n\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Once again, to ask a question, please press star one. Your first question comes from the line of Derek DeWynne with Bank of America.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, good morning. Derek, hey, um, so a couple of questions, and then I'll, I'll congratulate you on, on retirement. I'm jealous, by the way. Um, so to start off, so can you tell us what you're embedding into the guide in the two cue for covid-related contributions? I mean, you're producing a lot of sputum, you know, your sputum's ramping up. Um, so to start off, so can you tell us what you're embedding into the guide in the two cue for covid-related contributions? I mean, you're producing a lot of sputum, you know, your sputum's ramping up. Um, so to start off, so can you tell us what you're embedding into the guide I GUESS ARE ALL THOSE TESTS GOING TO BE USED OR WERE THEY SPOKEN FOR? I'M JUST CURIOUS IN REGARD TO WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUTH UTILIZATION AND WHAT'S EMBEDDED INTO THE GUIDE THANKS SURE OH YEAH THANKS THANKS DERRICK HAPPY TO WALK YOU THROUGH THAT A BIT SO IF LETS GO RIGHT TO THE TO THE COVID IMPACT IN Q2 AND I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT AS LARGELY A TAIL WIND THAT PROBABLY REPRESENTS YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED BASIS POINTS OF IMPROVEMENT OR GROWTH THAT'S ASSOCIATED PREDOMINANTLY WITH CEPHYD RADIOMETER AND I D T AND IN TERMS OF THE RELATED QUESTION ABOUT WHAT'S SPOKEN FOR YOU KNOW CEPHYD WE'RE FLAT OUT AT CEPHYD WE ARE WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY BUT EVERY TEST THAT WE PRODUCE EVERY SINGLE DAY GETS SHIPPED AND THE DEMAND IS CONTINUING TO BUILD RADIOMETER ALSO RUNNING FLAT OUT NOT QUITE THE NEED FOR EXPANDED CAPACITY WE HAD THE SERVICE CAPACITY WE NEEDED THERE BUT THEY'RE DOING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL AND I D T HOLDING ITS OWN AS WELL SO I THINK OVERALL YOU'D CONSIDER SEYFERT RADIOMETER AND I D T CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTORS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IS THAT THE REST OF THE PORTFOLIO I know is potentially down anywhere from five to fifteen percent. And those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like like vet med diagnostics like bio systems a bit that are more patient volume dependent and will have to see whether that patient volume you know coming from loosening up of elective procedures starts to return but certainly the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment oriented business like l m s and synex and a bit at p i d no doubt. So now putting all of this into text. I THINK THAT TOGETHER YOU'D THEN PARTIALLY OFFSET THAT WITH PROBABLY A BIT OF POSITIVE FROM PAUL AND SITIVA THAT ARE SHOWING POSITIVE GROWS THAT'S NOT EXCLUSIVELY COVID RELATED BUT CERTAINLY RELATED TO THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AROUND THERAPIES AND VACCINES SO I THINK THAT'S THE WAY I'D SORT OF GENERALLY FRAME UP THE You mentioned cytology. We are not assuming anything here in the quarter for cytology, even though we're ramping up with backman and we're gonna have some capacity here. Our view is that it's just a little too early to really kind of tell you know what the volumes might look like, what a national testing program or any other kind of local testing programs might look like. So that that covid tailwind does not include cytology, just to be clear. Oh, great. That's really helpful. And i guess what's just one question on sytiva. BUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS TALK\n\nBUSINESS PARTICULARLY MATERIAL BUT I'LL TELL YAH SITIVO IS OFF TO A GREAT START. AS I MENTIONED TEN PERCENT TEN PERCENT CORE GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER REALLY STRONG MOMENTUM IN THE CORE BIOPROCESSING BUSINESS AND AND THAT'S REALLY DRIVEN BY FOLKS WORKING ON SOLUTIONS TO TO COVID NINETEEN AND BUT YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK FORWARD I THINK WE HAVE REALLY WE HAVE REALLY JUST CLOSED THE YEAR THE FIRST OF APRIL WE'RE JUST GETT In there to really understand what that funnel looks like and you know there's there's plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time depending on the the progress of therapies and vaccines. So I think we've got an outstanding start here but you know in terms of where we are from a guide perspective on sitiva we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like obviously we haven't even gotten face to face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint Given the limitations we have here on travel, so right now we're going to focus on obviously a good, good deal of rebranding work that we need to do. We're going to stand it up as a standalone operating company, execute on the tsa and exit those tsa work streams and costs and make sure that we're embedding dbs into those, into the business and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance. So we'll come, we'll come back and give you a better sense of what sitiva looks like in the balance. The Year, Once We Get A Little Bit More Stability Here In Terms Of How The How The Bookings Trends Look And We Round The Corner Here Coming Into The Second Half Of The Year. Great, Thank You. Thanks, Derek. Your Next Question Comes From The Line Of Tyco Peterson With J P Morgan. Morning, Tyco. Thanks, Good Morning. Tom, I'll Start With The Congrats On The Transition. It Is Might Be Helpful To Hear. WY WHY NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME I KNOW YOU YOU PLANNED THOSE THINGS OUT WELL IN ADVANCE BUT YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE WERE A LITTLE OFF GUARD IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC AFTER CLOSING YOUR LARGEST DEALS SO CAN YOU JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW LONG THIS TRANSITION HAS BEEN PLANNED AND WHY NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME SURE ABSOLUTELY TYCO I'D BE HAPPY TO YOU KNOW I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT I DID AND ALONG WITH THE BOARD MADE SURE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TALENT DEVELOPMENT ABOUT INSURING THAT WE ARE PROGRESSING IN VARIOUS WAYS THROUGH OUR LEADERSHIP RANKS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND AND HAD AN OUTSTANDING CHOICE IN RYAN BLAIR TO SUCCEED ME. SO THIS HAS VERY MUCH BEEN THE CULMINATION OF A SUCCESSION PLANNING PROCESS THAT REALLY DID REACH ITS PEAK. Gone on over the last over the last five or six years we we always want to to do something like this when we're in a in a position of strength and i think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what i think makes us very comfortable that that this is certainly a good time to turn the reins over it was super important that we got sytiva clothes And and that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here of the role allows for both ryner and i to contribute to ensuring that sitiva comes into the organization smoothly. So i think it's really a combination of all those things you know i think the the dan of her board was incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along i am I am really excited about about Riner and the the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role. And he's just gonna do a fantastic job. So we we all feel great about it. Ok, thanks. And then for the follow-up, just a question on on some of the longer-term COVID related tailwinds. You know, for Sephora, they're presumably be less rule and rule out, you know, flu testing tied to COVID going forward. So I'm curious how you think about that. And then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, They think about the durability of that test once there is a vaccine on the market for Beck being curious if he can put anything around pricing for cytopathology and then lastly for siteiva and Paul, just curious how meaningful you think vaccine and therapy development could be for those businesses, you know, on a multi-year basis. Sure, thanks, Tyco. You know, we've got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts of COVID and I think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned. BOTH ON THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM. I THINK IF YOU START WITH FROM A DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PERSPECTIVE SEPHIAT'S IMPACT ALONG WITH IDT RADIOMETER IN TERMS OF TREATMENT ON THE FRONT LINE AS WELL AS BECKMAN AND SERUM AND SEROLOGY AND I G G TESTING I THINK THAT THAT'S A PRETTY UNIQUE COMBINATION OF CAPABILITIES. NOW YOU ASKED ABOUT THE DURABILITY OF THE SEPHIAT TEST. I THINK YOU KNOW WELL WE ARE ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING WORLD LEADERS IN FLU TESTING AND I THINK AS WE SEE THE FUTURE HERE YOU'RE GONNA YOU'RE GONNA LOOK CLINICIANS ARE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY IN DOING FLU TESTING TO ALSO BE DOING COVID NINETEEN TESTING AND I THINK THE ABILITY TO RUN THOSE TESTS ON THE SAME PLATFORM AND THE SAME CARTRIDGE OBVIOUSLY THE SAME CARTRIDGE CONFIGURATION IS A REAL ADVANTAGE AND A REAL OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE FOR SEPHIED. OF COURSE AS THIS SURGE IN DEMAND N In terms of the test cartridges themselves but it's driving a significant increase in our install base and so as that install base has grown you're also going to see that install base driving not only COVID nineteen testing but it's continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for Seppic over time and obviously there's a broader suite of tests that run on the Seppic architecture and so that's going to benefit as well so we think there's exceptional durability To the Sephardic architecture in an environment even in one where we have and and god willing we will have both therapies as well as as well as vaccines in terms of your question about beckman and serology you know i think the way we see serology evolving over time is it's going to be primarily driven obviously with the blood draw and you're going to see serology test the i g g test integrated The cost per test is going to be quite reasonable and it's going to be in line with other immunoassay tests. So while we talk about the capacity to have thirty million tests, as I think Matt said earlier, we wouldn't build that into any models. But I think it's representative of the fact that serology testing, that IgG test, is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunoassay. I'd say so. I think a lot of a lot of terrific potential there, particularly as it relates to advances in public health and population testing and some of the work that's being done by public health authorities to look for hot spots over time in terms of your question about sitiva and and work around therapies and vaccines, I'd say both Paul and sitiva are uniquely positioned to provide you pretty critical inputs, meaning fibrin and resins. To both vaccine and therapeutic candidates. Right now, we would estimate that there're greater than a hundred and fifty therapeutic and vaccine candidates today and Paul and Sycitva are working with a majority of those in some capacity. And so obviously they'll be, they'll be winners and losers. But we think we have a number of exceptional positions there with with folks that are likely to be part of the future therapy and or MORNING GUYS, I THINK WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE. I THINK WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE. I THINK WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE. I THINK WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE. I THINK WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE. I THINK WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE. I THINK WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE. I THINK WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE. I THINK WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE. I THINK W Mentioning Rayner, not not everyone knows him well, and you did mention that he was the right person. Maybe contrast your leadership style with that of Rayner's leadership style. What does Rayner bring here, you know, and what should investors look forward to under this transition? Sure, I'd start, BJ, with the fact that Rayner and I have worked together. GATHER CLOSELY FOR VIRTUALLY ALL OF HIS HIS TEN YEARS YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BUT WHEN RYNER WAS FIRST FIRST HIRED AT DANAHER HE CAME IN INITIALLY AS THE AS THE PRESIDENT OF VIDEO JET AND I'M NOT SURE RYNER AND HIS WIFE ELAINE HAD ACTUALLY UNPACKED THEIR BAGS WHEN WE HAD WE WERE LOOKING TO TO SUCCEED ME AT SYAX AFTER THE SYAX ACQUISITION AND I WAS HEADED OFF TO BECKMAN AND WE HAD THIS OUTSTANDING OUTSTANDING LEADER WHO HAD JUST COME INTO VIDEO JET AND A REAL NEED AT SYNEX AND AND RYNER REPACKED AND AND MOVED TO BOSTON AND AND LED SYNEX FOR FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND JUST DID AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB AND AND HE AND I HAVE WORKED TOGETHER LITERALLY EVERY DAY SINCE THEN THROUGH THE THE WORK AT SYNEX THROUGH THE ACQUISITIONS OF PAUL AND A D T OBVIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE TREMENDOUS WORK THAT HE DID IDENTIFYING THE Opportunity that has become sitiva our largest acquisition ever and so you know when you work together for as long as we have i guess there there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the two of us but you know vj you're gonna have plenty of time to ask riner that question and he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the two of us than i will he's a he's an outstanding individual he is super smart he is steeped in IN THE DOMAINS NOT ONLY IN LIFE SCIENCE BUT BUT ACROSS DANAHERA HE'S UNBELIEVABLY WELL RESPECTED ACROSS DANAHERA AS A DBS LEADER, A GREAT TEACHER, A DBS PRACTITIONER AND AND SOMEBODY WHO LIVES AND AND BREATHES THE DANAHERA CORE VALUES AND AND OUR SHARED PURPOSE OF HELPING REALIZE LIFE'S POTENTIAL EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU KNOW HIS TRACK RECORD RELATIVE TO M N A AND HIS BIAS TOWARDS DRIVING INNOVATION BY BEING WILL To place bets both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is is unparalleled. So I you know I I hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the two of us in terms of what we value but you know Rynair will put his own mark on Danaher and I am supremely confident that that mark on Danaher is gonna be an outstanding one and an indelible one. That's helpful. REGARDING TOM JUST MAYBE ONE HOUSEKEEPING QUESTION PERHAPS FOR MATT MATT THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE PRESS RELEASE HAD A COUPLE OF HUNDRED BASIS POINTS THAT CONTRIBUTION FROM SITIVA THAT PERHAPS IMPLIES YOU DOUBLE DIGITS, MAYBE EVEN LOW TEENS GROWTH IN THAT BUSINESS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT BUSINESS DOING TWENTY PERCENT I THINK IN Q1 YOU KNOW CONTINUING DOUBLE DIGITS IN Q2 IS THAT JUST THE BUSINESS Y AND PERHAPS FROM A YOU KNOW COVID RELATED BUSINESS AND THEN PERHAPS I ALSO ADDRESS YOU KNOW DECREMENTAL MARGINS HERE FOR TWO FEW YOU THANKS GUYS YEAH SURE SO FROM PRECISELY EVEN PERSPECTIVES I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW IT GREW TWENTY PERCENT THERE IN Q1 I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A REASONABLE PLACE YOU KNOW FOR THE BUSINESS TO BE HERE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AS WELL SO I THINK YOUR MATH ON THAT IS PRETTY CORRECT Decrementals it can vary you know quite a bit depending on mix et cetera but i think starting with forty is a good place to start i will tell you that you probably in in q two in diagnostics though probably need to be more like fifty or sixty percent decrementals and that's all related to fx so that delta will be because of fx here in the quarter so forty overall may be a touch higher here in q two in diagnostics thanks guys thanks vj We have reached the allotted time for questions. Your last question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Maleia's research. Hi, good morning, guys. And congrats, Tom. Thanks, Scott, good morning. It's been a great six years, we we're a little surprised you're going, but I don't blame you. It's retirement sounds pretty interesting right now. Yeah, it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it FORMED BY THE CURRENT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES IT WAS VERY MUCH PART OF THE PLAN YEAH SURE SURE I BELIEVE THAT YEAH THANK YOU BUT ANYWAYS I WISH YOU THE BEST I KNOW WE'LL SEE YOU BEFORE YOU GO BUT ANYWAYS IT'S BEEN A GREAT RUN WHAT WHAT I JUST SWITCHING TO BUSINESS YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES OF INTEGRATING SAITEKA HERE IN THIS KINDA NEW WORLD I MEAN CAN YOU REALLY TEACH DBS AND DO KAIZENS AND ALL TH YEAH THANKS FOR THE QUESTION SCOTT UM YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YE USING MICROSOFT TEAMS JUST TWO WEEKS AGO I KICKED THE GUY KICKED IT OFF RYNER WAS ON THE CALL JOHN ZACHOWSKI YOU KNOW FROM OUR D B I S OFFICE LED THE IT LED THE EFFORT WE PROBABLY TOUCHED WE GOT MORE PEOPLE THROUGH THAT E C O OVER THAT DAY AND A HALF I FORGET THE FULL DURATION BUT BECAUSE ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO USE A VIRTUAL TOOL AND SO A DIGITAL TOOL AND SO THE ANSWER IS WE'RE WORKING We're doing our best, we're off to a good start, we've got to get creative, we've got to invent new ways to get things done. Interestingly, our existing businesses outside of sitiva are, in fact, doing multiday kaizen using virtual tools, using zoom, using Microsoft teams and it's not the same, it's different. We wouldn't use that as a standard going forward. We've absolutely valued being face to face but you know we've we've challenged our teams to get creative and continue to drive continuous improvement even in this environment okay that's encouraging just just shifting gears I know there's been a lot of questions around cybersecurity and compliance so it should be but you know if you go down to environmental and applied solutions you've got some interesting businesses of different cyclicalities and such is there are kind of a range of outcomes and two c's THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN START TO THINK ABOUT FOR THOSE BUSINESSES AND I MADE SOME ENCOURAGING EXCUSE ME COMMENTS ON VIDEO CHAT BUT AND ACTUALLY JUST WATER TOO BUT ON AN OVERALL BASIS AT LEAST THOMAS IS THERE SOME COLOR YOU CAN GIVE THAT YEAH YEAH I KNOW SCOTT YEAH THOSE ARE FANTASTIC BUSINESSES EVEN IN A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT I MEAN YOU KNOW HOCKS LEADERSHIP POSITION IN WATER QUALITY RUM VIDEO JET YOU KNOW A LEADER FROM A SHARE PERSPECTIVE AS WELL BOTH OBVIOUSLY HEAVILY SKEWED TOWARDS THEIR THEIR BALANCE OF SALES SKEWED TOWARDS CONSUMABLES YOU KNOW NORTH OF SEVENTY FIFTY PERCENT IN THOSE BUSINESSES BEING AFTER MARKET CONSUMABLES AND SERVICE WHEN WHEN WATER QUALITY TESTING HAS TO BE DONE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN MUNICIPALITIES AROUND THE WORLD WHEN CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS HAVE TO BE MARKED AND SHIPPED THOSE CONSUMABLES CONTINUE TO UNDERPIN YOU KNOW REASONABLY STABLE PERFORMANCE. I MEAN THEY ARE A SAFETY NET UNDER THE UNDER THE REVENUE STRUCTURES OF THOSE BUSINESSES. AND WHILE THERE WILL BE SOME OTHER DIMENSIONS THEY LIKE THE EQUIPMENT SIDE IN IN WATER QUALITY FOR EXAMPLE OR EVEN IN P I D IN SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SOFTWARE BUSINESSES THAT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PRESSED HERE YOU KNOW I THINK THOSE ARE STILL Well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't trade those businesses for, for, for any in their markets. I, I should have asked it differently, I guess. Will this segment be down more than your corporate average Tom? Yes, well, yeah, I mean, I think they would be down a bit more only because they're not buoyed by the terrific performance that we continue to see at Seagate and HDD. GEOMETER, AND EVEN WITH THE YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK IS GONNA BE A PRETTY SOLID PERFORMANCE AT SITIVA AND PAUL. SO YEAH, I THINK THESE BUSINESSES WOULD BE AT THE LOWER END OF THE OF THE CORE GROWTH YOU KNOW COMPONENT YOU COULD POTENTIALLY SEE THE SEGMENT E A S DOWN POTENTIALLY MID TO HIGH TEENS INSIDE THE GUIDE. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?"

OFFICER THANK YOU JOSHUA AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AS OUR INDUSTRY AND HEALTHCARE FIRST RESPONDERS CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO DEFEAT THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH THOSE AFFECTED BY COVID-19 THE SEEMINGLY RELENTLESS SPREAD OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS HAS MADE 2020 A TRAGIC AND SURREAL YEAR BUT WE REMAIN HOPEFUL AND CONFIDENT IN THE ABILITIES OF OUR INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP THE THERAPIES NECESSARY TO EXTINGUISH THIS VIRULENT DISEASE I AGAIN WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK OUR TEAM FOR THEIR WORK AND DEDICATION TO OUR MISSION DEVELOPING FIRST-IN-CLASS MEDICINES TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PATIENTS WITH IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASES WHOSE CONDITIONS ARE NOT BEING ADEQUATELY TREATED BY THE CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE KEY PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT TO THE SECOND QUARTER WAS OUR TYPE C MEETING WITH THE FDA WHICH CHARTED THE REMAINING CLINICAL PATHWAY TO AN NDA SUBMISSION FOR TOPICAL OCULAR REPROXALAP IN DRY EYE DISEASE THE MEETING CULMINATED IN AN AGREEMENT TO USE LEVELS OF REACTIVE ALDEHYDE SPECIES OR RASP THE THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR REPROXALAP AS AN OBJECTIVE SIGN-IN POINT FOR SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL EVALUATION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WE PLAN TO INITIATE CLINICAL TESTING TO ASSESS THE ACTIVITY OF TOPICAL OCULAR REPROXALAP IN REDUCING TEAR LEVELS OF RASP AND OTHER OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF DRY EYE DISEASE AND WE EXPECT PRELIMINARY RESULTS BY THE END OF THE YEAR THE TIMING OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL IS OF COURSE SUBJECT TO FINALIZATION OF TRIAL DESIGN RASP ASSAY DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL DISRUPTIONS DUE TO COVID-19 INITIATION OF A SAFETY STUDY IN DRY EYE DISEASE PATIENTS IS ALSO PLANNED FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AN NDA SUBMISSION IS EXPECTED BY THE END OF 2021 OUR OPTIMISM FOR THE USE OF RASP AS AN OBJECTIVE SIGN OF DRY DISEASE IS SUPPORTED BY DATA FROM OUR SUCCESSFUL PHASE IIA TRIAL IN WHICH REPROXALAP TREATMENT DIMINISHED LEVELS OF RASP TEAR RASP IN TEARS AS MEASURED BY ELISA FOLLOWING 28 DAYS OF TREATMENT FOR THE UPCOMING RASP TRIALS THE LONGEST DURATION OF DOSING UNDER CONSIDERATION IS ALSO 28 DAYS WHEREAS THE SHORTEST DOSING DURATION IS ONE TO TWO DAYS ADDITIONALLY THE UPCOMING RASP TRIALS WILL INCLUDE A CHAMBER ASSESSMENT TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF ACUTE CHANGES IN DRYNESS ON RASP AND OTHER SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF DRY EYE DISEASE WE'LL BE SHARING ADDITIONAL DETAILS AS A PROTOCOL FOLLOWING RASP ASSAY VALIDATION AND FDA REQUIREMENT AND LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING TRIAL DESIGNS SHORTLY FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE TOPICAL OCULAR REPROXALAP ALREADY HAS BEEN EVALUATED IN MORE THAN 1,000 PATIENTS WITH NO OBSERVED SAFETY CONCERNS IN SHORT THE SAFETY CONSISTENCY AND CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY OF REPROXALAP ACROSS NUMEROUS CLINICAL TRIALS SUGGEST THAT REPROXALAP COULD BE AN IMPORTANT ADDITION TO THE LIMITED NUMBER OF THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR DRY EYE DISEASE WHICH AFFECTS MORE THAN 30 MILLION PATIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES LOOKING AT OTHER OCULAR PROGRAMS IN OUR PIPELINE TOP-LINE RESULTS FROM THE PHASE III INVIGORATE ALLERGEN CHAMBER TRIAL OF REPROXALAP AND ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS ARE EXPECTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2021 IN THE RETINAL DISEASE AREA THE SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION GRANTED ORPHAN MEDICINAL PRODUCT DESIGNATION TO ADX- 2191 FOR THE TREATMENT OF RETINAL DETACHMENT OPENING A NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR ADX- 2191 IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AS DRUGS RECEIVING THE ORPHAN MEDICINAL PRODUCT DESIGNATION ARE ELIGIBLE TO PROTOCOL ASSISTANCE RESEARCH FUNDING AND UPON APPROVAL 10 YEARS OF EU MARKET EXCLUSIVITY ADX-21- NOVE- 2191 ARE NOVEL AND PROPRIETARY INTRAVITREAL METHOTREXATE INJECTION IS BEING EVALUATED IN THE PHASE III GUARD TRIAL FOR PROLIFERATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY PVR IS A RARE BUT SIGHT-THREATENING CONDITION AND A LEADING CAUSE OF FAILURE OF RETINAL DETACHMENT SURGERY EFFECTING ROUGHLY 4,000 PATIENTS PER YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND NEARLY TWICE AS MANY IN EUROPE AND JAPAN COMBINED GIVEN THE NATURE OF PVR AND GIVEN THE CLINICAL SITE DELAYS CAUSED BY COVID-19 THE PROGRESS OF GUARD HAS BEEN SLOW ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THERE IS NO APPROVED THERAPY FOR PVR AND ADX- 2191 HAS RECEIVED ORPHAN DRUG AND FAST TRACK DESIGNATIONS FROM THE FDA ADX- 2191 IS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW CLINICAL PROGRAM IN PRIMARY VITREORETINAL LYMPHOMA OR PVRL A RARE AGGRESSIVE HIGH-GRADE CANCER THAT AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 2,900 PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH ABOUT 600 NEW CASES DIAGNOSED ANNUALLY THERE ARE NO APPROVED TREATMENTS FOR THE DISEASE ALTHOUGH THE STANDARD OF CARE IS PHARMACY COMPOUNDED METHOTREXATE THAT HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO THE EYE WE HAVE RECENTLY FILED FOR ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR ADX- 2191 IN PVRL TURNING TO OUR SYSTEMIC DISEASE PROGRAMS WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT ADX-21- ADX-629 WHICH TO OUR KNOWLEDGE IS THE FIRST SYSTEMICALLY AVAILABLE RASP INHIBITOR THE CLINICAL TESTING OF WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIRST TIME SYSTEMIC RASP INHIBITION HAS BEEN ASSESSED CLINICALLY MARKING AN EXCITING NEW MILESTONE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION AN IND HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE FDA FOR PHASE II CLINICAL TESTING OF ADX-629 IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 IN ORDER TO PREVENT CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME AND RESPIRATORY COMPROMISE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN THIS YEAR IN AN ANIMAL MODEL OF CYTOKINE STORM ADX-629 DEMONSTRATED A BROAD AND HIGHLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CYTOKINE LEVELS INCLUDING TNF-ALPHA INTERFERON GAMMA AND IL-17 WHILE UP-REGULATING THE KEY ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES IL-10 THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT RASP INHIBITORS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REPRESENT IMMUNOLOGICAL SWITCHES WHICH MAY MODULATE IMMUNE SYSTEMS FROM PRO-INFLAMMATORY STATES TO ANTI-INFLAMMATORY STATES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WE ALSO EXPECT TO INITIATE CLINICAL TRIALS OF ADX-629 IN PSORIASIS AN AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE AND ATOPIC ASTHMA AN ALLERGIC DISEASE IN COMBINATION TRIALS IN COVID-19 PSORIASIS AND ASTHMA COVER THE GAMUT OF INFLAMMATION AND THE RESULTS OF THE TRIALS WILL CHARACTERIZE THE IMMUNE-MODULATING ACTIVITY OF ADX-629 AND RASP INHIBITION MORE GENERALLY SWITCHING TO ADX- 1612 OUR NOVEL HSP90 INHIBITOR ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN COMPLETED IN THE INVESTIGATOR SPONSORED PHASE II EUDARIO TRIAL IN OVARIAN CANCER REGARDING THE ADX- 1612 COVID 19 PROGRAM CONSISTENT WITH FDA FEEDBACK ADDITIONAL PRECLINICAL ANTIVIRAL TESTING OF ADX- 1612 AGAINST SARS-COV-2 THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19 WILL BE PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES WHICH HAS ACCEPTED OUR REQUEST TO EVALUATE ADX- 1612 IN IN VIVO MODELS WE PLAN TO UPDATE ON THE ADX- 1612 COVID PROGRAM BY THE END OF 2020 WE APPROACHED THE MID-POINT OF THE THIRD QUARTER IN A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION ENHANCING OUR FLEXIBILITY WITH RECENT COMMON STOCK SALES TO TWO HEALTHCARE-FOCUSED FUNDS PERCEPTIVE ADVISORS AND AVIDITY PARTNERS THESE TRANSACTIONS RAISED GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY 19.5 MILLION COMPLETING OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED AT-THE-MARKET OFFERING PROGRAM WE EXPECT OUR CASH RUNWAY TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OPERATIONS THROUGH 2022 INCLUDING POTENTIAL REPROXALAP APPROVAL IN DRY EYE DISEASE AND ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS NOW WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO JOSH FOR THE FINANCIAL REVIEW THANKS TODD FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2020 WE REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $7.5 MILLION COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS OF $13.3 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2019 NET LOSS PER SHARE WITH 25 CENTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2020 COMPARED WITH 49 CENTS FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019 LOSSES HAVE RESULTED FROM THE COST OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AS WELL AS FROM GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $4.9 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2020 COMPARED WITH $10.7 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019 THE DECREASE TO $5.8 MILLION IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A REDUCTION IN CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT MANUFACTURING AND PERSONNEL COSTS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $2.2 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30 2020 COMPARED WITH $3.1 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019 THE DECREASE OF $900,000 IS DUE TO LOWER PERSONNEL-RELATED COSTS INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $7.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES OF $13.7 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019 AS OF JUNE 30 2020 CASH CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE $66.2 MILLION SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30 2020 $25.2 MILLION IN CASH WAS RECEIVED FROM AT-THE-MARKET OFFERING PROGRAMS SALES TO PERCEPTIVE ADVISORS AVIDITY PARTNERS AND OTHER INVESTORS BASED ON CURRENT OPERATING PLANS CASH CASH EQUIVALENT AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS OF JUNE 30 2020 PLUS THE ADDITIONAL AT-THE-MARKET OFFERING PROGRAM PROCEEDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OPERATIONS THROUGH THE END OF 2022 INCLUDING POTENTIAL NDA APPROVALS FOR REPROXALAP IN DRY DISEASE AND ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS ASSUMING POSITIVE CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND PLANNED NDA SUBMISSION ACCEPTANCES AND APPROVALS USE OF CASH CASH EQUIVALENT AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO INCLUDE THE CONTINUATION OF PART ONE OF THE PHASE III GUARD TRIAL IN PVR AND PHASE II CLINICAL TESTING OF ADX-629 AN ORALLY ADMINISTERED RASP INHIBITOR IN INFLAMMATORY DISEASES NOW I'LL TURN THE CALL BACK TO TODD FOR CLOSING COMMENTS THANKS JOSH WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MILESTONES PLANNED FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2020 AND LOOK FORWARD TO EXECUTING ON OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY ACROSS OUR OCULAR AND SYSTEMIC PROGRAMS LOOKING AT OUR IRR CALENDAR NEXT WEEK WE'LL BE PRESENTING AT THE BTIG VIRTUAL BIOTECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE AND WEDBUSH PACGROW HEALTHCARE VIRTUAL CONFERENCE THESE EVENTS WILL BE WEBCAST PLEASE CHECK THE EVENTS AND PRESENTATION SECTION OF OUR WEBSITE FOR DETAILS WE ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING WITH INVESTORS AND HOPE TO CONNECT WITH YOU AT THESE OR OTHER UPCOMING EVENTS AS ALWAYS WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO EXECUTING EFFICIENTLY IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN AND BRINGING TO MARKET NOVEL THERAPIES THAT IMPU- THAT IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PATIENTS WITH SERIOUS UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS WITH THAT JOSH DAVE AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS OPERATOR AT THIS TIME IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS * THEN THE NUMBER 1 ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD THAT IS * 1 TO ASK A QUESTION OUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE LOUISE CHEN WITH CANTOR HI THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTIONS HERE SO FIRST QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS COULD YOU GET INTO MORE DETAIL ON SIGNIFICANCE THE FDA'S RECOGNITION OF RASP AS ASSIGNED FOR DRY EYE DISEASE IS AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR YOU IN TERMS IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL APPROVAL AND MARKET OPPORTUNITY AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS ON YOUR COVID TRIALS HOW ADAPTIVE ARE THOSE TRIALS IN LIGHT OF THE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING LANDSCAPE FOR THE TREATMENT OF COVID AND THEN HOW'S ENROLLMENT GONE AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION HERE IS YOU NOTICED THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME HEADWINDS TO CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRESSION DUE TO COVID CAN YOU GIVE MORE COLOR ON WHICH TRIALS MAY BE IMPACTED HERE THANK YOU HI GOOD MORNING LOUISE AND AND THANKS FOR YOUR EXCELLENT QUESTIONS THE RASP DEVELOPMENT IS UH TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE FOR ALDEYRA UH RASP IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL TARGET IS UPON WHICH THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED MANY YEARS AGO UH TO OUR KNOWLEDGE NO COMPANY HAS EVER THERAPEUTICALLY ADDRESSED RASP AND YET RASP REPRESENTS UH A VERY BROAD-BASED ANTI-INFLAMMATORY APPROACH THAT PROBABLY APPLIES TO MANY MANY DISEASES NOT ONLY OCULAR DISEASES SUCH AS DRY EYE DISEASE BUT ALSO UH SYSTEMIC DISEASES SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE WERE THRILLED UH ABOUT THE FDA'S DECISION TO CLASSIFY RASP AS AN OBJECTIVE SIGN OF DRY EYE DISEASE WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS AN INFLAMMATORY UM CONDITION WHAT IT MEANS PRACTICALLY FOR THE COMPANY IS THAT THE UH ONGOING CLINICAL TRIALS THE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT ARE ABOUT TO START REGARDING THE ASSESSMENT OF RASP SHOULD BE UH LIKELY TO WORK BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE MECHANISM OF REPROXALAP AND OUR OTHER RASP INHIBITORS IS THE DIRECT INHIBITION OF RASP THESE COMPOUNDS BIND COVALENTLY TO RASP SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY MEASURING IS A CHEMICAL REACTION UH IN VIVO AND IN THIS CASE IN THE THE TEAR FLUID OF PATIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED UH REPROXALAP UM AND ALL OF THAT LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT WE'LL BE POSITION TO FILE AN NDA FOR DRY EYE DISEASE UH NEXT YEAR AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REGARDING UH THE COVID TRIAL DESIGNS UH WE ANTICIPATE FOR BOTH PROGRAMS ENROLLING APPROXIMATELY WAIT UH 30 PATIENTS I THINK THERE'LL LIKELY BE A TWO-TO-ONE RANDOMIZATION DRUG TO PLACEBO UH AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED ADAPTIVE DESIGNS I THINK THE NATURE OF THE RESULTS OF THESE FIRST UH TRIALS WILL HELP US DETERMINE SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL TESTING WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE MUCH MORE UH SIGNIFICANT UH IF THERE ARE POSITIVE RESULTS UH FROM THE PRELIMINARY OUTPUTS THAT WE HAVE HERE UM ENROLLMENT HASN'T STARTED THE IND HAS BEEN FILED FOR 629 AS I MENTIONED ON THE CALL TODAY UH 1612 IS THE SUBJECT OF UH FURTHER UM UH IN VIVO INVESTIGATION UM UH IN COVID THAT IS BEING PERFORMED UH BY NIAID AND WE'RE ABSOLUTELY THRILLED ABOUT NIAID DECISION TO UM TO TEST UH ADX- 1612 ON OUR BEHALF UM THE COVID IMPACT AS YOU MENTIONED LOUISE ACROSS THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT UH THE ONE TRIAL IN OUR CASE IN OUR PIPELINE THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY COVID-19 UH IS THE GUARD TRIAL THE PHASE III GUARD TRIAL FOR PVR UH WHAT SEEMED TO HAVE HAPPENED DURING UH THE PEAK OF UM UH COVID CASES UH BACK IN MARCH APRIL MAY AND SO FORTH WAS THAT MANY PATIENTS SIMPLY WERE NOT COMING INTO THE HOSPITAL DESPITE UM UH VISION CHANGES DESPITE UH LOSING SIGHT UH THE UM UH NUMBER OF OF PATIENTS COMING IN UH WAS DIMINISHED AT DURING THAT TIMEFRAME AND FURTHERMORE MANY CLINICAL SITES AS YOU KNOW SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE RESEARCH STAFF UH WHICH WERE CONSIDERED FOR A WHILE TO BE NON-ESSENTIAL SUCH THAT IT WAS UH DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE IN SOME CASES UH TO ENROLL TO ENROLL PATIENTS HOWEVER UH THE GOOD NEWS IS REGARDING THE REST OF THE PIPELINE WE DO NOT SEEM TO BE HAVE BEEN OV- OVERTLY AFFECTED UH BY COVID IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT UH THE DRY EYE PROGRAM WAS LARGELY UH UNDER DISCUSSION WITH THE FDA UH DURING THE PEAK NUMBER OF CASES UH IN THE SPRING UH THE ALLERGY PROGRAM THE PHASE III ALLERGY PROGRAM UH WAS ON UH PLANNED HOLD BECAUSE OF POLLEN AS YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT ENROLL ALLERGY PROGRAMS WITH AMBIENT POLLEN AND WE EXPECT THE INVIGORATE PROGRAM TO UH RE-INITIATE AGAIN IN THE FALL SO WE WERE QUITE FORTUNATE IN TERMS OF TIMING WITH REGARD TO OUR OTHER UH CLINICAL PROGRAMS WE'VE UM UH RELATIVE TO THE IMPACT OF OF COVID OKAY THANK YOU AS A REMINDER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS * THEN THE NUMBER 1 ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD THAT IS * 1 TO ASK A QUESTION OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF JUSTIN KIM WITH OPPENHEIMER & COMPANY HI GOOD MORNING GUYS THANKS FOR TAKING THE QUESTIONS AND CONGRATS ON THE PROGRESS UM I KNOW IT'S EARLY DAYS BUT YOU KNOW AS YOU THINK ABOUT ESTABLISHING REPROXALAP ACTION ON RASP AS A SIGN OF DRY EYE WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSION WITH INVESTORS ON WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE DURATION OF OBSERVATION TO ASSESS THIS ACTIVITY CAN YOU JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE ACUTE VERSUS FOUR-WEEK TIME POINTS FROM A TRIAL PERSPECTIVE UH DISEASE PERSPECTIVE AND LABELING PERSPECTIVE GREAT GOOD MORNING JUSTIN UM AND GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU THE AS I HIGHLIGHTED IN MY COMMENTS UH THIS MORNING THE POTENTIAL RANGE OF DOSING DURATION FOR THE RASP TRIALS IS ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO TWO DAYS ON THE ACUTE END TO 28 DAYS ON THE MORE UH CHRONIC OR SUBCHRONIC END WHICH REFLECTS THE PHASE IIA TRIAL THAT IS THE DATA IN OUR CORPORATE DECK SHOWING THAT AFTER 28 DAYS OF ADMINISTRATION OF REPROXALAP THERE WAS A HIGHLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN RASP LEVELS AS MEASURED BY ELISA I WANNA SPEND A FEW SECONDS TALKING ABOUT THE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO MEASURE RASP RASP EX- EXIST IN OUR BODY IN TWO FORMS SO-CALLED FREE RASP THAT ARE RASP THAT ARE SORT OF FLOATING AROUND AND THEN RASP THAT ARE BOUND TO PROTEINS THE ELISA MEASURES RASP BOUND TO PROTEINS AND AS YOU KNOW ELISA'S AN ANTIBODY MEDIATED UH DETECTION ASSAY THE REASON WHY WE'RE ABLE TO GENERATE ANTIBODIES TO BOUND RASP IS THAT WHEN RASP BIND TO PROTEINS THEY'RE ANTIGENIC AND UH FORM ANTIBODIES IN SOME CASES UH ANTIBODIES AGAINST SELF-PROTEIN SO THE ELISA MEASURES BOUND RASP AND BOUND RASP GENERALLY ACCUMULATE OVER TIME WHICH IS WHY IN THE PHASE IIA STUDY OVER 28 DAYS WE USE THE ELISA TO ASSESS RASP LEVELS ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM OF REGARDING ONE TO TWO DAY OR ACUTE DOSING OF REPROXALAP WE THINK THAT UH TECHNIQUES SUCH AS LC-MS MASS SPEC MIGHT BE UH MORE RELEVANT TO ASSESSING RASP BECAUSE THERE WE'D BE LOOKING AT PRE- RASP LEVELS THAT WOULD ACUTELY UH FOLLOWING DOSING SO SOMEWHERE WITHIN THOSE TWO RANGES OF DOSING PARADIGMS AND THOSE TWO DIFFERENT ASSAY TECHNIQUES UM WE WILL END UP VALIDATING THE PRECISE TECHNIQUE AND AND UH THEN UH ESTABLISHING PROTOCOL DESIGN UH FOR THE UH FIRST OF THE RASP STUDIES TO BEGIN SHORTLY OKAY GREAT GOT IT UM AND MAYBE THEN YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT DOSING REGIMENS TO THE INVESTIGATOR AND HAVE YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FDA ON YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU'D HAVE TO DO SORT OF YOU KNOW Q.I.D OR B.I.D YOU KNOW JUST TO APPRECIATE THAT YOU WOULD BE TAPERING IN IN SORT OF THE UH DISEASE STATE EVENTUALLY RIGHT AND AND THAT GETS BACK TO THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION HOW UH MIGHT THE CLINICAL COMMUNITY PERCEIVE UH DURATION OF DOSING AND DOSING REGIMEN UM FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT UH SIGNS OF DISEASES INCLUDING DRY EYE DISEASE ARE PRIMARILY OR FIRST AND FOREMOST REGULATORY MILESTONES UH I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF DRY EYE DISEASE THAT EITHER PHYSICIANS OR PATIENTS ARE PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT SIGNS PATIENTS DO NOT WAKE UP IN THE MORNING THINKING I WONDER WHAT MY SCHIRMER'S TEST IS I WONDER WHAT MY CORNEAL STAIN IS AND SO FORTH UH INSTEAD WE VIEW SIGNS AND I THINK MOST PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS VIEW SIGNS AS REGULATORY UM UH MILESTONES SO THE DOSING PARADIGM FOR TRIALS ASSOCIATED PURELY WITH SIGNS I THINK IS A LOT LESS IMPORTANT UM IN THIS CASE FOR ONE TO TWO DOSES UH DAY THE ONE- TO TWO-DAY DOSING PARADIGM YOU'RE THINKING OF OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF DOSES FOR THE 28-DAY DOSING PARADIGM I WOULD EXPECT WE WOULD DOSE UH Q.I.D WHICH IS THE FIRST PHASE OF OUR INDUCTION MAINTENANCE UH DOSING PARADIGM WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED WITH THE RELEASE OF THE PHASE III RENEW TRIAL UH BACK IN UH UH DECEMBER IN TERMS OF HOW PHYSICIANS LOOK AT THE DOSING PARADIGM FOR REPROXALAP IN GENERAL UH IN TERMS OF TREATING PATIENTS I THINK THAT UH THE INDUCTION MAINTENANCE PARADIGM ESTABLISHED WITH RENEW OVER 12 WEEKS UH R- REALLY SETS THE TONE A- AND AND MORE PRECISELY THE LABEL FOR HOW THE DRUG WILL BE USED AND THAT IS UH A Q.I.D DOSING INITIALLY UH FOLLOWED BY B.I.D DOSING UH FOR THE MAINTENANCE PHASE OKAY THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL UM MAYBE JUST A CLARIFICATION QUESTION I I KNOW IN THE PRESS RELEASE IT SAYS THAT THERE'S UH GONNA BE A DRY EYE NDA FILING UM BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR IS THE CURRENT THINKING STILL TO CONTINUE ONWARD WITH THE CONCURRENT FILING JUST YOU KNOW I KNOW I KNOW LATER IT SAYS THAT IT IS ALSO GONNA BE FILED JUST WONDERING IF THE EXPECTATION IS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TOGETHER STILL OUR CURRENT THINKING IS THAT BOTH WILL BE FILED TOGETHER PENDING POSITIVE CLINICAL DATA OF COURSE UH IT TURNS OUT THAT THE TIMELINES FOR DRY EYE DISEASE AND ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS CONTINUE TO OVERLAP UM THE SAFETY STUDIES THE EFFICACY STUDIES THE TIMELINE FOR FILING THE MDA M- NDA ALL OF THOSE SEEM TO OVERLAP UH FOR DRY EYE AND ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS AT THIS POINT UH WHICH SUGGESTS THAT A CONCURRENT NDA IS PERHAPS THE BEST REGULATORY STRATEGY BUT OF COURSE WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW UM EVENTS PLAY OUT UM UH OVER THE LATTER PART OF THIS YEAR AND THE EARLY PART OF NEXT YEAR BEFORE WE CAN GUIDE SPECIFICALLY ON THE POSSIBILITY OF UH CONCURRENT NDA WE REALLY DO LIKE THE CONCURRENT NDA PARADIGM HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE OVERLAP BETWEEN DRY EYE DISEASE AND ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS THERE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT A 50% OVERLAP SUCH THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE PATIENTS WITH DRY EYE DISEASE COMPLAIN OF OCULAR ITCHING AND ABOUT HALF THE PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS COMPLAIN OF DRYNESS AND AND A SINGLE COMPOUND THAT COULD TREAT BOTH DISEASES OR IS INDICATED FOR BOTH DISEASES WOULD BE HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS NOT ONLY TO TO UH PHYSICIANS BUT ALSO TO PATIENTS AS WELL RIGHT GREAT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE UM MY LAST QUESTION IS JUST UH YOU KNOW ON THE SAFETY STUDY IS THERE AN EXPECTATION FOR WHAT THE SIZE AND SCOPE UH YOU KNOW DURATION AS WELL AS NUMBER OF PATIENTS YOU WOULD YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE FOR IT RIGHT FOR DRY EYE DISEASE UM MY CURRENT UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE FDA GENERALLY REQUIRES 100 PATIENTS COMPLETE ONE YEAR OF DOSING UH HOWEVER UM UH BASED ON UM OTHER RES- OTHER SPONSORS' INTERACTIONS WITH THE AGENCY WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN FILE BASED ON SIX MONTHS OF SAFETY DATA SO WHAT HAPPENS IS MOST SPONSORS WILL OVER-ENROLL THEY'LL BEGIN WITH MORE THAN 100 PATIENTS UH SUCH THAT UH THEY HAVE 100 COMPLETERS AT UM AT 12 MONTHS UH AND TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THE UH UH THE SAFETY TRIALS ARE UM ARE FAIRLY STANDARD IN IN DRY EYE DISEASE UM I WILL SAY AS I MENTIONED IN MY UH PREPARED COMMENTS THAT WE'VE TESTED UH WELL OVER 1,000 PATIENTS UH WE HAVE SEEN NO SAFETY SIGNALS NO CHANGES IN INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE UH NO RETINAL FINDINGS UH NO ABERRANT CORNEAL FINDINGS UH OR ANY OTHER SAFETY UH UH SIGNALS THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE UH HAS BEEN AN WITH UH REPROXALAP DOSING IN ANY PATIENT THAT'S RECEIVED DRUG SO FAR GREAT GREAT THANKS AGAIN AND I'LL HOP BACK IN THE QUEUE YEP THANKS JUSTIN AND THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME I'LL TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO DR BRADY FOR CLOSING REMARKS WELL THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FOR JOINING US TODAY UH AS ALWAYS WE LOOK FORWARD TO KEEPING YOU UPDATED ON OUR

I again want to especially thank our team for their work and dedication to our mission, developing first in class medicines to approve the lives of patients. WITH IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASES WHOSE CONDITIONS ARE NOT BEING ADEQUATELY TREATED BY THE CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE KEY PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECOND QUARTER WAS OUR TYP C MEETING WITH THE FDA WHICH CHARTED THE REMAINING CLINICAL PATHWAY TO AN NDA SUBMISSION FOR TOPICAL OCULAR REPROXAPHAN IN DRY EYE DISEASE THE MEETING KULMINATED IN AN AGREEMENT TO USE LEVELS OF REACTIVE ALDEHYDES We plan to initiate clinical testing to assess the activity of topical ruxolitinib in reducing tear levels of ruxolitinib and other objective signs of dry eye disease. We expect preliminary results by the end of this year. The timing of the clinical trial is of course subject to spine. The realization of trial design rasp assay development and potential disruptions due to COVID nineteen initiation of a safety study in dry eye disease patients is also planned for the fourth quarter and NDA submission is expected by the end of twenty twenty one our optimism for the use of rasp as an objective sign of dry eye disease is supported by data from our successful phase two a trial In which retinoid treatment diminishes levels of RAS p21 RAS p21 as measured by ELIZA following twenty eight days of treatment for the upcoming RAS trials the longest duration of dosing under consideration is also twenty eight days whereas the shortest dosing duration is one to two days additionally the upcoming RAS trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the effect of acute changes in dryness on RAS and other MINDS AND SYMPTOMS OF DRY EYE DISEASE WE'LL BE SHARING ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF THE PROTOCOL FOLLOWING RASP ASSAY VALIDATION AND FDA REQUIREMENTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING TRIAL DESIGNS SHORTLY FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE TOPOGLOCOAL REPROXYLAX ALREADY HAS BEEN EVALUATED IN MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND PATIENTS WITH NO OBSERVED SAFETY CONCERNS IN SHORT THE SAFETY CONSISTENCY AND CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY OF REPROXALAP ACROSS NUMEROUS CLINICAL TRIALS SUGGESTS THAT REPROXALAP COULD BE AN IMPORTANT ADDITION TO THE LIMITED NUMBER OF THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR DRY EYE DISEASE WHICH AFFECTS MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION PATIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES LOOKING AT OTHER OCULAR PROGRAMS IN OUR PIPELINE TOP LINE RESULTS FROM THE PHASE 3 VIGORATE ALLERGEN CHAMBER TRIAL OF REPROXALAP IN ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS ARE EXPECTED IN THE Twenty twenty one in the retinal disease area and the second quarter of this year, the European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation to AX2101991 for the treatment of retinal detachment, opening a new market opportunity for AX2101991 in the European Union, as drugs receiving the orphan medicinal product designation are eligible for protocol assistance, research funding, and upon approval, ten years of EU market exclusivity.

As many of you know, there is no approved therapy for PVR and ADX 219191 has received orphan drug and fast-track designations from the FDA. Subject of our new clinical program in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma or PVR, a rare aggressive high-grade cancer that affects approximately 29,000 people in the United States with about 600 new cases diagnosed annually. There are no approved treatments for the disease, although the standard of care is pharmacy-compounded methotrexate that has been injected into the eye.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we reported a net loss of seven point five million dollars, compared with a net loss of thirteen point three million dollars for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Net loss per share was twenty five cents for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared with forty nine cents for the same period in 2019. Losses have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research and development programs. As well as from general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses were four point nine million dollars for the quarter ended June thirtieth, twenty twenty, compared with ten point seven million dollars for the same period in nineteen nineteen. The decrease of five point eight million dollars is primarily related to a reduction in clinical and preclinical development, manufacturing, and personnel costs. General and administrative expenses were two point two million dollars for the quarter ended June thirtieth, twenty twenty, compared with ten point seven million dollars for the same period in nineteen nineteen. The decrease of nine hundred thousand dollars is due to lower personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and other miscellaneous administrative costs. In the second quarter of twenty twenty, total operating expenses were seven point one million dollars, compared with total operating expenses of thirteen point seven million dollars for the same period in twenty nineteen.

With that, Josh, Dave, and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. That is star one to ask a question. Your first question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor. Hi, thanks for taking my question. QUESTIONS HERE SO FIRST QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU IS CAN YOU GET INTO MORE DETAIL ON HOW SIGNIFICANT THE FDA'S RECOGNITION OF RHAPSODY IS AS A SIGN FOR DRY EYE DISEASE IS AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR YOU IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL APPROVAL AND MARKET OPPORTUNITY AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU WAS ON YOUR COVID TRIALS HOW ADAPTIVE ARE THOSE TRIALS IN LIGHT OF THE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING LANDSCAPE FOR THE TREATMENT OF COVID AND THEN HOW ENROLLMENT GONE AND MY LA Trial progression due to COVID. Can you give more color on which trials may be impacted here? Thank you. A good morning Louise and thanks for your excellent questions. The RASP development is a truly transformative for Alder. RASP is the pharmaceutical target upon which the company was founded many years ago to our knowledge no company has ever therapy. POLITICALLY ADDRESSED RASP AND YET RASP REPRESENTS A VERY BROAD BASED ANTI-INFLAMMATORY APPROACH THAT PROBABLY APPLIES TO MANY MANY DISEASES NOT ONLY OCULAR DISEASES SUCH AS DRY EYE DISEASE BUT ALSO SYSTEMIC DISEASES SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE WERE THRILLED ABOUT THE FDA'S DECISION TO CLASSIFY RASP AS AN OBJECTIVE SIGN OF DRY EYE DISEASE WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS AN INFLAMMATORY ONE AH0 M sil K AH0 N D IH1 SH AH0 N sil W AH1 T IH1 T M IY1 N Z sil P R AE1 K T AH0 K L IY0 F ER0 DH AH0 K AH1 M P AH0 N IY0 sil IH1 Z sil DH AE1 T sil DH IY0 sil AA1 N G OW1 IH0 NG K L IH1 N IH0 K AH0 L T R AY1 ER0 DH IY0 sil K L IH1 N IH0 K AH0 L T R AY1 L Z DH AH0 T AA1 R AH0 B AW1 T T AH0 S T AA1 R T sil R IH0 G REACTIONS IN VIVO AND IN THIS CASE IN THE AIRE FLUID OF PATIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED REPROXALAB IN ALL THAT LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE IN A POSITION TO FILE AN NDA FOR DRY DISEASE NEXT YEAR AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REGARDING THE COVID TRIAL DESIGNS WE ANTICIPATE FOR BOTH PROGRAMS IN ROLLING APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PATIENTS. I THINK THEY'LL LIKELY BE A TWO TO ONE RANDOMIZATION DRUG TO PLACEBO AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED ADAPTIVE DESIGNS I THINK THE NATURE OF THE RESULTS OF THESE FIRST TRIALS WILL HELP US DETERMINE SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL TESTING WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT IF THERE ARE POSITIVE RESULTS FROM THE PRELIMINARY OUTPUTS THAT WE HAVE HERE ENROLLMENT HASN'T STARTED YET AND D HAS BEEN FILED FOR SIX TWO NINE AS I MENTIONED ON THE CALL TODAY SIXTEEN TWELVE IS THE SUBJECT OF FURTHER IN VIVO INVESTIGATIONS IN COVID THAT IS BEING PERFORMED BY NIHAD AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY THRILLED ABOUT NIHAD'S DECISION TO TO TEST A D I X S I K S T I L V Z ON OUR BEHALF THE COVID IMPACT AS YOU MENTIONED LUISES ACROSS THE GLOBE The industry has been significant. The one trial in our case in our pipeline that has been affected by COVID nineteen is the guard trial, the phase three guard trial for PVR. What seemed to have happened during the peak of COVID cases in March, April, May, and so forth was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite Some vision changes despite losing sight. The number of patients coming in was diminished during that time frame and furthermore, many clinical sites, as you know, simply did not have research staff which were considered for a while to be nonessential such that it was difficult, if not impossible, in some cases to enroll patients. However, the good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline, we do not seem to have been overtly affected by COVID in terms of enrollment. The Dry Eye Program was largely under discussion with the FDA during the peak number of cases in the spring. The allergy program, the phase 3 allergy program was on a planned hold because of pollen. As you know, you cannot enroll allergy programs with pollen. AMBIENT POLLEN AND WE EXPECT THE INVIGORATE PROGRAM TO REINITIATE AGAIN IN THE FALL. SO WE WERE QUITE FORTUNATE IN TERMS OF TIMING, WITH REGARD TO OUR OTHER CLINICAL PROGRAMS, WE LEAVE RELATIVE TO THE IMPACT OF COVID. OH, THANK YOU. AS A REMINDER, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION, PLEASE PRESS STAR, THEN THE NUMBER ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. THAT IS STAR ONE TO ASK A QUESTION. YOUR NEXT QUESTION. Comes from the line of justin simmons with auburn and company. Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the progress. I know it's early days, but as you think about establishing a probabilistic model on rast as a sign of dry eye, we've had some discussion with experts on what would be an appropriate duration of observation to assess the efficacy. Can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the acute versus four week time points from a trial perspective, disease perspective, and labeling perspective? BRIEF MORNING JUSTIN AND GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU THE POTENTIAL RANGE OF DOSING DURATION FOR THE RASPRILS IS ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO TWO DAYS ON THE ACUTE END TO TWENTY EIGHT DAYS ON THE MORE CRONIC OR SUBCRONIC END WHICH REFLECTS THE PHASE TWO A TRIAL THAT IS THE DATA IN OUR CORPORATE DECK SHOWING THAT AFTER TWENTY EIGHT DAYS OF ADMINISTRATION OF PROPRAXAL THERE WAS The highly statistically significant reduction in rasp levels as measured by eliza I want to spend a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure rasp rasp exists in our body in two forms so-called free rasp that are rasp that are sort of floating around and then rasp that are bound to proteins the eliza measures rasp bound to proteins and as you know eliza is an antibody mediated detection Protection assay. The reason why we're able to generate antibodies to bound rasp is that when rasp binds to proteins, they're antigens and form antibodies. In some cases, antibodies against self-proteins. So the elisa measures bound rasp and bound rasp generally accumulate over time which is why in the phase two a study over twenty-eight days we used the elisa to assess rasp levels on the other end of the spectrum. REGARDING ONE TO TWO DAY OR ACUTE DOSING OF REPROXILAN WE THINK THAT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS L C M S M A S S P E K T M AY B IH sil M AO1 R R EH1 V AH0 L AH0 N T T UW1 AH0 S EH1 S IH0 NG R AE1 S P sil B IH0 K AH1 Z DH EH1 R W IY1 W UH1 D B IY1 L UH1 K IH0 NG AE1 T F R IY1 R AE1 S P L EH1 V AH0 L Z sil DH AH0 T W UH1 D CH EY1 N JH A TECHNIQUE AND THEN ESTABLISHING PROTOCOL DESIGN FOR THE FIRST RAT STUDIES TO BEGIN SHORTLY OH GREAT GOT IT AND MAYBE THEN YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT DOSING REGIMENS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND HAVE YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FDA ON YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU'D HAVE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE Q ID OR B ID YOU KNOW JUST TO APPRECIATE THAT YOU WOULD BE CAPERING IN AND SORT OF A DISEASE STATE EVENTUALLY RIGHT AND THAT GETS BACK TO THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION HOW MIGHT THE CLINICAL COMMUNITY PERCEIVE A DURATION OF DOSEING AND DOSEING REGIMENS FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT SIGNS OF DISEASES INCLUDING DRY EYE DISEASE ARE PRIMARILY OR FIRST AND FOREMOST REGULATORY MILESTONES I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT'S CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF DRY EYE DISEASE THAT THAT SIGNS OF DISEASES INCLUDING DRY EYE DISEASE ARE PRIMARILY OR FIRST AND EITHER PHYSICIANS OR PATIENTS ARE PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT SIGNS PATIENTS DO NOT WAKE UP IN THE MORNING THINKING I WONDER WHAT MY SCHERMER TEST IS I WONDER WHAT MY CORNEAL STAIN IS AND SO FORTH INSTEAD WE VIEW SIGNS AND I THINK MOST PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS VIEW SIGNS AS REGULATORY MILESTONES SO THE DOSING PARADIGM FOR TRIALS ASSOCIATED PURELY WITH SIGNS I THINK IS A LOT LESS IMPORTANT In this case, for one to two day dosing, the one to two day dosing paradigm, you're thinking of a limited number of doses. For the twenty eight day dosing paradigm, I would expect we would do QID, which is the first phase of our induction maintenance dosing paradigm, which was established with the release of the phase three renewal trial back in December in terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm. REPROXALAP IN GENERAL IN TERMS OF TREATING PATIENTS I THINK THAT THE INDUCTION MAINTENANCE PARADIGM ESTABLISHED WITH RENEW OVER TWELVE WEEKS REALLY SETS THE TONE AND MORE PRECISELY THE LABEL FOR HOW THE DRUG WILL BE USED AND THAT IS A Q I D DOSING INITIALLY FOLLOWED BY B I D DOSING FOR THE MAINTENANCE PHASE OK THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL MAYBE JUST A CLARIFICATION GUIDELINE Question: I know in the press release it says that there's gonna be a dry nda filing at the end of next year. Is the current thinking still to continue on order with a concurrent filing? Just, you know, I later it says that A C's also gonna be filed. Just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect them to be together still. Our current thinking is that both will be filed together, pending positive clinical data of course. It turns out that the time is our current thinking is that both will be filed together, pending positive clinical data of course. It turns out that the time is our current thinking is that both will be filed together, pending positive clinical data of course. It turns out that the time is our current thinking is that both will be filed together, pending positive clinical data of course. Lines for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis continue to overlap the safety studies, the efficacy studies, the timeline for filing the M D, the N D A. All of those seem to overlap for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point would suggest that a concurrent N D A is perhaps the best regulatory strategy. But of course we'll have to see how events play out. OVER THE LATTER PART OF THIS YEAR AND THE EARLY PART OF NEXT YEAR BEFORE WE CAN GUIDE SPECIFICALLY ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A CONCURRENT N D A W E REALLY DO LIKE THE CONCURRENT N D A PARADIGM HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE OVERLAP BETWEEN DRY EYE DISEASE AND ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS THERE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT A FIFTY PERCENT OVERLAP SUCH THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE PATIENTS WITH DRY EYE DISEASE COMPLAIN OF OCULAR ITCHING AND ABOUT HALF OF THE PATI AND A SINGLE COMPOUND THAT COULD TREAT BOTH DISEASES OR IS INDICATED FOR BOTH DISEASES WOULD BE HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS NOT ONLY TO PHYSICIANS BUT ALSO TO PATIENTS AS WELL RIGHT GREAT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AH MY LAST QUESTION IS JUST YOU KNOW ON THE SAFETY STUDY IS THERE AN EXPECTATION FOR WHAT THE SIZE AND SCOPE YOUR DURATION AS WELL AS NUMBER OF PATIENTS YOU WOULD YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE FOR IT RIGHT GREAT THAT MAK My current understanding is that the FDA generally requires one hundred patients to complete one year of dosing. However, based on other sponsors' interactions with the agency, we believe that we can file based on six months of safety data. So what happens is most sponsors will over-enroll, they'll begin with more than a hundred patients. SUCH THAT THEY HAVE A HUNDRED COMPLETERS AT AT TWELVE MONTHS AND TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THE SAFETY TRIALS ARE FARLEY STANDARD IN DRY EYE DISEASE I WILL SAY AS THEY MENTIONED IN MY PREPARED COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE TESTED WELL OVER A THOUSAND PATIENTS WE HAVE SEEN NO SAFETY SIGNALS NO CHANGES IN INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE NO RETINAL FINDINGS NO ABERRANT CORNEAL FINDINGS OR ANY OTHER SAFETY SIGNALS THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE WITH REPROXIFEN DOSING IN ANY PATIENT THAT'S RECEIVED DRUG SO FAR GREAT GREAT THANKS AGAIN AND I'LL HOP BACK IN THE QUEUE YEAH THANKS JOGGY THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME I WILL TURN THE CALL BACK OVER TO DOCTOR BRADY FOR POSITIVE REMARKS Well, thank you all again for joining us today. As always, we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Have a nice day. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call.

Our users while also providing them with additional fresh short-form content. Moreover, we were successful in introducing new public survey functions to the platform which helped to amplify both user engagement and user interaction, especially within the content of major social events and hot topics. In addition to these key product upgrades, we also maintain our relentless efforts in fine-tuning our content recommendation. By integrating our seasoned editorial knowledge into more areas of the content recommendation process, we were able to better focus on improvements of click-through rates and user time spent on the platform during the period.

Now turning to our content operations in the third quarter, we remain focused on strengthening our leadership in those content verticals that we believe have long-term strategic value. In our financial vertical, for example, we further expanded our audience size by releasing such flash hits as \"On the Cover\" Omen, an in-depth debut series featuring exclusive interviews with influential people including Mr. Long Yongtu, former vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and Miss Maya Musk, celebrity model and mother.

This combination of factors allowed us to significantly expand the reach of our online ranking events further. The power of our brand authority and influence on our target audience as well as the fashion industry as a whole.

THANK YOU The epidemic in certain areas of China as well as the popularity of showroom videos and live streaming e-commerce which continued to gain market share during the quarter. As you may know, our brand advertising and performance-based advertising accounted for about 80 percent and 20 percent of our total advertising revenues respectively. In fact, in Q3, our brand advertising revenues increased on a sequential basis. This steady growth was mainly due to the gradual recovery of our offline promotional campaigns and the original i programs. As more offline activities continue to take place in the remainder of 2020, we expect our brand advertising revenues to achieve. Double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. However, on the other hand, our performance-based advertising continues to face challenges during the third quarter. Mainly due to the following two factors. First, some of our clients were subject to stricter industry regulations and therefore had to adopt a more conservative approach. Second, we had to adopt a more conservative approach as well. Advertising and placement strategy. And secondly, the overall supply of advertising in the market exceeded the market's demand, which made using ECPMs of performance-based advertising more difficult. By sector, the top five industries covered by our advertising business are all... E COMMERCE F M S C FINANCIAL SERVICES AND INTERNET SERVICES THOSE INDUSTRIES WHICH HAVE TRADITIONALLY ACCOUNTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR ADVERTISING VENUES INCLUDING AUDIO AND BAIDU WERE MOSTLY IMPACTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR HOWEVER AS THE PANDEMIC GRADUALLY IMPROVED THOSE INDUSTRIES WERE MOSTLY IMPACTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR HOWEVER AS THE PANDEMIC GRADUALLY IMPROVED THOSE INDUSTRIES WERE MOST Specifically brought under control in the third quarter both industries have since recovered significantly in regards to the auto market the industry continues to show strong signs of recovery in the period according to china passenger car association in september retail sales of passenger cars increased by about seven percent. ONE POINT THREE PERCENT YEAR OVER YEAR WHOLESALE SALES OF NEW ENERGY PASSENGER CARS INCREASED BY MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT YEAR OVER YEAR AS SUCH WE EXPECT THE AUTO SECTOR TO CONTINUE ITS RECOVERY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THE ONLINE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNDER PERFORMING DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF THE EPIDEMIC IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES Areas of China as well as this year's geopolitical issues, short form video and e-commerce were the only sources of advertising growth in this quarter while the rest of the industry underperformed in a recognition of the changing market dynamics we have already established our presence in both the short form video and e-commerce spaces. The majority of our original content is now produced in the showroom video format and more than eighty percent of our brand advertising projects are now showroom video projects which we are able to monetize through a combination of content production and advertising cells. We are confident that despite the challenges posed by today's complex and volatile media landscape, we are well-positioned to continue delivering high-quality, engaging content that resonates with our audience. Advertising Market Our Competitive Advantages Will Enable Us to Continue Preparing the Growth of Our Business Lines Going Forward Mm Mm I Hope I Have Answered Your Question Yes Yes It Does Thank You Very Much Edouard Your Next Question Comes from Karim Jan from First Shanghai Securities Please Ask a question. High management. After you receive the second charge of edis payments, how do you plan to use the additional cash on the company's balance sheet? Are you considering private placement or dividends? Hi, Karen. This is Shaw. Let me answer your question. As of September thirtieth, twenty twenty, we had cash and the cash equivalents of approximately. Years dollar three hundred fifty million we also maintain our cash strong cash flow during the pandemic it was driven by our effective cost control measures as well as the excellent return that we achieved in our investment it showcased our strategic investment experience as for existing capital we plan to use these resources in three key areas first we will continue to optimize our existing assets second we will explore new investment opportunities and third we will continue to invest in our people Our product market matrix with our flagship news app remains at the core of our service offerings. At the same time, we also aim to develop more platform-based products which is capable of meeting the future needs of consumers. We will also explore new business opportunities with both government and enterprise business partners. WE WILL ACTIVELY EXPLORE MORE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES BY EVALUATING POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS INTO THOSE BUSINESS FUNDS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR BUSINESS GOALS IN PARTICULAR WE WILL FOCUS ON FUNDS WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN GAMING TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT VIDEO LUXURY CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND OTHER VERTICAL SERVICES IT WILL HELP TO KEEP US UP TO DATE To create up to date on the very rapidly involving market dynamics of new business sectors. Certainly we remain committed to creating shareholder value and delivering returns to our shareholders in new and varied ways. Having said that, dividends are certainly one form of giving back to our shareholders that we will continue going forward. This year we have observed the privatization of some U.S. listed companies as well as registration system reforms in the domestic capital market. We will certainly evaluate our choices in due course with our continuing focus on ensuring shareholder rights and maximizing their interests. Right now, we will also be sure to take over to take our OWN SITUATION AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT INTO ACCOUNT IN ADDITION WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS REFINING OUR CORE BUSINESS AND EXECUTING OUR NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES WE ARE NOW TAKING ACTIVE STEPS TO EXPAND OUR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS BY UPGRADING OUR E-COMMERCE PRODUCTS AND BUILDING OUT OUR OWN SUPPLY CHAIN TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE MONETIZATION CAPABILITIES OF OUR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS I HOPE TO SHARE OUR BUSINESS PROGRESS ON THIS RUN WITH EVERYONE AS SOON AS NEXT QUARTER I HOPE THIS ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION CARL MARTIN THANK YOU THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN IF YOU SHOULD ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS BUT ONE YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM Frank Chen from Peking University. Please ask a question. Good morning, management. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. The first one is, I remember that you mentioned the company targets to narrow the loss this year. I think you did quite a good job. The second question is, what do you expect to break even in looking forward? Advertisements, probably on the advertisement pages, uni-pages on brandads. Can you update us how CPM looks like today compared to last quarter or a year ago? And what direction do you think CPM will go in the future? Edwards can add a few more words on the other hand. Our operating loss for the first nine months of twenty twenty was R and B seventy three point eight million, which is much lower than the operating loss of R and B two hundred forty eight million in the same period last year. As such, we are now on track to achieve our operating target for the full year. However, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are still facing uncertainties and challenges. The pandemic on our top line performance in twenty twenty we do not expect to be given at operating level this year as a public company we fully understand the importance of profitability and we're well aware that maintaining the healthy growth of our core business is the optimal path to long-term profitability with the continued optimization of our current strategy and vertical operations were confident in our ability to achieve our goals. That we can leverage our existing business strengths to not only insure the growth of our core business but also develop additional growth drivers in such new areas as e-commerce, product reviews, and original i.p. programs over the long term we believe that our effective corporate governance structure will enable us to strike the fine balance between growth and profitability. PROBABILITY YOU THINK YOU STILL MENTION THAT THE ADVERTISING TREND GOING FORWARD NEXT YEAR RIGHT SO MAYBE EDWARDS CAN ADD A FEW MORE WORDS HIGH FRANK LADIES EDWARDS SPEAKING ACTUALLY AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THAT THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS STILL FULL OF CHALLENGES YOU KNOW LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS STILL FULL OF CHALLENGES YOU KNOW LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS STILL FULL OF CHALLEN I THINK LIKE A FIRST IT DEPENDS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EPIDEMIC WORLDWIDE ESPECIALLY IN CHINA IN WE THINK NEXT YEAR IT'S GETTING BETTER BUT IT'S STILL A QUESTION RIGHT AND SO IN THIS KIND OF MICRO ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WE THINK THE ONLINE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS STILL FACING CHALLENGES MAYBE IN ITS Especially in the first half of twenty twenty and also this in the online advertising industry is evolving and users spend a more and more time on platforms like dooyoo and quipso this kind of show form video platforms so our advertising incomes are still facing pressures especially for the HOW TO MAKE OUR ADVERTISING MORE COST-EFFECTIVE IS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR US AND BUT WE AS I'VE ALSO MENTIONED BEFORE ACTUALLY WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT THIS KIND OF CHANGING IN MARKET DYNAMICS WE ALREADY HAVE PUT A LOT OF EFFORTS AND ARE IN LIKE THE SHORT FORM VIDEO AND THE E-COMMERCE SPACES SO NEXT YEAR THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES BUT WE ARE ALSO FEEL VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY EXCITED AND CONFIDENT WE THINK WE CAN HANDLE THESE CHALLENGES AND MAKE SOME PROGRESS IN ADVERTISING BUSINESS.

PANDEMIC INCLUDING OUR TENANTS AND PARTNERS THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED EXTRAORDINARY RESILIENCE WELL BEYOND WHAT WE ANTICIPATED WE EXPECT WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONTEND WITH COVID-19 AS IT EBBS AND FLOWS WHAT'S ENCOURAGING IS THE PROGRESS OF BETTER TREATMENTS AND PROMISING VACCINE DEVELOPMENTS MODERNA PFIZER ASTRAZENECA AND MANY OTHERS ARE REPORTING POSITIVE RESULTS FROM FAST-TRACKED CLINICAL TRIALS MANY EXPECT A SUCCESSFUL VACCINE IN 2020 WITH WIDESPREAD AVAILABILITY NEXT YEAR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE ALSO TAKING A MUCH MORE TARGETED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING HOTSPOTS WHICH IS ALLOWING HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO REMAIN OPEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE ARE SEEING PHYSICIANS RAMP UP THEIR VOLUMES QUICKLY NOW APPROACHING PRE- COVID LEVELS THEY ARE EXPERIENCING HEIGHTENED FOR DELAYED CARE PROVIDERS ARE BALANCING THE DELIVERY OF MUCH NEEDED CARE WITH SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AND THEY HAVE GAINED VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IN TREATING THEIR COVID PATIENTS AS A RESULT WE ARE NOT SEEING THE USE OF LENGTHY OR WIDESPREAD BANS ON ELECTIVE PROCEDURES SEVERAL PUBLICLY TRADED NATIONAL HEALTHCARE COMPANIES INCLUDING HCA SURGERY PARTNERS AND TENANT HAVE RECENTLY REPORTED STEADY IMPROVEMENTS IN VOLUMES THROUGHOUT MAY JUNE AND JULY LIKEWISE WE HAVE SEEN TENANT UTILIZATION OUR BUILDINGS REBOUND TO NEARLY 90% OF PRE- COVID LEVELS IT DOES VARY GEOGRAPHICALLY SOMEWHAT FROM A LOW OF 75% IN WASHINGTON DC TO 100% HERE IN NASHVILLE AND WORK ORDER REQUESTS ARE NOW RUNNING IT PRE- COVID LEVELS AND LEASING MOMENTUM HAS ALSO REBOUNDED TOURS WITH PROSPE- PROSPECTIVE TENANTS WHICH DIPPED BELOW 50% OF TYPICAL VOLUMES IN APRIL ARE NOW RUNNING WELL ABOVE AVERAGE RENT COLLECTION STANDS AT 97% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AS WELL AS JULY NEW DEFERRAL REQUESTS TO FALL INTO NEARLY ZERO IN THE LAST 30 DAYS AND OVER HALF OF DEFERRALS GRANTED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER WERE REPAID EARLY WHICH IS VERY ENCOURAGING FORGIVABLE PPP LOANS KICKED IN AS DESIGNED FOR PAYROLL RENT AND UTILITIES THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR RECEIVE MORE THAN 12% OF ALL PPP LOANS OF WHICH THE BIGGEST RECIPIENTS WERE PHYSICIAN OFFICES AT MORE THAN $8.40 BILLION HR'S OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WERE STEADY DESPITE THE IMPACT OF COVID STRONG CASH LEASING SPREADS HIGH TENANT RETENTION AND STABLE CONTRACTUAL RENT BUMPS WERE POSITIVE SIGNS OF THE RESILIENCY OF OUR TENANTS AND THE STABILITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO WITH TOURS BEING WELL OFF PACE IN APRIL AND MAY OCCUPANCY COULD BE MARGINALLY SOFTER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR BUT WITH A SHARP RECOVERY IN JUNE AND JULY WE EXPECT OCCUPANCY TO STRENGTHEN GOING INTO 2 AS A RESULT SAME-STORE NOI GROWTH WILL LIKELY BE CLOSER AT 2% IN 2020 AND BOUNCE BACK TOWARD 3% NEXT YEAR EXTERNAL GROWTH IS STILL ON PACE FOR A SOLID 202 THE PIPELINE IS STRONG EVEN AFTER WE TOOK EXTRA TIME TO UNDERWRITE THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF TENANTS WE'VE INCREASED THE TOP END OF OUR ACQUISITION GUIDANCE TO BE IN LINE WITH OUR VOLUME LAST YEAR AND WELL AHEAD OF OUR OUR HISTORICAL AVERAGE WE HAVE PLENTY OF FUNDING CAPACITY FROM THE MERCY DISPOSITIONS CASH ON HAND FORWARD EQUITY AND FULL AVAILABILITY ON OUR LINE OF CREDIT WE ARE POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A SIZABLE AND GROWING PIPELINE THE PANDEMIC HAS UNDERSCORED THE CRITICAL NATURE OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES EVEN IN UNCERTAIN TIMES IT HAS SHOWN THAT HOSPITALS ARE THE HUB OF ESSENTIAL CARE INCLUDING HIGH ACUITY OUTPATIENT SERVICES WHICH DRIVE THE STABILITY OF OUR CASHFLOWS DESPITE THE PANDEMIC WE STILL EXPECT TO PRODUCE POSITIVE FFO PER SHARE GROWTH IN 2020 RISING SECULAR DEMAND A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND A ROBUST PIPELINE POSITION AS WELL TO GROW SAFELY IN THE YEARS AHEAD NOW I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MS MANCINI FOR SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY ON HEALTHCARE TRENDS BETHANY THANK YOU THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR CONTINUES TO PROVE ITS RESILIENCE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE US POPULATION AND ECONOMY AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF EXPERIENCE WITH COVID-19 A HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS ARE NOW BETTER EQUIPPED WITH PROTOCOLS IN PLACE AND ADEQUATE PPE TO SERVE COVID PATIENTS AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDERS ARE MANAGING HIGHER DEMAND FROM THE DELAY OF SCHEDULED CARE SECOND QUARTER EMPLOYMENT GROWTH NUMBERS ARE SHOWING COVID UNPRECEDENTED IMPACT ON JOBS IN APRIL AND MAY WITH PROMISING SIGNS OF RECOVERY IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR FROM LATE MAY INTO JUNE AND CONTINUED POSITIVE MOMENTUM HEADING INTO THE THIRD QUARTER NOTABLY THE PACE OF RECOVERY IN THE AMBULATORY SECTOR INCLUDING PHYSICIAN OFFICES HAS DOUBLED THAT OF THE BROADER ECONOMY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE MEETING PENT UP DEMAND FOR ELECTIVE CARE AND THE RESURGENCE OF STRONG UTILIZATION TRENDS RETURNING TO MORE NORMALIZED LEVELS QUICKLY HR'S TENANTS ON AVERAGE ARE OPERATING NEAR FULL CAPACITY AND THEY ARE BETTER PREPARED TO PROVIDE ONGOING OUTPATIENT CARE EVEN IN THE EVENT OF A LOCAL SURGE TELEMEDICINE SERVED A CRITICAL ROLE IN APRIL AND MAY FOR MANY PROVIDERS THE EASING OF ITS RESTRICTIONS AND HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT HELPED SUSTAIN PATIENT CARE AND PHYSICIAN PRACTICE REVENUES DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE SHUTDOWN OF NON-EMERGENT CARE SINCE THEN PHYSICIAN OFFICES AND MOST OF OUR MARKETS HAVE RETURNED TO SEEING A MAJORITY OF PATIENTS IN PERSON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER EARLIER THIS WEEK TO REVIEW AND CONTINUE MEDICARE'S COVERAGE OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES AFTER WHICH CMS PROPOSED TO PERMANENTLY ALLOW MEDICARE PROVIDERS TO USE TELE-HEALTH FOR EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES ALONG WITH VISITS FOR SOME MENTAL HEALTH RELATED CARE DEPENDING ON REIMBURSEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS WE FORESEE TELEMEDICINE ALLOWING OUR TENANTS TO IMPROVE THEIR EFFICIENCY IN PROVIDING LOWER ACUITY SERVICES IT COULD SPUR GREATER ACCESS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES TO URBAN CARE CENTERS AND SUPPORT PROVIDERS IN GENERAL AS THEY MEET RISING DEMAND FOR HIGH ACUITY CARE FROM AN AGING POPULATION CMS REMAINS ACTIVE ON THE REGULATORY FRONT IN PURSUING SEVERAL MEDICARE COST SAVING INITIATIVES THESE INCLUDE HOSPITAL PRICING TRANSPARENCY SITE NEUTRAL PAYMENTS FOR OFF-CAMPUS HOSPITAL-BASED OUTPATIENT CARE AND THE ADDITION OF NEWLY COVERED SERVICES IN OUTPATIENT SETTINGS THESE INITIATIVES INCENTIVIZED CARE IN LOWER COST SETTINGS TYPICALLY IN MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS AND AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTERS AS WE APPROACH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WE CAN EXPECT HEATED PUBLIC DEBATE OVER ANOTHER ROUND OF FEDERAL STIMULUS AND COVID-19 RELIEF FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WE BELIEVE THE SECTOR IS POSITIONED WELL EVEN HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION TO CONTINUE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF RESPONDING TO COVID AND DELIVER THE UNDERLYING GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE SERVICES OUR POPULATION WILL NEED IN THE QUARTERS TO COME THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION FOR BOTH THE PRESIDENCY AND CONGRESS COULD IMPACT THE NATION'S MIX OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND EXPANSION OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID REGARDLESS OF ELECTION RESULTS WE EXPECT THE SHIFT OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY WILL CONTINUE TOWARD LOWER COST OUTPATIENT SETTINGS NOW I WILL TURN IT OVER TO ROB HALL FOR AN OVERVIEW OF INVESTMENT ACTIVITY ROB THANK YOU BETHANY HEALTHCARE REALTY'S INVESTMENT ACTIVITY DURING THE QUARTER CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS TWO DISTINCT PERIODS DEFENSE AT THE OUTSET AND BACK TO OFFENSE BY THE END OF THE QUARTER WE STARTED ON DEFENSE BY SHORING UP LIQUIDITY WITH AN AGREEMENT TO SELL TWO SINGLE TENANT NET LEASE PROPERTIES TO ST LOUIS-BASED MERCY FOR $244 MILLION OR $633 PER SQUARE FOOT WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IS THAT THIS TRANSACTION REPRESENTS A MEANINGFUL SHIFT OUT OF SLOWER GROWING PROPERTIES AND SMALLER MARKETS AND INTO ATTRACTIVE GROWING MSAS WITH SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE INVESTMENT ADDITIONALLY WE TOOK A DEEPER DIVE IN DUE DILIGENCE FOR ACQUISITIONS RATHER THAN TERMINATING CONTRACTS AND RISK LOSING SOLID DEALS BECAUSE OF COVID-19 FOR EXAMPLE WE DOUBLED THE LENGTH OF INSPECTION PERIODS TO MONITOR THE HEALTH AND STABILITY OF THESE PROPERTIES WE ALSO CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE TENANT INTERVIEWS OVER MULTIPLE BILLING CYCLES AND WE ANALYZE RENT COLLECTION AND DEFERRAL REQUESTS AT BUILDINGS UNDER CONTRACT COMPARED IT TO OUR OWN PORTFOLIO AND IT STACKED UP REALLY WELL THESE CRITICAL STEPS ALLOWED US TO SHIFT TO OFFENSE AS WE APPROACH THE THIRD QUARTER IN JULY WE CLOSED ON FOUR MOBS FOR $83 MILLION ONE PROPERTY MARKS OUR FIRST ACQUISITION IN THE SAN DIEGO MARKET A MARKET WHERE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE INVESTMENT ANOTHER IN LOS ANGELES WILL BENEFIT FROM THE HOSPITAL'S RECENT AFFILIATION WITH AA- RATED CEDAR SINAI HEALTH SYSTEM WHICH WILL PROVIDE AN INFUSION OF CAPITAL TO INCREASE HOSPITAL SERVICES IN THIS DENSE MARKET THE LAST TWO LOCATED IN ATLANTA AND SEATTLE REPRESENTS ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN ATTRACTIVE GROWTH MARKETS ON CAMPUSES WHERE WE OWN MULTIPLE PROPERTIES ALL THROUGH THE QUARTER OUR TEAM CONTINUED TO USE THEIR DEEP INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIPS TO SOURCE DEALS AND BUILD A PIPELINE EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF MARKETED TRANSACTIONS DECLINED WE NOW HAVE 10 BUILDINGS UNDER SIX SEPARATE CONTRACTS OR LETTERS OF INTENT FOR AN ADDITIONAL $163 MILLION THESE TARGETED ACQUISITIONS ARE LOCATED IN SIX MARKETS WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE WHE- WHERE WE ALREADY ARE INVESTED WE EXPECT TO CLOSE THESE DEALS BY YEAR END AND ALONG WITH PROPERTIES CLOSED IN JULY WE'LL FULLY REINVEST THE $244 MILLION OF MERCY PROCEEDS OUR RENEWED CONFIDENCE TO PROCEED WITH CLOSINGS AND A GROWING PIPELINE ARE DRIVING THE INCREASE IN OUR ACQUISITION GUIDANCE UP TO 300 TO 375 MILLION FOR THE YEAR WE EXPECT OUR AVERAGE CAP RATE TO REMAIN BETWEEN 5 AND 5.8% THE OUTLOOK FOR ACQUISITIONS REMAINS POSITIVE AS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT VISITS AND PROCEDURES AND MO- MOB RENT ROLLS ARE HOLDING UP ALLOWING SELLERS TO RETURN TO THE MODEL ALTHOUGH A FEW BUYERS ARE TEMPORARILY ON THE SIDELINES CAP RATES ARE STEADY AS INVESTOR DEMAND IS WIDE AND DEEP FOR THE STABLE CASH FLOWS FROM MOBS WHILE SEVERAL SIZEABLE PORTFOLIOS ARE AVAILABLE WE HAVEN'T FOUND THEM COMPELLING ENOUGH TO DEVIATE FROM OUR TARGETED PROCESS OF INVESTING IN ONE OR TWO BUILDINGS AT A TIME ON THE DEVELOPMENT FRONT WE ARE MAKING STEADY PROGRESS ON A $30 MILLION REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN MEMPHIS DURING THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC SEVERAL TENANTS EXPANDED THEIR SPACE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THE SURGERY CENTER AND A LARGE ORTHOPEDIC TENANT AS A RESULT THE LEASE PERCENTAGE HAS MOVED UP TO 94% DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2021 WE EXPECT EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTS TO BE COMPLETED AND THE BUILDINGS TO ANCHOR TENANT TO TAKE OCCUPIED THE REMAINDER OF THE SUITES WILL TAKE OCCUPANCY THROUGHOUT THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 202 THE PANDEMIC HAS DELAYED SOME DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSIONS BUT HOSPITALS ARE NOT ABANDONING LONG-TERM EXPANSION PLANS FOR EXAMPLE IN JULY A LEADING HEALTH SYSTEM IN TACOMA ANNOUNCED A $300 MILLION INVESTMENT IN A NEW BED TOWER AND NEXT WEEK HERE IN NASHVILLE ST THOMAS WILL BREAK GROUND ON ITS $300 MILLION EXPANSION WE ARE PLANNING REDEVELOPMENTS AT BOTH OF THESE CAMPUSES AND WE EXPECT TO START THESE PROJECTS SOON I AM PLEASED WITH OUR TEAMS ABILITY TO BUILD A SOLID INVESTMENT PIPELINE DURING THESE TIMES THEIR HARD WORK WILL LEAD TO TIMELY TO THE TIMELY REINVESTMENT OF PROCEEDS GENERATED FROM RECENT SALES AND POSITIONS AS WELL FOR CREATIVE GROWTH IN 202 NOW I WILL TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS TO DISCUSS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUARTER THANKS ROB SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE WAS STRONG AS COVID RELATED REVENUE IMPACTS WERE OFFSET BY OPERATING EXPENSE CONTROLS AND G&A REDUCTIONS NORMALIZED FFO PER SHARE OF 42 CENTS WAS AN INCREASE OF 5% OVER THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO BEFORE DIVING INTO THE SPECIFIC OPERATING METRICS FOR THE QUARTER I WILL TOUCH ON RENT COLLECTION AND DEFERRALS WE SAW SIGNIFICANT SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN MAY JUNE AND JULY THIS WAS THE RESULT OF A SWIFT REBOUND AND PATIENT VOLUMES FOLLOWING THE END OF GOVERNMENT MANDATED SHUTDOWNS EARLY IN THE QUARTER WE COLLECTED OVER 99% OF SECOND QUARTER RENT INCLUDING 2% OF DEFERRALS THESE DEFERRALS ARE TO BE PAYBACK IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR FOR JULY DEFERRALS WERE LESS THAN $100,000 OF OUR OF OUR OVER 40 MILLION IN MONTHLY RENT IN ADDITION OVER HALF OF DEFERRALS GRANTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER WERE REPAID EARLY SIGNALING HOW OUR TENANTS ARE GETTING BACK TO BUSINESS SCHEDULED RENT DEFERRAL PAYMENTS FOR JULY ARE TRACKING WELL AT 88% WHILE THIS IS PROMISING IT IS EARLY IN THE PROCESS SO WE TOOK A $730,000 BAD DEBT RESERVE REPRESENTING 25% OF OUTSTANDING DEFERRALS AT QUARTER END WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ANALYZE COLLECTIONS THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR AND ADJUST RESERVES ACCORDINGLY NOW SHIFTING TO OPERATING PERFORMANCE TRAILING 12 MONTH SAME-STORE NOI GREW 1.9% WHICH WAS IMPACTED BY LOCKDOWNS IN THE QUARTER IN THREE MAIN WAYS FIRST THERE WAS AN $800,000 SEQUENTIAL REDUCTION IN TRANSIENT PARKING INCOME PARKING VOLUMES RETURNED TO APPROXIMATELY 80% OF PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS BY THE END OF JUNE SECOND $673,000 OF THE TOTAL RENT DEFERRAL RESERVE WAS IN THE SAME-STORE PORTFOLIO AND THIRD AND MOST NOTABLE WAS A BENEFIT OF $1 MILLION FOR A REDUCTION AND NET OPERATING EXPENSES DUE TO LOWER BUILDING TRAFFIC IN THE QUARTER THE PRIMARY REDUCTIONS WERE IN MAINTENANCE AND UTILITIES WHICH EACH DECLINE OVER A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR AS UTILIZATION AND FOOT TRAFFIC HAS REBOUNDED IN JUNE AND JULY WE EXPECT OPERATING EXPENSES TO RETURN TO MORE CUSTOMARY THIRD QUARTER LEVELS INCLUDING TYPICAL SEASONAL UTILITIES BUT FOR THESE THREE IMPACTS TRAILING 12 MONTH SAME-STORE GROWTH WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS HIGHER NOI GROWTH IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD BE RELIABLY STRONG GIVEN THE MULTI-TENANT LEASING METRICS THIS QUARTER INCLUDING RETENTION OF 84.6% AVERAGE IN-PLACE CONTRACTUAL INCREASES OF 2.89% AND CASH LEASING SPREADS OF 4.5% IN THE QUARTER WE HAD 179,000 SQUARE FEET OF NEW LEASES TAKE OCCUPANCY LED BY GAINS AT SEVERAL REPOSITIONED AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES THIS LEVEL OF NEW LEASING EXCEEDED OUR HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 100,000 SQUARE FEET PER QUARTER LOOKING FORWARD GIVEN A SLOWDOWN IN LEASING TOURS EARLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER DUE TO LOCAL RESTRICTIONS WE COULD SEE LEASING DROP BELOW OUR HISTORICAL AVERAGE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR OUR SAME-STORE GUIDANCE REF- REFLECTS THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS IMPACT MOVING INTO 2021 WE EXPECT LEASING TO INCREASE AS TOURISTS HAVE ALREADY REBOUNDED TO PRE- COVID 19 LEVELS AND DEMAND FOR OUTPATIENT SPACE CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN NOW SHIFTING TO LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE OUR BAD DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO WAS 84% FOR THE QUARTER AND 93% FOR THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS WE EXPECT FULL YEAR 2020 TO BE IN THE LOW 90S AND NET DEBT TO EBITDA IMPROVED TO 5.1 TIMES INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF $33 MILLION OF EQUITY THROUGH THE ATM IN ADDITION WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD EQUITY CONTRACTS FOR AN ADDITIONAL $74 MILLION THESE PROCEEDS CAN BE DRAWN AT OUR ELECTION OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WE DON'T EXPECT TO DRAW ANY OF THE FORWARD EQUITY PROCEEDS UNTIL 21 GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR GROWING INVESTMENT PIPELINE OUR LIQUIDITY INCLUDES $44 MILLION OF CASH AT QUARTER END AND $244 MILLION FROM THE MERCY DISPOSITIONS WHICH CLOSED LAST WEEK OUR INVESTMENT IN THE MERCY PROPERTIES RESULTED IN AN UNLEVERED IRR OF 11.5% WHILE THE REINVESTMENT IN MULTI-TENANT MOBS AND MAJOR MSAS WILL IMPROVE THE DIVERSIFICATION AND GROWTH PROFILE OF OUR PORTFOLIO FOR EXAMPLE CONTRACTUAL ESCALATORS FOR THE MERCY ASSETS HAVE BEEN RUNNING 1.7% WHICH IS MORE THAN A HUNDRED BASIS POINTS BELOW OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO AND OUR ACQUISITION PIPELINE THE CAP RATE ROTATION UPON REINVESTMENT WILL RESULT IN A LITTLE MORE THAN 3 CENTS OF ANNUAL DILUTION THE TIMING OF THE REINVESTMENT THROUGH THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS WILL BRING FORWARD ALL OF THE THREE PLUS CENTS INTO 202 HOWEVER EVEN WITH THIS DILUTION AND THE COVID-19 IMPACTS DISCUSSED EARLIER WE ANTICIPATE POSITIVE FFO PER SHARE GROWTH IN 2020 AND WE'RE POSITIONED WELL FOR CONTINUED FFO PER SHARE GROWTH IN 21 AND BEYOND TODD THANK YOU CHRIS UH OPERATOR CHUCK WE WILL BE READY TO OPEN IT UP TO THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD THANK YOU WE WILL NOW BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION TO ASK A QUESTION YOU MAY

WE'VE GIVEN THE FIVE TO FIVE EIGHT PROBABLY DOWN IN THE YOU KNOW LOW TO MID FIVES IS IS WHERE ON AVERAGE THOSE ARE GONNA BE UM ARE YOU NICK- I GUESS I GUESS I'M MORE CURIOUS ON THE 100 YEAH THE 120 NEGOTIATION I MEAN WOULD YOU EXPECT TO CLOSE ON 100% OF THOSE OR WH- WHA- WHAT'S TYPICALLY THE FALLOUT FOR THE FOR THAT BUCKET OF UH POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS YEAH I MEAN I THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE 120 WE'VE WE'VE SAID THAT THERE ARE SOME IN THERE THAT WE THINK MIGHT CLOSE BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND THEN AND AND THEN MOVING INTO EARLY NEXT AND I WOULD SAY THE CAP RATES IN IN THOSE BUILDINGS UM ARE IN THE SIMILAR RANGE UH TO WHAT WE HAVE UNDER CONTRACT TO PIPELINE AND CERTAINLY IT'S EARLY AND AND WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THOSE SELLERS UM THERE ARE SOME THAT SOMETIMES MAY FALL OUT OR TAKE LONGER UH TO CLOSE ON BUT WE HAVE A GOOD LINE OF SIGHT ON THOSE AND ARE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THERE I I WOULD ADD TO THAT MAYBE NICK IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO OBVIOUSLY GIVE YOU AN A ONE PERCENTAGE PROBABILITY BUT IT- IT'S A RANGE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S NOT FIFTY FIFTY IF THAT HELPS YOU IT'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW NOT 100% AS ROB JUST SAID BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S IT'S UH 70 80% AT LEAST AND AND THE NICE THING IS I MEAN THOSE ARE ONES THAT ARE PRETTY FAR ALONG IN DISCUSSIONS THERE'S CLEARLY A LOT OF OTHER THINGS NOT IN THAT NUMBER THAT ARE A LITTLE FURTHER OUT THERE MAYBE NOT AS HIGHLY PROBABLE SO UH YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S THAT NUMBER IS IS A STRONG NUMBER UM JUST IN GENERAL IF YOU THINK ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY GOING INTO 2 THANKS THAT'S HELPFUL AND YOU MENTIONED THE PORTFOLIOS ON THE MARKET TODAY UM YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU MORE INTERESTED IS IT PRICING IS IT SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THE MIX OF ASSETS WITHIN THOSE UH THAT WOULD BE MORE INTERESTED IN EXECUTING ON THOSE UH YEAH I'D SAY THAT UM UH RATHER THAN PRICING JUST THE MARKETS AND THE SYSTEMS THAT THEY'RE UH ASSOCIATED WITH UM THE STRENGTH OF THOSE MARKETS THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH UM UH IS REALLY A A KEY PIECE UH THAT WE LOOK AT AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE YOU KNOW THE ON ADJACENT MAKEUP VERSUS VERSUS THE OFF MAKEUP UM TYPICALLY WHAT YOU SEE IS IS YOU KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROPERTIES A FEW PROPERTIES IN THERE THAT YOU REALLY LIKED BUT THEN THERE'S OTHER PROPERTIES IN THERE THAT YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THESE PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE OUT THERE THEY KIND OF FALL INTO NOW AND AND NICK I THINK AS WE'VE LOOKED WE'VE LOOKED AT PORTFOLIOS OVER THE YEARS WE ALSO RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T ALWAYS FIND THE PERFECT PORTFOLIO BY DEFINITION AND SO IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IS THERE A HIGH ENOUGH PROPORTION OF WHAT ROB DESCRIBED AS ATTRACTIVE ASSETS THAT WOULD BE WORTH YOU KNOW TAKING ON A FEW OF THOSE THINGS THAT THAT WE DON'T LIKE AS MUCH AND SO YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE ALWAYS STRUGGLED WITH THAT WE WE OBVIOUSLY THINK OUR PORTFOLIO REFLECTS A LOT OF THE QUALITY METRICS WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND WE WANNA IMPROVE THE AVERAGE BUT YOU KNOW IF 70 80% OF THE ASSETS REALLY FIT THEN I THINK IT MAKES SOME SENSE AND YOU KNOW THE <INAUDIBLE> TRANSACTION THE ATLANTA TRANSACTION UM THREE YEARS AGO YOU KNOW WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT UM YOU KNOW WE WE CERTAINLY LOOKED AT THE DUKE

HOPE TO MAINTAIN THAT LEVEL IF NOT IMPROVE IT EACH YEAR UM BUT YOU KNOW AS CHRIS ALSO TALKED ABOUT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF LEASING UH STRENGTHENING AS WE GO INTO THE LATER PART OF THIS YEAR AND INTO NEXT YEAR SO WE DO EXPECT THAT WHAT PROBABLY BENEFITED US FRANKLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND MAYBE UH EVEN IN THE THIRD WOULD BE A LITTLE LESS SPENDING ON TI UH BECAUSE OF THE SLOWDOWN IN LEASING WE SEE THAT PROBABLY PICKING RIGHT BACK UP LATER IN THE YEAR AND INTO NEXT YEAR SO YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO TELL UH EXACTLY WHERE WE'LL BE FOR 21 BUT WE LIKE THE DIRECTION GENERALLY WHERE WE'RE HEADED AND UH WE'LL WE'LL CERTAINLY HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THAT AS WE START PUTTING OUR PLANS TOGETHER FOR 21 LATER THIS YEAR OKAY GREAT UM AND THEN- TODD IS- SORRY GO AHEAD I THINK TODD'S RIGHT I WAS ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS JUST THE THE IDEA THAT WHERE WE ARE TERMS OF OUR CAPITAL OTHER THAN TI I I DON'T SEE ANY ANY MAJOR SHIFTS THERE UM BUT IF WE DON'T SEE THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IT WOULD BE TIED TO THAT UH BE TIED TO ABSORPTION AND NEW LEASING WHICH IS WHICH IS GREAT UM FOR LONGTERM IN TERMS OF OF UH EARNINGS AND SUCH BUT UH BUT COULD YOU KNOW SLOW THE MOMENTUM UM TEMPORARILY IN TERMS OF OF CONTINUED DRIVING THAT PAYOUT RATIO LOWER BUT LONG-TERM WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY MOVING IN THE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OKAY GREAT AND THEN JUST UM UH YOU KNOW ON THE A BIT MORE COLOR ON THE PIPELINE I KNOW IN THE PAST YOU'VE ALLUDED TO YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY LOOKING A BIT MORE AT OFF-CAMPUS UM I'M JUST WONDERING THROUGH COVID ARE THERE YOU KNOW HOW WAS THAT THOUGHT PROCESS CHANGED MAYBE GIVE US A SENSE OF THE PIPELINE MIX BETWEEN ON AND OFF AND AND ALSO JUST THROUGH COVID ARE THERE ANY OTHER MARKETS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF NEW INVESTMENTS OR OR DEVELOPMENT ROB YOU WANNA TOUCH ON MAYBE THE CURRENT PIPELINE AND AND WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE ON VERSUS OFF AND THEN I CAN ADD TO IT YEAH I THINK THAT UM WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AT THE CURRENT PIPELINE UH THE MAJORITY OF IT IS IS IN ON ON AN ADJACENT BUT THERE ARE A FEW ASSETS IN THERE THAT THAT KIND OF FALL INTO THE ON-CAMPUS CATEGORY UH BY OUR DEFINITION AND I THINK THOSE ARE KIND OF SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'VE HEARD US SAY IN THE PAST VIKRAM ABOUT STRONG MARKETS UM THAT ARE MARKETS WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE INVESTMENT UH AND UM YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S WHERE IF WE ARE GONNA GO OFF CAMPUS THAT'S WHERE YOU THINK WE WILL WE WILL DO THAT KIND OF INVESTING MARKETS THAT WE KNOW AND FAMILIAR WITH AND INVESTING IN OFF-CAMPUS ASSETS THAT ARE SORT OF PART OF THE PROVIDER PROVIDER NETWORK AND AND LEND ITSELF TO THAT RELATIONSHIP I I WOULD ADD ROB THAT THAT IN TERMS OF JUST THINKING DIFFERENTLY YOU KNOW POST- COVID OR OR NOW WE'RE STILL IN COVID BUT AS WE LOOK AHEAD I DON'T SEE THAT WE WOULD MAKE A TREMENDOUS CHANGE IN THE MARKETS THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER I THINK WITH THE ONES WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON BUILDING OUR PRESENCE IN STILL LOOK VERY ATTRACTIVE TO US YOU KNOW EVEN WITH WHAT'S GOING ON NOW UM OBVIOUSLY LIKE EVERYONE WE'RE GONNA BE WATCHING ALL THE TRENDS WE'RE NOT HEAVILY EXPOSED TO CERTAIN MARKETS IN THE NORTHEAST NEW YORK BOSTON UM YOU KNOW GREAT CITIES OBVIOUSLY BUT THERE ARE SOME SOME BIGGER TRENDS YOU KNOW CHALLENGES THAT THAT MAY COME YOU KNOW OVER TIME WITH WITH ALL THIS DEMAND AND SO FORTH UM LESS ABOUT HEALTHCARE THERE BUT I WOULD SAY WE REALLY LIKE SOME OF THE TECH UH YOU KNOW JOB UH CONCENTRATION THAT WE SEE IN A LOT OF THE MARKETS WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON I MEAN TWO OF THE MARKETS THAT WE'VE ADDED YOU KIND OF ASKED THAT QUESTION ABOUT ADDING MARKETS UH WE JUST ADDED SAN DIEGO AS ROB POINTED OUT IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN ADDING A BIT IN RALEIGH THE RALEIGH DURHAM AREA WHICH WE LIKED AS WELL UH BUT BUT MERELY 90% OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING 80 90% OF OF THE ACTIVITY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON OUR TOP 15 MARKETS SO IT'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE SAME MARKETS WE'VE BEEN BUILDING SCALE IN AND THEN OCCASIONALLY REACHING OUT LIKE I MENTIONED TO SAN DIEGO RALEIGH SOME OTHERS LIKE THAT THERE'S PROBABLY ROB FOUR OR FIVE YOU KNOW OTHER MARKETS WE'D CERTAINLY LOOK AT AND SEE SOME DEPTH IN BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S OUR OUR DEFINITELY LEANING TOWARDS THE MARKETS WE'RE CURRENTLY INVESTED IN GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VIKRAM OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM JORDAN SADLER WITH KEY- KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU UM FIRST I JUST WANNA FOLLOW UP ON THE UH THE PIPELINE I'M NOT SURE IF I'M OVERLY READING INTO YOUR COMMENTARY BUT UH IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU MENTIONED THE LARGE AND GROWING PIPELINE IS THERE POTENTIALLY MORE BEHIND THIS OR ARE THERE A HANDFUL OF LARGER DEALS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT CAUSE I'M NOTICING YOU KNOW YOU'VE TAKEN THE LEVERAGE ON A PRO FORMA BASIS QUITE LOW AND I KNOW IT'S A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT SO IT DOES MAKE SENSE BUT UH I'M GUESSING PRO FORMA LEVERAGE WITH FORWARD EQUITY AND GAIL AND MERCY LIKE THOSE ARE THE FOUR TIMES THOSE DIRECTLY COME ALONG SO KIND OF CURIOUS WHAT WHAT YOU'RE YOU KNOW TEED UP FOR YEAH I WOULD SAY ON THE ON THE PIPELINE JORDAN UM YOU KNOW OUR TEAM IS IS IS ALWAYS BUILDING AND AND ADDING TO OUR PIPELINE AND WE WE TAKE THE APPROACH OF YOU KNOW I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE CLOSED ON THIS YEAR ABOUT 80% OF THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER YOU KNOW ALL FOR LIGHTLY MARKETED DEALS SO OUR TEAM IS OUT THERE CONSTANTLY DEVELOPING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WE'VE IDENTIFIED BUILDINGS THAT WE WANT TO OWN AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE DIALOGUE WITH THE SELLERS OR OR OR BROKERS IN THOSE MARKETS THAT THAT UH WE WE TRUST AND AND YOU KNOW ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO TO GET THOSE SELLERS TO THE TABLE SO WE WE THINK THAT BEHIND WHAT WE'VE LAID OUT HERE CERTAINLY THERE'S THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THE GROWTH IN THE PIPELINE UH COMING AND SETTING US UP WELL FOR FOR 202 SO UM I THINK THAT'S WHY WE WE HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE DO BECAUSE WE SEE THE DIALOGUE UH THAT OUR TEAM IS HAVING WITH THESE THESE SELLERS THAT ARE THAT ARE SORT OF BEHIND WHAT WE'VE LAID OUT HERE AND JORDAN I I WOULD ADD TO THAT I DO THINK I MEAN I THINK MAYBE WHAT'S IN YOUR QUESTION TOO IS SORT OF YOU KNOW ARE WE PREPARING FOR SOMETHING BIGGER I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT I MEAN IN SOME WAYS YES BUT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CHANGE OF STRIPES FOR US I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH STICKING TO WHAT ROB JUST DESCRIBED REALLY GOING AFTER AND TARGETING WHAT WE WANT RATHER THAN YOU KNOW WAITING ON THE MARKETED DEALS THAT SAID OF COURSE WE WE LOOK AT THE MARKETED DEALS AND IF THEY MEASURE UP WE CERTAINLY GO AFTER THEM AND IT'S NOT YOU KNOW WE WE CERTAINLY ARE ENCOURAGED THAT UM YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO YOU KNOW GO AFTER SOME SOME DEALS IF WE CAN IN THIS SITUATION WHERE WE WE SEEM YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO AS YOU SAID HAVE THE CAPITAL THE RESOURCES BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN WE'RE GONNA PROBABLY STICK TO YOU AS YOU YOU WOULD KNOW US TO DO STICK TO THE QUALITY SIDE OF THINGS UM BUT WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY YOU KNOW THE PRODUCTIVITY AND THE EFFECTIVENESS THAT ROB DESCRIBED OF SUSTAINING A HIGHER LEVEL OF ACQUISITION I THINK THAT'S THE KEY AND REALLY DRI YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF OF PRUDENT GROWTH OR EXTERNAL GROWTH IN ADDITION TO OUR INTERNAL GROWTH TO KIND OF WORK THAT ALGORITHM OF FFO GROWTH PER SHARE IS A MIX AND I KNOW I THINK IT WAS YOU JUST YOU JUST SPOKE TO A QUESTION OF A SIMILAR THING BUT IS A MIXED KIND OF SKEW CONTINUE TO SKEW TOWARD THE ADJACENT TYPE ASSETS YOU THINK I CERTAINLY THINK WE WILL WE WILL SKEW TOWARDS ON AN ADJACENT UM VERSUS OFF BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE OKAY WITH OFF I THINK ROB TOUCHED ON THAT WE ARE OKAY WITH THAT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW TODAY WE SIT CLOSER TO ALMOST 90% ON AN ADJACENT UM WE HAVE DONE A FAIR BIT OF ADJACENT UM AS YOU KIND OF POINT OUT AND AND SOMETIMES YOU KNOW WHAT YOU FIND IS THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO IN AND TARGET AND GET UM UM YOU KNOW REALLY GET THOSE ASSETS MORE REGULARLY AND YOU KNOW THE ON-CAMPUS IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE YOU'RE WAITING FOR THOSE HOSPITALS TO LET THAT GO TYPICALLY SO UH WE REALLY LIKED THE DYNAMIC THAT OF ON AN ON AN ADJACENT AND AND I COULD SEE YOU KNOW THE OFF FLUCTUATING I THINK WE WE MAYBE LAST YEAR HIT AROUND 25% UM YOU KNOW OFF SO WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT IT'S STILL GONNA SKEW THAT WAY TOWARDS ON AN ON AN ADJACENT THOUGH OKAY AND THEN LASTLY LIKE UM MAYBE FOR CHRIS ON THE CAP RATES UM I- I'VE GOT THE CASH CAP RATES I'M KIND OF CURIOUS YOU MENTIONED THE ESCALATORS ON MERCY UM CAN YOU GIVE ME THE GAP CAP RATE ON THAT AT DISPOSITION AND THEN UH I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE ESCALATORS AND GAP CAP LOOK ON THE ACQUISITION AS WELL YEAH ON UM ON MERCY THE THE GAP AND CASH WERE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE SAME BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT AT THE MIDPOINT OF THE OF THE LEASE TERM UM SO THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF RIGHT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER UM IN TERMS OF THE THE NEW ACQUISITIONS THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ESCALATORS AS I MENTIONED ARE PRETTY SIMILAR TO WHAT OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO IS YOU KNOW THAT TWO EIGHT TO TWO NINE RANGE UM IN TERMS OF ESCALATORS AND UH YOU KNOW IT IT VARIES ON THE IMPACT OF THE GAP UH BASED OFF OF THE TERM THAT IS INSIDE OF OUR ACQUISITIONS BUT BUT IN GENERAL WE TYPICALLY SAY THE GAP ADDS ABOUT 25 TO 50 BASIS POINTS UM UH TO THE TO THE CAP RATE ON A GAP BASIS UH IN OUR ACQUISITIONS OKAY THANKS FOR CLARIFYING OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM LUCAS HEART- HEARTRICH WITH GREEN STREET ADVISORS PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS EVERYONE FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING UH THIS IS JOHN ON FOR LUCAS UH JUST A QUICK ONE FROM ME UH JUST LOOKING AT THE IMPROVEMENTS IN YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE CASH RELEASING SPREADS ON THE MULTI-TENANT SIDE UH YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEHIND THAT OPTIMISM UH I'LL SAY THE USA TRENDS ARE PRETTY FAVORABLE AND JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME OUTSIDE THERE AS WELL UH THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE CHANGE IN OUR GUIDANCE ON UM ON THE CASH LEASING SPREADS WE DID CHANGE IT THIS QUARTER COMPARED TO LAST BUT THAT REALLY WAS JUST KIND OF BRINGING IT BACK MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAD SEEN PRE- COVID UM LAST QUARTER WE WE WERE TAKING WE DIDN'T WANNA BE OVERLY AGGRESSIVE UM YOU KNOW NOT HAVING UH A LOT OF OF LEASING DATA UH IN THE MIDST OF OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND SO WE HAD TAKEN UM HAD TAKEN DOWN OUR EXPECTATIONS BUT AS UH AS WE UH WORKED RELEASES DURING THE QUARTER AND CONTINUED OUR DISCUSSIONS UM YOU KNOW THINGS HAVE HAVE REALLY SHOWN UH UM GREAT UM YOU KNOW RESILIENCE AND SO UH OUR EXPECTATIONS IS THAT OUR CASH LEASING SPREADS WE'LL BE ABLE TO KIND OF MAINTAIN WHAT WE HAD BEEN SEEING PREVIOUSLY UM WHICH LONGTERM WE SAY WE WE EXPECT UH THREE TO FOUR UH AND AND SO WE'RE WE'RE UH SO FAR WE'RE SEEING THAT UH THOSE TYPES OF METRICS ARE ARE HOLDING UP WELL AND OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM RICH ANDERSON WITH SMBC PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS EVERYBODY GOOD MORNING UM SO ONE THING WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IS UM THE RISK GOING FORWARD OF REINFECTION AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IN MANY OF THE STATES THAT YOU TRAFFIC AND WE'RE WE'RE SEEING SOME UPTICK BUT NO NO TALK OF SORT OF A A REVERSAL OF YOU KNOW ELECTIVE SURGERY UH SHUTDOWNS AND WHATNOT UM CAN YOU CAN YOU DISCUSS THAT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW HOW YOU'RE SEEING THAT PLAY OUT I MEAN EVEN THOUGH THE AVAILABILITY OR OR STATES ARE ALLOWING FOR UH ELECTIVE SURGERIES ARE PEOPLE REALLY JUMPING IN AND AND DOING IT AND IS THERE A RISK THAT YOU KNOW A MONTH OR SO FROM NOW WE COULD BE HAVING ANOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT SHUTTING IT DOWN RICH I IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK WE ALL SORT OF HAVE THAT UNEASE YOU KNOW GOING INTO THE FALL I THINK COLLECTIVELY THAT YOU KNOW THINGS CAN CHANGE AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE FLU SEASON COMING AND AND THINGS GET WORSE TYPICALLY IN THE WINTER SO IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I DO THINK YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANNA BE GLIB ABOUT THE OPTIMISM BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A LONG ROAD HERE AND UM YOU KNOW MAYBE THE TOUGHEST TIME AHEAD OF US THE GOOD NEWS IS I THINK IS I THINK BETHANY POINTED OUT AND I POINTED OUT AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THERE'S JUST BEEN A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT ON TREATMENTS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS AND SO I THINK WE WE ALL FEARED OBVIOUSLY IN THE FRONT END THAT HOSPITALS WOULD JUST BE TOTALLY OVERWHELMED AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS TESTED IN A COUPLE OF PLACES INCLUDING NEW YORK AND AND I THINK THE GOOD NEWS IS WE CAME OUT ON THE BETTER END OF WHAT WE ALL FEARED AND SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE SEEING IT AS YOU SAID IN HOTSPOTS YOU KNOW HOUSTON WENT THROUGH IT AND YOU'RE SEEING DIFFERENT PLACES UM AND AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY THEY SEEM TO BE HANDLING IT AND IT'S NOT CREATING THESE LONG LENGTHY SHUTDOWNS YOU KNOW YOU DID SEE IN TEXAS THE GOVERNOR TRYING TO PUSH YOU KNOW SOME SOME AGAIN YOU KNOW POLICIES THERE BUT IT REALLY ACTUALLY WAS A BIT OF A CARVE OUT FOR ASCS YOU KNOW IN SOME OF THE OUTPATIENT SURGERIES IT WAS MORE ABOUT PROTECTING THAT INPATIENT CAPACITY SO I DO THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT WE DO HAVE TO BRACE FOR THAT UM IN TERMS OF HOTSPOTS I DON'T THINK IT'S YOU KNOW NATIONWIDE SHUT IT ALL DOWN THE WAY IT WAS EARLY ON IT'S GONNA BE MUCH MORE TARGETED AND YOU KNOW I'M I'M NO EXPERT ANY MORE THAN ANYBODY ON THE PHONE BUT AS WE WATCH THIS MOVE AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF IT'S THE HOTSPOT IT'S THESE YOU KNOW FIRES THAT KIND OF COME UP AND THEN BURN OUT AND I HOPE THAT CONTINUES TO YOU KNOW YOU KNOW BE QUELLED YOU KNOW AND AND CONTAINED BUT UM I I THINK IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND EVEN THOUGH WE MIGHT YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE SOME SOME ISSUES I THINK WE'RE ENCOURAGED I MEAN THE PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT REPORT THEIR SURGERY NUMBERS HAVE BEEN REALLY INCREDIBLE UM SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S A BIG HESITATION TO COME BACK AND DO IT IT'LL JUST BE A MATTER OF YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO SORT OF TREAT THIS IN A TARGETED WAY RATHER THAN A BLANKET WAY AND AND WE THINK THAT WILL BE THE CASE OKAY UM MY SECOND QUESTION UH AND LAST QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY UM LOOKS LIKE AFTER THIS IS ALL DONE I MEAN WOULD YOU SAY THE HOSPITAL IN BUSINESS NOT THE MEDICAL OFFICE BUSINESS PER SE BUT THE HOSPITAL BUSINESS IS WEAKENED BY ALL THIS UM IN THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW WE KIND OF WENT IN OVER HOSPITALS UH TO BEGIN WITH AND AND AND MAYBE THIS FAST TRACKS SOME CONSOLIDATION OR CLOSINGS THAT PROBABLY OR MAYBE WOULD'VE JUST HAPPENED EVENTUALLY UH I'M JUST WONDERING IF IF YOU THINK SORT OF PICKING YOUR YOUR YOUR UM YOUR RELATIONSHIPS BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN THE AFTERMATH BECAUSE HOS THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY OVERALL IS IS PROBABLY A NOTCH WEAKER BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S FAIR A FAIR ASSESSMENT AND GOOD COMMENTARY WE WE WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH OUR BOARD EARLIER THIS WEEK ABOUT THAT WITH SEVERAL HEALTH SYSTEM LEADERS THERE ON OUR BOARD AND AND AND I THINK IT'S WHAT YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA IT'S IT'S A CLASSIC YOU KNOW PROBLEM THAT THESE CRISES JUST LIKE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS CAUSED THE STRONG ARE GONNA GET STRONGER THE WEAK ARE GONNA GET WEAKER AND THERE'S DIFFERENT DYNAMICS TO THAT BUT IN THE HOSPITAL WELL THAT'S VERY TRUE AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE SEEING AN HCA DO EXTREMELY WELL YOU KNOW COMING THROUGH THIS AND I THINK THEY THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF FIGURING IT OUT AND AND THERE'S A LOT OF NOT-FOR-PROFIT SYSTEMS THAT ARE LEADERS IN THEIR MARKETS I DO THINK THE STRENGTH AND AND SCALE MATTERS UM LARGER SYSTEMS VERSUS SMALL INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW MORE MORE URBAN UH VERSUS IN SUBURBAN VERSUS RURAL IS GONNA BE A HUGE TREND I KNOW THAT THAT THE TREND OF MOVING INTO THE CITIES EVERYBODY'S QUESTIONING A LITTLE BIT BUT I STILL THINK THOSE STRONG UM YOU KNOW POPULATION GROWTH CENTERS ARE GONNA BE WHERE YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE SUCCESS AND SO I DO THINK YOU ARE CORRECT THAT PICKING THE RIGHT PARTNERS WILL MATTER MORE BEING A SHARP SHOOTER WILL WILL CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN HONING EVER SINCE WE SORT OF FOUND THAT TREND TO BE TRUE FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS EVEN BEFORE SO IT IT'S TRUE I I DO THINK YOU'RE RIGHT HOSPITAL'S PROBABLY TAKEN YOU KNOW THEY'VE CLEARLY TAKEN A HIT AND WERE HELPED A LOT BY THE CARES ACT UM AND CMS IN GENERAL BUT I DO THINK WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT THE STRONG ONES I MEAN THIS IS A DEMAND NEED BASED BUSINESS YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T JUST UH YOU KNOW SELLING UH LUXURY ITEMS IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH NEED-BASED AND SO THERE'S A HUGE NEED FOR IT INPA BECAUSE I MADE MY COMMENTS OR REMARK THAT I MEAN HOSPITALS ARE PROVING THAT THEY'RE SO CRITICAL AND I THINK THE ACUITY LEVEL OF HOSPITALS IS ONLY GONNA CONTINUE TO CLIMB AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE ACUITY LEVEL WITH OUTPATIENT CLIMB BOTH ON AND OFF CAMPUS IT'S A CONTINUUM AND I THINK UM YOU KNOW ALL THOSE INNOVATIONS WILL CONTINUE AND UH IT WILL BE MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A WINNER VERSUS LOSER AT GAME AND AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY WELL-POSITIONED TO TO FOLLOW THAT TREND AND AND RELATED TO THAT RESPONSE THANKS TODD THAT WAS GREAT UM DO YOU THINK THE LONG AWAITED MONETIZATION OF HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL OFFICE WILL WILL BE YOU KNOW MORE OF A REALISTIC OUTCOME OF THIS EVEN FOR STRONGER HOSPITALS THAT MAYBE ARE NOW TAKING ON YOU KNOW MORE MARKET SHARE NEED MORE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND SO ON IS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN FINALLY SAY <LAUGH> WELL NOT NOT NOT TO GET RELIGIOUS BUT IT'S LIKE TESTING OUR FAITH RIGHT IN THIS THEORY <LAUGH> AND IT'S JUST WE GOTTA KEEP THE HOPE ALIVE RIGHT UM WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN IT IS THE REAL ANSWER UM IT HAS ALL THE MAKINGS TO SUGGEST THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLY TRUE UM WE HAVE A VERY CONTRADICTING DATA POINT HERE WITH THE MERCY TRANSACTION THAT WE JUST DID A LITTLE BIT OF A SPECIFIC SITUATION WHERE THEY HAD A PROPENSITY YOU KNOW TO TO WANT TO OWN THEIR ASSETS UH SO A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT WE'VE HEARD OF A FEW OTHER ANECDOTES JUST RECENTLY OF SOME OTHER HOSPITALS DOING SIMILAR THINGS SO UH YOU KNOW HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THINK STRATEGICALLY VERY DIFFERENTLY THEY DON'T FOCUS I MEAN AS THEY SHOULD THEY FOCUS ON PROVIDING CARE AND AND AND ALL THE THINGS THEY NEED TO DO TO EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS AND SUCCEED THEY'RE NOT SITTING AROUND THINKING ABOUT CAP RATES FOR MOBS BUT I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE THERE ARE GONNA BE SOME MORE OF THOSE IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM YOUR STRESSED SYSTEMS AND SO THEN WEEDING THROUGH THAT BACK TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION FIGURING OUT IS IT WORTH IT IS IT THE RIGHT SYSTEMS TO BE WITH IS THE QUESTION FOR THAT RIGHT RIGHT GREAT THANKS VERY MUCH THANKS THANKS RICH THE NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM JOHN CHEN WITH BMO CAPITAL PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS GOOD MORNING UM TODD IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS UM YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED NOI TRENDING BACK AT 3% WHICH IS CERTAINLY AGAINST RECENT TRENDS OF NOT ONLY HR BUT OTHER MOB LEADS I'M JUST WONDERING UM IF YOU COULD JUST DISCUSS YOUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL IN THAT STATEMENT AND IF THAT'S BEING DRIVEN BY OCCUPANCY PICKING UP OR LEASING SPREADS ON ON LEASES THAT YOU'RE NEGOTIATING NOW I I THINK THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS AND CHRIS ALWAYS HITS THIS IT'S THAT OUR AVERAGE CONTRACTUAL RENT BUMP ACROSS YOU KNOW MULTI-TENANT AND SINGLE TENANT IS 2.83% IT'S 2.89 FOR THE MULTI-TENANT SO THAT'S THAT'S THE DRIVER OF OF OUR SAME STORE GROWTH AND AND WHAT CHRIS ALWAYS WALKS THROUGH IS OKAY WE WE GREW THE REVENUE AT THAT LEVEL AND THEN AT YOUR RIGHT YOU YOU ADVANCED THAT BALL A LITTLE BIT WITH CASH LEASING SPREADS BUT THAT'S A PRETTY SMALL PIECE OF THE PIE EACH YOU KNOW QUARTER OR YEAR UM SO YOU YOU DO HELP THAT YOU DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW TURNOVER AS WELL THAT KIND OF HURTS THAT BUT THE REVENUE MODEL IS MORE OF A YOU KNOW HIGH TWOS KIND OF NUMBER AND THEN REALLY IT BECOMES YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR EXPENSES DOING AND HOW MUCH OPERATING LEVERAGE DO YOU HAVE YOUR MARGIN AND SO THAT'S THE ALGORITHM WE SEE THAT GETS US THERE PRETTY CONSERVATIVELY WITH IT BUT IT'S REALLY THE BIG DRIVER IS IS OUR REVENUE MODEL OF OUR ESCALATORS AND AND WE CONTINUE TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT THE CASH LEASING SPREADS HELP WITH THE MARGIN ABSOLUTELY AND AND AS CHRIS TALKED YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING TO TRY TO DRIVE ABSORPTION AS WE GO INTO 21 AND THAT WILL HELP ALSO BUT EVEN WITHOUT A LOT OF UH OF INCREASED ABSORPTION YOU CAN SEE SAME-STORE UH NOI GROWTH RUNNING YOU KNOW AROUND THREE AND HOW DOES FREE RENT UH IMPACT THIS NUMBER CAUSE I IMAGINE YOU'RE OFFERING MORE FREE RENT OR YOU BEEN MORE RECENTLY CHRIS DO YOU WANNA TOUCH ON THAT YEAH I MEAN OBVIOUSLY FREE RENT WILL GO INTO IT IF IF IF YOU HAVE A LARGER PERCENT A PERCENTAGE OF IT VERSUS WHAT YOU HAD BEFORE BUT I'LL SAY GENERALLY NO WE'RE NOT ADDING A LOT OF FREE RENT UM YOU KNOW WE REALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH IF ANY INSIDE OF OUR RENEWALS IF WE'RE IF WE'RE DOING IT AT ALL IT IT TYPICALLY IS INSIDE OF OF NEW LEASING UM AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE THAT UH WITH THE NEW LEASING IT JUST KIND OF CREATES A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY BEFORE YOU SEE THE THE THE REVENUE IMPACT FROM THAT ABSORPTION UM BUT UH BUT OVERALL NO WE'VE WE'VE NOT SEEN UM A MARKED EXPANSION OF OF FREE RENT OKAY AND THEN UH MAYBE I'LL ASK NICK JOSEPH'S QUESTION A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY UM I THINK YOU MENTIONED $150 MILLION OF ACQUISITIONS YOU HAD UNDER CONTRACT AND NOW YOU'VE CLOSED $83 MILLION POST QUARTER UM ARE YOU STILL ON TRACK TO CLOSE THAT REMAINING 70 MILLION OR SO OR HAVE ANY OF THOSE DEALS FALLEN APART UH YES WE'RE STILL ON TRACK TO TO CLOSE THOSE UM I THINK WE'VE GOT UM I THINK I MENTIONED WE HAVE 163 MILLION UM THAT'S EITHER UNDER CONTRACT OR OR LOI SO WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY IN- INCREASED THAT UNDER CONTRACT AMOUNTS SINCE SINCE THE LAST TIME AND AND I THINK ROB TOO YOU SAID AND WE WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL CLOSE THOSE TWO CATEGORIES UNDER CONTRACT NOI BY YEAR END WHICH IS WHAT WILL- YES HELP US GET THOSE MERCY PROCEEDS REINVESTED BY YEAR END RIGHT AND THE FOUR ADJACENT UH ACQUISITIONS UH YOU YOU MENTIONED ARE JUST A-RATED HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE THOSE HEALTH SYSTEMS AT ALL TENANTS IN THE BUILDINGS REQUIRED UM THEY HAVE I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE HAVE CERTAINLY HAVE PHYSICIANS THAT ARE YOU KNOW UTILIZING THE HOSPITAL UM NEXT DOOR UM I THINK THERE'S ONE WHERE THE HOSPITAL UM IS IS NOT A TENANT BUT BUT ALL THE OTHERS ARE ARE TENANT BY THE HOSPITAL THANK YOU THANKS JOHN OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM TODD STENDER WITH WELLS FARGO PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS UH PROBABLY IN ORDER JUST TO STICK WITH THAT LAST THEME ABOUT THE THE ASSETS UNDER A CONTRACT AND MAYBE THIS IS FOR ROB UM CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE CONDITION OF THOSE BUILDINGS I KNOW HISTORICALLY YOU GUYS ARE PREPARED TO PUT SOME REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS INTO THEM UM BUT IN THE CONTEXT THAT MAYBE TODD WHAT YOU WERE SPEAKING TO MAYBE TIS COME DOWN MAYBE JUST GETTING SOME BROADER THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS ARE ALLOCATING CAPITAL THANKS YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT UM THE ASSETS THAT WERE ON A CONTRACT TO TO PURCHASE AN ROI I MEAN THEY'RE ALL IN IN GOOD CONDITION I MEAN WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO INVEST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL UM INTO ANY OF THEM AS AN AS A REDEVELOPMENT PLAY IF THAT'S IF THAT'S ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION IT IS THANK YOU AND AND MAYBE FOR TODD UM DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT MAYBE EXPECTATIONS OF LOWER TIS COMING DOWN THE ROAD I THINK THAT'S A 2020 PHENOMENON WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY SUGGESTING THAT UM LOOKING INTO 2 WE ACTUALLY THINK IT SHOULD REBOUND TO SORT OF HISTORICAL LEVELS IN RELATIONSHIPS UM AND AND ALL THAT IS IS IS WHAT WE'VE HEARD SOME OTHERS SAY TOO WE HAD SLOWER TOURS AND AND NEW LEASING ACTIVITY WITH NEW PERSPECTIVE MET NEW TENANTS THAT CREATE ABSORPTION WHICH IS WHERE YOU HAVE HIGHER TI SPEND UH IN IN THE SECOND QUARTER YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY APRIL AND EVEN A LITTLE IN MAY AND THEREFORE YOU GET THIS LAG EFFECT OF WHEN THOSE TENANTS WOULD NORMALLY TAKE OCCUPANCY AND THAT'S PROBABLY A THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER PHENOMENON SO IT'S REALLY A BACK HALF ISSUE AND EVEN A LITTLE BIT YOU SAW IT IN THE SECOND QUARTER SO UM YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL WE'RE SAYING AND THEN BACK TO SORT OF NORMALIZE LEVELS IN 2 OKAY I WOULD CLARIFY THAT TOO OF YOU KNOW THA- THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ON THE PERSPECTIVE LEASING FRONT WHAT TODD'S TALKING ABOUT OF OF AND WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE- YEAH WHAT WE'VE KIND OF RUN IN DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE SCENARIO THAT THAT YES WE COULD SEE A LITTLE BIT LESS ABSORPTION HERE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS AND THEN REBOUNDING UM WHICH COULD HAVE AN IMPACT BUT THEN ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF TOTAL SPENDING YOU START LOOKING AT FAD RIGHT NOW WE ARE RUNNING UM AT THE LOW END AND FRANKLY A LITTLE BELOW THE LOW END OF OUR GUIDANCE RANGE UH AS IT RELATES TO SECOND GEN TI UM AND SO THERE'S JUST TIMING THAT IS ALWAYS RELATED TO THAT UH SO THAT MAY YOU KNOW PICK UP CERTAINLY WE THINK WE'LL BE IN THE RANGE BACK TO YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY NEAR THE MIDPOINT OF THE RANGE UM AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WHAT IS PLAYING INTO THE GUIDANCE AS AS IT RELATES TO UH DEFAD IN MY PREPARED REMARKS I'VE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE ARE ARE RUNNING SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW UM WHERE WE ARE ON A ON A TRAILING 12 MONTH BASIS BUT UM YOU KNOW WE DO THINK THAT THAT CAN PICK UP IN THE LATER HALF OF THE YEAR AND AND WHAT DRIVES OUR OUR VIEW THAT UH OUR FAD PAYOUT RATIO WILL WILL PROBABLY END UP THE YEAR DOWN IN THE IN THE LOW 90'S UH NOT IN THE LOW 80'S THAT YOU SAW THIS QUARTER SO I JUST WANTED TO TO CLARIFY THAT POINT THAT'S HELPFUL BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING U- ULTIMATELY WITH THIS IS SEEING THAT FAD PAYOUT RATIO DECLINED AND AND IN THE IN THE SPIRIT OF SEEING MAYBE SOME DIVIDEND GROWTH AT SOME POINT UM BUT MAYBE IT DOESN'T SHAKE OUT THAT LOW OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL ALL RIGHT THAT'S IT FOR ME THANK YOU THANKS TODD THE NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM TAYO OKUSEYA WITH MIZUHO PLEASE GO AHEAD OH YES GOOD MORNING EVERYONE UH CONGRATS ON THE TRANSACTION IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME UH MY FOCUS IS REALLY ON THE OUTLOOK FOR THE MOBS I I THINK YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER ON THAT UH YOU KNOW HOSPITALS IN GENERAL AND ASSOCIATE LEVEL THEY SEEM TO BE DOING WELL WHEN WE KIND OF YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT HCA RESULTS AND SOME OF THE OTHER HOSPITAL OPERATORS BUT A LOT OF THAT IS ALSO KIND OF DUE TO THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GRANTS THEY'VE KIND OF RECEIVED OVER THIS PERIOD AS WELL UH COULD YOU JUST KIND OF TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT KIND OF IN A WORLD WHERE THERE ARE NO GRANTS OR IN A WORLD WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE THAT SOURCE OF GOVERNMENT FUNDING IS IS DECREASED MAYBE IN THE NEXT YOU KNOW ACT THAT UH THAT CONGRESS ENACTS YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU KIND OF SEE HAPPENS IN THAT WORLD I MEAN SPECIFICALLY COULD WE START TO SEE DEFERRALS GOING UP AGAIN OR OR YOU KNOW WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TO JUST KIND OF EXPAND ON THAT WELL IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S ALL SPECULATION OBVIOUSLY TAYO BUT IT'S IT'S INTERESTING UM YOU KNOW I THINK WE SAW THE MOST EXTREME THING HOPEFULLY THAT WE'LL EVER SEE UH IN OUR LIFETIMES RIGHT BUT MAYBE NOT UH- AMEN TO THAT RIGHT RIGHT SO YOU KNOW APRIL WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY EXTREME AND AND CLEARLY THE GOVERNMENT STEPS IN AND WE JUST HOPE YOU KNOW WE DON'T SEE THAT AGAIN BUT I THINK WE'VE AS I MENTIONED WE'VE LEARNED A LOT AND I THINK WE LEARNED THAT HOSPITALS UH YOU KNOW GOOD OR BAD YOU KNOW HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS THEY REALLY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ON THE ELECTIVE UH PROCEDURE SIDE IN SURGERIES AND WHEN THAT WAS SHUT DOWN I MEAN YOU'RE CUTTING OFF THE MOST PROFITABLE SEGMENT OF THE BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE IT IT'S IT'S A LITTLE COLD TO SAY THAT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE ONLY DOING THEY'RE THEY'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE DOING WHAT'S NECESSARY BUT IT IS NECESSARY THERE'S A TON OF THAT NEED AND SO WHEN YOU CUT OFF THAT LIFEBLOOD IF YOU WILL UH IT REALLY HURTS THE SYSTEM SO I THINK NOW IF YOU GO BACK TO THE DISCUSSIONS EARLIER WHERE IT'S MORE OF A TARGETED APPROACH AND MAYBE YOU KNOW FOR A SHORT PERIOD IN HOUSTON THEY THEY ASKED YOU KNOW FOR SOME ELECTIVE PROCEDURES TO BE TO BE YOU KNOW REDUCED AND AND NOT EVEN IN ALL AFCS BUT IN HOSPITALS SO I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE A MORE TARGETED APPROACH UM RATHER THAN THE SORT OF ABSOLUTE YOU KNOW MONTH LONG OR MORE SHUTDOWNS SO IT SHOULD THEREFORE IT SHOULDN'T BE QUITE AS FINANCIALLY DIFFICULT UM YOU KNOW IS IT GONNA BE TOUGH YEAH JUST LIKE SCHOOL SCHOOLS FOR A LOT OF US YOU KNOW WITH KIDS AND IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH YOU KNOW AS SOON AS THEY SHUT DOWN THE SCHOOL FOR A WEEK TWO OR SOMETHING OR OR EVEN IF YOU'RE LUCKY IF THEY'RE OPEN SO THERE'S GONNA BE EBBS AND FLOWS AS I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS BUT I THINK WE'RE MUCH BETTER SHAPE TODAY THAN WE WERE WHEN WE KNEW VERY LITTLE IN MARCH SO I DON'T THINK IT'S AS DIRE AS YOU KNOW WE COULD ALL FEAR BUT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S NEVER DAVID EMORY USED TO ALWAYS SAY IT'S NEVER AS GOOD OR AS BAD AS IT MAY SEEM AND THAT'S PROBABLY VERY APPROPRIATE HERE IT IT IT WILL BE NOT EASY BUT IT IT I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE AS BAD AS IT WAS AND AND I IT'S NOT CHANGING OUR OUTLOOK ABOUT HOSPITALS AND ON-CAMPUS MOBS UM WE'LL WATCH THAT JUST LIKE EVERYBODY BUT I THINK IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW PERSONALLY IF YOU'VE EVER DEALT WITH A FAMILY MEMBER OR OR A FRIEND OR LOVED ONE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE WHO'S HAD A SERIOUS ILLNESS YOU DON'T THINK TWICE ABOUT GOING TO THE HOSPITAL OR GOING TO THAT YOU KNOW HIGH ACUITY SPECIALISTS THAT MIGHT BE NEAR THE HOSPITAL WHEN IT GETS REAL THIS THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LIGHT TOUCH STUFF AND IT'S REALLY COOL THAT THERE'S INNOVATIONS THAT CAN DO THINGS YOU KNOW IN IN LOWER COSTS YOU KNOW OFF-CAMPUS SETTINGS AND THAT'S FINE THAT'S A VERY REAL THING AND AND NOT TO SAY THAT TREND IS NOT REAL BUT YOU KNOW WE WE THINK THE DYNAMICS OF REAL ESTATE AND DEMAND SUPPLY AND DEMAND ARE BEST WHERE IT'S THAT HIGH ACUITY SORT OF OF NUCLEUS IF YOU WILL AROUND THE HOSPITAL AND AND AS RICH ASKED YOU KNOW WE GOTTA WATCH THAT NUCLEUS MAKE SURE IT'S HEALTHY THE HOSPITALS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH SO THAT THAT'S OUR FOCUS THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU THANKS TAYO",

i'd like to offer our best wishes to everyone as we approach five months since the start of the pandemic we are encouraged By the positive signs of recovery in the health care space and grateful for those who have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic including our tenants and partners they have demonstrated extraordinary resilience well beyond what we anticipated we expect we will continue to contend with covid nineteen as it ebbs and flows what's encouraging is the progress of better treatments and promising vaccine developments maderna pfizer astrazeneca and many others are reporting Positive results from fast-tracked clinical trials many expect a successful vaccine in twenty twenty with widespread availability next year public health officials are also taking a much more targeted approach to addressing hot spots which is allowing health care services to remain open across the country we are seeing physicians ramp up their volumes quickly now approaching pre-covid levels they are experiencing heightened demand for delayed care care providers are balancing the delivery of much needed care with safety precautions and they have gained valuable experience in treating their covid patients. as a result, we are not seeing the use of lengthy or widespread bans on elected procedures. several publicly traded national health care companies, including hca, surgery partners and tenet have recently reported steady improvements in volumes throughout may, june and july. likewise, we have seen tenant utilization in Our buildings rebound to nearly ninety percent of pre-covid levels it does vary geographically somewhat from a low of seventy five percent in washington d c to a hundred percent here in nashville tenant work order requests are now running at pre-covid levels and leasing momentum has also rebounded tours with prospective tenants which dip below fifty percent of typical volumes in april are now running well above average Rent collection stands at ninety seven percent for the second quarter as well as july new deferral requests have fallen to nearly zero in the last thirty days and over half of deferrals granted during the second quarter were repaid early which is very encouraging forgivable ppp loans kicked in as designed for payroll, rent and utilities the health care sector received more than twelve percent of all ppp loans of which the biggest recipients were physician offices More than eight point four billion dollars. hr's operating results for the second quarter were steady despite the impact of covid strong cash leasing spreads high tenant retention and stable contractual rent bumps were positive signs of the resilience of our tenants and the stability of our portfolio with tours being well off pace in april and may occupancy could be marginally softer in the second half of the year but A sharp recovery in june and july we expect occupancy to strengthen, going into twenty one as a result, same store operating income will likely be closer to two percent in twenty twenty and bounce back toward three percent next year external growth is still on pace for a solid twenty twenty the pipeline is strong even after we took extra time to undertake the financial health of tenants we have increased the top end of our acquisition guidance to be in line with our volume last year and well ahead of our original guidance our historical average we have plenty of funding capacity from the mercy dispositions cash on hand forward equity and full availability on our line of credit we are poised to take advantage of a sizable and growing pipeline the pandemic has underscored the critical nature of healthcare services even in uncertain times it has shown that hospitals are the hub of essential care including high acuity outpatient services which drive Achieve the stability of our cash flows despite the pandemic, we still expect to produce positive ffo per share growth in twenty twenty rising secular demand, a strong balance sheet and a robust pipeline position us well to grow safely in the years ahead. now i'll turn it over to miss mancini for some additional commentary on healthcare trends. bethany thank you. Continues to prove its resilience and significance to the u.s. population and economy after five months of experience with covid nineteen hospitals and physicians are now better equipped with protocols in place and adequate ppe to serve covid patients at the same time, providers are managing higher demands from the delay of scheduled care second quarter employment growth numbers are showing covid's unprecedented impact on jobs In april and may with promising signs of recovery in the health care sector from late may into june and continued positive momentum heading into the third quarter notably the pace of recovery in the ambulatory sector including physician offices has doubled that of the broader economy health care providers are meeting pent-up demand for elective care and the resurgence of strong utilization trends returning to more normalized levels levels quickly hr's tenants on average are operating near full capacity and they are better prepared to provide ongoing outpatient care even in the event of a local surge telemedicine served a critical role in april and may for many providers the easing of its restrictions and higher reimbursement helped sustain patient care and physician practice revenues during the height of the pandemic and the shutdown of non-emergent care Since then, physician offices in most of our markets have returned to seeing a majority of patients in person. the trump administration issued an executive order earlier this week to review and continue medicare's coverage of telehealth services after which cms proposed to permanently allow medicare providers to use telehealth for evaluation and management services along with visits for some mental health related care depending on reimbursement. Reimbursement and technology and security requirements we foresee telemedicine allowing our tenants to improve their efficiency in providing lower acuity services it could spur greater access of rural communities to urban care centers and support providers in general as they meet rising demand for high acuity care from an aging population cms remains active on the regulatory front in pursuing several medicare cost-saving initiatives these include hospital pricing transparency site neutral payments for off-campus hospital-based outpatient care and the addition of newly covered services in outpatient settings these initiatives incentivize care in lower cost settings typically in medical office buildings and ambulatory surgery centers as we approach the presidential election we can expect heated public debate over another round of federal stimulus Covid nineteen relief for health care providers we believe the sector is positioned well even absent additional legislation to continue to meet the demands of responding to covid and deliver the underlying growth in health care services our population will need in the quarters to come the result of the election for both the presidency and congress could impact the nation's mix of health insurance coverage and expansion of medicare and medicaid regardless Election results we expect the shift of healthcare delivery will continue toward lower cost outpatient settings now i will turn it over to rob hull for an overview of investment activity rob thank you bethany healthcare realities investment activity during the quarter can be characterized as two distinct periods defense at the outset and back to offense by the end of the quarter we started on defense by shoring up liquidity with an agreement to sell two single tenant net leased properties to saint louis based mercy for two hundred forty four million dollars or six hundred thirty three dollars per square foot what's also important is that this transaction represents a meaningful shift out of slower growing properties and smaller markets and into attractive growing msa's with significant opportunities for future investment additionally we took a deeper dive and due diligence for acquisitions rather than terminating contracts and risk losing solid deals because of covid nineteen for example we doubled the length of inspection periods to monitor the health and stability of these properties we also conducted extensive tenant interviews over multiple billing cycles and we analyzed rent collection and deferral requests We assessed buildings under contract, compared it to our own portfolio, and it sacked up really well. these critical steps allowed us to shift to offense as we approached the third quarter. in july we closed on four mb's for eighty three million dollars. one property marks our first acquisition in the san diego market, a market where we have identified substantial opportunity for future investment another in los angeles will benefit from the hospital's recent affiliation with double a minus rated cedars sinai health system which will provide an infusion of capital to increase hospital services in this dense market the last two located in atlanta and seattle represent additional investment in attractive growth markets on campuses where we own multiple properties These all through the quarter our team continued to use their deep industry relationships to source deals and build a pipeline even as the volume of marketed transactions declined we now have ten buildings under six separate contracts or letters of intent for an additional one hundred and sixty three million dollars these targeted acquisitions are located in six markets where we already have where we already are invested we expect to close these deals by year end and along with properties closed in july will fully reinvest the two hundred forty four million dollars of mercy proceeds our renewed confidence to proceed with closings and the growing pipeline are driving the increase in our acquisition guidance up to three hundred to three seventy five million for the year we expect our average cap rate To remain between five and five point eight percent the outlook for acquisitions remains positive as health care providers continue to experience meaningful improvement in patient visits and procedures m o b v r o l s are holding up allowing sellers to return to the market although a few buyers are temporarily on the sidelines cap rates are steady as investor demand is wide and deep For the stable cash flows from mbs while several sizable portfolios are available we haven't found them compelling enough to deviate from our targeted process of investing in one or two buildings at a time on the development front we are making steady progress on a thirty million dollar redevelopment project in memphis during the course of the pandemic several tenants expanded their space requirements including the surgery center and a large orthopedic tenant as a result the least percentage has moved up to ninety four percent during the first quarter of twenty twenty one we expect exterior improvements to be completed and the building's anchor tenant to take occupancy the remainder of the suites will take occupancy throughout the second and third quarters of twenty twenty one the pandemic has delayed some development discussions but hospitals are not abandoning long-term expansion plans for example, in july, a leading health system in toccoa announced a three hundred million dollar investment in a new bed tower and next week, here in nashville saint thomas will break ground on its three hundred million dollar expansion we are planning redevelopments at both of these campuses and we expect to start these projects soon i am pleased with our team's ability to Build a solid investment pipeline during these times their hard work will lead to timely to the timely reinvestment of proceeds generated from recent sales and positioning as well for creative growth in twenty twenty one now i will turn it over to chris to discuss financial and operational performance for the quarter thanks rob second quarter performance was strong as covid related revenue impacts were Offset by operating expense controls and gna reductions normalized ffo per share of forty two cents was an increase of five percent over the same period a year ago before diving into the specific operating metrics for the quarter i will touch on rent collection and deferrals we saw significant sequential improvements in may june and july this was the result of a swift rebound in patient volumes following the end of government government mandated shutdowns early in the quarter we collected over ninety nine percent of second quarter rent including two percent of deferrals these deferrals are to be paid back in the second half of the year for july deferrals were less than a hundred thousand dollars over of our over forty million in monthly rent in addition over half of deferrals granted in the second quarter were repaid early signaling how our tenants are getting back to business rents scheduled rent deferral payments for july are tracking well at eighty eight percent while this is promising, it is early in the process so we took a seven hundred thirty thousand dollar bad debt reserve representing twenty five percent of outstanding deferrals at quarter end we will continue to monitor and analyze collections through the balance of the year and adjust reserves accordingly now shifting to operating performance trailing Twelve month same store eno grew one point nine percent which was impacted by lockdowns in the quarter in three main ways first there was an eight hundred thousand dollar sequential reduction in transient parking income parking volumes returned to approximately eighty percent of pre pandemic levels by the end of june second six hundred seventy three thousand dollars of the total rent deferral reserve was in the same store portfolio And third, and most notable, was a benefit of one million dollars from a reduction in net operating expenses due to lower building traffic in the quarter. the primary reductions were in maintenance and utilities, which each declined over a half million dollars compared to the previous year. as utilization in foot traffic has rebounded in june and july, we expect operating expenses to return to more customary third-quarter levels, including typical seasonal utilities. But for these three impacts, trailing twelve months same store growth would have been approximately twenty basis points higher in oi growth in future periods should be reliably strong given the multitenant leasing metrics this quarter including retention of eighty four point nine six percent average in-place contractual increases of two point eight nine percent and cash leasing spreads of four point five percent in In the quarter we had one hundred seventy nine thousand square feet of new leases take occupancy led by gains at several repositioning and development properties this level of new leasing exceeded our historical average of approximately a hundred thousand square feet per quarter looking forward given a slowdown in leasing tours early in the second quarter due to local restrictions we could see leasing drop below our historical average in the second half of the year our same store guidance reflects the potential for this impact moving in to twenty twenty one we expect leasing to increase as tours have already rebounded to pre-covid nineteen levels and demand for outpatient space continues to strengthen now shifting to liquidity and leverage our bid dividend payout ratio was eighty four percent for the quarter and ninety three percent for the trailing twelve months we expect full year twenty twenty to be be in the low nineties and net debt to ebitda improved to five point one times including the issuance of thirty three million dollars of equity through the atm in addition we entered into forward equity contracts for an additional seventy four million dollars these proceeds can be drawn at our election over the next twelve months we don't expect to draw any of the forward equity proceeds until twenty one given the substantial liquidity available to fund our growing operations Investment pipeline our liquidity includes forty four million dollars of cash at quarter end and two hundred forty four million dollars from the mercy dispositions which closed last week our investment in the mercy properties resulted in an unlevered i r r of eleven and a half percent while the re-investment in multi-tenant m o b's and major m s a's will improve the diversification and growth profile of our portfolio for example Contractual escalators for the mercy assets have been running one point seven percent which is more than a hundred basis points below our existing portfolio and our acquisition pipeline the cap rate rotation upon re-investment will result in a little more than three cents of annual dilution the timing of the re-investment through the third and fourth quarters will bring forward all of the three plus cents into twenty twenty however even with this dilution And the covid nineteen impacts discussed earlier we anticipate positive ffo per share growth in twenty twenty and we are positioned well for continued ffo per share growth in twenty one and beyond. thank you, chris operator, check we will be ready to open it up to the question and answer period. thank you, chris operator, check we will be ready to open it up to the question and answer period. thank you, chris operator, check we will be ready to open it up to the question and answer period. thank you, chris operator, check we will be ready to open it up to the question and answer period. thank you, chris operator, check we will be ready to open it up to the question and answer period. thank you, chris operator, check we will be ready to open it up to the question and answer period. thank you, chris To ask a question, you may press star than one on your touch tone phone. if you're using a speaker phone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. to withdraw your question, please press star than two at this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. and our first question will come from nick joseph with city. please go ahead. thank you. appreciate the color on the acquisition pipeline. what's the Hit rate on assets that are in negotiation yeah, i think if you look at the pipeline, one hundred sixty three million that we're looking at right now, it's, you know, they're there, they're within our range that we've given the five to five a, probably down in the, you know, low to mid fives is where, on average, those are going to be. are you, i guess, more curious on the hundred, yeah, the hundred and twenty in negotiation. yeah, i guess i'm more curious on the hundred, yeah, the hundred and twenty in negotiation. yeah, i guess i'm more curious on the hundred, yeah, the hundred and twenty in negotiation. yeah, i guess i'm more curious on the hundred, yeah, the hundred and twenty in negotiation. Percentage of those or what's typically the fallout for for that bucket of potential acquisitions i mean, i think if you think about the hundred twenty we've we've said that there are some in there that we think might close by the end of the year and then and and then moving into early next and i would say the cap rates in in those buildings are in a similar range to what we have under contract in the pipeline and certainly it's it's early and and we're in discussions with those sellers there are some that sometimes may be a bit more challenging than others Fall out or take longer to close on, but we have a good line of sight on those and are optimistic about the opportunities there. i would add to that, maybe nick, it's a little hard to obviously give you a one percent probability, but it's a range. but i think you know, it's not fifty fifty. if that helps you, it's probably you know, not a hundred percent, as rob just said, but you know, maybe it's it's seventy eighty percent at least. and the nice thing is, Those are ones that are pretty far along in discussions. there's clearly a lot of other things not in that number that are a little further out there, maybe not as highly probable. so i, you know, i think it's that number is a strong number just in general. if you think about productivity going into twenty one thanks, that's helpful. and then you mentioned the portfolios on the market today. you know, what would make you more interested? is pricing? is it something specific about the mix of assets within those that would make you more interested? And executing on those yeah, i'd say that rather than pricing just the markets and the systems that they're associated with the strength of those markets, the opportunities for growth is really a key piece that we look at. and i would also say that the you know, the on adjacent makeup versus versus the off makeup typically what you see is is you know, there's a number of properties, a couple of properties in there that you really have to But then there's other properties in there that you really don't like and i think that's where these portfolios that are out there they kind of fall into now and nick i think as we've looked we've looked at portfolios over the years we also recognize you know you can't always find the perfect portfolio by definition and so it really comes down to is there a high enough proportion of what rob described as attractive assets that would be worth taking a few of those things that we don't like as much So you know we've we've always struggled with that we we obviously think our portfolio reflects a lot of the quality metrics we're looking for and we want to improve the average but if seventy eighty percent of the assets really fit then i think it makes some sense and you know the metas only transaction the atlanta transaction three years ago is a great example of that you know we we certainly looked at the duke transaction hard and competed for that so you know i'd throw that in there but some others like c n l and and others we we We couldn't get there. thank you. our next question will come from sarah tan with j. p. morgan. please go ahead. hi. i'm on from mike maitland. good morning. just have one question. can you talk about the acquisition of scudder stephens and what catamaran looks like? i'm sorry. i didn't hear the end of your question. can you repeat it? To ask, could you discuss the acquisition landscape and what capital requirements look like? sure. i would say that pricing for acquisitions has remained steady. the cash flows and in m&a's has held up remarkably well during this period. and i think that's a testament to the security and robust reliability of the asset class. and so you're seeing a continued demand for the product. there has been a few buyers that are temporarily on the sidelines. BUT WE SEE A LOT OF CAPITAL CONTINUING TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS SPACE AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ANY MEANINGFUL MOVEMENT IN CAP RATES THE OTHER THING ROB I MIGHT ADD TO THAT WOULD BE YOU YOU'VE EVEN SEEN YOU KNOW REALLY SINCE COVID A COUPLE OF TRANSACTIONS BY WELL TOWER THAT ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT THAT YOU'VE SEEN CAP RATES SORT OF RIGHT IN THE MID FIVES FOR THOSE PORTFOLIOS SO I THINK THAT SORT OF UND Range for typical mbo's and portfolios is very consistent over the last really couple of years and then you know, occasionally you see deviations from that more when you get down to specific assets that may drive it towards five or less or the other way for lower quality assets From vikram mahajan with morgan stanley. please go ahead. thanks for taking the question. this first one, you know, you had a nice improvement on the fad pay out. and you highlighted where you think this could kind of end up towards your end. and i'm just wondering how sustainable that level is. is there any gap x kind of bump we should expect next year or do you think the level is sort of sustainable going forward? vikram, that obviously you, chris, i'll touch on maybe you jump in. Remember, we're all social distancing, so we're we aren't as easily able to not talk over each other, which i apologize, chris. but i would say on the dividend, you're exactly right, vikram. chris mentioned low nineties for this year and certainly we're trying to steadily improve that. so we do hope to maintain that level, if not improve it each year but you know, as chris also talked about, we've got a lot of leasing strengthening. As we go into the later part of this year and into next year, so we do expect that what probably benefited us frankly in the second quarter and maybe even in the third would be a little less spending on t i because of the slowdown in leasing. we see that probably picking right back up later in the year and into next year. so you know, it's a little early to tell exactly where we'll be for twenty one, but we like the direction generally where we're headed and we'll certainly have a better sense of that as we start putting our plans in place. Together for twenty one later this year great okay and then tad is sorry tad's right i was only i would add to that is just the idea that where we are in terms of our capital other than t i i don't see any any major shifts there but if we don't see the continued improvement that we have been seeing the last several of years it would be tied to that be tied to absorption and new leasing which is which is great for a long term in terms of of earnings and Such, but, but could, you know, slow the momentum, um, temporarily, in terms of, uh, continued driving that, uh, pay-out ratio, lower, but, long-term, we're, we're certainly moving in the, in the right direction. okay, great. and then, just, you know, a little bit more color on the pipeline. i know in the past we've alluded to, uh, potentially looking a bit more at off-campus. i'm just wondering, through covid, are there, uh, how did that thought process change? maybe give a sense of the pipeline mix between, uh, on-campus and off-campus? On and off and and also just through covid are there any other markets you're thinking about in terms of new investments or development rob do you want to touch on maybe the current pipeline and in what that might look like on versus off and then i can add to it yeah i think that when you look at the at the current pipeline the majority of it is is in on an adjacent but there are a few assets in there that that kind of fall into the on campus category by our Definition, and i think those are a kind of similar to what you've heard to say in the past, dickerman, about strong markets that are markets where we already have an investment and you, that think that's where, if we are going to go off campus, that's where you think we will, we will do that kind of investing markets that we know are familiar with and investing in off-campus assets that are sort of part of the provider, provider network and lend itself to that relationship. I would add, rob, that in terms of Of just thinking differently you know post-covid or or now we're still in covid but as we look ahead i don't see that we would make a tremendous change in the markets that we're going after i think the ones we've been working on building our presence in still look very attractive to us you know even with what's going on now obviously like everyone we're going to be watching all the trends we're not heavily exposed to certain markets in the northeast new york boston you know great cities obviously but there are some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some some Challenges that that may come you know over time with with office demand and so forth less about healthcare there but i would say we really like some of the tech you know job concentration that we see in a lot of the markets we've been focused on i mean two of the markets that we've added you kind of ask that question about adding markets we just added san diego as rob pointed out in the last year we've been adding a bit in raleigh the raleigh durham area which we like as well but but merely ninety percent of what we've been doing Doing eighty ninety percent of the activity in the last few years has been very focused on our top fifteen markets so it's a lot of activity in the same markets we've been building scale in and then occasionally reaching out like i mentioned to san diego roley some others like that there's probably rob four or five you know other markets we'd certainly look at and see some depth in but you know it's it's we're definitely leaning towards the markets we're currently invested in great thank you our next question will come from jordan saddler with key bank capital markets. please go ahead. thank you. first, i just want to follow up on the the pipeline. i'm not sure if i'm overly reading into your commentary, but it seems like you mentioned a large and growing pipeline. is there potentially more behind this or are they potentially more behind this? A handful of larger deals that you're looking at? i'm noticing you've taken the leverage on a pop warner basis quite low and i know it's a challenging environment so it doesn't make sense but i'm guessing pop warner leveraged with the forward equity and sale merrill lynch used probably closer to four times their direct cost so kind of curious what what you're you're teed up for so yeah, i would say on the on the pipeline, jordan you know our team is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is Is always building and adding to our pipeline. And we, we take the approach of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of Trying to to get those sellers to the table. so we we think that behind what we've laid out here, certainly there's there's more opportunity that we're working on. and i think that's where we see the growth in the pipeline coming in and setting us up well for for twenty twenty one. so i think that's why we we have the confidence that we do because we see the dialogue that our team is having with these these sellers that are that are sort of behind what we've laid out here. and jordan, i would add to that, i do think i think i think we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we' Maybe what's in your question to is sort of you know are we preparing for something bigger i think it's more about i mean in some ways yes but it's not a complete change of stripes for us i think it's very much sticking to what rob just described really going after and targeting what we want rather than you know waiting on the marketed deals that said of course we we look at the marketed deals and if they measure up we certainly go after them and it's not you know we certainly are encouraged that you know we would like to go after some some deals if they measure up and it's not you know we certainly are encouraged that you know we would like to go after some some deals if they measure up and it's not you know we certainly are encouraged that you know we would like to go after some some de Can in this situation where we we seem you know to be able to as you said have the capital the resources but again you know we're going to probably stick to as you would know us to do stick to the quality side of things but we're encouraged by the the productivity and the effectiveness that rob described of sustaining a higher level of acquisitions i think that's the key and really dry you know recognizing the importance of of prudent growth through external growth in addition to our internal growth to kind of work that algorithm of of f of f growth per share Is the mix and i know i think it was just we just spoke to a question of a similar vein. but is the mix gonna skew continue to skew towards the adjacent type assets you mentioned i certainly think we will we will skew towards on an adjacent versus off but you know again we're we're okay with off i think rob touched on that we are okay with that i would say you know today we sit closer to almost ninety percent on an adjacent versus off We have done a fair bit of adjacent as you kind of point out and and sometimes you know what you find is those are the ones that you you can go in and target and get you know really get those assets more regularly and you know the on-campus it's tough because you're waiting for those hospitals to let that go typically so we really like the dynamic though of on and on an adjacent and and i could see the off fluctuating i think we've we've maybe last year hit a high and on an adjacent and and i could see the off fluctuating i think we've we've maybe last year hit a high and on an adjacent and and i could see the off fluctuating i think we've we've maybe last year hit a high and on an adjacent and and i could see the off fluctuating i Twenty five percent you know off. so we're okay with that. it's still gonna skew that way towards on an adjacent though. okay. and then lastly, like, major request for chris on the cap rates. i've got the cash cap rates, you're kind of curious. you mentioned the escalators on mercy. can you give me the gap cap rate on at this position? and then i'm just curious what the escalators and gap cap rates look like on the acquisition. As well yeah on on mercy the gap and cash were pretty close to the same because we were about at the midpoint of the of the least turn so they're they're kind of right on top of each other in terms of the the new acquisitions that were that were looking at the elevators as i mentioned are pretty similar to what our existing portfolio is call it that eight to two nine range in terms of elevators And you know it varies on the impact of to gap based off of the term that is inside of our acquisitions but but in general we typically say the gap adds about twenty five to fifty basis points to the to the cap rate on a gap basis in our acquisitions Our next question will come from lucas hartrich with green street advisors. please go ahead. i thank you all for your time this morning. this is john onner for lucas. just a quick one for me. just looking at the improvements in your expectations for the cash releasing spreads on the multi-tenant side. you know, what's behind that optimism? obviously, the year-to-day trends are pretty favorable and just wondering if there's actually some opportunity there. Some outside there as well thank you very much yeah, if you really look at the change in our guidance on on the cash leasing spreads we did change it this quarter compared to last but that really was just kind of bringing it back more in line with what we had seen pre-covid last quarter we were taking we didn't want to be overly aggressive you know not having a lot of of leasing data in the midst of what was going on and So we had taken had taken down our expectations but as we work through leases during the quarter and continued our discussions things have really shown a great you know resilience and so our expectations is that our cash lease spreads will be able to kind of maintain what we had been seen previously which long term we say we expect three to four and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and so we're we're so far we're seeing that those types of metrics are are holding up well Is the risk going forward of reinfection and certainly in many of the states that you traffic in, we've seen some uptick but no, no talk of sort of a reversal of, you know, elective surgery shutdowns and whatnot. Can you, can you discuss that a little bit about how how you're seeing that play out? I mean, even though the availability or our states are allowing for elective surgery, SURGERIES ARE PEOPLE REALLY JUMPING IN AND DOING IT AND IS THERE A RISK THAT YOU KNOW A MONTH OR SO FROM NOW WE COULD BE HAVING ANOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT SHUTTING IT DOWN RICH I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK WE ALL SORT OF HAVE THAT UNEASE YOU KNOW GOING INTO THE FALL I THINK COLLECTIVELY THAT THINGS CAN CHANGE AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE FLU SEASON COMING AND THINGS GET WORSE TYPICALLY IN THE WINTER SO IT'S A VERY Don't want to be glib about the optimism because you know it's it's a long road here and you know maybe the toughest time ahead of us the good news is i think as i think bethany pointed out and i pointed out and we've all seen there's just been a lot of improvement on treatments and how to deal with this and so i think we we all feared obviously in the front end that hospitals would just be totally overwhelmed and obviously that was tested in a couple of places including new york and and i think the good news is we came out on the better end of what we what we saw all feared, and so you're seeing as it said in hot spots, you know, houston went through it, and you're seeing different places and and the good news is they seem to be handling it, and it's not creating these long, lengthy shutdowns. you know, you did see in texas the governor trying to push some, some again, policies there, but it really actually was a bit of a carve out for a s c's, you know, in some of the outpatient surgeries. it was more about protecting that inpatient capacity. so i do think you're going to see a little bit of that. we do have to brace for that. IN TERMS OF HOT SPOTS I DON'T THINK IT'S YOU KNOW NATIONWIDE SHUT IT ALL DOWN THE WAY IT WAS EARLY ON IT'S GONNA BE MUCH MORE TARGETED AND YOU KNOW I'M NO EXPERT ANY MORE THAN ANYBODY ON THE PHONE BUT AS WE WATCH THIS MOVE AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF IT'S THE HOT SPOT IT'S THESE YOU KNOW FIRES THAT KIND OF COME UP AND THEN BURN OUT AND I HOPE THAT CONTINUES TO YOU KNOW BE QUELLED YOU KNOW AND CONTA Some issues i think we're encouraged i mean the public companies that report their surgery numbers have been really incredible so i don't think there's a big hesitation to come back and do it it'll just be a matter of you know do the public health officials continue to sort of treat this in a targeted way rather than a blanket way and we think that will be the case ok my second question and last question is what is your perspective of how the hospital industry looks like After this is all done. i mean, would you say the hospital business not the medical office business per se, but the hospital business is weakened by all this in the sense that you know we kind of went in over our heads to begin with and and maybe this fast tracks some consolidation or closings that probably or maybe would have happened eventually i'm just wondering if Do you think sort of picking your your your relationships becomes even more important in the aftermath because hospitals the hospital industry overall is is probably a notch weaker because of everything that happened yeah, i think it's a fair a fair assessment and good commentary we we were having a discussion with our board earlier this week about that with several health system leaders there on our board and And and i think it's what you said you're going to it's it's the classic you know problem that these crises just like the financial crisis caused the strong are going to get stronger the weaker are going to get weaker and there's different dynamics to that but in the hospital world it's very true and you know you're seeing an hca do extremely well you know coming through this and i think they do a good job of figuring it out and and there's a lot of not for profit systems that are leaders in their markets i do think the strength and scale matters Larger systems versus small independent systems, obviously you know more more urban versus in suburban versus rural is going to be a huge trend. i know that the trend of moving into the cities, everybody's questioning a little bit but i still think those strong you know population growth centers are going to be where you're going to see success. and so i do think you are correct that picking the right partners will matter more being a sharpshooter will continue to be critical for success. and i think that's something we've been. Ever since we sort of found that trend to be true from the financial crisis even before so it's true i do think you're right hospitals probably taken you know sort of clearly taken a hit and were helped a lot by the cares act and cms in general but i do think we are encouraged that the strong ones i mean this is a demand need based business you know this isn't just selling luxury items it's very much need based and so there's a huge need for it in pay as i've made my comments a remark I mean hospitals are proving that they're so critical and i think the acuity level at hospitals is only going to continue to climb and you're going to see acuity level at outpatient clinics both on and off campus. it's a continuum and i think all of those innovations will continue and it will be a little bit more of a winner versus a loser at game and i think we're we're pretty well positioned to to follow that trend and as as related to that response thanks tom, that was great do you think the long term Weighed monetization of hospital and medical office will will be you know more of a realistic outcome of this even for stronger hospitals that maybe you're now taking on you know more market share need more technological advances and so on is is that something that we can finally say well it's not not to get religious but it's like testing our faith right in this theory and it's just we gotta keep the faith Alive, right? we just haven't seen it is the real answer it has all the makings to suggest that would be possibly true we have a very contradicting data point here with the mercy transaction that we just did a little bit of a specific situation where they had a propensity you know to want to own their assets so a little different but we've heard of a few other anecdotes just recently of some other hospitals doing similar things so you know hospital systems Think strategically very differently. they don't focus, i mean, as they should. they focus on providing care and and all the things they need to do to expand their business and succeed. they're not sitting around thinking about cap rates for r o b e's. but i think there's going to be there are going to be some more of those. it may be a little bit more from your stressed systems. and so then weeding through that back to your earlier question, figuring out is it worth it? is it the right systems to be with? is the question for that. right. great. thanks. Thanks, thanks, rich. the next question will come from john chin with bmo capital. please go ahead. thanks, good morning, tom. in your opening remarks, you mentioned saint joseph's academy trending back to three percent, which is certainly against recent trends of not only hr but other mbo leeds. and i'm just wondering if you could discuss your confidence levels and that in that And if that's being driven by occupancy picking up or leasing spreads on on leases that you're negotiating now i think the simple answer is and chris always hits this it's that our average contractual rent bump across you know multitenant and single tenant is two point eight three percent it's two point eight nine for the multitenant so that's that's v driver of of our same store growth and and what chris always walks through is Is ok we we grew the revenue at that level and then at your right you you advance that ball a little bit with cash leasing spreads but that's a pretty small piece of the pie each you know a quarter or a year so you you do help that you do have a little bit of you know turnover as well that kind of hurts that but the revenue model is more of a you know high two's kind of number and then really it becomes what are your expenses doing and how much operating leverage do you have your margin and so that's the algorithm we see That gets us there pretty conservatively with it but it's really the big driver is is our revenue model of our escalators and and we continue to feel good about that the cash leasing segment helps at the margin absolutely and and as chris talked you know we're looking to try to drive absorption as we go into twenty one and that will help also but even without a lot of of increased absorption you can see same store inno y growth running you know around three and how does free rent impact that? This number, because i imagine you're offering more free rent or you haven't been more recently chris, do you want to touch on that? yeah, i mean obviously free rent will go into it, if if you have a larger percent percentage of it versus what you had before, but i'll say generally no, we're not adding a lot of free rent you know, we really don't have much of any inside of our renewals, if we're if we're doing it at all, it typically is inside of a new leasing and so when you have that it With the new leasing, it just kind of creates a little bit of a delay before you see the the revenue impact from that absorption but but overall, no, we've we've not seen a marked expansion of of free rent ok, and then maybe i'll ask nick josephs a question a little differently. i think at geneva, you mentioned an hundred and fifty million dollars of acquisitions you had under contract. and now you've closed eighty two million dollars post-quarter. Are you still on track to close that remaining seventy million or so, or have any of those deals fallen apart? yes, we're still on track to close those. i think we've got i think i mentioned we have one hundred and sixty three million that's either under contract or l o i so we've actually increased that under contract amount since the last time and i think rob, too, you said and we expect that we will close those to Categories under contract in alabama by year end, which is what will help us get those mercy proceeds reinvested by year end right and the four adjacent acquisitions you mentioned are adjacent to a a-rated health systems. are those health systems at all tenants in the buildings in question? i would say that they are certainly have physicians that are utilizing the buildings. Hospital next door i think there's one where the hospital is is not a tenant but that all the others are tenants by the hospital great thank you thanks john our next question will come from todd stender with wells fargo please go ahead thanks probably in order just to stick with that last theme about the assets under contract and maybe this is for you Rob, can you speak to the condition of those buildings? i know historically you guys are prepared to put some redevelopment dollars into them. but in the context of maybe, todd, what you were speaking to, maybe t i's come down, maybe just getting some broader thoughts about how you guys are allocating capital. thanks. yeah, i would say that the assets that we're under contract to purchase are in good condition. i mean, they're all in good condition. i mean, we're not planning to invest in real estate. i mean, they're all in good condition. i mean, we're not planning to invest in real estate. i mean, they're all in good condition. i mean, we're not planning to invest in real estate. i mean, they're all in good condition. i mean, we're not Assess a significant amount of capital into any of them as a as a redevelopment play if that's if that's answering your question it is thank you and then then maybe for god did i hear that right maybe expectations of lower t i's coming down the road i think that's a twenty twenty phenomenon we're not necessarily suggesting that looking into twenty one we actually think it should rebound to sort of historical levels in relationships And in all that is, is is what you've heard some other say to we had slower tours and new leasing activity with new perspective, new tenants that create absorption which is where you have higher t i spend in in the second quarter, you know, especially april and even a little in may and therefore you get this lag effect of when those tenants would normally take occupancy and that's probably a third and fourth quarter phenomenon so it's really a back half issue and even a little bit you saw it in the second quarter So that's all we're saying and then back to sort of normalized levels in twenty one i would clarify that too of you know that that's a little bit on the perspective leasing front what tye's talking about of and we don't know yet for sure we we're kind of run in different scenarios and so we're looking at one scenario that that yes we could see a little bit less absorption here in the next couple of quarters and then rebounding which could have an impact but then also as you look at it in terms of total spend and you start looking at fad right now we are running At the low end and frankly a little below the low end of our guidance range as it relates to second gen t i. and so there's just timing that is always related to that so that may you know pick up certainly we think will be in the range back to you know potentially near the midpoint of the range and so that's part of what what is playing into the guidance that it relates to to fad and my prepared remarks i talked about you know right now we are are running significantly below Um, where we are on a, on a trailing twelve month basis. but, um, we do think that that can pick up in the later half of the year and in what drives our view that our fad pay out ratio will probably end up the year down in the in the low nineties, not in the low eighty s that you saw this quarter. so, just wanted to clarify that point. that's, that's helpful because that's where i was going ultimately with this is seeing that fad pay out ratio decline and in the spirit of seeing maybe some dividend growth. Growth at some point but maybe it doesn't shake out that low. okay, that's helpful. all right, that's for me. thank you. thanks, dan. the next question will come from taro okusaya with mainichi shimbun. please go ahead. yes, good morning everyone. congratulations on the transactions. it makes perfect sense to me. my focus is really on the outlook for the m o b s. I think you mentioned your comments earlier on that you know hospitals in general and associated with them do seem to be doing well when we kind of you know, think about each hospital's results and some of the other hospital operators but a lot of that is also kind of due to the massive amount of grants they've kind of seized during this period as well i'm curious just to talk about how you're thinking about kind of in a world where there are no grants or in a world where Government funding is decreased maybe in the next you know act that congress and next you know what do you kind of see happens in that world? i mean, specifically, can we start to say defunding is going up again or or you know, would you love for you guys to just kind of stand on that well, it's it's all speculation obviously, tio, but it's it's interesting i think we saw the most extreme thing hopefully that will ever see i mean, it's it's all speculation obviously, tio, but it's it's interesting i think we saw the most extreme thing hopefully that will ever see i mean, it's it's all speculation obviously, tio, but it's it's interesting i think we saw the most extreme thing hopefully that will ever see i mean, it's In our lifetimes, right? but maybe not a man to that right, right? so, you know, april was just absolutely extreme and, and clearly the government steps in and we just hope you know we don't see that again. but i think we've, as we mentioned, we've learned a lot and i think we learned that hospitals you know good or bad, hospitals and physicians they really make a lot of money on the elective procedure side and surgeries and when that was shut down, i mean, you're cutting off the This profitable segment of the business and you know healthcare it's it's a little cold to say that because obviously they're only doing they're they're only supposed to be doing what's necessary but it is necessary there's a ton of need and so when you cut off that lifeblood if you will it really hurts those systems so i think now if you go back to the discussions earlier where it's more of a targeted approach and maybe you know for a short period in houston they they asked for some elective procedures to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to You know, reduced and not even in all a s c's but in hospitals. so i think you're going to see a more targeted approach rather than these sort of absolute, you know, month long or more shutdowns. so it should therefore it shouldn't be quite as financially difficult. you know, is it going to be tough? yeah, just like school. schools for a lot of us, you know, with kids and it's going to be tough. you know, as soon as they shut down the school for a week or two or something or even if you're lucky if they're open. so there's going to be ebbs and flows as i mentioned in my message. My remarks, but i think we're much better shaped today than we were when we knew very little in march. so i don't think it's as dire as, you know, we could all fear, but, you know, it's never david emery used to always say it's never as good or as bad as it may seem, and that's probably very appropriate here. it will be not easy, but i don't think it's going to be as bad as it was and and it's not changing our outlook about hospitals and on campus mb's we'll watch that just like everybody else. Think in my own experience, you know, personally, if you've ever dealt with a family member or a friend or a loved one, whatever it might be, who's had a serious illness, you don't think twice about going to the hospital or going to that high-acuity specialist that might be near the hospital. When it gets real, this, that's what this is about. You know, the light touch stuff and it's really cool that there's innovations that can do things, you know, in lower costs, you know, off-campus settings, and that's fine. That's a very real thing. I say that trend's not real, but you know, we think the dynamics of real estate and demand, supply and demand are best where it's that high acuity sort of nuclei, if you will, around the hospital. and as rich asked, you know, we gotta watch that nuclei, make sure it's healthy, the hospitals that we're working with. so that's our focus. gosh, that's helpful. thank you. next topic."

SHEET AS OF SEPTEMBER 26TH 2020 WE HAD CASH OF $234.80 MILLION COMPARED TO $34.60 MILLION IN THE YEAR AGO PERIOD OUR STRONG CASH BALANCE IN PART REFLECTS OUR LOWER INVENTORY POSITION AS WE ENDED THE QUARTER WITH $134.60 MILLION IN INVENTORY COMPARED TO $209.20 MILLION DURING THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR INVENTORY DECLINED 36% YEAR-OVER-YEAR REFLECTING BOTH THE COMPARISON TO A 33% GROWTH IN THE YEAR AGO PERIOD AS WELL AS ONGOING EFFORTS TO MATCH SUPPLY WITH THE ABOVE FORECASTED DEMAND WE HAVE SEEN ACROSS THE BUSINESS GOING FORWARD OUR FOCUS REMAINS ON FLEXING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TO NOT ONLY MATCH THE STRONG DEMAND WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE BRAND BUT ALSO REBUILD MORE CONSISTENT IN-STOCK LEVELS ACROSS OUR CHANNELS AS SUCH WE EXPECT TO BE IN A CONSTRAINED INVENTORY POSITION ACROSS CERTAIN PRODUCTS AS WE WORK THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER TOTAL DEBT EXCLUDING UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED FINANCING FEES AND FINANCE LEASES WAS $238.80 MILLION COMPARED TO $298 MILLION IN LAST YEAR'S THIRD QUARTER DURING THE QUARTER WE MADE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $53.80 MILLION INCLUSIVE OF A $50 MILLION VOLUNTARY PRE-PAYMENT WITH OUR STRONG CASH POSITION FOR THE QUARTER THE RATIO OF TOTAL NET DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE TRAILING 12-MONTH WAS ESSENTIALLY ZERO TIMES COMPARED TO 1.6 TIMES IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER OVERALL WE COULDN'T BE PROUDER OF HOW OUR BUSINESS AND OUR TEAM HAS RESPONDED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC NONETHELESS WE KNOW THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE TO NAVIGATE THE ONGOING UNCERTAINTIES OF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT TO EXECUTE ON OUR HOLIDAY PLAN AND ULTIMATELY TO CONTINUE OUR MOMENTUM INTO 202 GIVEN THE INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE OF OUR THIRD QUARTER LET ME GIVE YOU SOME HIGH LEVEL THOUGHTS INTO HOW WE SEE THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR PLAYING OUT WE EXPECT FOURTH QUARTER NET SALES TO INCREASE BETWEEN 15% AND 16% YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON TOP OF A STRONG 24% GROWTH RATE IN LAST YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER AS A REMINDER THE FOURTH QUARTER INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF AN EXTRA WEEK WHICH EXTENDS THE FISCAL PERIOD TO JANUARY 2 2021 AND IS EXPECTED TO BENEFIT REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY $7 MILLION WITH A STRONG OUT-PERFORMANCE IN THE THIRD QUARTER CONTRIBUTING TO LEAN INVENTORIES ACROSS OUR CHANNELS WE EXPECT DEMAND FOR THE YETI BRAND WILL CONTINUE TO EXCEED AVAILABLE SUPPLY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER AS WE FOCUS ON REBUILDING OUR INVENTORY POSITION WE ARE ALSO ACTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY MANAGING ALL ASPECTS OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TO NAVIGATE REAL AND POTENTIAL DISRUPTIONS FROM SUPPLIER CAPACITY TO HOLIDAY LOGISTICS WE EXPECT OUR ONGOING WORK HERE WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH AS WE CONTINUE TO RESTOCK THE CHANNEL INTO EARLY 202 TURNING TO THE BOTTOM LINE GAAP EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $0.55 AND $0.58 COMPARED TO $0.05 IN THE YEAR AGO PERIOD WE EXPECT ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE TO BE BETWEEN $0.57 AND $0.60 REFLECTING A 31% TO 38% YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH BEFORE TURNING THE CALL OVER FOR Q&A I WANT TO REINFORCE THREE THEMES THAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE BUSINESS FIRST WE ARE SEEING INCREDIBLE DEMAND FOR THE YETI BRAND WITH GROWTH EVENLY BALANCED BETWEEN OUR TWO MAIN PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND SUPPORTED BY OUR OMNI-CHANNEL EVOLUTION SECOND WE'RE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING PROFITABLE GROWTH HIGHLIGHTED BY RECORD GROSS MARGINS AND DISCIPLINED SG&A MANAGEMENT LASTLY WE CONTINUE TO BUILD MORE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES AND DRIVE FUTURE SHAREHOLDER VALUE WE BELIEVE THESE THEMES OF THE HALLMARKS OF A STRONG ENDURING BRAND AND POSITION THE COMPANY INCREDIBLY WELL AS WE LOOK TO ACHIEVE OUR LONG-TERM GOALS WE WILL NOW LIKE TO OPEN THE CALL FOR QUESTIONS OPERATOR THANK YOU AT THIS TIME WE WILL BE CONDUCTING A QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION IF YOU'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD A CONFIRMATION TONE WILL INDICATE YOUR LINE IS IN THE QUESTION QUEUE YOU MAY PRESS STAR TWO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE YOUR QUESTION FROM THE QUEUE FOR PARTICIPANTS USING SPEAKER EQUIPMENT IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO PICK UP YOUR HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE STAR KEY ONE MOMENT PLEASE WHILE WE POLL FOR QUESTIONS <SILENCE> YOUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF PETER BENEDICT WITH BAIRD PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION OH HEY GUYS GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR THE QUESTIONS UM UH FIRST FIRST JUST ON THE ON THE INVENTORY UM PAUL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN GIVE US MAYBE A BETTER SENSE OF UH OF WHERE YOU HOPE TO HAVE THIS FITTING AT YEAR END UM AND THEN ASSUMING THE DEMAND UM PACE REMAINS I GUESS SIMILAR UH WHEN WOULD YOU BE REALISTICALLY EXPECTED TO BE BACK KIND OF IN THE STOCK UM AT LEVELS THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO KIND OF GROW OR SELL-THROUGH IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK YOU COULD GET EARLY IN 2021 OR IF THIS DEMAND LEVEL CONTINUES WELL YOU'RE GONNA BE CHASING FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION MATT I HAVE ONE FOLLOW-UP GREAT THANKS PETER AND GOOD MORNING SO UM WE EXPECT TO END THE YEAR UM STILL DOWN ON INVENTORY BUT UM WE WILL MAKE SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT FROM WHERE WE ARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER UH SO WHILE DOWN YEAR-OVER-YEAR UM WE WE DO EXPECT TO THE PERCENTAGE TO LESSEN ON A DECREASE YEAR-OVER-YEAR AND THEN AS WE LOOK INTO 2021 UM YOU KNOW IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR WHERE WE CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW UM RAMP UP OUR INVENTORY AND IT'S REALLY IT'S ALL ABOUT DEMAND AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY IS DEMAND IS VERY VERY STRONG AND WE HOPE THAT UM CONTINUES BUT WE THINK AS WE GO THROUGH 2021 WE'LL GET TO A MORE NORMALIZED LEVEL OKAY THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL AND THEN I GUESS RELATED TO THAT UM JUST MATT MAYBE TALK ABOUT THE THE THE INNOVATION CADENCE UM IN THE BUSINESS AND I I KNOW YOU GUYS ADJUSTED SOME OF THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS THIS YEAR JUST IN RESPONSE TO COVID AND WHATNOT BUT NOW WE'VE GOT THE SUPPLY CONSTRAINT UH DYNAMIC OUT THERE SO MAYBE JUST HOW HAS THE HOW HAS YOUR PLANNING EVOLVED FOR FOR 2021 UH IN TERMS OF WHAT MAYBE YOU WERE THINKING A YEAR AGO YOU WOULD INTRODUCE UM UH VERSUS WHAT NOW YOU THINK THE CADENCE WILL LOOK LIKE PETER THANKS GOOD MORNING I WOULD SAY OUR PLANNING AND ROADMAP FOR 2021 AS IT RELATES TO THE PRODUCT UH HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY UH SO THE THE CHANGES WE MADE IN 2020 EARLY IN THE YEAR WHEN WE DIDN'T UH HAVE HAVE GREAT VISIBILITY ON THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR AND AS WE'VE PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED SHIFTED SOME THINGS TO THE FRONT HALF OF 2021 WE DON'T EXPECT THOSE TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE IN THE INVENTORY REBUILD IN THE THE KIND OF CAPACITY THAT WE'RE PUTTING ON OR THE PRESSURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING ON OUR SUPPLIERS FOR CAPACITY SO WE EXPECT UH THAT THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR PRODUCT ROADMAP IN THE INTRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS NEXT YEAR IT'S REALLY UH AS PAUL INDICATED IT'S REALLY REBUILDING UM THE CURRENT PRODUCT PORTFOLIO OR CURRENT INVENTORY UH BACKUP SO I I FEEL I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE INNOVATION CADENCE BEING UNTAPPED IN IN THE PLAN FOR INNOVATION IN 202 AND IN PARALLEL WE'LL BE REBUILDING AND AND RAMPING UP OUR OUR SUPPLY CAPACITY FOR OUR EXISTING PRODUCT PORTFOLIO OKAY NOW THAT'S HELPFUL I I IF I CAN SNEAK ONE MORE AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER I APOLOGIZE JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE RECALL I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH YOU CAN SAY ABOUT IT BUT JUST CURIOUS WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT MAGSLIDER ON THE TRAVEL MUG VERSUS THE OTHERS AND YOU HAVE MAGSLIDERS ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS SO IF YOU'RE AT LIBERTY TO SAY AND THEN YOU SAID ANY IMPACT IS IN YOUR FOURTH QUARTER PLAN PAUL I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S YOU COULD BE LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC BEHIND WHAT YOU THINK THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE THANK YOU YEAH PETER I'LL TAKE THE THE FRONT OF THAT WE DID A VOLUNTARY RECALL UM IN IN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION AND AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY WE HAD A REPORT OF A DISLODGING OF OUR OUR MAGNETIC LID AND SO WE QUICKLY MOVED YOU KNOW NINE DAYS INTO THE LAUNCH OF THIS PRODUCT THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT CHANNELS AND AND TOOK A TOOK A DECISIVE ACTION QUICKLY TO MAKE SURE WE FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND FULLY WRAPPED THIS THE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PRODUCTS IS IN THE LEGACY PRODUCT THERE'S ONE MAGNET ON THE TOP AND ON THE NEW ONE THERE'S A MAGNET ON THE BOTTOM AND A MAGNET ON THE TOP AND THAT'S WHAT CAN THEY CAN UH DISLODGE FROM EACH OTHER AND SO YOU KNOW WE PUT INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE ON UH CONSUMER SAFETY AND WHEN WE SAW THIS REPORTED WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO QUICKLY QUICKLY WRAP IT AND UH AND GET IT OFF THE MARKET AND PUT OUR TEAM BACK TO WORK ON MAKING SURE THAT UM WE HAD THE PRODUCT OUT IN THE MARKET THAT WE THOUGHT WAS UH DESERVING OF THE YETI BRAND AND THEN PETER ON THE UM SALES IMPACT WHILE I WON'T SHARE KIND OF WHAT OUR PLAN WAS AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE A LOT OF PUTS AND TAKES THERE AS WE INTRODUCE THE NEW PRODUCTS HOW DOES THAT IMPACT CURRENT PRODUCTS SO WHEN WE PULLED THE UH TRAVEL MUG YOU KNOW THE PERCEIVED CANNIBALIZATION OF OTHER PRODUCTS GOES AWAY SO UM AS WE SAID IT'S FULLY CONTEMPLATED IN THE UM IN THE TOPLINE GUIDANCE THAT WE GAVE IN THE 15% TO 16% AND UM YOU KNOW WE'RE EXCITED TO AS THE TEAM IS IS REWORKING THAT LID AND UM YOU KNOW LOOKING LOOKING FORWARD OKAY FAIR FAIR ENOUGH THANKS THANKS GUYS YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF CAMILO LYON WITH BTIG PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU GOOD MORNING GUYS AND UH GREAT JOB ON THE QUARTER UM I WANTED TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE INVENTORY COMMENTS YOU'RE MAKING I THINK YOU HAD SOME INVENTORY CONSTRAINTS ALSO UM UH DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE QUARTER AND OBVIOUSLY <INAUDIBLE> IN THE FOURTH QUARTER MAYBE IF YOU CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT CATEGORIES YOU ARE FEELING PARTICULARLY LIGHT ON AND UH HOW YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT UM YOU KNOW IS THERE A FAVORING OF A CHANNEL THAT YOU'D PREFER TO TO SUPPLY OVER ONE OVER THE OTHER SO ARE YOU GOING TO FEED YOUR DTC UH FIRST WHEN SUPPLY COMES BACK OR IS COMING THROUGH AND ALSO ARE YOU SEEING WHERE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN ARE YOU SEEING THE DISRUPTIONS IS IT ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE IS IT UM SHIPPING TIMES IS IT AT THE PORTS I'M JUST CURIOUS TO UNDERSTAND UM WHERE THE BOTTLENECKS EXIST UM AND WHERE WE COULD SEE SOME ALLEVIATION OF THAT UH OF THAT INVENTORY FLOW SURE SO LET ME START WITH UM THE KIND OF HOW HOW WE GOT HERE OR KIND OF JUST UM YOU KNOW KIND OF GOING BACK A FEW MONTHS SO IF YOU REMEMBER BACK AT THE END OF FIRST QUARTER AND THIS IS THIS IS WHERE DO WE SEE THE THE BOTTLENECK UM BECAUSE THERE REALLY AREN'T TRUE BOTTLENECKS IN THE IN THE NORMAL SENSE BUT IF WE GO BACK TO THE FIRST QUARTER THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER UM LAST TWO WEEKS OF THE FIRST QUARTER FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THE SECOND QUARTER WE CUT BACK <INAUDIBLE> UM AS WE WERE SEEING THOSE DEMAND SIGNALS WE HAD SOME SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION THERE BUT IT WAS REALLY US CUTTING BACK LOOKING AT THE CURRENT DEMAND SIGNALS AT THAT POINT AND THEN DEMAND STARTED TO IN THE BACK HALF OF SECOND QUARTER STARTED TO TAKE OFF AND WE BEGAN PLACING FORWARD ORDERS AND THEN AS WE CAME INTO Q3 SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT A LOT OF THIS IMPACT IS YOU KNOW KIND OF GOING BACK TO THE END OF FIRST QUARTER BEGINNING OF SECOND QUARTER WHERE WE WEREN'T PRODUCING AT A CAPACITY OR WE WEREN'T PRODUCING AT THE LEVEL TO SUPPORT THE 29% IN Q3 AND YOU KNOW BACK THEN I NEVER WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO TO DRIVE 29% TOP LINE GROWTH IN UH THE THIRD QUARTER SO IT IS REALLY WE HAVE ALL OUR ALL OUR FACTORIES WORKING YOU KNOW FULL CAPACITY IN IN PRODUCING SO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A BOTTLENECK IN THE SENSE OF YOU KNOW PORTS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW AND AND YOU'VE SEEN IT IN THE HEADLINES THE PORT COMING INTO THE INTO THE U.S. ON THE WEST COAST UH AND THEN CERTAINLY JUST LOGISTICS IN IN GETTING THE UM THE GOODS TO OUR DTCS BUT IT REALLY IS ABOUT KIND OF THE PROGRESSION OF REBUILDING THE INVENTORY FROM AN ALLOCATION UM YOU KNOW HERE'S HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT IS WE WANT TO MEET CONSUMER DEMAND ACROSS CHANNELS AND IF WE THINK ABOUT OUR WHOLESALE CHANNEL RIGHT SO OUR UM SELLING WAS PLUS 6% AND WE TALKED ABOUT UM WHOLESALE DEMAND BEING CLOSE TO WHAT OUR TOPLINE WAS IN LINE WITH WHAT OUR TOPLINE WAS AS A COMPANY UM SO WE KNEW WE HAD INVENTORY IN THE CHANNEL SO WE USED THAT INVENTORY TO SATISFY DEMAND AND THEN WE USED THE INVENTORY WE HAD TO SATISFY OUR DTC SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT SATISFYING CONSUMER DEMAND UM AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW WE ALLOCATE UM THE INVENTORY AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT UM INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER GOT IT OKAY GREAT UM AND THEN JUST ON THE CATEGORIES IS THERE A SPECIFIC UH UNDER INVENTORIED POSITION THAT'S MORE UM THAT'S MORE GRAVE UM MAYBE THAT'S TOO STRONG A WORD BUT UM THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OF GREATER FOCUS COOLERS VERSUS DRINKWARE OR IS IT EQUALLY BALANCED IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO BE YEAH GOOD GOOD QUESTION I'M GONNA COME AT IT FROM THE OTHER ANGLE OF WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF ALL LAST YEAR BUILDING UP MY DRINKWARE INVENTORY SO EVEN AS I CAME INTO THE FIRST QUARTER SECOND QUARTER AND I DID THE SAME THING THERE I CUT FORWARD POS BUT I HAD A LOT OF DRINKWARE INVENTORY IN MY DC SO AS DEMAND CAME BACK I WAS ABLE TO YOU KNOW PUT FORWARD POS IN UM SO I I HAD THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A LOT OF DRINKWARE INVENTORY WHICH AGAIN AS WE TALKED ABOUT WAS A TARIFF MITIGATION AND TURNED INTO A UH A CORONAVIRUS MITIGATION UM SO I WAS I BENEFITED FROM THAT PIECE GOT IT THAT'S THAT'S CLEAR THANK YOU UM AND THEN MAYBE MATT AS YOU THINK ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW THE BALANCE OF THE THE EXCESS SUPPLY EXCESS DEMAND UM DEMAND OUTSTRIPPING SUPPLY WITH MAINTAINING THE BRAND HEAT THAT YOU'RE CLEARLY BENEFITING FROM UM ARE YOU ARE YOU UH AT ALL SEEING ANYTHING ON THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE WHERE UM A CUSTOMER IS IS LEAVING THE BRAND JUST TO FULFILL SOME SORT OF PURCHASE NEED UM AND HOW ARE YOU TRYING TO MITIGATE YOU KNOW THAT UH POTENTIAL LOST SALE OR THAT LOST CUSTOMER THAT UM YOU KNOW MAYBE ORGANICALLY COMING TO YOU BUT NOT NOT SEEING THAT DEMAND FULFILLED CAMILO YEAH WE'VE SEEN UM THROUGH TIME AND THROUGH DIFFERENT POINTS IN YETI'S HISTORY WHEN WE GET INTO SUPPLY CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENTS OR WHERE DEMAND IS IS OUTSTRIPPING SUPPLY IS WE DON'T TEND TO SEE A LOT OF LEAKAGE UH OF THE OF THE CUSTOMER AND PART IS BECAUSE WE FOCUS A LOT ON MAKING SURE WE'LL CONTINUE TO DRIVE ENGAGEMENT AND EVEN IF IT'S ENGAGEMENT IN BETWEEN PURCHASES OR IT'S ENGAGEMENT WHILE SOMEONE'S WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO COME BACK AND STOCK OR WE PRESENT ALTERNATIVE UH ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS THAT I THINK IS OUR ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF OUR IN-HOUSE INTERNAL CREATIVE AND CONTENT TEAM COMBINED WITH OUR E-COMMERCE TEAM IS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO IDENTIFY UH MORE SMARTLY WHERE CONSUMERS ARE AND AND WHERE THEY ARE IN THE SHOPPING JOURNEY AND WHAT WE CAN PUT IN FRONT OF THEM AS AN ALTERNATIVE SO WE TEND TO SEE UH WE TEND NOT TO SEE THAT LEAKAGE AND YOU KNOW AS A REMINDER THIS BUSINESS PRE MID-MARCH AND PRE THE PANDEMIC SHUT DOWN HERE IN THE U.S. WAS GROWING 20 PLUS PERCENT WE JUST GREW 29% IN IN THE THIRD QUARTER WE PROVIDED SOME SOME OUTLOOK ON ON ON THE FOURTH QUARTER SO WE EXPECT THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR TO TO RETURN TO THAT 20% GROWTH THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT WAS DRIVING PERFORMANCE AND CONSUMER DEMAND AS WE AS WE WENT THROUGH THAT TIME AND AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO IT RIGHT NOW AND AND WE'LL WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP CONSUMERS ENGAGED WHILE UH WHILE WE GET OUR IN-STOCKS BACK AT THE LEVEL BOTH IN WHOLESALE AND OUR OWN DTC CHANNELS IN THE WAY WE WANT IT FANTASTIC GOOD LUCK IN HOLIDAY SEASON THANKS THANKS CAMILO YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF ALEXANDRA WALVIS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION GOOD MORNING THANKS SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE QUESTION HERE MY FIRST QUESTION IS ON E-COMMERCE E-COMMERCE OF COURSE GROWING UH VERY VERY STRONGLY SO IN THE QUARTER AND YOU MENTIONED THAT WAS UM YOU SAW GROWTH ACROSS CHANNELS COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE DISCREPANCY IN GROWTH THAT YOU'RE SEEING UM BETWEEN YETI.COM AND AMAZON MARKETPLACE YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE THE MIX OF THE E-COMMERCE BUSINESS TODAY BETWEEN THOSE CHANNELS AND AND HOW WOULD YOU EXPECT THAT TO UM TREND GOING FORWARD HEY ALEX GOOD MORNING UM SO YETI.COM AND UH I MAY HAVE SAID THIS IN MY PREPARED REMARKS YETI.COM DEFINITELY LED THE WAY SO IF I THINK ABOUT UM THE DTC BUSINESS YETI.COM WAS THE LEADER THEN AMAZON AND THEN CORPORATE SALES AND I'M LEAVING RETAIL OUT JUST BECAUSE OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON UM WITH THE NEW STORE IT DOESN'T MAKE THE THE PERCENT UM GROWTH RELEVANT UM SO YETI.COM IS STILL THE STRONGEST UM YOU KNOW WE LIKE WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THOSE CHANNELS UM AND ARE REALLY HAPPY WITH THE ENGAGEMENT WE'RE DRIVING WITH YETI.COM YOU KNOW THE AMAZON MARKETPLACE IS AN IMPORTANT BUSINESS FOR US WE SAW YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING BACK TO THE END OF END OF Q1 SLIGHT YOU KNOW DISRUPTION AS PEOPLE WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON MORE ESSENTIALS BUT THAT HAS COME BACK NICELY AND IS GROWING UM VERY VERY WELL BUT CLEARLY THE UH THE STANDOUT WAS YETI.COM GREAT AND ANY PLANS SO YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH OF THOSE YOU ARE PRIORITIZING AS YOU UM AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IN THE COMING QUARTERS AND YEARS SO PRIORITIZING AND I MEAN YOU CAN ASK YOU CAN COME BACK AT ME I'M GONNA STEP AWAY FROM PRIORITIZING INVENTORY BUT REALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE COMING YEARS WE REALLY LIKE THE YETI.COM BUSINESS UM IT'S THE FULLEST EXPRESSION OF OUR BUSINESS IT'S WHERE WE GET YOU KNOW THE MOST INFORMATION FROM A CUSTOMER AND AND BEING ABLE TO INTERACT WITH THE CUSTOMER SO YOU KNOW IF WE CAN WAVE IF I COULD WAVE A MAGIC WAND I'D HAVE EVERYONE GO TO YETI.COM THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW THE AMAZON MARKETPLACE IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF PEOPLE CHOOSE FOR NOW $119 A YEAR IF THEY'RE A PRIME MEMBER AND THEY GO TO BUY YOU KNOW SOMETHING AND THEY WANT TO PUT A A RAMBLER 20 IN THEIR CART WE WANNA BE WHERE THE CUSTOMER WANTS TO SHOP SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW WE THINK LONG-TERM IS AND THAT GOES AS FAR AS WHOLESALE TOO IS BEING WHERE THE CUSTOMER WANTS TO ACCESS THE BRAND IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO US <INAUDIBLE> I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THOUGHTS ON THAT UM MAYBE ONE MORE FROM ME I WONDER IF YOU COULD UPDATE US ON UM <INAUDIBLE> BUSINESS WITH LOWE'S UH HOW MANY <INAUDIBLE> YOU'RE IN NOW HOW THAT'S TRENDING AND AND WHAT'S THE UH WHAT'S THE THE NEXT STEPPING OPPORTUNITY IS THERE YEAH ALEX MATT I'LL I'LL TAKE THAT ONE UM THANKS THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AND AND GOOD MORNING YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO UH REALLY ENJOY THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE BUILT WITH LOWE'S AND THE PARTNERSHIP AND AND THAT'S THAT'S AS IMPORTANT TO US AS WE THINK ABOUT WHAT A METHODICAL PACE ROLLOUT LOOKS LIKE WE SAID THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THAT THE RATIONALE FOR WHY WE ADD ADDITIONAL WHOLESALE IS THAT THEY BRING A A RELATIVELY NEW CONSUMER A NEW BUYING OCCASION OR THEY THEY AUGMENT SUPPORT THE REST OF OUR EXISTING WHOLESALE AND I I THINK LOWE'S HAS CONTINUED TO DO THAT AND BEEN AND BEEN A GOOD PARTNER AS WE HAVE UH EVOLVED AND AND LEARNED TOGETHER YOU KNOW THIS YEAR UM WE'RE INCREDIBLY PLEASED WITH OUR PARTNERSHIP WE MADE SOME DECISIONS AS THE YEAR UH PACED ON TO MODERATE OUR ROLLOUT CONSIDERING THE ENVIRONMENT AND CONSIDERING OUR INVENTORY CONSTRAINTS AND IT GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY FOCUS ON UH THE EXECUTION AND PERFORMANCE SO WHAT UH WHAT WE REALLY LIKE IS WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE INCREMENTALITY OF THAT RELATIONSHIP AND AND WE LOOK AT IT AS A PIECE IN THE PUZZLE OF OUR OVERALL WHOLESALE AND OUR OVERALL WHOLESALE IS A PIECE IN THE PUZZLE OF OUR OVERALL OMNI-CHANNEL SO WE'RE UH WE'RE PLEASED WITH UH WITH HOW THAT'S PERFORMING AND AS WE SAID AT THE UH IN THE PREPARED REMARKS AND WE'LL REITERATE IT HERE WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE IN OUR WHOLESALE AND OUR JOB NOW IS TO UH TO THOUGHTFULLY REBUILD THE CHANNEL INVENTORY SO THAT UH WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS MORE AND MORE OF THE CONSUMER DEMAND FANTASTIC THANKS SO MUCH AND ALL THE BEST THANKS ALEX YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM LINE OF RANDY KONIK WITH JEFFERIES PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION YEAH UH GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY UM YOU KNOW CLEARLY THE THE STRONG REVENUE NUMBERS THE GROWTH OF REVENUE IS INDICATED INDICATIVE OF YOU KNOW ACCELERATION OF NEW CUSTOMER GROWTH AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS YOU KNOW BUYING MORE AND I I REMEMBER I RECALL NUMBERS A NUMBER OF QUARTERS AGO YOU GUYS WERE STARTING TO TRACK UH THE PURCHASE BEHAVIOR OR KIND OF TRACK CUSTOMERS ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO IS THERE ANY KIND OF COLOR YOU CAN GIVE US WHEN YOU ANALYZE THE DTC BUSINESS OF WHAT PROPORTION OF THE REVENUES ARE COMING FROM YOU KNOW NEW BRAND NEW CUSTOMERS VERSUS UH EXISTING CUSTOMERS RIGHT NOW RANDY GOOD MORNING THIS IS MATT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WE HAVEN'T AS YOU AS YOU POINTED OUT WE HAVEN'T SHARED THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE UM WE CONTINUE TO GET SMARTER AND HAVE BETTER INSIGHTS TO YOU KNOW I MADE A COMMENT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING THOSE CUSTOMER COHORTS AND HOW THEY PERFORM AND HOW THEY PERFORM DIFFERENTLY AND AS OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO EXPANDS UH WHAT THAT SEQUENCING OF PURCHASES AND AND WHAT THAT RECURRENCE OF PURCHASE LOOKS LIKE WHAT I CAN SAY IS INTERESTINGLY THROUGH THIS YEAR-TO-DATE AS WE HAVE SEEN ELEVATED DEMAND AND AS CHANNEL SHIFTS HAVE UH HAVE OCCURRED DURING DIFFERENT POINTS OF SHUTDOWN AND WHOLESALE IS OUR NEW TO YETI.COM VERSUS EXISTING OR REPEAT PURCHASE ON YETI.COM UH HAS ALL LIFTED AND AND THAT RATIO BETWEEN THE TWO HASN'T SHIFTED MATERIALLY AND SO WE WE WE REALLY LIKE THE NEW CUSTOMER ACQUISITION THAT WE'RE SEEING AND THE PERCENT OF NEW CUSTOMERS WE'RE SEEING AND UH ALONG WITH THAT WE LIKE THE THE RETURNING CUSTOMER AND THE REPEAT PURCHASE RATE AND AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THEIR BEHAVIOR AFTER THAT FIRST PURCHASE WITHIN THOSE FIRST 30 DAYS WITHIN THOSE FIRST 90 DAYS AND WITHIN THAT FIRST UH FIRST YEAR AND SO THOSE ARE ALL METRICS UH WE'RE WE'RE PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO AND THEN BELOW THAT UM WHAT DOES THAT WHAT DOES THAT BASKET OF EXPANSION EXPANSION LOOK LIKE SO WHAT WE ARE REPORTING UM THE NUMBERS UH IT IS SOMETHING WE'RE PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE TAKING ACTION ON UM AND IT'S SOMETHING WE LIKE THE TREND THAT WE'RE SEEING AND IT'S IT'S A BIG AREA OF INVESTMENT FOR THE BUSINESS IN 2020 AND THAT'LL CONTINUE TO BE A BIG AREA OF INVESTMENT IN 2021 AS WE DRIVE DEEPER CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND AND BEHAVIOR UNDERSTANDINGS TO REALLY TARGET THOSE DISTINCT UH THOSE DISTINCT AUDIENCES THAT'S GREAT UM AND THEN LAST QUESTION UH YOU MENTIONED I BELIEVE THE INTERNATIONAL PENETRATION IS AT UH 7% OF TOTAL I BELIEVE IT WAS ONLY 4% YOU KNOW ONLY A FEW QUARTERS AGO SO CAN YOU GIVE US SOME EXTRA UH DEPTH OF COLOR ON YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF RI- RISING AWARENESS OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THE ACCELERATION YOU'RE SEEING BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT BUSINESS IS NOW STARTING TO KIND OF REALLY COME INTO ITS OWN THAT THAT THAT GEOGRAPHY IF YOU WILL THE INTERNATIONAL AND JUST WANT TO GET SOME COLOR ON WHAT YOU THINK IS UH STARTING TO REALLY CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE THAT UM THAT BUSINESS GOING THAT PART OF THE UH UH SALES GEOGRAPHY GOING FORWARD THANK YOU YEAH YEAH WE'RE WE'RE RANDY WE'RE SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY INTERNATIONALLY WE HAVE BEEN UM BUT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT NOW IS OUR ENTHUSIASM IS BEING MATCHED BY UH THE ACTIVITY AND RESULTS AND I I SAY THAT FULLY KNOWING THAT UH WHOLESALE OR RETAIL IN EUROPE AND THE UK AND AUSTRALIA AND CANADA UNTIL Q3 WAS WAS REALLY DISRUPTED UM BY THE PANDEMIC AND I WOULD SAY DISRUPTED IN SOME CASES EVEN MORE THAN THE U.S. WHOLESALE MARKET SO WHAT WE SAW IN THE QUARTER WAS A REALLY STRONG RECOVERY IN OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UM AND IT CAME BACK IT CAME BACK ALIVE UM WHAT WE LIKED WAS WE SAW STRONG PERFORMANCE OUT OF OUR WHOLESALE LED BY THE CANADIAN WHOLESALE WHICH IS A MARKET THAT WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY AND DIRECTLY WITH YETI EMPLOYEES OPERATING IN SINCE 2017 BUT BALANCED WITH THAT WHOLESALE IS STRONG E-COMMERCE PERFORMANCE AND AND I THINK THAT IS INDICATIVE OF THE RISING AWARENESS OF THE BRAND UM YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THINGS LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA THE CONTENT WE CREATE UM THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION HAS BEEN MORE AND MORE DEMOCRATIZED GLOBALLY AND SO THE AWARENESS OF OUR BRAND AND THE AWARENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS UM IN IN MANY CASES IN SOME OF THE MARKETS WE ENTER INTERNATIONALLY LEADS OUR OFFICIAL ENTRY OR LEADS UM THE THE DISTRIBUTION WE HAVE IN THOSE MARKETS BECAUSE SOCIAL MEDIA IS SUCH A UH SUCH A GLOBALLY DEMOCRATIZED UM AND AVAILABLE SO WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON UH WE SEE THE DEMAND SIGNALS WE BELIEVE THE BRAND IS BIGGER THAN THE REVENUE OUR FOCUS CONTINUES TO BE ON BUILDING OUR BRAND IN THE RIGHT WAY SO WE'RE NOT RUSHING OUT UH JUST TO TASTE SHORT-TERM PLACEMENT OR SHORT-TERM GROWTH UH WE REALLY WANT THE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND WE'RE SEEING THAT IN CANADA AND AUSTRALIA IN PARTICULAR WHERE WE'VE BEEN OPERATING FOR THREE FULL YEARS AND WE'RE SEEING THE EARLY SIGNS OF IT IN THE UK AND EUROPE AND WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT THE UK AND EUROPE IN THE EARLY DAYS IS EVEN WITH THE DISRUPTION THROUGH THE SUMMER IN THEIR UH IN THE WHOLESALE CHANNEL UM THAT E-COMMERCE CONTINUES TO BE TO BE A STRONG OPPORTUNITY SO I THINK YOU'D LOOK FOR US TO GO INTO 2021 WITH A HEAVY FOCUS AROUND INTERNATIONAL FOCUS A HEAVY FOCUS AROUND BRAND BUILDING AND DRIVING UH ULTIMATELY THE QUESTION YOU ASKED WHICH IS DRIVING THE AWARENESS WHICH WE THINK ULTIMATELY DRIVES THE CONSIDERATION AND THE PURCHASE VERY HELPFUL THANKS GUYS THANKS RANDY YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF SHARON ZACKFIA WITH WILLIAM BLAIR PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION HI GOOD MORNING SO QUESTION ON ON THE OPERATING MARGIN YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY HAD UM A COUPLE OF QUARTERS IN A ROW WHERE OPERATING MARGIN HAS STARTED WITH A TWO AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE AMPUTATION IS THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND AND IT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE FULL YEAR UM I GUESS I'D BE INTERESTED IN PAUL AND AND HOW 2020 HAS CHANGED ANY OF YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE LONGTERM SUSTAINABLE MARGIN OF THE COMPANY AND ALSO IF THERE ARE ANY UM ANY AREAS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE OVER EARNING THIS YEAR UH BECAUSE YOU PULL BACK ON MARKETING OR OR TRAVEL OR OTHER DYNAMICS IF YOU COULD KIND OF DIMENSIONALIZE THOSE FOR US YEAH UM GOOD MORNING SHARON SO THE PERFORMANCE IN THAT THE OPERATING MARGIN EXPANSION UM AND THE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC SO AS I AS I THINK ABOUT THAT AND THEN THINKING ABOUT GOING FORWARD OBVIOUSLY THAT'S DRIVEN BY THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DIRECT TO CONSUMER UM AND THE SHIFT THAT WE'VE SEEN BOTH UM IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE THIRD QUARTER BUT EVEN IF WE GO BACK TO THE TO THE FIRST QUARTER AND AND THE WHOLE ALGORITHM OF THE COMPANY OF DTC GROWING FASTER THAN WHOLESALE UM SO A LOT OF THAT MARGIN EXPANSION IS DRIVEN BY GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION BECAUSE WE LOOK TO THE TO THE FUTURE UM I A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THE FIRST IS WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN WITH MIX SHIFT IN COST IMPROVEMENTS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND I DON'T EXPECT IT TO EXPAND TO THE LEVEL IT DID THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT OUTPERFORMANCE OF DTC AND THEN AND AS YOU KNOW JUST UH THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS IS MY DTC BECOMES A BIGGER UM PERCENT OF THE BUSINESS EVERY INCREMENTAL 1% MIX GIVES ME LESS ON THE MIX BUT WE DO BELIEVE UM GROSS MARGIN WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM MIX SHIFT COST IMPROVEMENTS UM AND THEN I WILL SAY WE TALK VERY OFTEN INTERNALLY ABOUT WHERE DO WE WANT TO UM ARE THERE THINGS WE WANT TO INVEST AT THE GROSS MARGIN LEVELS ARE THERE THINGS WE WANT TO INVEST IN IN THE PRODUCT AND I THINK YOU SAW THAT AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS WHEN WE PUT THE CHUG CUP ON THE BOTTLE AND DIDN'T CHANGE THE PRICE UM SO WE DELIVERED VALUE TO THE CONSUMER UM AND HELD TO THE PRICE AND WE USED SOME OF THAT GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION UM TO FUND THEM FROM UH UM OVER EARNING IN THE BUSINESS I THINK THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE AND YOU CALLED IT OUT IS T&E RIGHT SO UH WE'RE STILL WORKING REMOTELY AND AND AND NOT TRAVELING UH SO CERTAINLY T&E IS DOWN YOU KNOW WE

GREAT WHOLESALE PARTNERSHIPS AND THAT VERY OPEN DIALOGUES AS WE'VE UH AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS AND AS WE'VE SEEN CHALLENGES TO THE SUPPLY DISRUPTION UM YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR WHOLESALE PARTNERS IS HOW DO WE FILL IN EITHER WITH OTHER YETI PRODUCTS OR UH MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE REPRESENTED UM AS WELL AS WE CAN AS WE REBUILD THAT SPACE SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE IS UH YOU KNOW AS WE REBUILD THAT INVENTORY WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT SPACE TO MERCHANDISE THE PRODUCTS THE RIGHT WAY AND THE WAY THAT WE DID PRE PANDEMIC AND AND THE WAY WE WOULD EXPECT ALL OF OUR WHOLESALE PARTNERS UM AS UH AT ANY POINT BUT AS WE REBUILD THAT INVENTORY SO I WOULD SAY THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN GREAT UH WE'RE IN FULL

UH THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT UH ABOUT WHAT WE CONTINUE TO DO WITH THE BRAND AND WHAT WE CONTINUE TO DO FROM AN INNOVATION PERSPECTIVE OKAY UH THANKS MATT I'LL ASK THE NEXT QUESTION TO PAUL JUST AROUND THE THE STRUCTURE OF THE GUIDANCE SO WITH THE THE 15% TO 16% UH GROWTH IT DOES IMPLY A NOTABLE DECELERATION FROM Q3 AND WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE UH ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT UH BUT IS THERE ANYTHING IDENTIFIABLE UH THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD CAUSE THAT SLOWDOWN AND THEN UH MAYBE ON A RELATED NOTE THAT THE EPS UH GROWTH GUIDANCE OF $0.31 TO $0.38 IS CERTAINLY ABOVE NORMAL FOR SORT OF YOUR YOUR NORMAL MID-TEENS REVENUE GROWTH SO WHAT ARE THE THE MARGIN CHARACTERISTICS THAT DRIVING THAT ABOVE AVERAGE EPS GROWTH SO A COUPLE OF THINGS ON THE TOPLINE AND AS AS WE THINK ABOUT THIS UM IF YOU STEP BACK TO THE END OF SECOND QUARTER UH WHERE WE SAID THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR WOULD BE 14% TO UM BETWEEN 10% AND 15% UM AND NOW THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR IS UM GONNA BE YOU KNOW ON IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER CALL IT 20% SO IF WE LOOK FROM WHERE WE WERE THREE MONTHS AGO YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS HAS CERTAINLY PERFORMED AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT A VERY STRONG Q3 SO THE THE DECELERATION I I THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY OF THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR FROM WHERE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT THREE MONTHS AGO IS ACTUALLY STRONGER THAN WHAT I WAS TAKING THREE MONTHS AGO UM YOU KNOW AS WE THINK ABOUT THE FOURTH QUARTER IN PARTICULAR UM YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF THINGS THE FIRST IS YOU KNOW WE'RE UP AGAINST OUR STRONGEST COMPARISON FROM LAST YEAR TO PLUS 23 IN LAST YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE INVENTORY CONSTRAINTS UM SO THOSE THAT'S WHAT UM KIND OF SHAPED OUR THINKING ON THE UM CURRENT OUTLOOK BUT AGAIN AS I THINK OF THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR STRONGLY OUTPERFORMING WHAT WE THOUGHT THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR WAS GOING TO BE JUST UH THREE MONTHS AGO FROM AN EPS PERSPECTIVE UM OR A MARGIN IT'S GOING TO BE UM AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT MUCH OF THE SAME WE'RE GONNA SEE EXPANDING GROSS MARGINS NOW WE'RE ROLLING OVER AS FOURTH QUARTER ALWAYS IS OUR BIGGEST DTC QUARTER EVERY YEAR UM SO IT YOU KNOW THE THE HURDLE CERTAINLY GETS GETS HIGHER BUT BUT I THINK ABOUT GROSS MARGINS I'M GOING TO EXPECT SOME GROSS MARGIN I'M GONNA EXPECT GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION FROM THE CHANNEL MIX SHIFT COSTING IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN UM TARIFF TAILWIND AND THEN IF I THINK ABOUT SG&A UM KIND OF COME DOWN THE P&L IT'S GONNA BE A SIMILAR STORY OVERALL OF DE-LEVERAGING ON THE VARIABLE BECAUSE OF THE MIX SHIFT SO REALLY DRIVEN BY MIX SHIFT AND I EXPECT THE NON-VARIABLE UM TO BE ROUGHLY FROM A LEVERAGE PERSPECTIVE TO BE ROUGHLY FLAT ISH YEAR-OVER-YEAR UM FROM A UM LEVERAGE NOT NOT A DOLLAR OBVIOUSLY THE DOLLARS WILL WILL INCREASE SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THE OPERATING MARGIN DOWN TO UM YOU KNOW IF YOU TALK ABOUT GET DOWN TO EPS OBVIOUSLY UH MY LOWER INTEREST UM BOTH FROM A NICE TO BE THE LAST ONE THAT I HIT THE THE BALANCE OF DEBT AND THEN BECAUSE I HAVE A FLOATING RATE DEBT AS YOU ALL KNOW UM INTEREST RATES ARE JUST UM IN MY FAVOR AND AS I DELEVER MY PRICING I GO DOWN ON THE GRID OF LESS EXPENSIVE UM

WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND IN OUR EXISTING PRODUCT FAMILIES AND AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR HISTORY OF PACING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE CONTINUE TO KIND OF PUSH THE EDGE OF OF NEW PRODUCT FAMILIES AND I WOULD EXPECT AS WE GO INTO 2021 THAT THAT'S GONNA CONTINUE YOU KNOW WE WANT TO KEEP REINVIGORATING OUR LONGEST STANDING PRODUCT FAMILIES AND INTRODUCE UH INTRODUCE NEW NEW FAMILIES AND AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND UM UNDERNEATH THE THE PERMISSION THE YETI BRAND AND THE YETI CONSUMERS HAVE GIVEN US TO TO BRING MORE

SECOND ONE IS CAPEX INVESTMENTS AND THE CAPEX INVESTMENTS FALL WITHIN A COUPLE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THEY FALL WITHIN OUR UM THE CONTINUED DIGITIZATION OF THE BUSINESS AND OUR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS

me give you a few recent examples in august, displaying the breadth of our appeal and audience, culture aficionados highsnobiety published an article titled how yeezy beat streetwear at the business of making things cool while driving awareness will continue continue to be a priority. we also balance a focus on the depth of engagement with our long-standing customers which keeps us centered. from a storytelling perspective, the pandemic created a unique opportunity to launch our latest collection of yeti presents films. after the pandemic caused us to cancel our in-person yeti film tour in march this summer, we released the eight new films through a youtube live premiere featuring video introductions from our ambassadors, filmmakers, and film subjects. this event showcased the power and reach of the yeti community to complement youtube an extension of the virtual tour was aired in partnership with vice media and cbs in september we also launched a socially distanced drive-in film tour across eight stops from l a to montauk to central texas creating a safe, uniquely yeti experience for our fans from the product introduction side we partnered with our ambassadors for our

venue workers after securing thirty seven music artists to customize forty two of our roadie twenty four coolers for our online auction the program raised a hundred and thirty five thousand dollars the campaign was an incredible success and attracted additional top tier artists who were eager to support future efforts we have also focused on finding ways to ensure the wild is open WELCOMING AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THRIVE OUTSIDE AND BIG CITY MOUNTAINEERS TWO ORGANIZATIONS COMMITTED TO DRIVING DIVERSITY IN THE OUTDOORS WE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH BLACK OUTSIDE AN INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION BASED OUT OF SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS WHICH CONNECTS BLACK YOUTH TO THE OUTDOORS MOVING TO YETI INNOVATION WE CONTINUE TO SEE SUSTAINED STRENGTH ACROSS DRINK WEAR, COOLERS AND E Long before the pandemic and we are now seeing the strength continue through the third quarter as a result of more fully open channels plus positive trends in digital engagement outdoor pursuits a focus on hygiene and individual use and people taking near home vacations these dynamics support the robust demand we are seeing across the product portfolio and particularly both hard and soft coolers in drinkware we have seen a success with the performance of our bottles business where we included the popular chug coolers in drinkware we have seen a success with the performance of our bottles business where we included the popular chug coolers in drinkware we have seen a success with the performance of our bottles business where we included the popular chug coolers in drinkware we have seen a success with the performance of our bottles business where we included the popular chug coolers in drinkware we have seen a success with the performance Cap as the standard lid and our expanded colster can insulator line where we now offer broader products for hard seltzers and large cans while currently limited to d to c we are also encouraged by the early success of our rambler ten oz tumbler which is mentioned earlier was supported by our caffeine and cocktails digital campaign color remains an important part of our innovation mix following the july launches of northwoods greens and drinkware and sagebrush green and coolers we launch our third second half half of our innovation mix following the july launches of northwoods greens and drinkware and sagebrush green and coolers we launch our third second half half of our innovation mix following the july launches of northwoods greens and drinkware and sagebrush green and coolers we launch our ice pink in mid-september. demand for this extremely popular color extended into our breast cancer awareness initiatives throughout october. we are excited to once again support breast cancer and casting for recovery. our fourth year with both of these incredible organizations. we also expanded our rambler elements metallic collection to the coupe and lowball, an extended sagebrush from coolers into drinkware. i would like to take a moment to address the voluntary recall which was announced yesterday. Partnership with the u.s. consumer product safety commission of the rambler twenty ounce travel mug with our stronghold lid we launched the travel mug on october first as our newest travel-ready product however shortly after our limited initial launch on yahoo dot com and in our retail stores we discovered a potential safety issue with the stronghold lid and out of an abundance of caution decided to pull the product from these channels and voluntarily began work with the cpsc to date there have been no reports. Of injuries from customers to put this recall in perspective we sold less than fifteen thousand units during the nine days it was available in these direct channels of the approximately two hundred and forty two thousand total produced mugs mentioned in our release in addition we did not ship the product to our wholesale partners customer safety is our priority which is why we took such an aggressive stance addressing this issue we are actively engaged in working on an enhanced design that will continue to meet the high standards Standards that our customers place on each and every product carrying the yeti brand this delay while disappointing in the near term is fully contemplated in our outlook and will continue to make us better in addition to our lineup of new products launched this year we are continuing to energize some of our existing categories as part of our marketing strategy to drive broader awareness this includes the come hell or high water campaign in early july that showcases the versatility and performance of our products of our panga of fully submersible bags more recently, our built for generations yeti v series films launched digitally on yeti social are centered around our innovative premium stainless steel cooler which is designed to be passed down through the generations expect continued targeted product storytelling through the holidays with our holiday gift guides and upcoming yeti dispatch magalog which will begin to drop mid november we also remain laser focused on working towards rebuilding in stock levels As a reminder, to protect our balance sheet in late Q1, we initially reduced purchase orders at the start of the pandemic. And as demand recovered, we have worked to flex our supplier capacity to meet rising demand. With demand accelerating in the third quarter, coupled with some pandemic-driven supply disruptions through the summer and early fall production, we expect inventory will remain tight through the holidays. We have taken additional action to mitigate risk and increase visibility of our supply chain during the holidays. but do expect our overall restocking initiatives will extend into early two thousand and twenty one as we look at the balance of the year we remain focused on driving deeper engagement across the eddi portfolio and executing in stocks across all channels looking at our omni channel efforts consumer dynamics are clearly accelerating the digital shift and building upon the activities we have been driving for the past five years along with the heightened focus of our brand. In delivering amazing, highly relevant digital content, we're taking additional actions to drive greater consumer acquisition and conversion through investments in incremental consumer insights and behavioral work, an enhanced product customization experience, new digital tools, and talent additions to our team. This is work that will evolve as we match the speed of our customers' purchasing habits and the rapidly evolving consumer expectations. The biggest proof point of our success here is our direct-to-consumer business. Which grew sixty two percent and reached fifty one percent of total sales this period and year to date our strong third quarter to dc performance was led by yahoo dot com due to excellent traffic and conversion on the site we continue to see a great mix of new versus existing customers and have maintained great engagement as a result of our targeted and relevant content rounding out our online presence the amazon marketplace continues to post solid growth through the quarter on the corporate side revenues turned slightly positive for the quarter as healthy demand was limited by inventory availability increased capacity and delivery for custom is our focus as we ramp through the holiday season in yeti retail we added our eighth location in west palm beach in august we continue to prioritize operational excellence in all our stores while also monitoring the real estate environment for opportunity as we evaluate store expansion potential for twenty twenty one Turning to wholesale, demand and channel sell-through remained robust. Retailers were able to support demand with in-store inventory. However, they did in the quarter with inventory down double digits compared to the prior year. We have opportunity to drive stronger in stocks, particularly in high demand areas such as coolers and soft coolers which had significant sell-through during the quarter. As the wholesale business evolves, we're working to support the expanded omni capabilities of our wholesale partners through their distribution channels. E-commerce, curbside, and in-store which combined are expected to be an important part of this holiday season. we had a very strong performance in our international businesses quarter with international wholesale more than doubling while our international e-commerce quadrupled in size still off a low base but showing great potential overall, international grew a hundred and sixty-five percent to reach seven percent of sales the highest mix yeti has registered to date. The biggest factor in the growth was the reopening of our Canadian wholesale which delivered significant year-over-year growth this quarter. Importantly, the D to C side of the Canadian business, including both e-commerce and corporate sales, also registered exponential growth during the period. While Canada still drives the majority of our current international business, we continue to be highly encouraged with the demand we see in other markets. Australia showed more than a threefold increase in both the wholesale and e-commerce businesses. Due to the extraordinary performance and execution of our australian team as we hit the one year mark in our u k and europe expansion we're seeing this business build larger each quarter and we continue to see a meaningful opportunity to drive performance as retail reopens we remain highly focused on building the brand internationally in a thoughtful manner while developing the infrastructure to support smart sustainable growth outside of our strategic priorities We were excited to announce earlier this week the next step in our board evolution as our board of directors appointed alison dean former cfo of i robot as an independent director and a member of our audit committee alison brings over thirty years of financial leadership experience including fifteen years with i robot and seven years as a company cfo before stepping down earlier in twenty twenty alison's addition corresponds to the resignation of mike najjar who returns to his role managing court. Additionally, our chair and co-president dave snodgrass has informed the board that he intends to step down as chair of the board and the nominating and corporate governance committee effective at the twenty twenty one annual meeting of shareholders dave has indicated that he would be willing to stand for re-election to the board if so nominated in may we appreciate the many contributions dave and mike have made to yeti over the years with these moves one of our nine current board members is affiliated with our original private equity sponsor seven are now independent directors and one third are women we are proud to continue adding diverse thought and incredible experience to our board as we further build out the long-term opportunity for the brand as i pass the call over to paul i would again like to reiterate how thrilled we are with the holistic performance during the third quarter and i would like to thank our yeti team for their exemplary efforts and ability to adapt and thrive so well against a very challenging backdrop To our customers and partners who have continued to show their confidence in our products and our brand, thank you. while challenges remain pervasive in the headlines, we are fully focused on our people and what we do best, driving passion for the yeti brand and delivering innovative products. we look forward to building upon the strength of our twenty twenty to date performance with strong execution through the holiday season and q4 paul thanks, guys Good morning everyone. i'll begin with a review of our third quarter results followed by some high level thoughts as we look at the business during the holiday period. we'll then open up the call for your questions. starting with the third quarter net sales increased twenty nine percent to two hundred ninety four point six million compared to two hundred twenty nine point one million in the prior year period representing our highest growth rate as a public company. the momentum that built throughout the second quarter accelerated into the third given what we believe is a sustainable shift in consumer behavior towards outdoor leisure activities and related products this trend was highlighted by balanced growth across our product categories and continued d t c momentum even as our wholesale channel returned to growth and experienced even stronger sell-through during the quarter Looking at our channels, direct to consumer net sales grew sixty two percent to a hundred and fifty five point four million compared to ninety two point nine million in the same period last year driven by strength in both coolers and equipment and drinkware within d t c the yeti dot com business continued to lead the way the amazon marketplace posted strong growth and corporate sales increased slightly for the period overall d t c reached fifty one percent of net sales for the period compared to forty one percent in last year's period wholesale net sales increased six percent to one hundred forty four point two million compared to one hundred thirty six point two million last year strong gains in drinkware helped offset declines in clothing and equipment which were largely driven by inventory Constraints channel sell-through was up double digits for the quarter though channel inventories exited the quarter down double digits on a year-over-year basis by category, drinkware returned to strong growth during the quarter with net sales increasing thirty one percent to a hundred and sixty five point nine million compared to a hundred and twenty six point four million last year we are very pleased with the results. the continued strength of our original drinkware skews even as we introduce new products to address additional use cases for our customers our expanded colster lineup and updated bottle styles with chug caps remained big winners this year and we are also excited to see the early receptivity of our ten ounce rambler during the period coolers and equipment net sales increased twenty seven percent revenue to a hundred and twenty four point two million compared to ninety seven point eight million during the same period last year our overall coolers business remains vibrant led by our new rodi twenty four in the tundra hall in hard coolers and our flip and back flip lines in soft coolers we also saw strong results in our outdoor living category led by our trailhead camp chair which we believe supports the broader opportunity of the brand as we develop and expand deeper into new categories gross profit increased forty five percent to a hundred and seventy four million or fifty nine point one percent of net sales compared to a hundred and twenty point one million or fifty two point four percent of net sales during the same period last year the six hundred and seventy bases Point year over year expansion was driven by the following favorable impacts two hundred and ninety basis points from channel mix a hundred and ten basis points from product cost improvements ninety basis points from lower tariffs seventy basis points from lower inbound freight seventy basis points from higher inventory reserves in the prior period In lower warranty expenses in the current period and lastly forty basis points from all other impacts adjusted s&g&a expenses for the third quarter increased by twenty two percent to a hundred one one point six million of thirty four point five percent of net sales as compared to eighty three point five million or thirty six point four percent of net sales in the same period. Last year variable sgna expenses de-leveraged a hundred and fifty basis points driven by a significant shift in channel mix towards a faster growing dtc channel primarily with higher outbound freight non-variable sgna expenses leveraged three hundred and fifty basis points driven by the overall strength of the company's top-line results. we continue to invest prudently to grow our business with higher year over year spending across most key expense categories including marketing while we also resumed hiring more broadly across the organization adjusted operating income increased ninety eight percent to seventy two point four million or twenty four point six percent of net sales compared to Thirty six point six million or sixteen percent of net sales during the same period last year our effective tax rate was twenty four point four percent during the quarter compared to twenty four point nine percent in last year's third quarter adjusted net income more than doubled to fifty three point five million or sixty one cents per diluted share compared to twenty three point two million or twenty seven cents per diluted share during the prior year period adjusted ebitda increased eighty four percent to eighty point two million or twenty seven point two percent of net sales compared to forty three point seven million or nineteen point one percent of net sales in the same quarter last year now turning to our balance sheet As of september twenty six twenty twenty we had cash of two hundred and thirty four point eight million compared to thirty four point six million in the year ago period our strong cash balance in part reflects our lower inventory position as we ended the quarter with a hundred and thirty four point six million in inventory compared to two hundred and nine point two million during the same quarter last year. Inventory decline thirty six percent year over year reflecting both the comparison to a thirty three percent growth in the year ago period as well as ongoing efforts to match supply with the above forecasted demand we have seen across the business going forward our focus remains on flexing our supply chain to not only match the strong demand we have seen for the brand going forward our focus remains on flexing our supply chain to not only match the strong demand we have seen for the brand going forward our focus remains on flexing our supply chain to not only match the strong demand we have seen for the brand going forward our focus remains on flexing our supply chain to not only match the strong demand we have seen for the brand going forward our focus remains on flexing our supply chain to not only match the strong demand we have seen for the brand going forward our focus remains on flexing our supply chain to not only match the strong demand we But also rebuild more consistent in-stock levels across our channels. as such, we expect to be in a constrained inventory position across certain products as we work through the fourth quarter. total debt, excluding unamortized deferred financing fees and financing leases was two hundred and thirty-eight point eight million compared to two hundred and ninety-eight million in last year. Year's third quarter during the quarter we made principal payments of fifty three point eight million inclusive of a fifty million dollar voluntary pre payment and with our strong cash position for the quarter the ratio of total net debt to adjusted ebitda for the trailing twelve months was essentially zero times compared to one point six times in the prior year quarter. Overall, we couldn't be prouder of how our business and our team has responded since the beginning of the pandemic. Nevertheless, we know there is more work to be done to navigate the ongoing uncertainties of the current environment to execute on our holiday plan and ultimately to continue our momentum into 2021 given the incredible performance of our third quarter. I'll give you some high level thoughts into how we see the balance of the year playing out we expect fourth quarter net sales to increase between fifteen and sixteen percent year over year on top of a strong twenty four percent growth rate in last year's fourth quarter as a reminder the fourth quarter includes the impact of an extra week which extends the fiscal period to january second twenty twenty one and is expected to benefit revenues by approximately seven million dollars with our strong outperformance in the third quarter contributing to lean inventories across our channels we expect demand for the yetti brand will continue to exceed available supply during the fourth quarter as we focus on rebuilding our inventory position we are also actively and aggressively managing all aspects of our supply chain. To navigate real and potential disruptions from supplier capacity to holiday logistics. we expect our ongoing work here will provide opportunities for growth as we continue to restock the channel into early twenty twenty one turning to the bottom line gap earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter are expected to be between fifty five and fifty eight cents. compared to five cents in the year ago period we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between fifty seven and sixty cents reflecting a thirty one to thirty eight percent year over year growth before turning the call over for c u n a i want to reinforce three themes we are seeing in the business first we are seeing incredible demand for the yeti brand with growth Evenly balanced between our two main product categories and supported by our omni-channel evolution. second, we are focused on delivering profitable growth, highlighted by record gross margins and disciplined sg&a management. lastly, we continue to build more financial flexibility to support strategic opportunities and drive future shareholder value. we believe these themes are the hallmarks of a successful organization. STRONG, ENDURING BRAND AND POSITION THE COMPANY INCREDIBLY WELL AS WE LOOK TO ACHIEVE OUR LONG-TERM GOALS WE WOULD NOW LIKE TO OPEN THE CALL FOR QUESTIONS OPERATOR THANK YOU AT THIS TIME WE WILL BE CONDUCTING A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD A CONFIRMATION TONE WILL INDICATE YOUR LINE IS IN THE QUEUE CUE You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key one moment please while we poll for questions your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes from online your first question comes Of peter benedict with baird. please proceed with your question. oh, guys, good morning. thanks for the questions. um, first, first, just on the inventory paul, i don't know if you can give us maybe a better sense of of where you where you you hope to have this sitting at your end and then assuming that the man pace remains i guess similar when would you realistically expect to be back? Kind of in stock at levels that will allow you to kind of grow with self-service. is that something that you think you could get early at twenty one or if this demand level continues, will you be chasing for for quite some time? that's my first question. matt, one follow-up. great, thank you, peter. good morning. so we expect to end the year still down on inventory, but will make sequential improvement from where we are in the third quarter. so while down year-over-year, we'll make sequential improvement from where we are in the third quarter. The year we do expect to the percentage to lessen on a decrease year over year. And then as we look into twenty twenty one you know it's probably the first half of the year where we continue to you know ramp up our inventory and it's really it's all about demand and what we're seeing today is demand is very, very strong and we hope that continues. But we think as we go we do expect to the percentage to lessen on a decrease year over year. And then as we look into twenty twenty one you know it's probably the first half of the year where we continue to you know ramp up our inventory and it's really it's all about demand and what we're seeing today is demand is very, very strong and we hope that continues. But we think as we go we do expect to the percentage to lessen on a decrease Through twenty twenty one we'll get to a more normalized level okay that's helpful and then i guess related to that just matt, maybe talk about the the innovation cadence in the business and i know you guys adjusted some of the new product introductions this year just in response to covid and whatnot. but now we've got the supply constraint dynamic out there. so maybe this is how is how is your planning evolved for for twenty twenty one in terms of what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what Maybe you were thinking a year ago you would introduce versus what now you think the cats will look like? peter, thanks, the morning. you know, i would say our planning and roadmap for twenty twenty one as it relates to the product has not changed significantly. so the, the changes we made in twenty twenty, early in the year when we didn't have a great visibility on the back half of the year and as we've previously communicated, shifted some things to the front half of the year. Of twenty twenty one we don't expect those to get caught up in the in the inventory rebuild and the kind of capacity that we're putting on or the pressure we're putting on our suppliers for capacity so we expect that that shouldn't have a substantial impact on our product roadmap in the introduction of products next year it's really is as paul indicated it's really rebuilding the current product portfolio or current inventory back up so i feel like Good about the innovation cadence being intact in the plan for innovation in twenty twenty one and in parallel we'll be rebuilding and in ramping up our our supply capacity for our existing product portfolio okay that's helpful i if i can think one more and then i'll turn it over i apologize just with respect to the recall i'm not sure how much you can say about it but i'm just curious what's different about that mag slider on the travel mug versus the others you get you have mag sliders on a lot of different products so If you're at liberty to say, and then you said, you know, any impact is in your fourth quarter plan, paul, there's you could pull a little more specific behind what you think the impact's gonna be. Thank you. yeah, peter, i'll take the, the front of that. the, you know, we did a voluntary recall in an abundance of caution and didn't have any. we had a report of a dislodging of our, of our magnetic lid and so we quickly moved, you know, nine days into the launch of this product through our own drive. channels and and took a took a decisive action quickly to make sure we fully understood and fully wrapped this the difference between the two products is in the legacy product there's one magnet on the top and on the new one there's a magnet on the bottom of the magnet on the top and that's what can they can dislodge from each other so you know we put incredible importance on consumer safety and when we saw this report of it we had an opportunity to quickly quickly wrap it and get it off the market And put our team back to work on making sure that we had the product out in the market that we thought was deserving of the ety brand. And then, peter, on the sales impact, while i won't share kind of what our plan was, and as you can imagine, there are a lot of puts and takes there as we introduced a new product. How does that impact current products? So when we pulled the ety travel mug, you know, they were the perceived cannibalization of other products. goes away. so as we said, it's fully contemplated in the in the top line guidance that we gave in the fifteen to sixteen percent. and you know, we're excited too, as the team is, is reworking that lid and you know, looking looking forward. okay, fair enough, thanks, guys. your next question comes from the line of camilla lyon with btig. your next question comes from the line of camilla lyon with btig. your next question comes from the line of camilla lyon with btig. your next question comes from the line of camilla lyon with btig. your next question comes from the line of camilla lyon with btig. your next question comes from the line of camilla lyon with btig. your next question comes from the line please proceed with your question thank you. good morning, guys. and great job on the quarter. i wanted to draw down a little bit more on the inventory comments you're making. i think you have some inventory constraints also during the middle of the quarter and obviously continue here in the fourth quarter. maybe if you can help us understand what categories you're feeling particularly light on and how you're thinking about That you'd prefer to to supply over one over the other so are you going to feed your d t c first when supply comes back or is it is coming through and also are you seen where in the supply chain are you seen the disruptions is it on the production side is it shipping times is it at the ports i'm just curious to understand where the bottlenecks exist and where we could see some alleviation of that of that inventory flow sure so let's start with The kind of how we got here or kind of just you know kind of going back a few months. so if you remember back at the end of first quarter and this is this is where we see the bottlenecks because they really aren't true bottlenecks in the in the normal sense but if we go back to the first quarter, the end of the first quarter, first two weeks of the first quarter, first two weeks of the second quarter, we cut back four p o's. As we were seeing those demand signals, we had some supply chain disruption there, but it was really us cutting back, looking at the current demand signals at that point. and then demand started to, in the back half of the second quarter, started to take off. we began placing forward orders and then as we came into q3, so it's really about a lot of this impact is, you know, kind of going back to the end of first quarter, beginning of a second quarter, starting to take off. where we weren't producing at a capacity or we weren't producing at the level to support the twenty nine percent in two three and you know back then i never would have expected to to drive twenty nine percent top line growth in the third quarter so it is really we have all our all our factories working you know full capacity and producing so it's not a it's not a bottleneck in the sense of you know ports and things of that nature that being said You know, and you've seen it in the headlines, the port coming into the into the u s on the west coast and then certainly just logistics in in getting the the goods to our d c s but it really is about kind of the progression of rebuilding the inventory from an allocation here's how we think about it is we want to meet consumer demand across channels and if we think about our wholesale channel Right, so our sell-in was plus six percent and we talked about wholesale demand being close to what our top line was, in line with what our top line was as a company. So, we knew we had inventory in the channel. So, we used that inventory to satisfy demand and then we used the inventory we had to satisfy our d t c. So, we're constantly looking at satisfying consumer demand. Demand and that's kind of how we allocate the inventory. And we continue to do that into the fourth quarter. Got it. Ok, great. And then just on the categories, is there a specific under inventoried position that's more, that's more grave, maybe that's too strong a word, but that's of greater focus, fooler's versus stringer's? where is it equally balanced in terms of where you'd like to be yeah, good, good question. and i'm gonna come at it from the other angle of we had the benefit of all last year building up my drinkware inventory so even as i came into the first quarter, second quarter, and i did the same thing there, i cut forward p o's but i had a lot of drinkware inventory in my d c so as demand came back i was able to you know, put forward p o's in so i had the benefit of having a lot of drinkware inventory which, again, as we talked about was a tariff mitigation and turned into a coronavirus mitigation so that i was i benefited from that piece just that's clear, thank you and then maybe, matt, as you think about this you know, the balance of the the excess supply the excess demand a demand outstripping supply with maintaining the brand heat that you are clearly benefiting from are you are you at all seen anything on the competitive landscape where a customer is is leaving the brand just to fulfill some sort of purchase need and in how are you trying to mitigate you know that potential loss sale or that lost customer that you may be organically coming to you but not seeing that demand fulfilled? Seen through time and through different points in yeti's history, when we get into supply-constrained environments or where demand is outstripping supply, is that we don't tend to see a lot of leakage of the of the customer. And part of it is because we focus a lot on making sure we'll continue to drive engagement. And even if it's engagement in between purchases, or it's engagement while someone's waiting for something to come back in stock, or we present alternative products. Products. i think it is our one of the benefits of our in-house, internal creative and content team combined with our e-commerce team is that we are able to identify more smartly where consumers are and where they are in the shopping journey and what we can put in front of them as an alternative. so we tend to see we tend not to see that leakage and you know, as a reminder, this business pre-mid march and pre-pandemic shut down here in the us was growing twenty percent plus. We just grew twenty nine percent in the third quarter we provided some some outlook on on the fourth quarter so we expect the back half of the year to to return to that twenty percent growth this is a business that was driving performance and consumer demand as we as we went through that time and and will continue to do it right now and and will work hard to make sure we keep consumers engaged while while we get our in stocks back at the level both in wholesale and in our own d to c channels in the way we want fantastic, good luck on the holiday, sue. thanks, eric. your next question comes from a line of alexandra waldis with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question. good morning. thanks so much for taking the question here. my first question is on e commerce. e commerce, of course, is growing very, very strongly still in the quarter. and you mentioned that was that you saw growth across channels. could you talk about the discrepancy in growth that you're seeing? And between youtube and amazon marketplace, you know, what's the mix of the e-commerce business today between those channels, and how would you expect that to trend going forward? hey, alex, good morning. so, youtube dot com and i made this in my prepared remarks. youtube dot com definitely led the way. so, if i think about, um, you know, the d t c business, youtube dot com, and i said, this is my prepared remarks. youtube dot com definitely led the way. so, if i think about, um, you know, the d t c business, youtube dot com, and i said, this is my prepared remarks. youtube dot com definitely led the way. so, if i think about, um, you know, the d t c business, youtube dot WAS THE LEADER, THEN AMAZON, AND THEN CORPORATE SALES. AND I'M LEAVING RETAIL OUT JUST BECAUSE OF THE YEAR OVER YEAR COMPARISON WITH NEW STORES. DOESN'T MAKE THE PERCENT GROWTH RELEVANT. SO YETI DOT COM IS STILL THE STRONGEST. YOU KNOW WE LIKE WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THOSE CHANNELS. AND WE'RE REALLY HAPPY WITH THE ENGAGEMENT. WE'RE DRIVING WITH YETI DOT COM. YOU KNOW THE AMAZON MARKETPLACE IS AN IMPORTANT BUSINESS FOR US. This is going back to the end of in this q one slight, you know, disruption as people were really focused on more essentials, but that has come back nicely and is growing very, very well. but clearly the the standout was yahoo dot com. great, any plans, so, you know, which, which of those are you prioritizing as you move forward in the coming quarters and the years? so, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, prioritize, Describing and i'm gonna you can't you can't come back at me and i'm gonna step away from prioritizing inventory if but really if you think about the coming years we really like the yeti dot com business it's the fullest expression of our business it's where we get you know the most information from a customer and in being able to interact with a customer so if we could wave if i could wave a magic wand i'd have everyone go to yeti dot com that being said the amazon marketplace is currently Important, if people choose for now a hundred nineteen dollars a year, if they're a prime member, and they go to buy you know something, and they want to put at a rambler twenty in their cart, we want to be where the customer wants to shop. So that's kind of how we think long-term is. And that goes as far as wholesale is being where the customer wants to access the brand is the most important thing to us. To update us on the business with lowes, how many doors you're in now, how that's trending, and what the next step opportunity is there. yeah, alex, matt, i'll take that one. thanks, thanks for the question, and good morning. you know, we continue to really enjoy the relationship that we built with lowes in the partnership, and that's as important to us as we think about what a methodical pace rollout is. Looks like we said that from the very beginning that the the rationale for why we add additional wholesale is that they bring a relatively new consumer, a new buying occasion or they they augment support the rest of our existing wholesale and and i think bloes has continued to do that and it's been and it's been a good partner as we have evolved and learned together you know this year were incredibly pleased with our partnership we made some decisions As the year pases on to moderate our rollout, considering the environment and considering our inventory constraints. And it gave us an opportunity to really focus on the execution and performance. So what we really like is we continue to see the incrementality of that relationship. And we look at it as a piece in the puzzle of our overall wholesale and our overall wholesale is a piece in the puzzle of our overall omnichannel. So we're pleased with how that's performing and as we're At the in the in a prepared remarks and we've reiterated here we're pleased with the overall performance of our wholesale and our job now is to to thoughtfully rebuild the channel infrastructure so that we continue to address more and more of the consumer demands fantastic, thanks so much and all the best thanks alex your next question comes from line of randy konic with jeffries please proceed with your question Questions yeah, good morning everybody you know clearly, the strong revenue numbers, the growth of revenue is indicative of you know, acceleration of new customer growth and existing customers buying more and i remember, i recall numbers, a number of quarters ago, you guys were starting to track the purchase behavior or kind of track customers on what they're doing so is there any kind of color you can give us when you analyze the dc t business of what proportion of the revenues are coming from you know new brand new customers versus existing customers right now randy good morning it's matt what i would say is we haven't as you pointed out we haven't shared the specific numbers it is something that we we continue to get smarter and have better insights to i i made A comment a little bit earlier that you know we're we're focused on understanding those customer cohorts and how they perform and how they perform differently and as our product portfolio expands what that sequencing of purchases and what that recurrence of purchase looks like what i can say is interestingly through this year to date as we have seen elevated demand and as channel shifts have occurred during different points of shutdown and wholesale. Is our new to yahoo dot com versus existing or repeat purchase on yahoo dot com has all lifted and in that ratio between the two hasn't shifted materially. and so we we really like the new customer acquisition that we're seeing and the percent of new customers we're seeing and along with that we like the the returning customer and the repeat purchase rate and and what we're really focused on is you know what is their behavior after that first purchase within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty days within those first thirty The first ninety days and within that first first year. And so those are all metrics we're we're paying a lot of attention to and then below that what does that what does that basket of expansion expansion look like? So while we aren't reporting the numbers it is something we're paying a lot of attention to. It's something we're taking action on and it's something we like the trend that we're seeing. And it's it's a big area of investment for the business in twenty twenty and that'll continue to be a big area of investment in twenty twenty one. As we drive deeper consumer insights and behavioral understandings to to really target those distinct those distinct audiences that's great and then last question you mentioned i believe the international penetration is at seven percent of total i believe it was only four percent you know only a few quarters ago so can you give us some extra depth of color on you know what you think is happening in terms of where we're going? Rising awareness or what would you have you just try to get a sense of the acceleration you're seeing because it seems like that business is now starting to kind of really come into its own that that that geography, if you will, the international and just want to get some color on what you think is starting to really continue to accelerate that that business going that that part of the sales geography going forward thank you yeah yeah we're we're really super excited about the opportunity internationally we have been BUT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT NOW IS OUR ENTHUSIASM IS BEING MATCHED BY THE ACTIVITY AND RESULTS. AND I SAY THAT FULLY KNOWING THAT HOLESALE OR RETAIL IN EUROPE, IN THE UK, IN AUSTRALIA, AND IN CANADA, IN CHINA, WAS REALLY DISRUPTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND I WOULD SAY DISRUPTED IN SOME CASES EVEN MORE THAN THE US HOLESALE MARKET. SO WHAT WE SAW ON THE QUARTER WAS A REALLY STRONG RECOVERY IN OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINE Live what we liked was we saw strong performance out of our wholesale led by the canadian wholesale which is a market that we've been actively and directly with yeti employees operating in since two thousand and seventeen but balance with that wholesale is strong e-commerce performance and i think that is indicative of the rising awareness of the brand i think that things like social media the content we create that type of information has been more and more democratized Globally and so the awareness of our brand and the awareness of our products in in many cases in some of the markets we enter internationally leads our official entry or leads the distribution we have in those markets because social media is such a such a globally democratized and available so we continue to focus on we see the demand signals we believe the brand is bigger than the revenue our focus continues to be on we see the demand signals we believe the brand is bigger than the revenue our focus continues to be on we see the demand signals we believe the brand is bigger than the revenue our focus continues to be on we see the demand signals we believe the brand is bigger than the revenue our focus continues to be on we see the demand signals we believe the brand is bigger than the revenue our focus continues to be on we see the demand signals we believe the brand is bigger Building our brand in the right way so we're not rushing out just to taste a short-term placement or short-term growth. we really want the sustainable growth and we're seeing that in canada and australia in particular where we've been operating for three full years and we're seeing the early signs of it in the u.k. and europe. and what we like about the u.k. and europe in the early days is even with the disruption through the summer in their there in the wholesale channel that e-commerce continues to be a strong opportunity. so i think you can see that we're building our brand in the right way so we're not rushing out just to taste a short-term placement or short-term growth. we really want the sustainable growth and we're seeing that in canada and australia Looked for us to go into twenty twenty one with a heavy focus around international, a heavy focus around brand building and driving ultimately the question you asked, which is driving the awareness which we think ultimately drives a consideration in the purchase very helpful, thanks guys thanks randy your next question comes from the line of sharon zacks with william blair please proceed with your question Hi, good morning. So, question on, on the operating margin. You've obviously had a couple of quarters in a row where operating margin has started with the two and it looks like the impetus is that that will continue in the fourth quarter and it looks like for the full year. I guess i'd be interested in paul and in how twenty twenty has changed any of your thoughts about the long-term sustainable margin of the company and also if there are any areas where you're seeing growth in the operating margin. Like you're over earning this year because you've pulled back on marketing or or travel or other dynamics and you could kind of dimensionalize those for us yeah, um, good morning, charlie. so the performance in the, the operating margin expansion and the performance has been fantastic. so as i think about that and then thinking about going forward, obviously that's driven by the significant increase in direct to consumer in this shift that we've seen. In the second quarter and the third quarter, but even if we go back to the to the first quarter and in the whole algorithm of the company of d t c growing faster than wholesale. so a lot of that margin expansion is driven by gross margin expansion. as we look to the to the future a couple of thoughts. the first is we expect gross margin with mix shift in cost improvements to continue to expand. i I don't expect it to expand to the level it did this year because of the significant outperformance of dtec and then and as you know just the law of large numbers as my dtec becomes a bigger percent of the business every incremental one percent mix gives me less on the mix but we do believe gross margin will continue to benefit from mix shift cost improvements and then and i will say we talk very often in Internally, about when do we want to are there things we want to invest at the gross margin level? are there things we want to invest in the product? and i think you saw that and we've talked about this when we put the chug cap on the bottle and didn't change the price so we delivered value to the consumer and held the price and we used some of that gross margin expansion to fund that from a over earning in the business i think the most obvious one AND YOU CALLED IT OUT AS TEENY, RIGHT? SO WE'RE STILL WORKING REMOTELY AND IN AND IN NOT TRAVELING SO CERTAINLY TEENY IS DOWN YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE AND EVEN THOUGH WE SAW SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE ON NON VARIABLE EXPENSES YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS WE CONTINUE TO SPEND MORE IN MARKETING WE'VE RESUMED HIRING SO YOU KNOW We continue to bring great talent into the business and things of that nature. so the expense leverages really about kind of the top line growth. but other than p and e you know we are running the business and investing in the business for the future. so i don't feel like we're over-earning to use your word based on you know cutting back on expenses thanks that's very helpful Well, your next question comes from the line of robbie o'meara with bank of america securities. please proceed with your question. oh, thanks, guys. you know, great quarter. the, um, actually, just two quick questions. um, you mentioned, you know, sort of some new drivers of growth to the brand outdoor, near home vacations, things like that, near the beginning of the call. i guess i'm matt. is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is there any, um, is when you get beyond the the inventory constraints and you look out you know the next year or two um are you looking at are there some new wholesale type customers that you guys are thinking about now because of these new drivers of demand for the brand that you maybe weren't thinking about a year ago I WOULD SAY FOR OUR BRAND THERE HAVE BEEN DYNAMICS THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING FOR THE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS THAT THAT MOVEMENT TOWARDS BEING ACTIVE OUTDOORS ADVENTURE BASED VACATIONS CAR CAMPING ALL THOSE DYNAMICS WE THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS SUMMER IS JUST ITS ACCELERATED EXPOSURE OF THE TREND THAT WE WERE SEEING AND OBVIOUSLY OUR BUSINESS WAS WAS BENEFITING FROM STRONG GROWTH PRE PANDEMIC AND AS THOSE TRENDS GET H People try those things were were right in that in that slipstream to to continue to sustain that momentum you know if it were different and we were zero growth and realized growth because of a trend it would be a different dynamic and that's not that's not the situation we're in i couple that with because we were we think we were well positioned pre pandemic and and pre these trends being highlighted we believe we've got really good positioning pre pandemic and pre these trends being highlighted we believe we've got really good positioning pre pandemic and pre these trends being highlighted we believe we've got really good positioning pre pandemic and pre these trends being highlighted we believe we've got really good positioning pre pandemic and pre these trends being highlighted we believe we've got really good positioning pre pandemic and Representation from a wholesale perspective domestically and we think that between the amazon marketplace and etsy dot com, we've got good, good representation. That said, as we've said in the past, we constantly monitor the wholesale market. We look for everything from independent partners who help us identify a certain region or a certain customer group that we may not be accessing all the way up to larger national, but is, as you know, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a while, having followed us for a Were really thoughtful when we bring on a big partner. we were thoughtful when we added lowes to the to the suite of of wholesale partners we have. so we feel good where we are today but we also pay attention to the market. i think internationally is a different a different situation because that's a little more greenfield for us when it comes to wholesale exposure. and so far we've been following a similar playbook to the u.s. which is building strong, relevant, independent relationships and identifying regional players. In some cases, national players that we think will represent the brand and the business well that's helpful and then paul just quickly, shipping surcharges, anything, any impact to you guys, you see, for the fourth quarter or next year? yes, so from a dollar perspective, it's all we are seeing, you know, the surcharges that u p s has announced, all contemplated, it's all we are seeing, you know, the surcharges that u p s has announced, all contemplated, it's all we are seeing, you know, the surcharges that u p s has announced, all contemplated, it's all we are seeing, you know, the surcharges that u p s has announced, all contemplated, it's all we are seeing, you know, the surcharges that In the fourth quarter outlook and in robbie, what i would say is what we're really focused on is not to play down the dollar piece of it. it's really the capacity in making sure you know that we secure and we work with u p s. i think our guys probably talk to them if not every day, three times a week. we have secured our capacity for the fourth quarter and that's really our biggest focus and again, not to downplay the dollars, but it's really the capacity in making sure you know that we secure and we work with u p s. i think our guys probably talk to them if not every day, three times a week. we have secured our capacity for the fourth quarter and that's really our biggest focus and again, not to downplay the dollars, but it's really the capacity in making sure you know that we secure making sure we have the making sure they're coming to pick up the trailers is absolutely critical. and we have a very good relationship with them and in our ops team is very focused on that terrific. thanks so much. thanks, rob. your next question comes from a line of peter keith with typer sandler. please proceed with your question. ah, thanks, good morning, guys. i want to follow up with your question. A prior question, i think, from kimball, regarding the inventory out of stocks at wholesale. so it seems like kind of a good news, bad news situation. remarkably strong sell-through, but inventory constrained and now you're going into the holiday season. it seems like there could be some risk where your wholesale partners might bring in some alternative competitors to fill in some of those cooler out of stocks. what actions can you take in order to prevent that type of activity? Activities and do you see that as any risk in the coming months peter i would say a couple of things to that one we have great wholesale partnerships and and have very open dialogues as we've as we've gone through this and as we've seen challenges to the supply disruption one of the things that we've worked very closely with our wholesale partners is how do we fill in either with other yeti products or make sure that we're represented one of the things that we've worked very closely with our wholesale partners is how do we fill in either with other yeti products or make sure that we're represented one of the things that we've worked very closely with our wholesale partners is how do we fill in either with other yeti products or make sure that we're represented one of the things that we've worked very And as well as we can, as we rebuild that space. now one of the one of the conversations we have is you know, as we rebuild that inventory, we want to make sure that we have the right space to merchandise the products, the right way, and the way that we did pre pandemic, and the way that we would expect of all of our partners as at any point, but as we rebuild that inventory, and so i would say the conversations have been great. we're in full alignment with our partners. so we don't see any risk. From something changing because of this moment in time. we also don't see risk as far as is mentioned earlier on the call, demand leakage. you know, we want to continue to drive demand for our products. we continue to bring innovation to market. we've started previewing our spring products with our wholesale partners. and there's a lot of excitement about about what we continue to do with the brand and what we continue to do from an innovation perspective. okay, thanks, matt. i'll ask a next question to paul. JUST AROUND THE STRUCTURE OF THE GUIDANCE SO WITH THE FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN PERCENT GROWTH IT DOES IMPLY A NOTABLE ACCELERATION FROM Q3 AND WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT BUT IS THERE ANYTHING IDENTIFIABLE THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD CAUSE THAT SLOW DOWN AND THEN MAYBE ON A RELATED NOTE THAT THE E P S GROWTH GUIDANCE OF THIRTY ONE TO THIRTY EIGHT IS CERTAINLY ABOVE NORMAL FOR SORT OF YOUR NORMAL MIDTE What are the marginal characteristics that are driving that above average i p s growth? and so a couple of things on the top line, and as we think about this, if you step back to the end of second quarter, where we said the back half of the year would be fourteen to between ten and fifteen percent, and now the back half of the year is going to be you know on, if you look at what we've talked about for the fourth quarter, Twenty percent so if we look from where we were three months ago you know the business has certainly performed and it's really about a very strong q three so that the the deceleration i i think about it a little bit differently of the back half of the year from where i thought about it three months ago is actually stronger than what i was speaking three months ago you know as we think about the fourth quarter in particular you know a couple of Things. the first is you know we're up against our strongest comparison from last year to a plus twenty three in last year's fourth quarter you know we talked about the inventory constraints so those that's what kind of shaped our thinking on the current outlook. but again, as i think of the back half of the year, strongly outperforming what we thought the back half of the year was going to be just three months ago from an eps perspective or a margin. It's going to be, and i'm happy to say, much of the same. We're going to see expanding gross margins. Now we're rolling over as fourth quarter always is our biggest d t c quarter every year so it it you know the hurdle certainly gets gets higher. but if i think about gross margins, i'm going to expect some gross margins. i'm going to expect gross margin expansion from the channel mix shift costing improvements and then carrefour tailwind and then if i think about gross margins, i'm going to expect gross margin expansion from the channel mix shift costing improvements and then carrefour tailwind and then if i think about gross margins, i'm going to expect gross margin expansion from the channel mix shift costing improvements and then carrefour tailwind and then if i think about gross margins G s and a kind of come down the p n l it's going to be a similar story overall of de leveraging on the variable because of the mix shift so really driven by mix shift and then i expect the non variable to be roughly from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat ish year over year from a leveraged perspective to be roughly flat is Operating margin down to, you know, if you're talking about, get down to eps, obviously my lower interest both from a, it's to be the last one that i hit the balance of debt and then because i have a floating rate debt, as you well know, interest rates are just in my favor and as i delever, my pricing i go down on the grid of less expensive spreads. Okay, that's all very helpful. keep up the good work, guys, and good luck with the holiday. great, thanks. your final question comes from line of matt correnda with roth capital partners. please proceed with your question. hey, guys, thanks for sneaking me in here. i just wanted to touch on twenty twenty one, again, if i could and that's been covered a little bit, but wanted to see, did we get any new categories that add to growth? As we look out into the twenty twenty one, or is it still the existing drink wear and cooler categories and just punishment in the wholesale and then sustained strength in d t c just wanted to get your take on that first so we haven't we haven't we haven't communicated any forward category expansion we tend not to talk about a forward category expansion what we we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven't we haven Look for expansion opportunities within our existing products and in our existing product families and if you look at our history of pacing over the last few years we continue to kind of push the edge of of new product families and i would expect as we go to twenty twenty one that that's going to continue we want to keep invigorating our longest standing product families and introduce introduce new new families and continue to expand underneath the the Permission the yeti brand and the yeti consumers have given us to to bring more products to market got it it sounds like paul did you want anything because it sounds like you're jumping in there as well nope that's it okay great great good good very helpful and then just a lot of the other stuff has been answered but on the balance sheet what i was curious about is i mean as we sort of get into a very high quality situation where you've got essentially zero returns of leverage how do we think about cash deployment going forward? obviously, we're going to see plenty of investment in organic growth. we understand that, but when we think about sort of return of cash versus emn and the prioritization there, just curious to get your thoughts going forward yeah, it's really you know, we think about it in three in three buckets right now for for what we would spend our cash on first of all, is rebuilding our inventory to the level that we believe is the right level to support the growth. Across our omni channel so number one number one is inventory the second one is capx investments and the capx investments fall within a couple of different categories they fall within our the continued digitization of the business and our technology investments and they fall on the product side and the product side splits into two things its investment in capacity as we continue to ramp legacy products and its investment in new product development and then the third thing is and we communicated this in the past that As we contemplate strategic m and a, you know, one of the things that i always like to say is we like the yeti brand a lot. we think there's a lot of expansion opportunity underneath the yeti brand. but as we look at m and a, we look at it across really two two fronts. one r and d investment in technologies or materials that help accelerate our existing product roadmap or a strategic acquisition that helps accelerate entry into relevant categories in that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that Bring category expansion, it could bring customer-based expansion, it could bring geographic expansion. and so that's really it's really the way with the way we look at it internally. we also feel very fortunate to be sitting here with two hundred and twenty-five million dollars in cash and in a highly coming out of a highly uncertain summer. so you know we feel good about the opportunities in front of us to return the value to shareholders but first and foremost through growth. great, thanks for that, nat. let's jump into queue. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to mr. matt rancich for closing remarks. thanks everybody for joining us today. i just want to reiterate the incredible quarter we had at yeti. demand continues to be strong for the brand. we love the receptivity we're seeing to our continued innovation. you know, the brand was strong and the business was strong before the pandemic. Were thrilled to be sitting here at the end of the third quarter and looking out to the fourth quarter with a business that continues to perform and deliver. i wish everybody a safe and and happy end of the year and holiday season. look forward to speaking to you as we as we wrap up the fourth quarter operator this concludes today's conference. you may disconnect your lines at this time. thank you for your participation."

THE THIRD QUARTER LOOKING AHEAD WITH CONTINUED DOUBLE DIGIT YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH IN DISTRIBUTION REVENUE AND WHAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE ROBUST SPENDING LEVELS RELATED TO THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHICH WE DO NOT EXPECT TO BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS WE HAVE EXCELLENT VISIBILITY ON OVER 50% OF OUR ANNUAL REVENUE IN 202 AS SUCH WE EXPECT TO BE FREE CASH FLOW POSITIVE IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING OUR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO ALLOCATING THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR FREE CASHFLOW TOWARDS LEVERAGE ADOPTION AND CONFIDENT IN REACHING OUR TARGET LEVEL FOR THE REDUCED LEVEL OF UM HAVING THAT LEVERAGE TO FOUR TIMES BY YEAR END 202 NEXSTAR HAS ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON OUR LEVERAGE REDUCTION PLAN AND WE ENJOY A STRONG CASH POSITION WITH ADDITIONAL CAPACITY UNDER OUR REVOLVER IN ADDITION THE REDUCTION OF IN INTEREST RATE EXPENSE UH RELATED TO THE FAVORABLE LIBOR RATES OPERATING EXPENSE SAVINGS ON OUR CAPITAL

DIGITAL SALES PROGRAMS THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR DISTRIBUTION REVENUE STREAM AND WHAT ARE PROJECTED TO BE RECORD LEVELS OF POLITICAL SPENDING HERE IN 202 IN TERMS OF CAPITAL ALLOCATION WE BELIEVE

SPEAKER PHONE PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR MUTE FUNCTION IS TURNED OFF TO ALLOW YOUR SIGNAL TO <INAUDIBLE> AGAIN THAT IS STAR ONE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK ANY QUESTION AND WE'LL TAKE OUR FIRST QUESTION FROM JOHN KENNEDY WITH WOLF RESEARCH THANK YOU PERRY I HAVE TWO FOR YOU ONE IS YOU TALKED ABOUT LOCAL NEWS AND VIEWERSHIP WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN TERMS OF ADVERTISERS <INAUDIBLE> AND NEWS IN TERMS OF <INAUDIBLE> YOU SO- SPOKE TO AND THEN I GUESS THE SUB LEVELS IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT THERE'S BEEN NO NOTICEABLE IMPACTS FROM THE PANDEMIC OR IS THAT <INAUDIBLE> WELL AS AS IT RELATES TO LOCAL NEWS YOU KNOW THROUGH THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THIS YEAR 51% OF OUR TOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUE CAME FROM LOCAL NEWS AND THAT'S UP OVER THE PRIOR YEARS UM UH CUMULATIVE TOTALS WHICH INDICATES OBVIOUSLY ADVERTISERS YOU KNOW ARE PUTTING THEIR MONEY UH IN INTO THAT PRODUCT IN INCREASING UH WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY UM OBVIOUSLY THE UH THE DEMAND IS WHERE THE AUDIENCE IS AND THAT'S WHERE THE AUDIENCE IS FOR US RIGHT NOW UM AND SO UH WE DO SEE CONTINUED READ-THROUGH AND AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE AUDIENCE GAINS AT LEAST SOME OF THEM WILL BE STICKY WHEN YOU KNOW AND I HATE TO USE THIS TERM WHEN WHEN THE NEW NORMAL SETTLES IN AS TO WHATEVER THAT IS BUT SO FAR THROUGH THIS NORMAL UH PEOPLE IN ALL AGE GROUPS ARE UH TUNING TO OUR LOCAL NEWS BROADCAST IN IN INCREASING NUMBERS UM I WILL SAY THAT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY UH MVPDS HAVE REPORTED SUB COUNTS AND ATTRITION FOR THE QUARTER YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ARE FACTORED INTO UM INTO OUR PROJECTIONS AND ANALYSIS AND UH AND OUR OUR RETRANS REVENUE IS AGAIN WE WE FORECAST ATTRITION INTO OUR BUDGETING PROCESS AND AND WE ARE WE ARE AT BUDGET ON RETRANS REVENUE AND OUR PROJECTIONS THROUGH UH THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR SO WE HAVE SEEN NO SIGNIFICANT DECLINE BEYOND WHAT WE HAD FORECASTED SO UH WE THINK IT'S IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL FROM A DISTRIBUTION REVENUE STANDPOINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM THAT STEVEN CALL WITH WELLS FARGO THANKS I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT UH YOUR REVERSE COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS AS UM THE DECLINES ARE ACCELERATING I WAS WONDERING IF THAT'S CHANGING THE TONE OF THOSE AT ALL AND ALSO DOES IT MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT MOVING FROM LIKE A PER SUB BASIS UH SORRY TO A PER SUB BASIS FROM A FIXED PROGRAMMING FEE WHERE YOU CAN AND AND RELATEDLY WE HAVE MORE BROADCAST CONTENT GOING DIRECT TO CONSUMER LIKE CBS ALL ACCESS AND PEACOCK SO HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT MONETIZING THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT MAY NOT BE SUBSCRIBING THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL PROCESS SURE UM YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE NETWORKS ARE A MIX OF YOU KNOW FIXED FEE AND UM AND UH PERCENTAGES OF OF DISTRIBUTION REVENUE SO THERE ARE SOME THAT THAT ARE FUNGIBLE AND OTHERS THAT THAT ARE NOT AND THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE CONTINUING WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OF BOTH PARTIES TO GET A DEAL DONE SO THERE IS SOME SOME HEDGE THERE AT THIS POINT AND WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT READY TO CALL THE BALL AS TO WHAT THE THE MOST PREFERABLE UH PREFERABLE TERM IS UH THERE BASED ON OUR NEGOTIATING ABILITY UM AS IT RELATES TO UH CBS ALL ACCESS UH WE PARTICIPATE IN THAT WE'RE PAID TO BE A PART OF THAT SERVICE AND OUR LOCAL STREAM IS A PART OF THAT OFFERING UH PEACOCK WE ARE NOT UH AFFILIATE UH LOCAL NEWS UH AFFILIATE UH STREAMS ARE NOT YET A PART OF THAT BROADCAST UH UH OFFERING AND WE'RE NOT SURE IF AT ANY POINT THEY WILL BE UM BUT YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THIS THING CALLED OVER THE AIR WHICH YOU KNOW WE WE REACH UH YOU KNOW A A MUCH LARGER UNIVERSE POTENTIALLY THAN THE WIRED AND PAY CABLE UNIVERSE ALREADY WHERE YOU KNOW 16% OF OUR VIEWERS ALREADY USE THAT AS THEIR AS THEIR UM UH RECEPTION DEVICE WITHOUT THE AID OF A PAYWALL AND AND THAT'S AVAILABLE TO UH TO THOSE WHO WANT TO UH QUOTE THREE MONTHS THAT WAY IF YOU WILL AND UH THE THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THAT IS THERE ARE FAR FEW COMPETITORS FOR EYEBALLS IN A IN AN OVER THE AIR WORLD THAN THERE ARE IN A 500 PLUS CABLE OR SATELLITE UNIVERSE SO UM A- AGAIN WE UH WE WE ARE IN FLUX WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR AGREEMENTS NAILED DOWN THROUGH ' 21 AND ' 2 WE DO HAVE SOME THAT WILL BE UP UH END OF THIS YEAR AND EARLY NEXT YEAR AND AND THAT'S WHERE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL WILL CENTER AROUND WHAT'S THE BEST TYPE OF AGREEMENT UH FOR FOR BOTH COMPANIES TO ENTER INTO GREAT AND THEN JUST ONE ON POLITICAL FOUR YEARS AGO WE KIND OF GOT A HEAD TAKE AT THE LAST MINUTE FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN TERMS OF NOT SPENDING WHAT WAS EXPECTED UM I DON'T THINK ANY OF US EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN THIS TIME BUT WHEN DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY NEGATIVE SURPRISES ON THE POLITICAL SPENDING SIDE OH I'M PRETTY COMFORTABLE IN THAT RIGHT NOW I MEAN LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT BOTH CAMPS HAVE RAISED THAT THE ATTENDANCE PACKS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS HAVE RAISED SUPPORTING THOSE CANDIDATES AS WELL AS DOWN DOWN VALID CANDIDATES UM YOU KNOW THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES IN THIS BUSINESS BUT AS CLOSE TO A GUARANTEE AS I'LL MAKE YOU IS THERE'LL BE NO NEGATIVE SURPRISE ON POLITICAL ADVERTISING THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD GUARANTEE THANK YOU WELL AND I'LL TAKE OUR NEXT QUESTION FROM ZACH SILVER WITH <UNK> OKAY GREAT UH THANKS FOR HEARING THE QUESTION THE FIRST ONE IS JUST IF YOU CAN QUANTIFY THE SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT FOR CORE IN JULY VERSUS A TOTAL OF Q2 ' 20 OR EVEN THE PRO FORMA YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE SO FAR IN JULY AND THEN MORE BROADLY AND I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT RELATED TO STEVEN'S QUESTION YOU KNOW THE NARRATIVE OUT THERE HAS BEEN THAT THE MACRO ENVIRONMENT AND GROWTH IN STREAMING HAS IS GOING TO ACCELERATE THE SHIFT OF AD DOLLARS FROM LINEAR TV TO CONNECTED TV AND STREAMING UH CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW WELL POSITIONED YOU ARE TO ADDRESS THAT IF THAT NARRATIVE DOES TURN OUT TO PLAY OUT TOM I LET YOU ADDRESSED THE HOW HOW LINEAR YOU WANT TO GET ON ON GUIDANCE OBVIOUSLY WE SAW A SUBSTANTIAL UH SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN CORE AD TRENDS IN JULY VERSUS NOT ONLY JUNE BUT THE ENTIRE QUARTER UM TOM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANNA ADD ANY MORE DETAILS FOR THAT BUT UM I'LL LET YOU SPEAK TO THAT SURE WELL I THINK UH WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT JULY IS OBVIOUSLY JULY WAS SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER THAN THE SECOND QUARTER AS A WHOLE AND JULY WAS BETTER THAN THE LAST MONTH OF THE SECOND QUARTER SO SEQUENTIALLY THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER AND THAT TREND CONTINUES INTO EARLY Q3 GOT IT AS IT RELATES TO UM TRADITIONAL STREAMING SERVICES UM YOU KNOW THERE UH A- AT SOME POINT THERE BECOMES KI- KIND OF A SAMENESS TO THEM AND AND UH YOU KNOW UM IT'S IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CONTENT IF YOU HAVE THE CONTENT THAT PEOPLE WANT THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO CONSUME YOU WHETHER THAT'S OVER THE YEAR OR WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH A PAY SERVICE OR THROUGH A STREAMING SERVICE THAT WE'RE PAID TO BE ON AND WITHOUT OUR SERVICES YOU HAVE AN INFERIOR OFFERING TO THE VIEWING PUBLIC IT IS OBVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED THAT LOCAL NEWS IS A PRODUCT THAT PEOPLE WANT AND ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR AND SO I THINK WE'LL JUST STAND BY THAT UH YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A LOT LESS NOISY AT THE OPERATING LEVEL THAN IT IS PERHAPS AT THE INVESTOR LEVEL ABOUT THESE STREAMING SERVICES YOU KNOW IS IT A FRAGMENTING UNIVERSE BUT ARE THEY JUST TAKING FROM A FROM A WIRE YOU KNOW FROM A FROM A UH A TRADITIONAL PAY TV UNIVERSE INTO A VIRTUAL PAY-TV UNIVERSE AND IF SO AND WE'RE ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT TRANSACTION IT'S NOT UH YOU KNOW IT'S NOT NEARLY THE UH UH THE NOISE THAT UH THAT IT APPEARS TO BE IN THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY SO WE'RE SOMEWHAT SANGUINE ABOUT IT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT PEOPLE WANT WE'RE THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF IT IN THE COUNTRY IT'S CALLED LOCAL NEWS AND UM AND AND WE BELIEVE THAT PRODUCT WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME AS IT HAS FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS TEST OF TIME YEAH I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE AND WHEN WE'RE IF IF I COULD UH DOES THE THIS IS I GUESS FOR TOM DOES THE TARGET LEVERAGE RATIO FOR THIS YEAR CONTEMPLATE UH ANY BUYBACKS IN THE SECOND HALF AND CAN YOU REMIND US OF WHERE WE ARE IN RESUMING A REPURCHASE PROGRAM THANKS UM IT DOES I WON'T SAY HOW MUCH OF IT UM IS ALLOCATED TO STOCK REPURCHASES THE WAY WE THINK WE WE HAVE AN AUTHORIZATION LEFT UH FROM THE BOARD WE'RE CURRENTLY NOT BUYING STOCK UM BUT I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT TO GET REVISITED HERE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT IT IS REALLY STARTING ON LABOR DAY AND AND QUITE HONESTLY THAT'S PROBABLY UH NOT DOING SERVICE TO THE FACT THAT IT'S FAIRLY MENTIONED JULY POLITICAL REVENUE WAS VERY STRONG AND WE THINK AUGUST WILL BE AS WELL WE'RE RAPIDLY TRANSITIONING OUT OF THIS BEING A STORY UM DURING THE PANDEMIC JUST ABOUT UH POOR ADVERTISING REVENUE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE THE THE OTHER LEG TWO LEGS TO THE STOOL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE UM DISTRIBUTION REVENUE HAS BEEN STRONG CONTINUES TO BE STRONG AS PERRY MENTIONED WE'RE ON BUDGET FOR THE YEAR WE'RE ON BUDGET FOR THE SECOND WE WERE ON WE WERE ACTUALLY ABOVE BUDGET FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WE'RE ON BUDGET FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WITH REGARDS TO RETRANSMISSION REVENUES AND THEN THE THIRD LE- LEG OF THE STOOL IS POLITICAL AND THAT'S REALLY GOING THAT CANDLE IS GONNA GET LIT UM HERE RIGHT AROUND LABOR DAY AND RUN REALLY HARD FOR THE TWO MONTHS OF SEPTEMBER OCTOBER AND THE FIRST WEEK OF NOVEMBER SO THE FREE CASH FLOW OF THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO UH GO ALONG NICELY AND THEN GET TURBOCHARGED BY FREE CASH FLOW FROM POLITICAL BEGINNING AROUND LABOR DAY AS I'VE SAID TO OTHER PEOPLE I FULLY EXPECT OUR UM OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION ATTITUDE TO CHANGE FROM PLAYING DEFENSE TO PLAYING OFFENSE SOMETIME RIGHT AROUND LABOR DAY WE'RE NOT THERE YET BUT I CAN SEE THERE FROM HERE AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THEN I WOULD IMAGINE WE WOULDN'T SIT HERE WITH AN UNNATURAL $600 MILLION OF CASH ON OUR BALANCE SHEET MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> WE DEPLOY THAT BY ACTUALLY REPAYING DEBT AND LOOKING AT STOCK REPURCHASES BUT THAT'S A UH MULTI-VARIABLE EQUATION TELL ME WHAT THE STOCK IS AROUND THAT TIME AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT OUR APPETITE IS RIGHT IS THAT RESPONSIVE ZACH YEAH THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU BOTH I JUST WANT TO ADD TO TOM'S UH COMMENT ABOUT POLITICAL VIEW MOST FOLKS WOKE UP THIS MORNING UH READING ABOUT THE YOU KNOW BIDEN'S UH BUY THAT HE'S PLACING STARTING ON SEPTEMBER 1ST IN UH 15 STATES WELL WE WE OPERATE UH SUBSTANTIAL OPERATIONS IN 12 OF THOSE 15 STATES SO UH JUST TO POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW POLITICAL WILL REACH A CRESCENDO UH AROUND LABOR DAY THAT WILL CONTINUE ON THROUGH THE FIRST WEEK OF NOVEMBER AND UH AND AGAIN WITH JULY RESULTS BEING ABOVE ALL OF SECOND QUARTER FOR POLITICAL UH YOU KNOW THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD UH PRETTY GOOD MEASURE I THINK OF OF WHAT'S YET TO COME AND SO WE REMAIN COMPETENT IN OUR POLITICAL GUIDANCE AND AS THAT STORY CONTINUES TO PROVE THEN I THINK YOU'LL SEE UH TOM EXERCISE MORE OPTIONALITY AROUND OUR CASH FORWARD THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS ON THE BALANCE SHEET GOT IT THANKS PERRY WELL NOW WE HAVE A QUESTION AARON WATTS WITH DEUTSCHE BANK HI GUYS THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON UM A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON THE AD ENVIRONMENT I GU- I GUESS FIRST THERE'S BEEN SOME FITS AND STARTS IN TERMS OF COVID CASES UH IN POCKETS OF THE COUNTRY WHAT BEHAVIOR <INAUDIBLE> IN THE MARKET THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THAT UH AND I AND I GUESS ON A RELATED NOTE IN TERMS OF CATEGORIES JUST GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AUTO CATEGORY UM ANYTHING YOU CAN GIVE US IN TERMS OF HOW THAT REBOUND I- IS SHAPING UP AND WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING FROM AUTO IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS YEAH AUTO UH HAS REBOUNDED YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING BETTER UH BETTER PACING AND BETTER RESULTS IN Q3 THAN WE DID IN Q2 WHEN DEALERS WERE SHUT DOWN UH WE'RE CERTAIN OF THE OEMS MOVE UH MONEY AROUND FROM MARKET TO MARKET UH BASED ON WHERE THEY HAVE CARS AND THAT'S PRIMARILY AFFECTED SOME OF THE FOREIGN NAME PLATES BUT ON THE WHOLE UM I THINK THE UH OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR AUTO ARE THAT IT WILL BE LESS DOWN SEQUENTIALLY GOING FORWARD AS WILL MOST OF CORE ADVERTISING UM AS IT RELATED TO UM COVID I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU MEANT HOW IT AFFECTED THE COMPANY UH OR OR WHAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR MARKETS UM BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE COLOR ON BOTH UH WE HAVE HAD 145 UH CONFIRMED CASES IN THE COMPANY UM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC UM REMARKABLY OUT OF A WORKFORCE OF ABOUT 13,000 THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT OUR PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY UM WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE HOSPITALIZATION AND THAT PERSON HAS FULLY RECOVERED UM ABOUT 60% OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING FROM THE FACILITY TO WHICH THEY ARE ASSIGNED WE HAVE ANOTHER 20% THAT ARE REPORTING TO WORK BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN THE FACILITY REPORTERS MEETING THEIR CREWS IN THE FIELD TO GO TO THEIR FIRST ASSIGNMENT AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND WE HAVE ANOTHER 20% THAT ARE UH THAT ARE UH ARE WORKING REMOTELY AND UH YOU KNOW I USED THE EXAMPLE WITH OUR BOARD THAT YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IN TOPEKA IS REPORTING TO WORK UH HOWEVER NOBODY IS POPULATING OUR NEW YORK OFFICES BECAUSE OF THE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS AND AND THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE AND THERE'S CERTAINLY NO MANDATE TO DO THAT AND AND SO THAT'S KIND OF A PROXY FOR THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW WE KEEP TABS BY EVERY MARKET AS TO UH YOU KNOW VARIOUS STAGES OF REOPENING I WOULD SAY THAT ALL OF OUR MARKETS HAVE UH HAVE SOME DEGREE OF REOPENING SOME MORE THAN OTHERS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PAUSES IN CALIFORNIA IN TEXAS AND OTHERS ON ON FURTHER REOPENING UH AREAS HAVE BEEN ROLLED BACK YOU KNOW BARS AND AND RESTAURANTS UH ARE NOT NECESSARILY BIG ADVERTISING CATEGORIES WITH US TO BEGIN WITH HOSPITALITY CONTINUES TO BE UH UH UH A CATEGORY WHERE WE SEE NO SPEND UH TO SPEAK OF UM THERE IS SOME INTEREST STATE TOURISM ADS THAT ARE GOING ON LIKE IF YOU'RE IN TEXAS COME TO ARKANSAS AND VICE VERSA IN OKLAHOMA UH WE'VE WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THAT BUT HOSPITALITY FOR US IS A SUB 2% CATEGORY THAT YOU KNOW UH I- IS NOT MATERIALLY DRIVING OUR OUR TOP LINE SO AARON I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE KIND OF FLAVOR YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY MORE SPECIFIC FOLLOW-UP NO THAT'S COOL UM ONE LAST ONE FOR ME AND I I APPRECIATE THE TIME AGAIN UH YOU YOU SPOKE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL NEWS AND THE AD REVENUES THAT COME IN ATTEST TO THAT TO THE OVERALL REVENUE PIE UH IF IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THAT MAYBE NFL FOOTBALL IS DELAYED OR COLLEGE FOOTBALL DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE FALL HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE FLOW THROUGH OF THAT POTENTIAL AND WHAT IT COULD MEAN TO YOUR REVENUE PIE SURE I'M I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT UH IT IT'S INTERESTING AT THE LOCAL STATION LEVEL WHICH IS WHERE WE LIVE ALL SPORTS COMPRISES UH ABOUT 10% OF OUR ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AND OF THAT THE NFL COMPRISES ABOUT 60% OF THAT 10% SO IT LETS JUST IN REAL ROUND NUMBERS SAY THAT AD REVENUE SUPPORT IS HALF OF OUR REVENUE AND NFL IS 6% OF 10% OF THAT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE POINTS OF REVENUE UH SO FROM AN ADVERTISING PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED AVAILS THAT THE LOCAL STATIONS GET IN IN ALL OF LOCAL SPORTS UH OR ALL OF UH TELEVISED SPORTS THAT'S NOT LOCAL UM YOU KNOW IT IT'S IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A CONTRIBUTOR BUT OBVIOUSLY IT HAS AN OUTSIZED UH UH EFFECT ON VIEWERSHIP ON PROMOTIONAL ABILITY AND I WOULD SAY ON ON THE NATIONAL PSYCHE AND ON ON PEOPLE'S MORALE UH OBVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTORS ARE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN IN LIVE SPORTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW LIVE SPORTS AND LIVE NEWS DRIVE VIEWERSHIP BUT FROM A PURE FINANCIAL ADVERTISING POINT OF VIEW IT'S UH IT'S NOT ALL THAT MATERIAL TO OUR OUR TOP OR BOTTOM LINE OKAY PERFECT THAT'S UH EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR VERY WELL DONE THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL BE FROM BRIAN <INAUDIBLE> WITH DEUTSCHE BANK HI I HAD TWO QUESTIONS UM FIRST WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE US UM SOME COLOR ON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF SUBSCRIBER DECLINES IN YOUR MARKETS UM TWO IS HOW THEY COMPARE TO THE OVERALL INDUSTRY AND UH ANY COLOR ON ADVERTISING AND DISTRIBUTOR RECEPTION TO NEWSNATION AND UH ANY EXPECTATIONS FOR WHEN YOU MIGHT SEE YOU KNOW SOME INCREMENTAL REVENUE LIFT FROM NEWSNATION THANKS TOM I'LL LET UH <CROSSTALK> PERRY I <CROSSTALK> YEAH SUBSCRIBER AND THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT GM HOW'S THAT SURE UM I WOULD SAY OUR UM EXPERIENCE WITH SUBSCRIBERS IS NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF THE UM THE MVPDS OBVIOUSLY WE ARE STILL GETTING AN UPLIFT FROM THE VIRTUAL MVPD SO THAT THE THE TRADITIONAL MVPD SUBSCRIBER LOSS IS SOMEWHAT RECOUPED BUT CERTAINLY NOT ALL ARE RECOUPED BY UM BY THE THE VIRTUAL MVPDS AND AS PERRY HAD MENTIONED OBVIOUSLY WE FACTOR IN IN OUR BUDGETING PROCESS AND IN OUR GUIDANCE PROCESS YOU KNOW AN ATTRITION RATE FOR SUBSCRIBERS AND A UM A UNIT RATE FOR OUR UM FOR OUR REVENUE AND AS WE MENTIONED THAT WAS BASICALLY IN LINE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND EARLY RETURNS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER ARE CONSISTENT WITH THAT UH EXPECTATION SO NOT GETTING INTO SPECIFIC SUBSCRIBER DECLINE NUMBERS ET CETERA I WOULD SAY THAT UM WE WE SEE AND FEEL THE SAME THING THAT THE UM UH YOU KNOW THE THE DISTRIBUTORS DO UM IT'S JUST THAT OUR UM YOU KNOW OUR ECONOMICS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT UM BECAUSE WE'VE GOT UM YOU KNOW RATE THAT HELPS US OFFSET THAT UM BUT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS AS IT RELATES TO UH WGN AMERICA WE HAVE HAD AND YOU KNOW DANA ZIMMER AND HER TEAM HAVE BEEN OUT PRESENTING WGN AMERICA TO EVERY UH MVPD UH WITH WHICH WE ALREADY DO BUSINESS AND ALSO THOSE THAT DO NOT CARRY WGN UH WGN AMERICA AND THAT'S PRIMARILY IN LEGACY NEXSTAR MARKETS UH AND AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH RENEWALS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR FOR AN INCREMENTAL APPROXIMATELY 200 TO 250,000 SUBS THAT COULD ADD WGN AMERICA NOW THESE ARE SMALLER SYSTEMS UH AGAIN WHERE NEXSTAR HAS A RELATIONSHIP BUT THERE WAS NO TRIBUNE RELATIONSHIP THAT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED WGN AMERICA SO THERE WAS UPSIDE THERE UM AND AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE RECEPTION FROM DISTRIBUTORS HAS BEEN POSITIVE UH PARTICULARLY FROM THOSE WHO HAVE UH EXISTING CONTRACTS AND REALIZE THERE'S GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL VALUE ADD FOR NO ADDITIONAL COSTS DU- DURING THE TERM OF THE THE CURRENT AGREEMENT WE ARE UH DISTRIBUTED ON UH AT&T NOW UM AS THE UH THE ONLY VIRTUAL MVPD SYST- UH SERVICE THAT IS OFFERING WGN AMERICA WE ARE EFFORTING TO UH TO GET DISTRIBUTION UM UH AT THE LAUNCH OR OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER ON OTHER OTT SERVICES AND THAT WILL BE A VALUE ADD WHERE WGN AMERICA IS NOT CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTED BUT UH THE RECEPTION FOR BOTH THE ADVERTISING COMMUNITY AND THE DISTRIBUTION COMMUNITY HAS BEEN POSITIVE BECAUSE WE'RE INVESTING IN A PRODUCT THAT WILL ADD VALUE TO THEIR BUSINESSES AS WELL GREAT THANKS THANKS PERRY THANKS TOM WE'LL TAKE OUR NEXT QUESTION FROM DAN <UNK> WITH BENCHMARK THANKS GOOD MORNING SLIM PICKINGS LEFT HERE AFTER THE STRONG POINTS AND ALL THE QUESTIONS BUT UH I GUESS I'LL ASK YOU UM ONE FOLLOW-UP TO THE PRIOR PERRY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SORT OF YOU KNOW GOOD COLOR ON ON SUB CARRIAGE UH INCREMENTAL OPPORTUNITY IS THERE ANY WAY FOR US TO THINK ABOUT SORT OF TIMING AND HIGHER THINKING ABOUT THE NEWSNATION IMPACT ITSELF RELATIVE TO UH EITHER ADVERTISING OR OR UH I GUESS ANCILLARY WITH THAT UM YOUR COMMENT ON CARRIAGE WE KNOW IT'S GONNA BE SELF-FUNDING OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE PLANS TO KIND OF EXPAND IT SO JUST ANY HELP KIND OF FRAMING YOUR THOUGHTS UH ON SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THEN SEPARATELY UM YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF NOISE LATELY UH IN THE DIGITAL WORLD FACEBOOK TWITTER UH AD BOYCOTTS ALL OF THAT FUN STUFF UM YOU GUYS ARE THE LARGEST YOU GUYS HAVE A PRETTY BIG NETWORK EFFECT AND A PRETTY STRONG DIGITAL PORTFOLIO YOURSELVES IS THERE ANY ACCRUED BENEFITS YOU GUYS OR DO YOU THINK THAT STAYS MOSTLY IN THE DIGITAL BUCKET THANKS I'LL SPEAK FIRST TO UH WGN AMERICA THE UH WE WE HAVE UH I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE JOB THAT DAVE ROTEM AND HIS SALES TEAM HAVE DONE IN ASSEMBLING UH UH ADVERTISERS FOR UH FOR THE PREMIERE PREMIERE WEEK OF WGN UH AMERICA'S NEWSNATION BLUE CHIP NAMES AND UH AND AT COST PER POINTS THAT ARE UH IN EXCESS OF UH I'M SORRY I SHOULD SAY COST PER THOUSANDS UH THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF 50% GREATER THAN WHAT UH STANDARD PROGRAMMING WAS GENERATING AL- ALONE UM SO THAT'S UH A VERY POSITIVE INITIAL INDICATION WE'RE TRYING TO REWORK SOME OF THE EXISTING BUYS INTO UH THE NEWSNATION UH PRIMETIME UH OFFERING AND UH AND SO UM WHAT WE COULD REALLY USE IS YOU KNOW AN UPFRONT OR A FOURTH QUARTER SCATTER MARKET TO BREAK BUT ALL OF THAT SAID WE DO ANTICIPATE AN INCREMENTAL LET'S CALL IT LOW UM EIGHT FIGURE UH REVENUE CONTRIBUTION TO WGN'S AD REVENUE UH IN THE FOUR MONTHS OF THE OF THE END OF THIS YEAR UM AND AGAIN GIVEN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE OPERATION THAT WOULDN'T BE DEEMED TO BE MATERIAL BUT WE DO EVEN IN THESE CONDITIONS EXPECT YOU KNOW A LOW A LOW EIGHT FIGURE UPLIFT IN IN GROSS REVENUE THERE AND UH AND AND DISTRIBUTION THAT WILL MOSTLY COME AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO IT WILL IMPACT 2021 MORE THAN THIS YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INCREMENTAL DEALS DONE ALREADY THAT WILL LAUNCH WGN AMERICA UH YOU KNOW BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR BUT I WOULD SAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT IMPACT WOULD BE FELT UM IN UH IN UH IN 202 AND AGAIN YOU'RE TALKING A POTENTIAL UPLIFT OF YOU KNOW A QUARTER OF A MILLION SUBSCRIBERS ON UH YOU KNOW NIELSEN REPORTED I THINK 75 MILLION SUBSCRIBER BASE SO EVEN THAT IS INCREMENTAL BUT IT BUT IT'S ALL INCREMENTAL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS DRIVE THE INCREMENTAL GROWTH OUT OF THE ASSETS THAT WE OWN AND AND THEN THE THOUGHTS ON EITHER FACEBOOK TWITTER AS IT RELATES TO CORE POLITICAL UM IF THAT STAYS IN THE DIGITAL BUCKET OR IF YOU COULD PICK SOME OF THAT UP YEAH LI- LISTEN I I THINK THE MOST DIRECT UH TRANSFER COULD BE IN POLITICAL IF PEOPLE YOU KNOW IF CERTAIN PLATFORMS ARE REFUSING THOSE ADS THAT MONEY HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE AND YOU KNOW WITH- WITHOUT UH CONVENTIONS TO FUND AND WITHOUT RALLIES TO FUND THE THE <LAUGH> THE ONE WAY TO REACH PEOPLE IS THROUGH BROADCAST TELEVISION I THINK WE'RE SEEING AN EVIDENCE OF THAT RIGHT NOW SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY THE THE DIRECT TRANSFER YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE BOYCOTTS AND ALL OF THAT I I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN A A SUBSTANTIAL UH DECLINE IN UH IN IN DIGITAL REVENUE UH PERFORMANCE ON THOSE PLATFORMS UM SO UM AT THIS POINT THE DAMAGE IS MORE REPUTATIONAL THAN FINANCIAL AND WE'LL SEE YOU KNOW UM HOW DEEP THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO GET INVOLVED IN TAKING A LOOK AT POTENT- POTENTIALLY REGULATING THESE COMPANIES MORE SYMMETRICALLY WITH THE WAY WE'RE REGULATED BUT UH AT THIS POINT I I I THINK THE FINANCIAL UH TRANSFER UH OUTSIDE OF POLITICAL UH TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE IS IS MINIMAL GOT IT SUPER HELPFUL THANKS FOR THE COLOR IN THE NEXT QUARTER THANKS OUR NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM GREG HARBOR WITH HARBOR RESEARCH PARTNERS YES GOOD MORNING THANK YOU UM FEW QUESTIONS UM LAST QUARTER ON YOUR

SERVICES DESPITE THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND RECENT CIVIL UNREST WITH OUR PLANNING AND PREPARATION, STRONG BALANCED SHEET AND COMMITMENT TO OUR MARKETS AND EMPLOYEES I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT NEXTAR HAS KEPT OUR EMPLOYEE ROSTER INTACT AND OUR RECORD QUARTERLY RESULTS AGAIN REFLECT OUR TEAM'S COMMITMENT TO FLEXIBILITY THROUGHOUT THIS TIME AS ALWAYS OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER TOM CARTER IS ON THE CALL WITH Executions such as our new business strategies and our rapid adoption of cost containment programs at the onset of the pandemic resulted in record second quarter results with all of our cash flow metrics well above consensus expectations. The forty one percent rise in second quarter net revenue reflects growth in total television advertising revenue as we grew year over year increases in the same station new to television business and strong shares of political spending at our markets as well as the seventy one percent year over year increase in distribution. FEE REVENUES AS SUCH DESPITE THE ECONOMIC PRESSURES RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC NEXT OUR TOPLINE GROWTH IN OPERATING AND EXPENSE MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINES RESULTED IN A THIRTY EIGHT POINT SEVEN INCREASE IN NET INCOME AND RECORD SECOND QUARTER BROADCAST CASH FLOW ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW WITH THOSE NET METRICS GROWING TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT FORTY NINE PERCENT AND HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT RESPECTIVELY AS THE WORLD CONT Economic challenges brought on by the pandemic, the strength of our business model and enterprise-wide focus on managing operations for free cash flow enabled us to bring about twenty one percent of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line. In the year-to-date period, NextEra generated approximately six hundred thirty one million dollars of free cash flow before one-time transaction expenses. By way of comparison, we generated a total of five hundred twenty one million dollars of free cash flow in all of twenty nineteen. Momentum remains strong even before the upcoming benefit of political spending in the back half of the year. Reflecting repurchases made in Q1, we have reduced our share count to approximately forty five point five million shares outstanding. So twenty twenty year to date free cash flow per share amounts to about thirteen dollars and eighty eight cents per share. And we remain confident in our unique positioning in this environment to again generate significant free cash flow in the current quarter and again in Q4 of this year. Speaking of the full year 2020, it's important to remember that approximately sixty percent of our annual revenue is expected to be derived from contractual distribution fee and political advertising revenue, which is not expected to be materially impacted by the pandemic. Specifically, Nextar has solid visibility in terms of our contractual distribution economics through December of 2020 as we complete due multi-year renewals, mission consent agreements representing approximately seventy percent of our subscribers at year end. In nineteen nineteen, as well as new long-term network affiliation contracts with cbs, fox, and mbc at the same time, nextar has a strong balance sheet including approximately six hundred and sixty-five million in cash as of june thirty with an access to another hundred eighty or a hundred forty million dollars under our revolving credit facility. we continue to successfully navigate through the evolving challenges presented by the pandemic based on our core value of serving communities where we operate.

As the nation's largest producer of local news programming, Nexstar's proprietary content provides essential news and information to users and viewers that is unique and relevant to each of the local communities we serve across the United States. Forever, viewers rely on television news to stay informed about everything from the latest pandemic developments to the reopening of the economy to the upcoming election. With Nexstar's market-leading stations and sites, deep local and national reach, and local broadcast record of being the most influential and effective medium for both brands and politicians, we expect to see advertisers continuing to allocate increased spending to our broadcast and digital platforms as the threat resolves. Turning back to some second quarter highlights. Lay out total television advertising revenue increased eighteen point one percent to three hundred nineteen point eight million including political revenue of twenty one point six million and core advertising revenue of two hundred ninety eight point two million while local and national advertisers adapted their media plans during the second quarter we saw sequential month over month improvement in our same station core advertising revenue performance from april to may from may to june and this trend continuing in july notwithstanding marketplace placed core advertising revenue performance from april to may from may to june and this trend continuing in july notwithstanding marketplace placed core advertising revenue performance from april to may from may to june and this trend continuing in july notwithstanding marketplace placed core advertising revenue performance from april to may from may to june and this tr Challenges, next our local sales initiatives continue to generate healthy levels of new business with second quarter new to television ad revenue rising on both a quarterly sequential and year over year basis. In total, our sales teams generated twenty point seven million dollars of second quarter new to television ad revenue, marking an eleven point three percent rise over the first quarter and a four and a half percent rise over the comparable twenty nineteen period. As mentioned at the outset of our call, our new business strategies, ongoing sales training, and education continue to drive our success. Education and deployment of performance-focused initiatives combined with our sharing of best practices have proven very effective in our ability to capture ad spend share in both broadcast and digital locally. We recorded healthy levels of Q2 spending by political action committees and from candidates with twenty twenty second quarter political revenue of twenty one point four million exceeding our expectations from early in the quarter despite the cancellation of some primaries. Both presidential campaigns recently generated record levels of spending. HOLDS A FUNDRAISING WHICH BODES WELL FOR OUR UPCOMING POLITICAL REVENUE TRAJECTORY AS SUCH OUR FULL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY EXPECTATIONS FOR NET POLITICAL REVENUE IN THE LOW FOUR HUNDRED MILLION RANGE REMAINS UNCHANGED RECENT DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT RENEWALS AND THE INCLUSION OF W G I N AMERICA HAVE RESULTED IN A TWENTY ONE PERCENT I'M SORRY A SIXTY ONE PERCENT RISE IN SECOND QUARTER DISTRIBUTION REVENUE TO F Total digital revenue declined by approximately nine point six million dollars or seventeen percent reflecting our focus on higher margin profitable operations while digital profitability was up substantially over the comparable prior year period as our website and mobile app engagement also rose significantly. The combined second quarter digital and distribution fee revenue of five hundred eighty three point two million dollars rose approximately fifty seven point one percent over the prior year period. REVENUES UP FROM FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT IN THE YEAR AGO PERIOD. THE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IN SECOND QUARTER DISTRIBUTION REVENUE REFLECTS THE NEW AGREEMENTS REACHED IN THE SECOND HALF OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND A REALIZATION OF TRIBUNE MEDIA REVENUE SYNERGIES RELATED TO THE AFTER ACQUIRED CLAUSES IN OUR RE TRANSMISSION CONSENT CONTRACTS AND AS NOTED THE INCLUSION OF WGN IN AMERICA. OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR NET RETRANS GROWTH REMAIN UNCHANGE COMPLETED IN THE SECOND HALF OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND AS A RESULT OVER EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR BIG FOUR AFFILIATIONS ARE CONTRACTED THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR BIG FOUR AFFILIATIONS ARE CONTRACTED THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH OUR SUCCESSFUL TWENTY NINETEEN RENEWAL OF RETRANSMISSION CONSENT AGREEMENTS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY SEV STRONG POLITICAL GROWTH AND SPENDING THAT WE'RE SEEING.

WE HAVE PRETTY CLEAR VISIBILITY FOR A NET RETRANS REVENUE GROWTH EXPECTATIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND BEYOND AS WE DISCUSSED ON THE LAST CALL AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC WE TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADAPT Which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings in excess of forty million dollars from budgeted second quarter levels. Looking ahead to the third quarter, while the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising, we're seeing the same pattern of month over month improvement in our pace data and expect to benefit from significantly increased levels of political ad spending. And in fact, our july political billing exceeded that of all of q two overall. We're encouraged by continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint and by our continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint and by our continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint and by our continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint and by our continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint and by our continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint and by our continuing signs of recovery across our station ECONOMIC INDICATORS INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT DATA AND CONSUMER SPENDING AND AT PRESENT WE'RE CAUTIOUSLY CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE RETURN OF LIVE SPORTS AS LIVE NEWS AND SPORTS PROGRAMMING CONTINUES TO GENERATE THE STRONGEST LEVELS OF VIEWERSHIP ACROSS OUR ALL DIGITAL MEDIA. ADDITIONALLY, PREPARATIONS FOR THE SEPTEMBER ONE LAUNCH OF W G N AMERICA'S PRIME TIME NATIONAL NEWCAST NEWS NATION WHICH WILL REACH APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE M The news now and my first impressions of the product are very positive. News Nation will air daily from 8 am to 11 pm ET and will draw on the local, regional, and national expertise of Nexstar's 5400 journalists and 100 local newsrooms across the country. And during the quarter, we announce the anchor teams and correspondents for our live three-hour prime-time national newscasts, which are already attracting strong interest from leading national advertisers at much higher CPMs than normal for WGN America. Broadcasts will deliver news reporting that is fact-based, impactful, and unbiased, and we are confident that there are more Americans than ever before who are seeking just that. In addition to the live nightly newscast, News Nation's team of reporters and producers will deliver news 24 hours a day online through News Nation's soon-to-be-launched app, News Nation Now, which will create another opportunity for monetization and revenue diversification. As always, we remain committed to generating free cash flow actively. Managing our capital structure, our cost of capital, and our liquidity position to provide the financial flexibility to support our business and enhance shareholder returns as we emerge from the pandemic. During the first half of 2020, we allocated approximately five hundred ninety four million in cash from operations and investments toward debt reduction, opportunistic share repurchases, and cash dividends. Additionally, as I mentioned before, NextEra continues to maintain a strong balance sheet, including six hundred sixty five million in cash on hand at June thirty. We have access to an additional 140 million dollars under our revolving credit facility. On the return of capital front in late June, we declared our third quarterly cash dividend at a the new fifty six cents per share level, which was twenty four percent ahead of last year's pay out. With our hundred ninety one percent year to date free cash flow growth, our contractual distribution fee revenues, our food network distribution our historically low libor rates, which have reduced our interest expense and what is projected to be the biggest presidential elections. Cycle in the company's history. We remain confident in our positioning to be a free cash flow positive in every quarter of twenty twenty and we continue to expect NextEra's net leverage to decline to approximately four times by year end. In summary, while the pandemic has presented challenges for most every industry, NextEra's leading local platforms are well positioned to continue building the top line, maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet over time. Our disciplines in these areas have strengthened the resilience of our company. BUSINESS AND OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND CREATED AN UNRIVALED LOCAL MARKETING PLATFORM WHILE SUPPORTING INCREASING GROWING AND GROWING RETURNS FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS WITH THAT SAID LET ME TURN THE CALL OVER TO TOM CARTER FOR OUR FINANCIAL REVIEW AND UPDATE TOM THANKS PERRY AND GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY AS OUTLINED IN THIS MORNING'S PRESS RELEASE THE ACTUAL RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO REFLECT THE COMPANY Announced on September 19, 2021, the second quarter of 2022 revenue from W.G. and America also acquired in the Tribune transaction is included in core television advertising revenue and distribution fee revenue. Contribution from Nextstar's thirty one point three percent ownership stake in the television food network and other investments acquired in the Tribune transaction is included in the full income statement under income or loss on equity investments net and in the cash flow statement. Under Distributions from Equity Investments, the comparable three and six month period ended March 31, 2021, reflects Legacy Nextstar Operations during that period. All actual results also reflect the impact of one-time transaction expenses incurred in the quarters both in the quarters and the six month period ending June 30, 2021. With that, I'll provide a review of Nextstar's Q2 2021 Income Statement and Balance Sheet data. Update on our capital structure and some points of guidance on a combined company basis and pro forma for the divested station. Second quarter same station net total revenue was down six percent due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately thirty five percent reflecting a sharp decline in April due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month improvement from April to May to June same station net total revenue was down six percent due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately thirty five percent reflecting a sharp decline in April due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month improvement from April to May to June same station net total revenue was down six percent due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately thirty five percent reflecting a sharp decline in April due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month improvement from April to May to Distribution fee revenue was up twenty eight percent and continuing digital revenues were down eighteen point two percent reflecting local agency service revenue growth of approximately eight percent while station website revenue was down approximately thirty percent due to softer local customer buying trends related to the pandemic to offset the anticipated impact of COVID nineteen on commercial advertising revenue late in the first quarter next star.

When excluding non-cash comp and one-time transaction expenses, recurring corporate expenses were approximately seventeen million, which came in better than the guidance we had provided in the first quarter call of approximately twenty one point five million by the end of April, the vast majority of the initial operating synergies of the transaction have been realized. The second quarter operating cash taxes were approximately six million dollars substantially lower than our guidance of forty five to fifty million due to a timing difference. That forty to forty five million dollar variance will now be paid in two three ongoing capex and transaction capex totaled forty million dollars spectrum repack capex totaled thirteen million and received approximately twenty six million of reimbursements from the fcc during the quarter.

As a reminder, we received cash distributions from TV Food on a quarterly basis with the largest payment recorded during the first quarter of each year. For the third quarter of twenty twenty, we anticipate recording approximately twelve million dollars in TV Food network distributions. We expect cost savings in Q3 to approximate twenty five million dollars. The budgeted levels as variable costs and discretionary expenditures are prudently bought back online with the expected strengthening of the economy and the broadcasting advertising environment for the third quarter. We project recurring cash corporate overhead exclusive of stock comp and transactions costs to be approximately twenty three million dollars and we will easily meet our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance of approximately one hundred twenty million dollars for the quarter. For the entire year, non-cash expenses are projected to be approximately thirteen million dollars for the quarter and forty-eight million dollars for the full year. Transaction expenses will approximate three million dollars for the quarter and will decline for the remainder of the year. Third-quarter operating cash taxes are now estimated to be approximately one hundred and fifty million dollars, and operating cash taxes for the entire year will now come in at approximately two hundred and fifty million dollars.

Finally, we expect Nextar's cash interest expense to approximate seventy eight million for the third quarter and three hundred twenty five million for the full year, reflecting interest expense savings related to the decline in Libor rates. Turning to the balance sheet, Nextar's outstanding debt at June thirty was approximately eight billion dollars and consisted of five point four billion of term loans. AND TWO SERIES OF SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES ONE AT APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THE OTHER AT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WITH MATURITIES OF TWENTY TWO FOUR AND TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN RESPECTIVELY TOTAL NET DEBT APPROXIMATED SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION AT JUNE THIRD COMPARED TO SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION AT MARCH THIRTY FIRST AND EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION AT TWELVE THIRTY ONE NINETEEN NET DEBT FOR F Debt net cash limited to a two hundred million dollar amount. Our first-lien covenant ratio at June thirtieth was approximately three point one one one compared to three point five two at year-end which is well below our first-lien covenant of four to a quarter. As a reminder, our first-lien covenant limits cash netting to approximately two hundred million dollars. Our total net leverage at quarter-end was four point four seven compared to five point one eight at year-end. And as a reminder, NextEra's only covenant is our first-lien covenant. First lease debt covenant which is the aforementioned four and a quarter at the onset of the pandemic Nextar took immediate actions to adopt our business to the current environment and to preserve liquidity in order to best position the company for long term success as we return to normalized operations in this regard we continue to prioritize cash retention and have added approximately two hundred thirty one million to our first quarter cash position for a total cash balance of six hundred sixty five million at june thirtieth We have an additional 140 million dollars available under our evolving credit facility. At the same time, during the second quarter, we returned approximately 25 million dollars to shareholders through the quarterly cash dividend and made thirteen million dollars in payments on our debt. During the first half of 2020, we have actively managed our capital structure, cost of capital, and liquidity position to support our business in this challenging environment while enhancing shareholder returns. Year to date, we have allocated approximately 140 million dollars to our evolving credit facility. Approximately five hundred ninety four million towards shareholder value creating initiatives including four hundred and thirty seven million dollars in debt reduction, fifty one million dollars in dividend payments and seventy three million dollars in share repurchases in the near time while pluralistic data suggests ongoing sequential improvement in economic trends and the commercial advertising environment we continue to focus on cash preservation in order to optimize our financial flexibility as we move through the third quarter looking ahead with continued doubled up initiatives. A digit year over year growth in distribution revenue and what are expected to be robust spending levels related to the upcoming presidential election which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus we have excellent visibility on over fifty percent of our annual revenue in twenty twenty as such we expect to breathe free cash flow positive in the third and fourth quarters in addition to continuing our dividend payments we remain committed to allocating the vast majority of our free cash flow towards levered buybacks and confident in our ability to do so.

WE LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO CATCHING UP WITH YOU WITH ANOTHER POSITIVE REPORT JUST AFTER ELECTION DAY. AND ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE NEXT GENERATION, OUR BOARD AND OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED INTEREST, SUPPORT AND FOR JOINING US TODAY. SO NOW LET'S LET THE CALL TO Q AND A ADDRESS YOUR SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST. OPERATOR? YES, SIR THANK YOU. AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION, PLEASE I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a text version of the audio as it appears to be a mix of multiple languages and does not make clear sense in any of them. Levels of alignment with expectations, is the re-evaluation that there's been no noticeable impact from the pandemic, or is it too soon to call given the lay of the land? Well, as it relates to local news, you know, through the first six months of this year, fifty one percent of our total advertising revenue came from local news, and that's up over the prior year's cumulative totals, which indicates obviously advertisers are putting their money into that product and increasing it. With increasing frequency obviously the demand is where the audience is and that's where the audience is for us right now. And so we do see continued growth through and we're hopeful that the audience gains at least some of them will be sticky when you know and I hate to use this term when the new normal settles in as to whatever that is. But so far through this normal people in all age groups are tuning to our local news broadcasts in increasing numbers. I will say that, I mean, obviously NBPDs have reported sub counts and attrition for the quarter. You know, those are factored into our projections and analyses and our retrans revenue is, again, we forecast attrition into our budgeting process and we are at budget on retrans revenue and our projections through to the end of this year. So we have seen no significant decline beyond what we had forecasted. Male Speaker: WE THINK IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL FROM A DISTRIBUTION REVENUE STANDPOINT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM STEPHEN COHEN WITH WELLS FARGO. MY NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM STEPHEN COHEN WITH WELLS FARGO. MY NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM STEPHEN COHEN WITH WELLS FARGO. MY NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM STEPHEN COHEN WITH WELLS FARGO. MY NEXT QUESTION WILL COME FROM STEPHEN COHEN WITH WELL Sorry, to a per subscriber basis from a fixed programming fee where you can and and relatedly we have more broadcast content going direct to consumer like cbs all access and peacock so how do you think about monetizing those households that may not be subscribing through the traditional process sure i would say you know the the current relationships with the networks are a mix of you know fixed fee and and percentages of OF DISTRIBUTION REVENUE. SO THERE ARE SOME THAT THAT ARE FUNGIBLE AND OTHERS THAT THAT ARE NOT AND THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE CONTINUING WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OF BOTH PARTIES TO GET A DEAL DONE SO THERE IS SOME SOME HEDGE THERE AT THIS POINT AND WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT READY TO CALL THE BALL AS TO WHAT THE THE MOST PREFERABLE PREFERABLE TERM IS THERE BASED ON OUR NEGOTIATING ABILITY AS IT RELATES TO C B S ALL ACCESS WE PARTIC AND OUR LOCAL STREAM IS A PART OF THAT OFFERING PEACOCK WE ARE NOT AFFILIATED LOCAL NEWS AFFILIATED STREAMS ARE NOT YET A PART OF THAT BROADCAST OFFERING AND WE'RE NOT SURE IF AT ANY POINT THEY WILL BE BUT YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THIS THING CALLED OVER THE AIR WHICH YOU KNOW WE WE REACH YOU KNOW A MUCH LARGER UNIVERSE POTENTIALLY THAN THE WIRED AND PAY CABLE UNIVERSE ALREADY WHERE KNOW SIXTEEN PERCENT OF OUR VIE AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, AS THERE, The speaker talks about the end of the year and the beginning of the next year. He mentions that conversations will center around what's the best type of agreement for both companies. He also talks about the Trump campaign and its impact on political spending. The speaker concludes by saying that he doesn't think there will be any negative surprises on the political spending side. I'm pretty comfortable in that right now. I mean, look at the amount of money that both camps have raised, that the attendance tax and special interest groups have raised, supporting those candidates as well as down-ballot candidates. You know, there are no guarantees in this business, but as close as a guarantee as I'll make you is there'll be no negative surprise on political advertising. That's a pretty good guarantee. Thank you. Okay, great, thanks for the question. The first one is just if you can quantify the sequential improvement for core in July versus total two point twenty or even the performer year over year change so far in July. And then, more broadly, I think it's a little bit related to Stephen's question. You know, the narrative out there has been that at the macro environment and growth in streaming is going to accelerate the shift of ad dollars from linear TV to connected TV and streaming. Can you talk about how well positioned you are? I'll address that if that narrative does turn out to play out. Tom, I'll let you address how linear you want to get on on guidance. Obviously, we saw substantial sequential improvement in core ad trends in July versus not only June but the entire quarter. Tom, I don't know if you want to add any details to that, but I'll let you speak to that. Sure. Well, I think what I'll say about July is obviously July was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a record was a Substantially better than the second quarter as a whole and july was better than the last month of the second quarter so sequentially things have gotten better and that trend continues into early q three but as it relates to additional streaming services you know they're at some point there becomes not kind of a sameness to them and and you know it's all about the content if you have the Content that people want, they will find a way to consume you, whether that's over the air or whether that's through a pay service or through a streaming service that we're paid to be on. And without our services, you have an inferior offering to the viewing public. It is obviously demonstrated that local news is a product that people want and are willing to pay for. And so, I think we'll just stand by that. You know, it's a lot less noisy at the operating level than it is perhaps at the investor level. About these streaming services you know, is it a fragmenting universe? But are they just taking from a from a wire, you know, from a from a traditional pay TV universe into a virtual pay TV universe? And if so, and we're on both sides of that transaction, it's not you know, it's not nearly the noise that that appears to be in the investment community. So we're somewhat sanguine about it. You know, we have a product that people want. We're the largest producer of it in the country. It's called Local. MAN 1: And we believe that product will stand the test of time as it has for the last forty years of time.\n\nWOMAN: Yeah, I think that makes sense. And one more if I could, does the, uh, I guess for Tom, does the target leverage ratio for this year, uh, contemplate, uh, any buybacks in the second half? And can you remind us of where we are in resuming our repurchase program? Thanks.\n\nMAN 2: It does, I won't say how much of it, is, uh, is, uh, is, uh, is, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, u The speaker is discussing stock repurchases and the authorization left on the board. They mention that they are not currently buying stock, but anticipate revisiting it in the future. The speaker also mentions that July's political revenue was strong and that August is likely to be even stronger. This will be as well. We're rapidly transitioning out of this being a story during the pandemic just about poor advertising revenue and what's happening there. The other leg, two legs to the stool from our perspective, distribution of revenue has been strong, continues to be strong. As Perry mentioned, we're on budget for the year. We're on budget for the second. We were actually above budget for the second quarter. We're on budget for the third quarter. With regard to retransmission revenues and then the third leg of the stool is political and that's really going that candle is going to get lit here right around labor day and run really hard for the two months of september october in the first week of november so the free cash flow of the company will continue to go along nicely and then get turbocharged by free cash flow from political beginning around labor day As I've said to other people, I fully expect our capital allocation attitude to change from playing defense to playing offense sometime right around Labor Day. We're not there yet, but I can see there from here and when that happens, I would imagine we wouldn't sit here with an unnatural six hundred million dollars of cash on our balance sheet. We'd deploy that by actually repaying debt and we'd deploy that by actually repaying debt and we'd deploy that by actually repaying debt and we'd deploy that by actually repaying debt and we'd deploy that by actually repaying debt and we'd deploy that by actually repaying debt and we'd deploy that by actually repaying debt and we'd deploy that by actually repaying debt and we'd deploy Looking at stock repurchases but that's a multi-variable equation. Tell me what the stock is around that time and I'll tell you what our appetite is. Is that responsive? Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you both. I just want to add to tom's comment about political of you. Most folks woke up this morning reading about the you know, biden's buy that he's placing starting on september first in fifteen states. WE OPERATE SUBSTANTIAL OPERATIONS IN TWELVE OF THOSE FIFTEEN STATES. SO JUST TO POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW POLITICAL WILL REACH A CRESCENDO AROUND LABOR DAY THAT WILL CONTINUE ON THROUGH THE FIRST WEEK OF NOVEMBER AND AGAIN WITH JULY RESULTS BEING ABOVE ALL OF SECOND QUARTER FOR POLITICAL YOU KNOW THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD PRETTY GOOD MEASURE I THINK OF WHAT'S YET TO COME AND SO WE REMAIN COMPETENT IN OUR POLITICAL G The audio is a mix of male and female voices speaking in different languages. It is difficult to understand the exact content of what they are saying. BEHAVIOR PATTERNS IN YOUR MARKETS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THAT AH AND I GUESS ON A RELATED NOTE IN TERMS OF CATEGORIES, JUST GIVE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AUTO CATEGORY UM ANYTHING YOU CAN GIVE US IN TERMS OF HOW THAT REBOUND IS SHAPING UP AND WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING FROM AUTO IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS YEAH AUTO HAS REBOUNDED YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING BETTER BETTER PACING AND BETTER RESULTS IN Q3 THAN WE DID IN Q2 When dealers were shut down, we're seeing certain of the OEMs move money around from market to market based on where they have cars, and that's primarily affected some of the foreign nameplates. But on the whole, I think the our expectations for auto are that it will be less down, sequentially going forward, as will most of core advertising. OR WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR MARKETS BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE COLOR ON BOTH. WE HAVE HAD A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE CONFIRMED CASES IN THE COMPANY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. UM, REMARKABLY OUT OF A WORKFORCE OF ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE HOSPITALIZATION AND THAT PERSON IS FULLY RECOVERED ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR We are working from the facility to which they are assigned. We have another twenty percent that are reporting to work but not necessarily in the facility. Reporters meeting their crews in the field to go to their first assignment and things of that sort. And we have another twenty percent that are working remotely. And you know, I used the example with our board that, you know, everybody in topeka is reporting to work, however, nobody is populating our new york offices because of the, the public health concerns. Reproduction requirements and they don't feel safe, and there's certainly no mandate to do that. And so that's kind of a proxy for the country, you know, we keep tabs by every market as to you know various stages of reopening. I would say that all of our markets have a some degree of reopening, some more than others. There have been some pauses in California and Texas and others on further reopening areas have been rolled back, bars and restaurants are not necessarily big. ADVERTISING CATEGORIES WITH US TO BEGIN WITH HOSPITALITY CONTINUES TO BE A CATEGORY WHERE WE SEE NO SPEND TO SPEAK OF THERE IS SOME INTERSTATE TOURISM ADS THAT ARE GOING ON LIKE IF YOU'RE IN TEXAS COME TO ARKANSAS AND VICE VERSA OHIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FLAVOR YOU WERE LOOKING FOR BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY MORE SPECIFIC FOLLOW UP AUDIO:\n\nMAN: What could mean to your revenue pie? SURE, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT. IT'S INTERESTING AT THE LOCAL STATION LEVEL WHICH IS WHERE WE LIVE ALL SPORTS COMPRISES ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF OUR ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AND OF THAT THE N F L COMPRISES ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF THAT TEN PERCENT. SO LET'S JUST IN REAL ROUND NUMBERS SAY THAT AD REVENUE SUPPORT IS HALF OF OUR REVENUE AND N F L IS SIX PERCENT OF THAT. We're talking about three points of revenue. So from an advertising perspective, because of the limited availability of the local stations get in, in all of local sports or all of televised sports that's not local, you know, it's not that big of a contributor, but obviously it has an outsized effect on viewership, on promotional ability, and I would say on the national psyche and on people's morale. Obviously, distributors are very, very important. The audio features a male voice speaking about live sports and how they drive viewer engagement. He explains that from a financial advertising point of view, live sports and live news drive viewer engagement. However, he also acknowledges that there is more to viewer engagement than just financial advertising. He then introduces the next question which will be from Brian Craft with Deutsche Bank. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of subscriber declines in your markets? Curious how they compare to the overall industry and any color on advertising and distributor reception to News Nation and any expectations for when you might see some incremental revenue lift from News Nation? Thanks. Sure, I would say that our experience with subscribers is not materially different than that of the VMPDs. Obviously, we are still getting an uplift from the virtual VMPDs, so that the traditional VMPD subscriber loss is somewhat recouped, but certainly not all recouped by the virtual VMPDs. And as Parry mentioned, obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we've been mentioned obviously we Factor in our budgeting process and our guidance process. You know, an attrition rate for subscribers and a unit rate for our revenue. And as we mentioned, that was basically in line for the second quarter and early returns for the third quarter are consistent with that expectation. So not getting into specific subscriber decline numbers, et cetera. I would. It's important to say that we see and feel the same thing that the distributors do. It's just that our economics are a little bit different because we've got a rate that helps us offset that, but it's consistent with our expectations. As relates to w g in america, we have had and dana and zimmer and our team have been out presenting. W G N America to every M B P D with which we already do business and also those that do not carry W G N W G N America and that's primarily in Legacy Nextar Markets and and we have an opportunity with renewals between now and the end of the year for an incremental approximately two hundred to two hundred and fifty thousand subs that could add W G N America and these are smaller systems again where Nextar has a relationship but that there are smaller systems again where Nextar has a relationship but that there are smaller systems again where Nextar has a relationship but that there are smaller systems again where Nextar has a relationship but that there are smaller systems again where Nextar has a relationship but that there are smaller systems again where Nextar has a relationship but that there are smaller systems again where Nextar has a relationship but that there are smaller systems again where Nextar has a relationship but There is no trivia relationship that would have included WG in America. So there is an upside there. And I would say that the reception from distributors has been positive, particularly from those who have existing contracts and realize there's going to be additional value add for no additional cost during the term of the current agreement. We are distributed on A&T now as the only virtual NBDP system service that is offering WG in America. We are endeavoring to to get distribution at the launch or shortly thereafter on other ot t services. and that will be a value add where wg and america is not currently distributed. but the reception from both the advertising community and the distribution community has been positive because we're investing in a product that will add value to their businesses as well. WE'LL TAKE OUR NEXT QUESTION FROM DAN CORRIGAN WITH BENCHMARK THANKS GUYS GOOD MORNING SLIM PICKENS LEFT HERE AFTER THE STRONG PRINT AND ALL THE QUESTIONS BUT I GUESS I'LL ASK YOU UM ONE FOLLOW UP TO THE PRIOR PERRY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SORT OF YOU KNOW GOOD COLOUR ON ON SUB CARRIAGE INCREMENTAL OPPORTUNITY IS THERE ANY WAY FOR US TO THINK ABOUT SORT OF TIME AND HIGHER THINKING ABOUT THE NEWS NATION IMPACT ITSEL Do you either advertise or I guess ancillary to that your comment on care is we know it's going to be self-funding, obviously you have plans to kind of expand it. So just any help kind of framing your thoughts on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity and then separately obviously there's been a lot of noise lately in the digital world, Facebook, Twitter, ad boycotts, all that fun stuff. You guys are the largest, you guys have a pretty big network, a lot of fun stuff. You guys are the largest, you guys have a pretty big network, a lot of fun stuff. You guys are the largest, you guys have a pretty big network, a lot of fun stuff. You guys are the largest, you guys have a pretty big network, a lot of fun stuff. You guys are the largest, you guys have a pretty big In a pretty strong digital portfolio or sells is there any accrued benefits to you guys or do you think that stays mostly in the digital bucket? Thanks. I'll speak first to wgn america the we have i'm very impressed with the job that they wrote in and the sales team have done in assembling advertisers for the premier premier week of wgn america's news nation blue chip names and and at cost per point. That are in excess of I'm sorry, I should say cost thousands that are in excess of fifty percent greater than what standard programming was generating alone. So that's a very positive initial indication. We're trying to rework some of the existing buys into the news nation prime time offering and and so what we could really use is an upfront or a fourth quarter scatter market. BUT ALL OF THAT SAID WE DO ANTICIPATE AN INCREMENTAL LET'S CALL IT LOW EIGHT FIGURE REVENUE CONTRIBUTION TO W G N'S AD REVENUE IN THE FOUR MONTHS OF THE OF THE END OF THIS YEAR AND AGAIN GIVEN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE OPERATION THAT WOULDN'T BE DEEMED TO BE MATERIAL BUT WE DO EVEN IN THESE CONDITIONS EXPECT A LOW A LOW EIGHT FIGURE UPLIFT IN GROSS REVENUE THERE AND AND DISTRIBUTION THAT WILL MOSTLY COME AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO WILL IMPACT TWENTY TWENTY ONE MORE THAN THIS YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INCREMENTAL DEALS DONE ALREADY THAT WILL LAUNCH W G N AMERICA YOU KNOW BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR BUT I WOULD SAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT IMPACT WOULD BE FELT IN IN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND AGAIN YOU'RE TALKING A POTENTIAL UPLIFT OF YOU KNOW A QUARTER OF A MILLION SUBSCRIBERS ON A Even that is incremental, but it's all incremental, and that's what we're gonna do is drive incremental growth out of the assets that we own. And then the thoughts on either Facebook, Twitter, as it relates to core or political, if that saves in a digital bucket or if you can pick some of that up? Yeah, listen, I think the most direct transfer could be in political, if people, you know, if certain platforms are refusing those ads, that money has to go somewhere, and it's gonna be without convention. MENTIONS TO FUND AND WITHOUT RAILS TO FUND THE THE THE THE ONE WAY TO REACH PEOPLE IS THROUGH BROADCAST TELEVISION I THINK WE'RE SEEING EVIDENCE OF THAT RIGHT NOW SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY THE DIRECT TRANSFER YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE BOYCOTTS AND ALL OF THAT I DON'T THINK YOU'VE SEEN A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN IN IN DIGITAL REVENUE PERFORMANCE ON THOSE PLATFORMS SO AT THIS POINT THE DAMAGE IS MORE REPUTATIONAL THAN FINANCIAL AND WE THE GOVERNMENT THAT WANTS TO GET INVOLVED IN TAKING A LOOK AND POTENTIALLY REGULATING THESE COMPANIES MORE SYMMETRICALLY WITH THE WAY WE'RE REGULATED BUT AT THIS POINT I THINK THE FINANCIAL TRANSFER OUTSIDE OF POLITICAL TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE IS IS MINIMUM GOT IT SUPER HELPFUL THANKS FOR THE COLOR IN THE NEXT QUESTION Yes, good morning. Thank you. I have a few questions. Um, last quarter on your conference call, I believe you said your retrans subs were down four or five percent year over year. As you guys may know, Sinclair on their call right before ours said their second quarter subs were down about seven percent, including the benefit of the virtual side. Should I assume that you guys were down roughly about seven percent for the second quarter for your subs? Is that reasonable? A MAN SPEAKING OVER THE PHONE It's not down seven, but it's closer to the previous quarter's results. Okay, I appreciate that. Um, can you help us, your TV advertising pay scenes for the month of August? Would you say that those are tracking better than the rate of decline for your core advertising? And that is tracking better than what you're or what July turned out to be? It's a little. We have very, you know, few days in August here. I'm, I'm thinking, you know, it's a little too early to be making any comments with regard to that. Okay. Can you help us then, maybe? I'm just trying to understand then what you're sort of budgeting or thinking the rate of decline, fee of core advertising could be down in the third quarter. Maybe. I think it's that's why we're not giving guidance. MAN 1: DID YOU KNOW THAT JULY WAS DOWN LESS THAN JUNE LAST YEAR?\nMAN 2: I THINK YOU TOLD US IT WAS DOWN LESS. AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT JULY WAS DOWN LESS THAN JUNE AND JUNE WAS OBVIOUSLY IF IT'S JUST MATH IF THE ENTIRE QUARTER WAS DOWN THIRTY FIVE PERCENT AND EVERY MONTH WITHIN THE SECOND QUARTER GOT BETTER THEN CLEARLY JUNE WAS DOWN LESS THAN THIRTY FIVE PER And July was down less than June. That's kind of the extent of the forward-looking guidance that we're going to give as it relates to specific advertising revenue. Okay, um, maybe, uh, let me ask another question then. In this, on this virus situation that's going out there. In the states where the virus cases have gotten dramatically worse over the last several weeks. Have you guys MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE CORE TV ADVERTISING IN THOSE MARKETS. HAS THERE BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT? It is reported to be 30 percent, which could be a hundred cases in a state. I mean, you've got to put all of these numbers into context. But I would say no, the evidence is in, you know, in our results in July and our pacing in August and our pacing in September, all substantially better than where we exited second quarter, and then we performed in second quarter. So, you know, the proof is in the numbers. As Tom says, it's just math. But, you know, we have not seen any, and I think I just said this, you know, hospitality continues to be down. Auto's orders are down. IMPROVING WE DON'T GET A LOT OF MONEY FROM RESTAURANTS UNLESS IT'S Q S R AND THEY'RE MAKING MINTS THROUGH THEIR DRIVE THRU SO YOU KNOW THINGS ARE WE'RE SEEING STEADILY STEADY IMPROVEMENTS AND EVEN WERE PAUSING AN OPENING IS BETTER THAN NOT BEING OPENED AT ALL AND THATS KINDA OUR WORST CASE SCENARIO IN SOME OF OUR MARKETS AND IN OTHERS WE DON'T HAVE THAT YOU KNOW THIS MORNING WE'RE DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH A MAN SPEAKING TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE ABOUT FLOODING AND ITS IMPACT ON BUSINESSES A LITTLE BIT MORE TO HOW WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT YOUR COST TRENDS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER. I KNOW YOU GAVE A FIGURE THERE VERSUS YOUR BUDGET FOR THE THIRD QUARTER. YOU HAVE A SIMILAR ONE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER. BUT JUST WHAT SORT OF COSTS DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD HELP A LITTLE BIT MORE THINK ABOUT THAT MAY NOT REPEAT MAY NOT REPEAT COST SAVINGS IN A THIRD QUARTER YOU BENEFIT FROM IN THE SECOND. THANK Y WHICH WE BELIEVE YOU KNOW WE OVERPERFORMED ON THAT SAME NUMBER FOR THE THIRD QUARTER IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION AS WE OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THOSE ARE VARIABLE COSTS AS ADVERTISING STARTS TO RETURN THOSE COSTS GO UP SOME OF THEM ARE DISCRETIONARY THAT WE WILL ADD BACK IN WE WILL TRAVEL MORE IN THE THIRD QUARTER THAN WE DID IN THE SECOND QUARTER WE BASICALLY COULDN'T HAVE TRAVELED ANY LESS IN THE SECOND QUARTER THAN W There will be more than offset by higher advertising revenues in the second quarter. But specifically, as it relates to, you know, if you're looking year over year, the majority of the synergies taken out of the Tribune transaction have occurred. So that won't change materially, sequentially. Two, three, over two. And you'll have some added expense coming back in. But that's the extent of some of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the In the polls on expenses. You answered it well, thank you. I appreciate that, guys. Well, now let's take our next question from John Corrigan with JK Media. I hope you can hear me having the internet problems like a lot of people in the neighborhood. Two quickies. Tom, I think the twenty four bonds were callable two days ago and I heard nothing. That means they're not likely to be called. WELL AGAIN JOHN I THINK THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH OUR MESSAGE THAT YOU KNOW IN THE NEXT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS I THINK WE WILL HAVE A BETTER UM AH BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM BETTER UM B OBVIOUSLY IN THE LAST HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS AND PROBABLY IN THE NEXT THIRTY DAYS WE'RE STILL GONNA CONTINUE TO TAKE A PRETTY CONSERVATIVE VIEW ON THAT BUT HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO FLIP THE SWITCH AND BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THE NEAR TERM SECOND LADY DID I HEAR CORRECTLY THAT YOU'RE ON TRACK FOR A MID TERM RETRAIN NET RETRAIN GROWTH THIS YEAR AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THE GROWTH The gross retrans is up high twenties pro forma. Did i have that correctly? Gross high twenties net midteens. So far this year are our retrans revenue growth has exceeded twenty percent. That is correct. We have budgeted for four midteens. Yes, well, twenty eight in the second quarter. I forget what exactly the first quarter was. We've budgeted for mid-teens growth in net retrans for the entire year but so far we have exceeded that. So, net retrans margins are down, you know, more than a little bit this year. Is that correct? No, I would say that they're actually up a little bit because we're, we've included a fair amount of Tribune subscribers that are non-big four affiliates where our net retrans margins are down.

If you would like to cancel this request, please press star zero again Sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking. Can you please rephrase your question? Few retrans negotiations done in the first half of the year. We had one top ten that we were pleased with the results on. I would say, you know, in my comments earlier, I did report that our viewership, and I highlighted the eighteen to thirty four demographic, you know, obviously was up in April, one hundred fifty one percent, eighty three percent in May, and eighty nine percent in June over the prior year. Our digital page views which were in excess of two point three billion for the quarter were one point one billion in April that was up one hundred thirty three percent and then in the month of June just by comparison our local websites were up sixty percent compared to the prior year. So you know there is there is some covid fatigue I think but I also think there is increased interest in local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news The diminution of newspaper and radio local coverage and content, so you know, we do think that there is stickiness to this, you know, the long tail will determine how much, but people continue to turn to our news cast in record numbers and it's amazing, you know, a t l a in los angeles and w g n in chicago, independent stations, by and large, but producing copious amounts of local news are ranking number one in all. Parts beating all the network o n o s in virtually every news cast and that just speaks to the power of localism that you're not dependent on network lead in or lead out to generate your audience. you're doing it on your own and we're particularly gratified by by that kind of execution producing those kinds of results. okay and one last thing the i was wondering about the promotion efforts to create visibility for news nation as a whole The text version of the audio is as follows:\n\nIt seems like CNN tended to fill a similar role to that which you're targeting, where they tended to be unbiased. Maybe it's a little less so these days. And it in that era, it would tend to be the place to go when something as an event occurred, but it some of the other news more important. Influenced news casts politically would sort of gather the their base in more normal times. And I'm wondering if there's a way for you to position yourself to you know sort of gather at least that role and maybe you know maybe have something more sustainable and if this proves successful do you think you've broadened it beyond the three hour original time frame? I'm here to unpack. I'll try my best with it here. Obviously, you know, that is how CNN started. I don't think anyone listening to this call thinks CNN is in that same place today from an unbiased political lean. We, as I've said before, we have a staff of rhetoricians and two full-time staff that do nothing but check scripts and reporting for unconscious bias and bias in our writing. And we've had very spirited discussions about that, even in the rehearsals. You know, we do think we will be that place to go for news that doesn't make a, you know, twenty two minute news hole in a network evening news broadcast or much news on the, the opinion based, you know, talk networks. For example, last night in our rehearsals, we did a story on the first woman police chief in Colorado Springs and that's not a story you'd see every place else. But again, we've got our, we've got our country divided up into six zones and we have zone producers and they're there. Their job is to know exactly what's going on in those zones, in all of those newsrooms, and what might be of interest to a national audience. In addition to the hundred and fifty people we've hired in Chicago, correspondents that are also based in Miami, New York, New York, Dallas, Los Angeles, and D.C. that report exclusively for the network, as well as all the behind the scenes production folks that that we think we can give a more representative view of America than perhaps what's seen. Inside the New York D.C. beltway, so we think there's a purpose for that, and there's a reason for that, and the acceptance of that concept now has been very enthusiastic. It's now just on us to deliver. As it relates to promotion, we have secured something that none of the other networks, news networks, I think, are able to compete with, and that is to harness the power of a hundred and ninety six television stations across the country. We're asking our nation to promote this news cast on a day-date-specific basis beginning later this month. And if you look at the annualized promotion value that the stations will be contributing on a dedicated basis, it's something approaching a hundred million dollars. We are layering on top of that on an annualized basis approximately twenty million dollars of outside promotion expense which primarily goes for advertising on other media. CABLE NETWORKS BECAUSE WE'RE JUST A CHANNEL CHANGE AWAY AT THAT POINT ON NATIONAL AND SYNCHRONIZED RADIO WE'RE ALSO INVESTING HEAVILY IN SOCIAL MEDIA NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE APP BUT TO TRY AND DRIVE A YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC TO AN ALTERNATIVE NEWSCAST AND SO WE THINK OUR PROMOTION SPENDING YOU KNOW ALL TAKEN TOGETHER YOU KNOW A NINE FIGURE AMOUNT OF BOTH CASH AND IN KIND CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE COMPANY ARE ANOTHER ASSET THAT WILL HO FOR THIS THIS EFFORT AND AGAIN IT'S YOU KNOW IT IS A COUNTER PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITY IN PRIME TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR BEST TO SUCCEED THERE OBVIOUSLY IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL WE WOULD LOOK AT OTHER DAY PARTS BUT WE'RE TAKING VERY MUCH OF A CRAWL WALK RUN APPROACH TO THIS WE WANT TO GET IT RIGHT AND AND YOU KNOW WE WILL GROW AS FAST AS OUR SUCCESS WOULD ALLOW US TO GROW SO I THINK I'D LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT YOU KNOW W Introducing an alternative in prime time to entertainment sports and opinion programming and that the product will reach a will strike a chord and resonate with the audience and then you know audience growth and advertising growth will continue so tune in it launches on September first. I would like to thank the conference for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today. And I would like to extend my gratitude to Mr. Suk for any additional remarks or closing remarks. Well, thank you, operator. Again, we're very pleased at our progress and we're pleased at our strong financial position and we're excited about the launch of W G in America and the advent of the political spending season that will all be upon us before our next call. So we look forward to reporting back to you shortly after election day with the early results on all of those efforts and thank you very much for your time this morning. SPEAKER 1: Thank you all for your participation. You may now discuss.\n\nSPEAKER 2: And once again, that concludes today's conference. We thank you all for your participation."

OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS OF YOUR <INAUDIBLE> TO TRANSFORM OR CROSS-STRUCTURE AND STRENGTHEN A FRANCHISE WE'RE SUCCEEDING EVEN EARLIER THAN WE EXPECTED WE'VE ALREADY ACHIEVED FIVE ABOUT SEVEN 2021 CROSS TARGETS LIVING WITH REALIZED PRICES DOWN $20 TO TIMES FROM THE FIRST QUARTER AND REALIZED PRICES SO THAT'S JUST $13 TO TURN IN THE QUARTER WE GENERATED OVER 800 MILLION IN CASH FROM OPERATIONS SO

CONTINUING TO TRANSFORM THE QUARTER'S ACCELERATING EARNINGS AND CASHFLOW CLEARLY REFLECT OUR EFFORTS TODAY AND WE ARE DRIVING ADDITIONAL FUTURE SAVINGS WE EXPECT TO DELIVER ANOTHER $700 MILLION IN SAVINGS ABOVE THE 2019 DAYS AS WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY MOSAIC IS MORE COMPETITIVE THAN EVER BEFORE AND WITH FERTILIZER MARKETS IMPROVING WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT EARNINGS LEVERAGE TO THE FUTURE NOW WE'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS <UNK> JOC I'M GOING TO START WITH SOME QUESTIONS YOU RECEIVED ON COSTS ADAM SAMUELSON FROM GOLDMAN SACHS UH IN THE SECOND QUARTER MOSAIC WAS AHEAD OF ITS 2021 TARGETS AND A NUMBER OF ITS KEY COST KPIS HOW MUCH INCREMENTAL OPPORTUNITY TO SEE ON EACH KEY METRIC TO FURTHER REDUCE COSTS AND IF SO WHAT LEVEL OF INCREMENTAL CAPITAL SPENDS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THOSE OUTCOMES THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION ADAM AS WE'VE SAID EARLIER WE HAVE NEW TARGETS THAT INCLUDE $700 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE COMPANY 200 MILLION OF THOSE COMING FROM OUR BRAZIL OPERATION AND 500 COMING FROM OUR NORTH AMERICAN AND AND ADMINISTRATIVE SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE BIG GAINS AS WE GO FORWARD OBVIOUSLY ARE IN BRAZIL WHERE WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THAT BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA WHERE AUTOMATION IS ALLOWING US TO DRIVE EFFICIENCIES IN BOTH PHOSPHATES AND POTASH AND THEN OF COURSE OUR K3 OPERATION WHICH AS WE RAMP IT UP WILL ELIMINATE A LOT OF COSTS AND IMPROVE OUR GRIND MANAGEMENT COSTS SO AS WE LOOK FORWARD WE SEE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES STILL AND IMPORTANTLY IN SEPTEMBER WHEN WE BRING OUR ALL OF THIS TO OUR AMBULANCE DAY WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU MORE COLOR AND DETAIL ON WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE JOC CHRIS PARKINSON FROM CREDIT SWISS ASKS YOU'RE CLEARLY COMFORTABLY AHEAD ON NUMEROUS COST INITIATIVES INCLUDING YOUR K3 CHATS <INAUDIBLE> INFO PHOSPHATE ROCK COSTS IN THE US AND BRAZIL AND FOR THE <INAUDIBLE> PLATFORM BUT WHEN YOU TAKE A STEP BACK HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT YOUR STRUCTURAL COST SPACE IN A NORMALIZED ENVIRONMENT AND HOW MUCH MORE COULD ACTUALLY BE DONE ESPECIALLY IN PHOSPHATE YEAH THANK YOU CHRIS IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE COSTS IMPROVEMENT CERTAINLY ARE SOMEWHAT DRIVEN BY HIGH UTILIZATION WE'VE HAD A GOOD QUARTER WHERE WE'RE ABLE TO USE OUR ASSETS FULLY A- AND WE'VE HAD SOME BENEFITS FROM EXCHANGE RATE PARTICULARLY IN BRAZIL BUT ALSO IN CANADA OVER THE LONGTERM THOUGH THE REAL DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN STRUCTURAL AND THOSE ARE GOING TO STAY WITH US AND THOSE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THOSE SO IF WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW OUR MAJOR PROJECTS WHICH INCLUDE ESTERHAZY K3 NEXT GEN MINING AND THE BRAZIL TRANSFORMATION THOSE ARE NOT TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES THOSE ARE TRUE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT WILL BE DELIVERING VALUE FOR THE LONG-TERM JOC MICHAEL PIKEN FROM CLEVELAND RESEARCH ASKS YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE ON TRACK TO EXCEED YOUR 225 MILLION AND NON-MARKET GROWTH IN 2020 WHICH SEGMENTS ARE EXCEEDING YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF HOW MUCH HIGHER CAN THIS NUMBER GO FOR 2020 HELLO MICHAEL UH LET ME CLARIFY OUR $225 MILLION WERE ACTUAL ITEMS THAT WE SPENT IN 2019 THAT WE DID NOT EXPECT TO REPEAT IN 202 SO ON THOSE SOME OF THE KEY ITEMS TO PLANT T- TO THE ISLAND THAT'S HAPPENED AND NOW IS OUTSIDE OF OUR COST STRUCTURE OUR BRAZILIAN DAMS WE'VE COMPLETED THE WORK NOW AND THAT $80 MILLION OF COST IS NOW BEHIND US EQUALLY THE RAMP UP OF ESTERHAZY WHICH HAS GOTTEN BETTER THAN WE EXPECTED WE NOW ARE DELIVERING 1 MILLION TONS A YEAR FROM THE K3 PROJECT SO THAT BENEFIT IS ALREADY FLOWED THROUGH TO US AND THEN OF OUR $50 MILLION OF TRANSFORMATION IN BRAZIL WE'RE PART OF THAT 225 MILLION WE'RE ALREADY AT OVER 40 MILLION SO WE SEE THAT AS PRETTY MUCH COMPLETE AND ONGOING SAVINGS WILL BE ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT ORIGINAL 225 WE TALKED ABOUT JOC THE LARGEST NUMBER OF QUESTIONS SEEK A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR COUNTERVAILING DUTIES PETITION SETH <INAUDIBLE> SCENE FROM MORNING SIDE CHRIS PARKINSON FROM CREDIT SUISSE ASKED FOR AN UPDATE ON POTENTIAL REGULATION CHANGES OF THE US IMPORT DUTIES ON MOROCCO AND RUSSIAN SUPPLY AND IF THE OUTCOME IS SUCCESSFUL IN OUR FAVOR WHAT SHOULD THEY EXPECT IN CHANGES TO THEIR LANDED US CLASS IN OTHER WORDS WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD THANK YOU GENTLEMEN LET ME START BY SAYING WE BELIEVE IN FREE AND FAIR TRADE HOWEVER THE REASON WE FILED THIS PETITION IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS TO ADDRESS AND BALANCES ASSOCIATED WITH UNFAIR GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES ON INPUTS AND TO HIGHLIGHT ON EQUAL REQUIREMENTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WE BELIEVE OUR COMPETITORS BENEFIT FROM ACCESS TO ARTIFICIALLY LOW LOCK COSTS AND ENERGY WHILE NOT HAVING TO MEET ADEQUATE AND PROPER ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WE ALSO WILL SAY THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS PUT THIS FORWARD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION THEY WILL JUDGE ON THE MERITS AND AS SUCH DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF DUTIES IF ANY NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO CREATE A FAIR TRADE SITUATION AND QUINN DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT YEAH NO JACK I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WE UH WE CERTAINLY ARE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE ON THE REALIZATION OF THE $225 UH MILLION IN NON-MARKET BENEFIT THIS YEAR YOU KNOW KEEP IN MIND THAT UM THE $80 MILLION THAT WE SPENT ON ON DAM REMEDIATION LAST YEAR UH WITH SPREAD REALLY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER SO WE REALIZED ABOUT $36 MILLION IN BENEFIT IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND SHOULD REALIZE THE BALANCE UH THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE YEAR JOC JOHN ROBERTS FROM UBS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW CAN YOU REVIEW THE BASIS FOR YOUR PROSTATE COUNTERVAILING DUTIES POSITION AND HAVE YOU HAD ANY RESPONSE FROM CUSTOMERS OR COMPETITORS THANK YOU JOHN OUR BASIS FOR THE PETITION IS CLEARLY LAID OUT IN THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU GO TO THOSE ALSO THE COMMENTS FROM ANY OF OUR COMPETITORS FOR UH CUSTOMERS OR THE OTHER CONCERN GROUPS IS CLEARLY LAID OUT IN THOSE UH PUBLIC DOCUMENTS SO I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GO THERE OUR POSITION IS CLEARLY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION REALLY ARE THE ONES THAT WILL DECIDE WHAT ARE THE MERITS OF THIS CASE UH NOW CLEARLY AS WE TALK TO OUR CUSTOMERS SOME ARE CONCERNED MOSTLY ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEIR SUPPLY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS OPENED UP NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUTSIDE COMPETITORS TO COME IN AND MAKE UP SOME OF THAT SUPPLY UM BUT IN THE END I THINK ALL PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHY WE PUT IT FORWARD AND YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE ITC SAYS IN TERMS OF THIS MESS JOC WE RECEIVED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ASKING ABOUT TRADE FLOWS AND IMPLICATIONS TO OTHER MARKETS SPECIFICALLY ADAM SAMUELSON AND SEVEN OTHERS UH OVER THE NEXT SIX TO 12 MONTHS HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE NET IMPACT OF POTENTIAL TRADE FLOW IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL US COUNTERVAILING DUTIES ON MOROCCO AND RUSSIAN PHOSPHATE DO YOU SEE RISK OF MARKET SHARE COMPETITION RISING IN OTHER MAJOR IMPORT MARKETS NOTABLY BRAZIL THANKS MIKE AND JOEL LET'S ANSWER THE LAST QUESTION FIRST NO WE DON'T THINK THIS WILL IMPACT GLOBAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND ALL WE WILL DO IS PROBABLY CHANGE TRADE FLOW THE CURRENT MARKET AND RESOLVING PRICING IS REFLECTIVE OF A TIGHT MARKET AND IF ANYTHING THE COUNTERVAILING DUTIES ONLY HIGHLIGHTED TO PEOPLE THAT THIS MARKET WAS TIGHT SO WHAT'S CAUSING THE TIGHT MARKET FAVORABLE FARM ECONOMICS AND LOWER SUPPLY WHICH BEGAN TO TAKE SHAPE WELL BEFORE WE FILED THE PETITION HOWEVER IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THE TRADE FLOWS WILL BE ALTERED AND SOME PRODUCT WILL BE SHIFTED TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING NEW SUPPLIERS COMING INTO THE US AND THE MOROCCAN AND RUSSIAN SUPPLIERS FOCUSING ON OTHER MARKETS WHICH COULD BE BRAZIL OR WHEREVER JONAS OSCAR FROM BERNSTEIN ASKED TWO MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE PETITION NAMELY IF THE MOSAIC TRADE COMPLAINT IS UPHELD WILL THERE BE A RETROACTIVE BENEFIT TO MOSAIC AND WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR FINAL DECISION ON THE COMPLAINT SO LOOK THANK YOU JONAS LET ME FIRST CLARIFY WHETHER DUTIES ARE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY WILL DEPEND UPON THE LEVEL OF IMPORTS FROM THESE TWO COUNTRIES FROM THE FILING OF THE CASE UNTIL THE DOC PRELIMINARY RULING WE EXPECT THE CASE TO BE FINALIZED IN Q1 202 AND AT THAT POINT IF THERE HAS BEEN EXCESSIVE IMPORTS THEY WILL LOOK AT ASSESSING A RETROACTIVE DUTY JOC I'M NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS ABOUT PHOSPHATE OPERATIONS BEN ISAACSON SAID FROM SCOTIA ASKED ON THE CASH COST OF MINE ROSS IN FLORIDA FALLEN TO $36 PER TON FROM $40 YEAR OVER YEAR HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS DUE TO TRANSFORMATIONAL EFFORTS VERSUS FAVORABLE GEOLOGY AND HOW MUCH MORE WIGGLE ROOM IS THERE TO BRING THAT DOWN AND HOW SUSTAINABLE ARE THESE COSTS IMPROVEMENTS THANK YOU BEN CERTAINLY OUR COST IMPROVEMENTS ARE A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL FACTORS WE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN RUNNING OUR ASSETS AT A ELEVATED UTILIZATION RATES AND THAT'S HELPED BUT OUR EFFORTS TO CENTRALIZE MINING OPERATIONS STREAMLINED PROCESSES AND AUTOMATE HAVE ALSO HELPED REDUCE OUR COSTS AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CENTRAL CONTROL CENTER FOR OUR MINING AND ALL OF OUR MINING OPERATIONS BASICALLY INTO ONE LARGE OPERATION WHICH SHOULD BE BEGIN OPERATION BY THE END OF THE YEAR WE'LL RELEASE FURTHER AND HOUSE COSTINGS AND AS WE INTRODUCE NEW MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES INCORPORATE AUTOMATION FOR CERTAIN MINING FUNCTIONS AND ACCEL- ACCELERATE SAVINGS FROM ADJUSTMENTS TO TRANSPORTATION WE START TO SEE REAL LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR COST STRUCTURE JOC PJ <INAUDIBLE> ALSO ASKED WITH THE RECENT RISE OF OVER $50 PER TIME IN DAP PRICING HAVE YOU RAMPED UP YOUR PRODUCTION AT THE MINE AND WHAT COULD BE THE BENEFIT OF BETTER COST ABSORPTION FROM HIGHER TIMES IN THE THIRD QUARTER THANKS FOR THE QUESTION PJ HIGH UTILIZATION RATES ON A BENEFICIAL IMPACT BUT THAT'S REALLY ONLY PART OF THE STORY AS WE'VE MENTIONED BUT I WILL SAY THAT AS WE LOOK OUT TWO THREE GOING FORWARD WE CAN EXPECT THOSE TONAGE HIGH TONNAGE AND HIGHER UTILIZATION RATES TO CONTINUE SO WE DO EXPECT TO SEE BETTER COSTS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE YEAR BOTH STRUCTURALLY AND BECAUSE OF HIGH UTILIZATION JOC WE ALSO HAVE A QUESTION FROM ADAM SAMUELSON FROM GOLDMAN SACHS THE SPECIALTY PERCENTAGE ROSE TO 48% OF SHIPMENTS AND MARKED THE NEW QUARTERLY HIGH IN PHOSPHATE COINCIDENT WITH MICROESSENTIALS SHIPMENTS TO <INAUDIBLE> BEING SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE RECENT QUARTERS IS THIS SUSTAINABLE WHY OR WHY NOT THANK YOU ADAM THE SALES OF MICROESSENTIALS AND ASPIRE HIT RECORD HIGHS AND KAMEN CAME IN CLOSE TO THE RECORD IN QUARTER TWO TWO 202 AMONG THESE GROWTH MICROESSENTIALS SHIPMENTS TO BRAZIL HAS BEEN A MAJOR DRIVER NOW WE BELIEVE THAT THE GROWTH OF MICROESSENTIALS WILL CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT QUARTER DRIVEN BY MOSAIC FOR <INAUDIBLE> AND ALSO NORTH AMERICA I HAVE TO REEMPHASIZE THE VALUE THAT MICROESSENTIALS BRINGS TO THE GROWERS IS SHOWING POSITIVE RETURNS FOR THEM ON THEIR INVESTMENTS SO THESE ARE BRINGING REAL VALUE TO THE GROWERS AND TO OUR CUSTOMERS THE DISTRIBUTORS SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT AS MORE PEOPLE START USING MICROESSENTIALS THIS IS VERY SUSTAINABLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THE BENEFIT AND THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP USING THAT PRODUCT JOC THREE ANALYSTS SUBMITTED MULTI-PART QUESTIONS RELATED TO OUR POTASH OPERATIONS SO FIRST CHRIS PARKINSON'S ASKS THE DEMAND ENVIRONMENT IN POTASH CONTINUES TO BE MODESTLY IMPROVING WELL SPOT PRICES ARE WELL OFF THEIR FIRST HALF LOAD CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 21 OPERATING RATE ASSUMPTIONS AND HOW THAT MAY DRIVE CHANGES IN YOUR MINING THANKS CHRIS AS YOU KNOW WE'VE ACCELERATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF K3 AND THIS HAS AN OBVIOUS IMPACT ON COSTS SO NOW WITH DECLINING MANAGEMENT SPENDING AND IN THE FUTURE AS THE MINE RAMPS UP BEYOND K3 WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG RESULTS FROM BELLE PLEINE WHICH RECORDED HIS LOWEST COST POSITION IN MORE THAN A DECADE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OWNING TWO OF ONLY SEVEN MINES IN THE WORLD WITH ANNUAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF OVER 3 MILLION TONS AND WITH SOME OF THE LOWEST COSTS IN THE INDUSTRY SO AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE WE INTEND TO OPTIMIZE THE PRODUCTION COMING FROM K3 AND FROM OUR BELLE PLEINE OPERATION AND ONLY SEE RUNNING HIGHER COST MINES LIKE <INAUDIBLE> IF THE MARKET REALLY REQUIRES IT IN THE FUTURE JOC ANOTHER QUESTION COMES TO YOU FROM JONAS OSCAR OF BERNSTEIN UH IN PART AS YOU LOWERED YOUR COST PER TON OF FAIR BIT BUT HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS SIMPLY SPREADING FIXED COSTS OVER A 20% LARGER VOLUME ON A FIXED VOLUME BASIS WHAT WOULD YOUR COST REDUCTIONS BE GOOD QUESTION JONAS THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE LARGER VOLUME HELPS SPREAD OUT OUR COSTS HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THERE ARE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING OUR SCR- OUR COSTS OVER THE LONG TERM WE THINK ONE AREA OF CLEAR SAVINGS IS THE ACCELERATED REDUCTION OF BRINE MANAGEMENT CLASSES WE SHIFT TO K3 K1 UNDERGROUND MINING WILL BE COMPLETED THIS YEAR FLY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTED FOR $8 A TON IN Q2 AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE AS WE MOVE INTO 2021 AND WILL BE ELIMINATED COMPLETELY BY 202 SO AS YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF OUR COSTS-REDUCTION IS ACTUALLY STRUCTURAL AND SHOULD BE WITH US FOR THE LONGTERM JOC PJ <INAUDIBLE> ASKS WHAT KIND OF SAVINGS DO YOU EXPECT FROM SENDING K3 POTASH TO THE K1 MILL AND WHAT IS THE UPDATED TIMELINE NOW TO SHUT DOWN K1 AND K2 THANK YOU PJ WE EXPECT TO BE SENDING POTASH TO K1 AND ACTUALLY BE SHUTTING DOWN OUR K1 SHOUTS FROM A PRODUCTION PERSPECTIVE EARLY IN 2021 THAT WILL START MEANING WE'RE ONLY GOING TO BE OPERATING TWO SHAFTS AND THEN BY THE END OF 2022 ONLY OPERATING THE ONE BIG K3 SHAFT AT THAT POINT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETE WE'LL ELIMINATE <INAUDIBLE> INFLOW AND THAT REALLY WILL BE THE END OF OUR K1 AND K2 PATH UM MINE'S FROM A PRODUCTION PERSPECTIVE VINCENT ANDREWS IS INTERESTED IN HOW HE SHOULD THINK ABOUT OUR POTASH SHIPMENTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR GIVEN HOW STRONG SHIPMENTS WERE IN SECOND QUARTER ALSO CAN YOU REMIND HIM OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE CHINESE CONTRACT SHIPMENTS THAT WERE ALREADY IN A BONDED WAREHOUSE PRIOR TO CONTRACT AGREEMENT THANK YOU VINCENT YES WE DID HAVE STRONG SHIPMENTS IN QUARTER ONE AND IF I WOULD REFER TO OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH COMPETENCE I THINK THEY HAVE A FAIRLY FOR THE BOOK FOR Q3 AND EVEN GOING WELL INTO Q4 SO I BELIEVE THE SHIPMENTS INTERNATIONALLY WILL BE STRONG IN THE SECOND HALF AND DOMESTICALLY WE'RE EXPECTING A GOOD FALL IN NORTH AMERICA SO WE'RE EXPECTING STRONG SHIPMENTS THERE AS WELL SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE A SECOND HALF IS LOOKING PRETTY STRONG FROM A PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE UM SHIPMENTS IN THE FIRST HALF I JUST LIKE TO THROW IT OVER TO CLINT TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR CHINA SHIPMENTS TO BONDED WAREHOUSE THAT WE <INAUDIBLE> IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR CLINT CAN YOU DISCUSS THAT SURE JOC AND GOOD MORNING VINCENT UM SO TO START WITH UM ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WE DON'T RECOGNIZE REVENUE UNTIL THAT PRODUCT IS SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY HOWEVER UM WE DO ON A SEGMENT LEVEL BASIS WE DO RECOGNIZE A REVENUE WHEN UH CAMPA TECHS SELLS UM PRODUCTS TO OUR DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS IN CHINA AND WHEN THEY SENT THAT PRODUCT UH TO OUR DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS IN CHINA THE SEGMENT RECOGNIZED UH REVENUE BUT THAT WAS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF PRICING SINCE THE CONTRACT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED ONCE THE CONTRACT WAS COMPLETED AND THE PRICE FOR THAT TRANSACTION WAS SET THAT GAVE RISE TO THE ADJUSTMENT BUT AGAIN THAT'S AN ADJUSTMENT ON THE POTASH SEGMENT ONLY BECAUSE WE WON'T RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THAT PRODUCT ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS UNTIL IT'S FINALLY SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY THANKS FOR THAT CLARIFICATION CLINT JOC I'M NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS ABOUT MOSAIC <INAUDIBLE> WE HAVE FOUR ANALYSTS INCLUDING JOHN ROBERTS FROM UBS AND MARK CONLEY FROM STEVENS ASK SIMILAR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TIMING OF VOLUMES IN BRAZIL BRAZILIAN FARMERS ARE HAVING AN OUTSTANDING YEAR SO FAR AND HAVE BEEN WIDELY REPORTED TO THE BUYING INPUTS WELL AHEAD OF LAST YEAR SCHEDULE HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HAS BEEN BORROWED FROM THE THIRD QUARTER AND ARE WE LIKELY TO SEE AN OFFSETTING REDUCTION IN THIRD QUARTER MARGIN TO REFLECT THOSE LOWER VOLUMES NEXT QUARTER AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE QUARTER APRIL AND MAY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR MONTH WELL JUNE APPEARED TO BE MUCH CLOSER TO A YEAR AGO IS THAT JUST TIMING OR ARE THE TRENDS DECELERATING INTO JULY GREAT QUESTION THE STRONG VOLUMES IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR DID REFLECT SOME FORWARD INPUT PURCHASES AS A RESULT OF GENERALLY FAVORABLE FARM ECONOMICS SO YEAR OVER YEAR DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO BE UP SLIGHTLY BUT 37 MILLION TONS AND IN THAT FIGURE WE BELIEVE WE ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE MARKET SHARE AS FARMERS GRAVITATE TOWARDS HIGHER ANALYSIS PRODUCTS AND HIGH-VALUE PRODUCTS SUCH AS OUR MICROESSENTIALS JOC MARK CONNOLLY AT STEVENS ASKED HOW DID THE DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN COST IN BRAZIL BREAKOUT BETWEEN VOLUME-DRIVEN COST IMPROVEMENT AND OPERATIONAL STRUCTURAL COST CHANGE BUT SHOULD REPEAT WITH NORMAL VOLUMES THANK YOU MARK LET ME START BY SAYING LAST YEAR OPERATIONS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE CHANGE IN REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRED US TO UH SHUT DOWN A COUPLE OF OPERATIONS FOR DAM IMPROVEMENTS THAT REDUCED VOLUME AND IMPACT OF OUR RAW MATERIALS ACCESS THIS YEAR WE'RE WE'RE BENEFITING FROM RUNNING A FULL OPERATIONS RATE AND THIS ALSO HAS ALLOWED US TO HAVE MORE ACCESS TO OUR OWN ROCK SUPPLIES SO OVERALL THAT HAS HELPED A LITTLE BIT SO ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE COSTS ARE PROBABLY VOLUME RELATED THE OTHERS ARE IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR FREIGHT OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT OUR OVERALL PLANNING AND OF COURSE STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO OUR STRU- TO OUR UM COST STRUCTURES I THINK OVERALL THOUGH WE'RE WE'RE SEEING THE LONG-TERM CHANGES TO HOW THE BRAZIL BUSINESS IS RUNNING AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE FULL BENEFIT OF THE $330 MILLION OR SO OF INTEGRATION BENEFIT THAT WE ANNOUNCED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR JOC PJ MICROESSENTIALS HAS A QUESTION ABOUT CURRENCY SO BRAZILIAN <INAUDIBLE> VERSUS A USL WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY YEAR OVER YEAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 202 HOW DID THAT VOLATILITY IMPACT YOU AND WHAT SPECIFICALLY WAS THE IMPACT IN THE QUARTER AND MOSAIC <INAUDIBLE> THANKS PJ I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TWO ASPECTS OF THE UM BRAZILIAN REAL THAT REALLY HAS CHANGED THINGS AND THE FIRST OF THOSE OF ALL OF COURSE IS THE IMPACT ON FARMER ECONOMICS I THINK THAT IS ACTUALLY THE BIGGER IMPROVEMENT THEIR ABILITY TO BUY FERTILIZERS AND THE CONTINUOUS GROWTH OF THE BRAZILIAN AGRICULTURE UH SEGMENT IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY GREAT ECONOMICS FOR THE FARMER AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THE FIRST PLACE WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHERE THE BRAZILIAN REAL HAS HELPED US IN TERMS OF OUR COST PERFORMANCE YOU WILL SEE THAT WE TEND TO PUT OUR TARGETS IN REAL BASE SO THAT ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE REAL UNDERLYING IMPROVEMENT UH OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS SOME POSITIVE IMPACT I THINK WE SAW DEFINITE UH IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR OVERALL COSTS BECAUSE OF THE REALITY BUT I WOULD SAY WE FOCUS MORE ON WHAT IS THE REAL BASED COST BECAUSE THAT TELLS US WHERE THEY WERE REALLY IMPROVING THE BUSINESS OR JUST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CURRENCY OH IN THE BACK YOU'LL NOTICE SORRY PJ I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BACK OF OUR STUFF YOU'LL SEE BASICALLY OUR SENSITIVITIES AND A ONE A 10 CENT MOVE IN THE REAL AMOUNTS TO ABOUT $20 MILLION A YEAR UNHEDGED SO IF WE THINK ABOUT US AS BEING ABOUT 50% <INAUDIBLE> UH IT'S FAIRLY EASY TO DO UH THE RECONCILIATION TO LAST YEAR REAL COST JOC WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FROM BEN ISAACSON UM WITH RESPECT TO MOSAIC SUMMER BRANCHES MOSAIC BRANCHES SALES VOLUMES HAVE BEEN NOTABLY HIGHER YEAR OVER YEAR CAN YOU WALK THROUGH THIS STRATEGIC STRENGTH OF THIS BUSINESS AND HOW IT RELATES TO YOUR MIX BETWEEN COMMODITY AND MICROESSENTIALS <INAUDIBLE> THANKS BEN YOU KNOW AGAIN I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE BUT I'LL I'LL REPEAT YOU KNOW THE THE VOLUME GROWTH REALLY WAS A RESULT OF IMPROVEMENT IN FARM ECONOMICS IN BRAZIL UH THE STRENGTHENING OF THE US DOLLAR VERSUS THE REAL EXCELLENT BAR THE RATIOS AND ANTICIPATION ABOUT A STRONG SUMMER CROP DEMAND SO BOTH BOTH COMMODITY AND PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS HAVE SHOWN ROBUST INCREASES IN Q- Q2 QUARTER TWO OF 2020 VERSUS A YEAR AGO JOC CHRIS PARKINSON ASKED FOR A COVID-19 UPDATE HIS QUESTION IS <INAUDIBLE> IN THE MIDST OF A FAIRLY COMPLEX COVID-19 OUTBREAK WHICH HAS PERIODICALLY BEEN AFFECTING THE PORT AND LOGISTICS SYSTEM CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE DEMAND ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS ANY LOGISTICAL HEADWINDS YOU PROCEED DURING THE PEAK FERTILIZER APPLICATION SEASON THANKS CHRIS LOOK LET'S START TOMORROW FOR OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL AND ALTHOUGH WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CASES BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION WE HAVE NOT BEEN IMPACTED ON OUR OPERATIONS TO THIS POINT AND WE'VE INSTITUTED A NUMBER OF PROCEDURES TO MAKE SURE WE MITIGATE THE SPREAD S- SORRY AND THEN FROM AN OVERALL COUNTRY LOGISTICS PERSPECTIVE UH WE BELIEVE THAT IN GENERAL WE HAVE BEEN UNEFFECTED BY COVID NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE LOCAL PLACES WHERE THAT IMPACTS US BUT IN GENERAL WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK AROUND THAT AND KEPT THE PRODUCT MOVING TO THE END CUSTOMER AND FROM A DEMAND PERSPECTIVE DESPITE COVID WE'VE CONTINUED TO SEE STRONG DEMAND AGAIN DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE FARM ECONOMICS AND WE HAVE GOT OUR PRODUCT TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE IMPACT THE LAST QUESTION WE RECEIVED ON MOSAIC <INAUDIBLE> COMES FROM JOEL JACKSON <INAUDIBLE> SAYS THE SECOND QUARTER GROSS MARGIN WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE RESULTS FROM THE PRIOR TWO YEARS HOW MUCH OF THAT GAME WAS MARKET CONDITIONS VERSUS FOREIGN EXCHANGE TAILWINDS VERSUS SHARE GAIN IN THE MARKET THIS IS A PULL FORWARD OF Q3 BECAUSE OF COVID RELATED-LOGISTICS CONCERNS THANKS JOEL I WOULD SUMMARIZE OUR RESULTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF IN BRAZIL AS AN A COUPLE OF FACTORS FIRST OF ALL IF WE LOOKED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE IT'S PROBABLY OFFSET ALMOST PERFECTLY THE CHANGE IN PRICING SO WHAT WE SEE IN ACTUAL RESULTS IS ALMOST SOLELY THE RESULT OF OUR OWN ACTIONS AND THE REVERSAL OF SOME OF THE DOWN COSTS THAT WE SAW LAST YEAR JOC WE RECEIVED A HANDFUL OF QUESTIONS ON THE BALANCE SHEET PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON USES OF PRE CASTABLE JOHN ROBERTS ASKED WHAT ARE THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARD AND CAN YOU PLEASE DISCUSS YOUR GROWTH DEBT LEVEL DIVIDENDS AND POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES AND PJ YOU'VE <INAUDIBLE> ASKED BEYOND PAYING DOWN SOME DEBT WHAT COULD BE USES OF CASH ESPECIALLY WITH IMPROVED FREE CASHFLOW IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2020 WOULD BUY BACK THE APPROVED USE OF CASH OVER THE COUNTERVAILING DUTY DECISION PREVENT YOU FROM BUYING BACK STOCK JOC CAN YOU TALK ABOUT CAPITAL PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE QUESTIONS YEAH THANK YOU GENTLEMEN OUR CAPITAL PRIORITIES ARE UNSH- CHANGED AND THEY CONTINUE TO BE WHAT WE'VE SAID IN THE PAST RIGHT MM-HMM <AFFIRMATIVE> SORRY YOU KNOW OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS TO MAINTAIN THE BUSINESS NEXT PRIORITY MAINTAIN INVESTMENT GRADE METRICS AND TO DO THAT UH YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO CONTINUE OUR NORMAL CAPITAL PLAN AS WE'VE HAD UH WE EXPECT TO LOWER DEBT BY ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS UH DOING SO WHEN OUR BONDS COME DUE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND THEN CONTINUE SOME OF THE KEY PROJECTS LIKE THE ESTERHAZY ACCELERATION K3 ACCELERATION AND THEN WHAT WE HAVE AFTER THAT RETURNING CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS ALL THESE ARE DEPENDENT ON FUTURE CASH FLOW GENERATIONS AND CAPITAL ALLOCATION WILL NOT BE IMPACTED IN ANY WAY BY THE COUNTERVAILING DUTIES WE'VE ALSO HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FROM A BUY-SIDE ANALYST UH AND THEY INCLUDE UM CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE 610 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBTS THAT YOU INDICATED WILL BE PAID IN 2020 AND DOES MOSAIC STILL PLAN TO KEEP ABOUT A BILLION DOLLAR CASH BALANCE AND PAID ON ITS 2021 MATURITY THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AT THE START OF THIS YEAR WE DID INCREASE OUR CASH BALANCE TO A BILLION DOLLARS BY FIRST OF ALL TAKING OUT UH SOME MONEY FROM OUR REVOLVER AND EXECUTING ON SOME OF OUR UH INVENTORY FINANCING DEBT SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE PAID DOWN THE REVOLVER AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY DOWN THE REST OF THE $600 MILLION IN SHORT-TERM DEBT THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THIS YEAR BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO MARKET-RELATED QUESTIONS BEN ISAACSON ASKED ABOUT OUR TAX RATE OUTLOOK WHY IS YOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE MID TO HIGH 60S AND HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THIS RATE UNDER A TRUMP OR BIDEN PRESIDENCY THANK YOU BEN LET ME START BY SAYING THE FIRST PART OF THIS IS AND THE REASON FOR THE TAX RATE BEING HIGHER IS OUR INCOME MIX BETWEEN OUR THREE JURISDICTIONS CANADA BRAZIL AND THE US UH THE DETAILS OF THAT I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY HAND IT OVER TO CLINT TO EXPLAIN WHY THE NEGATIVE EARNINGS IN THE US WILL CREATE A HIGHER TAX RATE OVERALL YEAH THANKS JOC AND UM <INAUDIBLE> THAT'S RIGHT IT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO AN EARNINGS MIX UH PHENOMENON FOR US IF YOU RECALL THE UM THE TAX RATE IS IS IS BASED ON GAP RESULTS BY JURISDICTION AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE UNITED STATES NOT ONLY IS OUR PHOSPHATE BUSINESS UH INCORPORATED INTO THAT BUT ALSO OUR CORPORATE DNA OUR INTEREST EXPENSE AND SO FORTH SO UM THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THAT PRE-TAX INCOME IN THE US TURNS NEGATIVE AND THAT CAN BEGIN TO SKEW THE RATE WHEN YOU THEN START TO FACTOR IN THINGS LIKE SOME OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVES THAT WE'VE SEEN UM AND HOW IT AFFECTS OUR OUR MARK TO MARKET AND SOME OF THE NOTABLE ITEMS THAT THAT WE HAVE ON OUR SCHEDULE THAT BEGINS TO SCALE IT AND THEN YOU KNOW AS YOU'VE SEEN BRAZIL UH IMPROVED THIS YEAR UH THAT'S OUR HIGHEST RATE TAX JURISDICTION SO SO THAT UH BEGINS TO INFLUENCE THAT RATE AS WELL SO REALLY THE COMBINATION OF ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT RESULTING IN AN UNUSUALLY HIGH TAX RATE FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN I'D HAD TWO THINGS UH ONE UH ON A LONGER TERM BASIS WE WOULD EXPECT THAT EFFECTIVE TAX RATE UH TO BE UH SOMEWHERE IN THE MID TO HIGH 20S UM BUT THEN I WOULD ALSO CALL TO YOUR ATTENTION UM THAT OUR CASH TAX UH RATES UH AND PAYMENTS UH ARE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THAT MATTER OF FACT THIS YEAR WE EXPECT TO END UP WITH A UH A SMALL CASH TAX REFUND UM SO VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE UH THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO <INAUDIBLE> RELATED QUESTIONS MIKE <INAUDIBLE> ASKED IF HE COULD COMMENT ON OUR SUMMER FILL PROGRAMS IN THE US AND WHERE WE SEE DOWNSTREAM INVENTORIES IN THE US AT THIS POINT THANK YOU MICHAEL I THINK WE'VE HAD FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL FILL PROGRAMS IN BOTH PHOSPHATES AND POTASH HERE IN THE US UM RECENT DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH OUR CUSTOMERS SUGGESTED THEY'RE PROBABLY IN THE RANGE OF 60% FULL FOR THE FALL SEASON SO THERE WILL BE INCREASED MIND TOWARDS THE FALL SEASON BUT FOR THE MOST PART OUR CUSTOMERS ARE IN REASONABLY HEALTHY SHAPE GOING INTO THAT FALL STEVE BARNES IS LOOKING FOR INSIGHT INTO TEACHER VOLUME HOW ARE YOU TRENDING IN EACH OF THE SEGMENTS THROUGH THE MONTH OF JULY ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS DO YOU SEE VOLUMES HIGHER IN THE THIRD QUARTER ANY EXPECTATION FOR VOLUMES FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR THANKS STEVE I WOULD CHARACTERIZE Q3 AS LARGELY HAVING OUR ORDER BOOKS FULL FOR BOTH PHOSPHATE AND POTASH AND SO IT'LL BE A MATTER OF DELIVERY AND UH REVENUE RECOGNITION THAT WILL DETERMINE WHERE WE ARE FOR Q3 BUT WE EXPECT A REASONABLY GOOD FALL IN THE US AND GLOBAL MARKETS ARE RUNNING LOW SO FOR BOTH PHOSPHATES AND POTASH WE EXPECT RELATIVELY NORMAL TWO THREE VOLUMES AND BOLD AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR WE SHOULD ALSO SEE A GOOD STABLE UH VOLUME JOHN MARK CONNELLY WOULD LIKE INSIGHT INTO GRADING ROYALTY PRESENTATIONS HOW IMPORTANT TO MOSAICS EARNINGS OUTLOOK ARE HIGHER GRAIN AND ILT PRICES IF THE CURRENT PRICE OF CORN IS THE SAME THROUGH 2020 AND SOYBEAN STAY AT OR NEAR THEIR CURRENT PRICES DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY MATERIAL ROOM FOR HIGHER P&K PRICES IN THE MARKET THANK YOU MARK CLEARLY OIL SEED AND GRAIN PRICES DO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR US BUT IN GENERAL THE FARMERS TEND TO WORK A LOT MORE ON THEIR NEEDS TO PLANT SO WHAT'S A LOT MORE IMPORTANT TO US AS PLANTING INTENTIONS NUMBER OF ACRES PLANTED AND REMEMBER ALSO THE GRAIN AND OIL SEEDS ARE JUST A FEW OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE FERTILIZED SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT DOES THE WHOLE GLOBAL MARKET LOOK LIKE AND WHAT IS THE DEMAND FOR P&K AND WHAT SUPPLY BALANCE THERE AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING ON THE GRAIN AND OIL SEED IT HAS AN INDIRECT IMPACT BUT I WOULD SAY NO DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR PRICING <INAUDIBLE> FOR MORGAN STANLEY WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT OUR MARKET FORECAST GIVEN THAT THE LAST 10 YEARS OF P&K SHIPMENTS SHOW SOME PATTERN LUMPINESS OF POTASH MORE THAN PHOSPHATES WHY NOT FORECAST LUMPINESS GOING FORWARD RATHER THAN JUST KEGGERS THANKS VINCENT WE TEND TO FORECAST ON ANNUAL GROWTH SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME OF THE OTHER FACTORS THAT GO INTO THE LUMPINESS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST AND THOSE ARE REALLY INVENTORY MOVEMENTS GLOBALLY AND OF COURSE WEATHER UH YOU SAW IN 2019 THE WEATHER IMPACTS IN THE US MADE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE TO THE GROWTH RATE OF BOTH PHOSPHATE AND POTASH ON A ON A GLOBAL SCALE SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT ON AVERAGES BUT RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WILL BE LUMPINESS AS WE GO FORWARD WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO SOME QUESTIONS ON PHOSPHATE UH THIS ONE IS FROM BEN ISAACSON THE BENCHMARK MIP SELLING PRICE FELL BY $16 TO $314 PER TON YES MOSAIC AVERAGE FINISHED PRODUCT DOWNSIDES FELL BY ALMOST THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT ALMOST $44 TO 308 FROM 35 WHY HOW COULD WE THINK THIS SO HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP GOING FORWARD THANKS BEN THE ANSWER HERE IS SIMPLY THAT THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE AND OR LAVON PHASE IS BASED ON ALL THE COMPONENTS WE SELL INCLUDING UREA AND POTASH AND THE BLENDS BOTH OF WHICH ARE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT RELATIONSHIP GOING FORWARD YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THREE PRODUCTS THAT WOULD BE IN OUR BLENDS THAT WE SELL BEN ALSO ASKED THAT STRIPPING MARGINS HAS STARTED TO IMPROVE IN JULY AFTER REMAINING LARGELY FAT THROUGHOUT THE SECOND QUARTER ARE YOU SEEING THIS FLOWS THROUGH TO THE PHOSPHATE SEGMENTS MARGINS THANK YOU BEN AGAIN UH DOC'S TRIVIA MARGIN IS WE TRACK THAT BECAUSE THAT REALLY IS WHAT DO WE GET AFTER THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND TRANSPORT AS AS REVENUE SO OF COURSE THIS FLOWS DIRECTLY INTO OUR MARGINS UH AN IMPROVEMENT IN STRIPPING MARGIN REALLY IS ALMOST DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY ADAM SAMUELSON UH WE'D LIKE TO KNOW UH WHAT DOES MOSAIC SEE AS THE EQUILIBRIUM PRICES OF US NOLA DAP AND MAP VERSUS KEY OFFSHORE BENCHMARKS THANK YOU ADAM ALL I CAN REALLY SAY THERE IS IF YOU LOOK AT IT HISTORICALLY OTHER THAN THE LAST SAY THREE YEARS WHERE THERE'S BEEN A REAL INCREASE IN IMPORTS UM WE HAVE SEEN NOLA PRICES BEING SIMILAR TO UH OTHER GLOBAL PRICES AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT UNDER A MORE UH FAIR TRADE MARKET THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IS YOU WOULD SEE THE NOLA PRICE BEING EQUAL TO WHAT THE PRICE IS AND OTHER MARKETS ARE ADJUSTED FOR THE TRANSPORT COST AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPECT WILL HAPPEN AFTER A COUNTERVAILING DUTY CASE UH IF THEY UH READJUST THAT MARKET JOC STEVE BARNES WOULD LIKE MORE INSIGHT INTO OUR GLOBAL SOFT RATE DEMAND OUTLOOK AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO INVENTORIES SWINGS SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE OF UNDERLYING GLOBAL CONSUMPTION OF PHOSPHATE IN <INAUDIBLE> AND LIVER BELOW THE SHIPMENT BUT 71 MILLION POUNDS DID IT REFLECT <INAUDIBLE> THANK YOU STEVE IF WE LOOK AT 2019 THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT THERE WAS BUILDUP OF GLOBAL INVENTORY PARTICULARLY IN THE US I MEAN IN THE US THERE WAS UM AT POOR SEASON AND THE IMPORTS IN PARTICULARLY KEPT COMING IN WE SHUT DOWN OUR LOUISIANA OPERATION FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS LAST YEAR AND AND STILL THE INVENTORY BUILD IN THE US WAS WAS VERY HIGH LIKEWISE THE THE BRAZILIAN UH INVENTORY WAS PROBABLY SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL COMING INTO THIS YEAR FOR MAYBE SOME OF THE SAME REASONS UM BUT UH WHAT I WILL SAY IS IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WE HAVE LARGELY CLEARED OUT ALL OF THAT INVENTORY AND PROBABLY HAVE MOVED FROM AN AREA OF HIGH INVENTORY TO VERY LOW INVENTORY IN PHOSPHATES UH AS WE MOVE INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF THIS YEAR JOC IN A RELATED QUESTION HE ALSO ASKED ARE NORMAL INVENTORY LEVEL FOR THE INTEREST CERTAINLY FORECAST IN 202 THANKS STEVE YEAH IN TERMS OF 2021 WHAT WE REALLY SEE IS THE INVENTORY LEVELS SHOULD BE PRETTY MUCH LEVELED OFF AND WE EXPECT NORMAL GROWTH IN THE MARKET AS PER ANY OTHER YEAR SO THAT UH 2% TYPE ANNUAL GROWTH IN 202 VINCENT ANDREWS WOULD LIKE OUR OPINION ON TIMER ECONOMICS HE ASKS GIVEN THE RECENT RUN-UP IN DAP PRICES ARE YOU AT ALL CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR FARMERS DEFERING APPLICATION THANKS VINCENT LOOK OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN AND IF YOU LOOK EVEN AT THIS SPRING WITH THE COVID UNCERTAINTY THAT FARMERS WILL PUT FERTILIZER ON THEIR FIELDS ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS AND AND YOU KNOW FRANKLY TODAY WITH PRECISION AGRICULTURE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO PUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FERTILIZERS ON EVERY YEAR SO YOU KNOW AND PHOSPHATE PRICES FRANKLY ALSO ARE A VERY SMALL PIECE OF THE OVERALL COST OF RUNNING A FARM SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT MOST FARMERS WILL UM LOOK AT PHOSPHATE PRICING AND HAVE IT CHANGED THEIR APPLICATION BUT I'D ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE FALSELY PRICES ARE STILL VERY AFFORDABLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE GRAIN AND OIL SEED PRICES ARE SO AS WITH MOST FALL SEASONS WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WHETHER IT WILL BE A M- THE MAIN ARBITRATOR OF DEMAND AND YOU KNOW WITH EXPECTING AN EARLY CROP MATURITY THIS YEAR WE EXPECT WE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD FALL JOC WE HAVE THE THREE QUESTIONS RELATED TO CHINA AND PHOSPHATE FIRST VINCENT ANDREWS ASKS WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE WOULD BE THE CHINESE DAP EXPORTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2020 AND WHAT SECOND HALF 2020 THAT PRICE DOES THAT ASSUME THAT PRICES ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN YOUR ESSENTIALLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO CHINESE EXPORTS THANKS VINCENT CHINESE EXPORTS OVER THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR WERE LOWER BY ABOUT 800000 TONS FROM LAST YEAR NOW OUR BASE FORECAST CALLS FOR CHINESE EXPORTS TO END THE YEAR ABOUT 600000 TIMES LOWER IN OTHER WORDS WE EXPECT THAT INTERNATIONAL PRICING IS A LITTLE HIGHER WORLD SENT A FEW EXTRA TONS COMING OUT OF CHINA IN THE SECOND HALF AND IF PRICES ARE HIGHER THAN OUR EXPECTATIONS UM THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE UPSIDE BUT WE DON'T SEE SIGNIFICANT UPSIDE AND PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS IS DOMESTIC DEMAND IS COMING IN FAIRLY STRONG AS WE MOVE INTO FALL AND I THINK THE BIGGEST SH- THERE WILL BE EXPORT AVAILABILITY LIMITATIONS NOW OBVIOUSLY IF OUR PRICES ARE LOWER THAN EXPECTATIONS UM YOU KNOW THE VOLUMES COULD BE EVEN LOWER THAN WHAT THEY ARE NOW GOLDSTEIN AND STEVE BARNES BOTH ASKED ABOUT PRODUCTIONS SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS THE STATUS AND OUTLOOK FOR REDUCED PHOSPHATE PRODUCTION AT SPECIFIC FACILITIES IN CHINA AND TUNISIA AND DO YOU EXPECT AS LOWER EXPORTS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WELL LET ME HIT CHINA FIRST UM YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A A WELL-KNOWN SHIFT TOWARDS UH SHUTTING DOWN SOME OF THE HIGHER-POLLUTING PLANTS PARTICULARLY ALONG THE NC RIVER UM AND WE'VE SEEN SOME OF YOUR UM THAT HAVE RESULTED IN PRODUCTION DECLINES IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR UH IN TERMS OF CHINESE EXPORT VOLUME OVER THE NEXT YEARS UH WE MAINTAIN THE CHINESE EXPORTS WILL TREND TREND LOWER AND WE'LL ESTABLISH A NEW NORMAL I MEAN WE'VE NOW SEEN WHAT WE THINK IS THE BOTTOMING OF CHINESE DOMESTIC DEMAND AND WE'RE SEEING A LOWERING OF PRODUCTION SO WITH THAT WE'LL HAVE TO COME A LOWERING OF EXPORTS AS THEY MEET DOMESTIC DEMAND FOR TUNISIA IT WOULD APPEAR THAT EXPECTATIONS FOR PLANT RESEARCH AND RESURGENCE OF PRODUCTION IN 2020 WERE SOMEWHAT OVERSTATED BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO PUT TUNISIAN CONTEXT THEY HAVE PRODUCED AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT 750000 TONS OF DAP AND TSP OVER LAST FIVE YEARS PER PROTESTS WILL CERTAINLY LEAD TO SHOVELING OF THE ROCK PRODUCTION THE BUSINESS PLAGUED THEM FOR OVER A DECADE SO WHICH MEANS WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO STAY ABOUT THE SAME RUN RATE AS WE GO FORWARD AS WELL JOC THE LAST SECTION OF QUESTIONS REALLY TO POTASH GLOBAL MARKETS <INAUDIBLE> ASKED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF PALM OIL DEMAND ON PRODUCTS WHAT IS THE TYPICAL LAG BETWEEN MOVEMENTS AND PALM OIL PRICES AND CHANGES IN POTUS DEMAND TO SOUTHEAST ASIA AND HENCE THE REBOUND IN PALM OIL PRICING RESULTED IN INCREASED PRODUCTS DEMAND IN <INAUDIBLE> THANK YOU GENTLEMEN THE PALM OIL DEMAND IS IMPORTANT FOR POTASH AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IS AN IMPROVEMENT IN PALM OIL PRICES AND WE KNOW FOR PRODUCTION REASONS THEY WILL BE ADDING POTASH TO THEIR PALM OIL PLANTATION SO SO WE SEE THAT AS A FAIRLY DIRECT RELATIONSHIP UH I WOULDN'T SAY WE SEE INCREASED DEMAND BUT WE SEE DEMAND THAT IS GETTING BACK TO ITS NORMAL LEVELS IN TERMS OF A LONGER TERM UM EXPORT DEMAND AND DOMESTIC DEMAND FOR BIOFUELS IS HELPING IN TERMS OF OPTIMISM FOR RECOVERY SO ALL OF THESE THINGS MEAN THAT WE SHOULD SEE A BETTER DEMAND FOR POTASH IN THE SOUTHEAST ASIA REGION PARTICULARLY MALAYSIA AND INDONESIA JOEL JACKSON AND BEN ISAACSON BOTH ASKED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE GLOBAL POTASH IN <INAUDIBLE> IN THE VARIOUS REGIONS PARTICULARLY IN CHINA THANK YOU GENTLEMEN UM IF IF WE LOOK AT CHINA THERE'S THERE'S SORT OF A BIFURCATION OF INVENTORY WE KNOW THERE'S ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MILLION TONS OF THE PORT BUT WE BELIEVE THERE'S RELATIVELY LOW INVENTORIES AS WE MOVED ON THE LAB AND SO AS WE'RE NOW SEEING A STRONG DEMAND FOR NPK IS IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET WE DO EXPECT WITH THE MOVEMENTS OUT OF THE PORT TO THOSE MPK CLOWNS WILL START BRINGING DOWN INVENTORY LEVELS ASSUMING THAT THE ARRIVALS ARE ABOUT AT NORMAL LEVELS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR MARK CONNELLY AND STEVE BARNES ARE BOTH INTERESTED IN POTASH DEMAND GROUP WHAT IS DRIVING THE ACCELERATION IN POTASH DEMAND IN YOUR PODCAST AND OTHER SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHY THANKS I WOULDN'T SAY WE'RE ACTUALLY FORECASTING AN ACCELERATION OF POTASH DEMAND OUR POTASH DEMAND GROWTH FROM A LONGTERM TREND IS SAYING FAIRLY STEADY AT WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE AROUND 3% AND IF YOU TAKE 2019 OUT OF IT UH I THINK WE STILL HAVE STAY JUST ON THAT TREND AND A RELATED QUESTION IF DEMAND ENDS UP TOWARD THE HIGH END OF YOUR R- RANGE CAN YOU SEE INCREASED SUPPLY BALANCE IN THE MARKET OR WOULD YOU EXPECT THE MARKET TO TIGHTEN WELL I GUESS THIS REQUIRES TWO THINGS ONE THE W- W-SUCCESS OF PRODUCTION RAMP UPS ON THE NEW PROJECTS PARTICULARLY I GUESS <INAUDIBLE> UM BUT GIVEN THE DELAYS WE'VE SEEN IN REC- RECENT YEARS ON THESE RAMP UPS IT WOULD SEE THAT THE MARKET SHOULD TIGHTEN ACTUALLY IF DEMAND COMES IN BUY AND THE BAR EXPECTATION AND THE LAST RELATED QUESTION ALSO WHAT IS THE BULL CASE FOR POTASH PRICING OVER A THREE TO FIVE-YEAR PERIOD THANKS THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD CREATE A BULL RUN IN POTASH PRICES AND THE FIRST I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED WHICH IS SLOWER AROUND TOP OF THE UM PROJECTS PARTICULARLY THE ONES IN RUSSIA AND BELLA RUSSIA UH BUT WHAT WE WOULD REALLY EXPECT IS PROBABLY A HIGHER UTILIZATION RATE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN ASSETS OVER THE NEXT SAY THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND AND A MORE MODEST RISE IN PRICES THAT WOULD SUGGEST PRICES APPRECIATE SLIGHTLY TO WHERE THEY WERE MAYBE IN 2018 AND UTILIZATION OF ASSETS GOES OFF AT THE SAME TIME ANOTHER I PROMISED TO THEY'RE BOTH ASKING ABOUT THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN PRICING TRENDS BETWEEN BRAZILIAN <INAUDIBLE> THAT RALLIED OFF CLOSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER VERSUS YOU ASKED THEMSELVES THESE ASIAN MOP PRICES THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO BE SOME OF THE GROWERS ARE STRONG RESILIENT ECONOMICS I'M NOT SO OFFSET THIS WEEK THAT'S ANOTHER REGION THANKS BRAZILIAN FARM ECONOMICS ARE REALLY OUTSTANDING AT PRESENT WHICH IS CERTAINLY HELPING TO UNDERPIN PRICING IN THAT MARKET AND WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE UH FOR THE US AND SOUTHEAST ASIAN MARKETS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A SEASONALLY SLOW PERIOD FOR POTASH DEMAND AND THAT WILL IMPACT PRICES I'D ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR SUMMER FIELD PROGRAM WAS EXTREMELY WELL RECEIVED AND IT IS TYPICAL OF COMMODITY MARKETS TO NECESSARILY SEE FIRST A REBOUND IN DEMAND AND THEN PRICES FALLING AFTER THAT WE HAVE NOW COMPLETED OUR PRE-SUBMITTED QUESTIONS AND SO NOW I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS OPEN IT UP TO THE AUDIENCE FOR LIVE Q&A OPERATOR THANK YOU THAT'S YOUR REMINDER TO ASK A QUESTION YOU WILL NEED TO DIAL STAR ONE ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD TO WITHDRAW YOUR QUESTION PLEASE PRESS THE POUND KEY WE'LL LIMIT THE QUESTION TO ONE PER PARTICIPANT TO ALLOW THE OTHER'S QUESTIONS TO BE ADDRESSED THANK YOU <INAUDIBLE> FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF ADAM SAMUELSON FROM GOLDMAN SACHS YOUR LINE IS OPEN UH YES THANKS UH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE SO UH I GUESS UH I WANTED TO JUST FOLLOW UP ON ON THE AFFORDABILITY UH QUESTIONS JOC O- ON PHOSPHATES AND ON YOUR OWN KIND OF AFFORDABILITY METRIC THAT YOU PUBLISH WE'RE NOW UH ABOVE LONG-TERM AVERAGE AND JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHERE WHERE YOU WOULD SEE AN UPPER LIMIT TO THAT AND ESPECIALLY IF IF YOU THINK ABOUT NEXT YEAR AND FARMER INCOME RISKS UM FR- FROM UH GOV- GOVERNMENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS IN THE US OR LACK THEREOF GIVEN KIND OF THE BIG FARMER SUPPORT PAYMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SERIOUS BOTH THIS YEAR AND LAST THANKS ADAM WELCOME UH YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAINLY A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UH CROP PLACES AND HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE IMPORTS BUT AS YOU SAY YOU KNOW SUPPORT PAYMENTS FROM GOVERNMENTS AND WHATNOT HAVE DONE A LOT TO KEEP FARMERS' INCOME AT LEAST STABLE UM AND YES WHILE WE'RE PUSHING UM PHOSPHATE AND POTASH PRICES PROBABLY NOT POTASH MUCH BUT CERTAINLY PHOSPHATES A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THAT UM RATIO TWO THINGS ON THIS I'D SAY IS FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT DECEMBER 21 PRICES AND IF YOU LOOK AT DECEMBER OF 21 PRICES I THINK WE UM I THINK WE'D BE LOOKING AT WHAT 360 AND NINE 360 FOR CORN AND NINE BUCKS FOR FOR UM BEING SO THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO SEE SOME REASONABLE PRICES ON THERE UM IF THEY SOLD FORWARD INTO THAT MARKET SO THERE'D BE INCENTIVE TO GET A GOOD CROP AND AND USE THE FERTILIZER BUT IN TERMS OF THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO I'D SAY YOU COULD EASILY GO A STANDARD DEVIATION ABOVE THAT RATIO AND NOT HAVE IT MATERIALLY AFFECT DEMAND THANK YOU NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM THE LINE OF STEVE BARNES WITH BANK OF AMERICA YOUR LINE IS OPEN YEAH JUST WONDERING IF HERE WHETHER OR NOT YOU SAW ANY IMPACT ON PHOSPHATE IMPORTS DURING DURING THE MONTH OF JULY FOLLOWING THE COUNTERVAILING DUTY UM PETITION AND JUST UH ASK FOR AN UPDATE ON YOUR YOUR UH GYPSUM SALES OUT OF THE EURO GYP STACKS IN BRAZIL ANY ANY UPDATE ON THAT SURE THANKS STEVE UM FIRST OF ALL YEAH IN JULY I BELIEVE THE UM IMPORTS WERE LOWER IN JULY I UM I'D HAVE TO GET AN EXACT NUMBER AND GET SOMEBODY TO GET BACK TO YOU ON ON HOW MUCH THAT WAS DOWN BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING AND WE WE DID TALK TO A LOT OF CUSTOMERS AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS CERTAINLY THE UM THE IMPORTERS WHO WERE IMPORTING EITHER THE OCP OR THE RUSSIAN PRODUCTS I DEFINITELY TOOK A STEP BACK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RISKS MIGHT BE IN TERMS OF UM THEM PICKING UP UH SOME SORT OF UH COUNTERVAILING DUTY RISKS SO UH WE WE DID SEE A STEP BACK IN JULY WHETHER THEY WILL COME BACK INTO THE MARKET IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HOWEVER IS NEW PRODUCTS COMING IN FROM PLACES LIKE UH EGYPT AND AUSTRALIA AND MEXICO SO IT DOES SAY THERE IS SOME SOME CHANGE UH I GOT OUT SOMEBODY TO GIVE ME WHAT WAS THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION THERE STEVE I MISSED THE- I MISSED MY WRITING",

Project hitting a major milestone of connecting the k three shafts to the k one mill we continued to reduce our briquette management costs and we achieved the lowest cash cost per ton of production in over a decade mosey for president had an excellent quarter, hitting both rayon based cost targets and achieving further cost benefits from the weakening rayon market as well as realizing over 80 percent of our targeted full year transformation benefits Fossil fuels drove the cash costs of rock below the target and lower than last year, despite increasing distances from mining to beneficiation. and with all of these efforts, we've reaffirmed our commitment to you to our shareholders, our employees, our customers, and our communities to act responsibly. we announce new, aggressive, broad-based environmental, social, and governance targets. and we will use these targets to drive performance across the business. we are continuing to transform our business. we are continuing to transform our business. we are continuing to transform our business. we are continuing to transform our business. we are continuing to transform our business. we are continuing to transform our business. we are continuing to transform our business. we are continuing to transform our business. we are continuing to transform our business. Form the quarters, accelerating earnings and cash flow clearly reflect our efforts to date and we are driving additional future savings. we expect to deliver another seven hundred million dollars in savings above the twenty nineteen base as we continue to execute our strategy. mosaic is more competitive than ever before and with fertilizer markets improving we have significant earnings leverage to the future. now we'll take your questions I'm going to start with some questions you received on cost adam samuelson from goldman sachs asked in the second quarter, morgan stanley was ahead of its twenty twenty one targets and a number of its key cost kpi's how much incremental opportunities do you see on each key metric to further reduce costs and if so what level of incremental capital spending would be necessary to achieve those outcomes thanks for your question adam as we've said earlier we have New targets that include seven hundred million dollars of additional improvements across the company two hundred million of those coming from our brazil operation and five hundred coming from our north american and administrative some of the areas where we believe we can make big gains as we go forward obviously are in brazil where we continue to improve that business in north america where automation is allowing us to drive efficiencies in both fossil fuels and potash and then of course our k three operation which as we ramp it up will eliminate a lot of costs and improve our drainage management costs so as we look forward we see a lot of opportunities still and importantly in september when we bring our all of this to our analyst day we expect to be able to give you more color and detail on what that's going to look like jock, chris parkinson from credit suisse asked you're clearly comfortably ahead on numerous cost initiatives, including your k three shaft, bryn inflo, phosphate rock cost in the us and brazil and for l'azurde's platform but would you take a step back how are you thinking about your structural cost base in a normalized environment and how much more could actually be done especially in phosphate yeah, thank you, chris it's important to keep in mind These cost improvements certainly are somewhat driven by high utilization. we've had a good quarter where we were able to use our assets fully and we've had some benefits from exchange rate, particularly in brazil but also in canada over the long term though the real differences have been structural and those are going to stay with us and those are going to continue and we're going to continue to improve those so if we look at our major projects which include Estrada k three next gen mining and the brazil transformation those are not temporary differences those are true structural changes that will be delivering value for the long term doc michael piken from cleveland research asked you mentioned that you are on track to exceed your two hundred and twenty five million in non-market growth in twenty twenty which segments are exceeding your expectations and how much higher can this number go for twenty twenty Hello Michael, let me clarify our two hundred and twenty five million dollars were actual items that we spent in nineteen nineteen that we did not expect to repeat in twenty twenty so on those some of the key items the planted city idling that's happened and now is outside of our cost structure our brazilian dams we've completed the work now and that eighty million dollars of cost is now behind us equally the ramp-up of esterhazy, which has gone better than we expected. we now are delivering one million tons a year from the kraft project. so that benefit has already flowed through to us. and then of our fifty million dollars of transformation in brazil, that we're part of that two hundred and twenty five million, we're already at over forty million. so we see that as pretty much complete and ongoing savings will be above and beyond that original two twenty five million. Possible docs a larger number of questions seek a better understanding of our countervailing duties petition stephen gould from morningside chris parkinson from credit twist asked for an update on potential regulatory changes of the u s import duties on morocco and russia's supply and if the outcome is successful in our favor what should they expect in changes to their landed u s cost in other words what the potential outcomes in terms of leveling the playing field thank you, gentlemen. let me start by saying we believe in free and fair trade. however, the reason we filed this petition in the first place was to address imbalances associated with unfair government subsidies on imports and to highlight unequal requirements on environmental standards. we believe our competitors benefit from access to artificially low-cost energy and adequate and proper environmental standards. we also will say that what we have done is put this forward to the department of commerce and the international trade commission. they will judge on the merits and as such determine what level of duties, if any, need to be put in place to create a fair trade situation. and quinn, do you have anything to say? That's right. no, jock, i think you're right. we we certainly are ahead of schedule on the realization of the two hundred and twenty five million dollars in non-market benefit this year. you know, keep in mind that the eighty million dollars that we spent on on dam mediation last year would spread really through the second and fourth quarters. so we realized about thirty six million dollars in benefit in the second quarter and should realize the balance throughout the rest of the year. Dr. John Roberts from ubs would like to know can you review the basis for your phosphate countervailing duty position and have you had any response from customers or competitors thank you john our basis for the petition is clearly laid out in the public documents and i would ask that you go to those also the comments from any of our competitors or customers Other concerned groups is clearly laid out in those public documents. so i would suggest you go there. our position is clearly that the department of commerce and the international trade commission really are the ones that will decide what are the merits of this case. now clearly as we talked to our customers, some are concerned mostly about how they're going to get their supply. we believe that this has opened up new opportunities for us. side competitors to come in and make up some of that supply but in the end i think all people understand why we put it forward and you know we'll have to wait to see what the itc says in terms of its merit doc we received several questions asking about trade flows and implications to other markets specifically adam samuelson and seven others ask over the next six to twelve months how do we think about the net impact of potential trade flow impacts of potential u s. countervailing duties on morocco and russian safflower do you see risk of market share competition rising in other major import markets notably brazil thanks mike and joel let's answer the last question first no we don't think this will impact global supply and demand all we will do is probably change trade flow the current market and resulting pricing is reflective of a Tight market and if anything, the countervailing duties only highlighted to people that this market was tight. so what's causing the tight market? favorable farm economics and lower supply which began to take shape well before we filed the petition. however, it is reasonable to assume that the trade flows will be altered and some product will be shifted to other jurisdictions including new suppliers coming into the us and the moroccan and brazilian markets. russian suppliers focusing on other markets which could be brazil or wherever jonas oscar from burlington asked two more technical questions with respect to the petition, namely if the mozi trade complaint is upheld, will there be a retroactive benefit to mozi and what is the timeline for final decision on the complaint so thank you, jonas. clarify whether duties are applied retrospectively will depend upon the level of imports from these two countries from the filing of the case until the doc preliminary ruling. we expect the case to be finalized in q one twenty twenty one and at that point if there has been excessive imports they will look at assessing a retrospective duty. guy, i'm now going to move on to questions about prospects. Operations ben isaacs from scotland asked on the cash cost of mining rock in florida falling to thirty six dollars per ton from forty dollars year over year how much of that would do to transformational efforts versus favorable geology and how much more wiggle room is there to bring that down and how sustainable are these cost improvements thank you ben clearly our cost improvements are a combination of several factors We've certainly been running our assets at elevated utilization rates and that's helped but our efforts to centralize mining operations, streamline processes and automate have also helped reduce our costs. as previously mentioned, the establishment of a central control center for our mining and collapsing all of our mining operations basically into one large operation which should be begin operation by the end of the year will further enhance cost savings. And as we introduce new management structures, incorporate automation for certain mining functions and accept, accelerate savings from adjustments to transportation, we start to see real long-term improvements in our cost structure. so, pete jubber, from city also asked, with the recent rise of over fifty dollars a ton in dap pricing, have you ramped up your production at the mine and what could be the benefits? a better cost absorption from higher times in the third quarter. thanks for the question, pj. high utilization rates have a beneficial impact. but that's really only part of the story. as we've mentioned, but i will say that as we look at two three going forward, we can expect both tonnage, high tonnage and high utilization rates to continue. so we do expect to see better costs throughout the rest of the year both structurally and because of cost savings. high utilization. we also have a question from adam samuelson from goldman sachs. the specialty percentage rose to forty eight percent of shipments and marked a new quarterly high in profits. coincident with micro-electronic shipments to ferrilux being substantially above recent quarters. is this sustainable? why or why not? thank you adam. the sales of micro-essentials and aspire hit record highs and kemag came in. Close to the record in quarter two to twenty twenty among these growths micronutrient shipments to brazil has been a major driver now we believe that the growth of micronutrient shipments will continue over the next quarter driven by mozambique for livestock and also north america i have to re-emphasize the value that micronutrient brings to the growers is showing positive returns for them on their investments so these are bringing real value to the growers and to our customers the distributors. so we do believe that as more people start using micro-essentials this is very sustainable and they're going to see the benefit and they're going to keep using that product. jack three analysts submitted multi-part questions related to our potash operations. so first, kirk parsons asked the demand environment in potash appears to be modestly improving while spot prices are well off their first half low. can you talk about your thought process? FOR THE SECOND HALF OF TWENTY ONE OPERATING RATE ASSUMPTIONS AND HOW THAT MAY DRIVE CHANGES IN YOUR MINE METHOD THANKS CHRIS AS YOU KNOW WE'VE ACCELERATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF K THREE AND THIS HAS AN OBVIOUS IMPACT ON COSTS SO BOTH NOW WITH DECLINING BRINE MANAGEMENT SPENDING AND IN THE FUTURE AS THE MINE RAMPS UP BEYOND K THREE WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG RESULTS FROM BELL PLANE WHICH RECORDED ITS LOWEST COST POSITION IN MINE METHOD More than a decade as we move forward, we're going to take advantage of owning two of only seven mines in the world with annual production capacity of over three million tons and with some of the lowest costs in the industry so as we look to the future, we intend to optimize the production coming from k three and from our belpah operation and only see running higher cost mines like colombia if the market really requires it in the future. Eh? Another question comes to you from jonas oxgard of burne-jones. In potter, you lowered your cost per ton a fair bit, but how much of that was simply spreading fixed costs over a twenty percent larger volume? On a fixed volume basis, what would your cost reduction be? Good question, jonas. There is no question that the larger volume helped spread out our costs. However, we believe there are structural changes that are fundamentally changing our costs. Our costs over the long term we think one area of clear savings is the accelerated reduction of brine management costs as we shift to k three k one underground mining will be completed this year brine management accounted for eight dollars a ton in k two and that will continue to decline as we move into twenty twenty one so as you can see a lot of our cost reduction is actually structural and should be with us for the long term Jack p jewelcar from city asks what kind of savings do you expect from sending k three podashor to the k one mill and what is the updated timeline now to shut down k one and k two thank you pj we expect to be sending podashor to k one and actually be shutting down our k one shafts from a production perspective early in twenty twenty one that will start meaning we're only going to be operating Two shafts, and then by the end of twenty twenty two, two only operating the one big k three shaft. at that point, the project will be complete, will eliminate brine inflow and that really will be the end of our k one and k two plan mine production perspective now, fred andrews is interested in how he should think about our potash shipments in the second half of this year, given how strong shipments were in second quarter Also, can we remind him of the accounting for the chinese contract shipments that were already in a bonded warehouse prior to contract agreement? thank you, vincent. yes, we did have strong shipments in quarter one and if i refer to our discussions with campa pharma, i think they have a fairly full order book for q three and even going well into q four. so i believe the shipments internationally will be strong in the second half and domestically. Statistically, we're expecting a good fall in north america. so we're expecting strong shipments there as well. so from our perspective, a second half is looking pretty strong from a podest perspective. in terms of the um shipments in the first half, i'd just like to throw it over to clint to explain a little bit about our china shipments to bonded warehouse that we re-recked in the first half of the year. clint, can you discuss that? sure, john. and good morning, vince. So, to start with, on a consolidated basis, we don't recognize revenue until that product is sold to a third party. However, we do, on a segment level basis, we do recognize a revenue when campbelltown sells product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell product to our distribution business in china and when they sell That product to our distribution business in china the segment recognized revenue but that was based on an estimate of pricing since the contract had not been completed once the contract was completed and the price for that transaction was set that gave rise to the adjustment but again that's an adjustment on a potash segment only because we won't recognize revenue on that product on a consolidated basis until it's finally completed Sold to a third party. thanks for that clarification, quinn. chuck, i'm now going to move on to questions about mozzarella for lasagna. we have four analysts including john roberts from ubs and mark connolly from stevens asking similar questions about the timing of volumes in bahrain. brazilian farmers are having an outstanding year so far and have been widely reported to be buying inputs well ahead of last year's schedule. how much do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you Has been borrowed from the third quarter and are we likely to see an offsetting reduction in third quarter margins to reflect those lower volumes next quarter and specifically within the quarter april and may were significantly higher than the prior year months while june appeared to be much closer to a year ago is that just timing or are the trends decelerating into july great question the strong volumes in the first half of the year did reflect some forward input purchases As a result of generally favourable farm economics but year over year demand is expected to be up slightly to thirty seven million tonne and in that figure we believe we are beginning to take market share as farmers gravitate towards higher analysis products and high value products such as our micro essential Between volume-driven cost improvement and operational structural cost change that should repeat with normal volumes thank you, mark let me start by saying last year's operations were negatively impacted by the change in regulations that required us to shut down a couple of operations for dam improvements that reduced volume and impacted our raw materials access this year we're we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we're benefiting from that we running at full operations rates and this also has allowed us to have more access to our own rock supply so overall that has helped a little bit so about a third of those costs are probably volume related the others are improvements to our freight our inventory management our overall planning and of course structural changes to our cost structures i think overall though we're seeing a long-term Changes to how the brazil business is running and we're starting to see full benefit of the three hundred and thirty million dollars or so of integration benefit that we announced at the end of last year. josh p juvabharat has a question about currency. the brazilian real, british pound, to us dollar was down significantly every year over year in the second quarter of twenty twenty how did that volatility impact you and what specifically was the impact in the quarter? thanks, pj. i'd like to talk about two aspects of the brazilian rio grande that really has changed things and the first of those, of course, is the impact on farmer economics. i think that is actually the bigger improvement their ability to buy fertilizers and the continuous growth of the brazilian agriculture segment is largely driven by great economics for the farmer. and so That's the first place we want to talk about where the brazilian ria has helped us. in terms of our cost performance, you will see that we tend to put our targets in ria base. so that allows us to understand what's the real underlying improvement. obviously, there was some positive impact. i think we saw definite improvements in our overall cost because of the ria. but i would say we focus more on what is ria. The reia based cost because that tells us whether we're really improving the business or just taking advantage of currency in the back you'll notice sorry pj i'd also like to point out that if you look at the back of our stuff you'll see basically our sensitivities and a one a ten cent move in the reia amounts to about twenty million dollars a year unhedged so if we think about us as being about fifty percent hedged so if we think about us as being about fifty percent hedged so if we think about us as being about fifty percent hedged so if we think about us as being about fifty percent hedged so if we think about us as being about fifty percent hedged so if we think about us as being about fifty percent hedged so if we think about us as being about fifty percent hedged so if we think It's fairly easy to do the reconciliation to last year's ria cost. we have another question from ben isaacson with respect to mozilla for laptops. mozilla for laptops sales volumes have been notably high year over year. can you walk us through the strategic strength of this business and how it relates to your mix between commodities and micro-essential tuns? thanks, ben. You know, again, i've said this before, but i'll repeat, you know, the volume growth really was a result of improvement in farm economics in brazil the strengthening of the us dollar versus the real excellent barter ratios and anticipation of a strong summer crop demand so both both commodity and performance products have shown robust increases in quarter two of twenty twenty versus a year ago dr. chris parkinson asked for a covid nineteen update. his question is brazil is in the midst of a fairly complex covid nineteen outbreak which has periodically been affecting the port and logistics system can you give us an update on the demand environment as well as any logistical headwinds you perceive during the peak fertilizer application season thanks, chris look, let's start from our own operations in brazil. and, of course, we've had a number of cases because of the high level of community transmission. we have not been impacted on our operations to this point. and we've instituted a number of procedures to make sure we mitigate the spread. just sorry. and then from an overall country logistics perspective, we believe that in general we have been unaffected by Covid. now, obviously, there's going to be local places where that impacts us, but in general, we've been able to work around that and kept the product moving to the end customer. and from a demand perspective, despite covid, we've continued to see strong demand, again, driven by favorable farm economics, and we have got our product to our customers with relatively little impact. the last question we received on the zillow petaluma comes from joel jackson zillow's second quarter growth margin was more than double the results from the prior two years how much of that gain was market conditions versus foreign exchange tailwinds versus share gain in the market versus a pull forward of q three because of covid related logistics concerns Thanks joel i would summarize our results in the second quarter in brazil as a couple of factors. first of all if we looked at the exchange rate it's probably off set almost perfectly the change in pricing so what we see in actual results is almost solely the result of our own actions and the reversal of some of the dam costs that we saw last year Guys, we've received a handful of questions on the balance sheet, primarily focused on uses of free cash flow. john roberts asked what are the capital allocation priorities moving forward and can you please discuss your growth, debt level, dividend, and potential share repurchases? and p j yuvaraj, beyond paying down some debt, what could be uses of cash, especially with improved free cash flow in the second half of twenty twenty would buybacks be the approved use? Pass over the countervailing duty decision prevent you from buying back stock john can you talk about capital priorities to address both of these questions yeah thank you gentlemen our capital priorities are unchanged and they continue to be what we've said in the past our first priority is to maintain the business next priority is to maintain investment grade metrics and to do that You know, we have to continue our normal capital plan as we've had we expect to lower debt by about a billion dollars over the next few years doing so when our bonds come due in the next couple of years and then continue some of the key projects like the esther hazey acceleration, k three acceleration and then what we have after that returning capital to shareholders all Releases are dependent on future cash flow generation and capital allocation will not be impacted in any way by the countervailing duties. we've also had a couple of questions from a bioside analyst and they include can you describe what's included in the six hundred ten million of short-term debt that you indicated will be paid in twenty twenty and does mosaic still plan to keep about a billion dollar Dollar cash balance can pay down its two twenty one maturity thanks for the question at the start of this year we did increase our cash balance to a billion dollars by first of all taking out some money from our revolver and executing on some of our inventory financing debt since that time we've paid down the revolver and we will continue to pay down the rest of the six billion One hundred million dollars in short-term debt throughout the rest of this year before we move on to market-related questions, ben isaacson asked about our tax rate outlook why is your effective tax rate expected to be in the mid to high fifties and how should we think about this rate under a trump or biden presidency thank you, ben let me start by saying the first part of this is and the reason for the tax rate being higher is our income mix between our three jurisdictions canada brazil and the u s the details of that i'm going to actually hand it over to kent to explain why the negative earnings in the u s will create a higher tax rate overall mix phenomenon for us, if you recall the tax rate is based on gap results by jurisdiction. and when you look at the united states, not only is our fossil fuel business incorporated into that, but also our corporate dna, our interest expense, and so forth. so there are times when that pretax income in the us turns negative, and that can begin to skew the rate. some of the foreign currency moves that we've seen and how it affects our mark-to-market and some of the notable items that that we have on our schedule that begins to skew it and then you know as you've seen brazil improve this year that's our highest rate tax jurisdiction so so that begins to influence that rate as well so really the combination of all of those things that resulting in an unusually high tax rate for this year and then i'd add two things one on a on a A longer-term basis we would expect that effective tax rate to be somewhere in the mid to high twenties. but then i would also call to your attention that our cash tax rates and payments are much different than that. in fact, this year we expect to end up with a small cash tax refund so very different than the effective tax rate in our financial statements. Now let's move on to market-related questions mike pike asked if you could comment on our summer fill programs in the u s and where we see downstream inventories in the u s at this point thank you michael i think we've had fairly successful fill programs in both phosphates and potash here in the u s recent discussions that we've had with our customers suggest They're probably in the range of sixty percent full for the fall season. so there will be increased buying towards the fall season but for the most part our customers are in reasonably healthy shape going into that fall. volumes higher in the third quarter and any expectations for volumes for the rest of the year? thanks, steve. i would characterize q3 as largely having our order books full for both phosphate and potash. and so it'll be a matter of delivery and revenue recognition that will determine where we are for quarter three. but we expect a reasonably good fall in the u s. and global markets are running well. so both phosphates and potash we expect relatively normal two three volumes in both and then for the rest of the year we should also see a good stable volume josh mark connelly would like insight into grain and oilseed prices in particular how important are mosaic's earnings and outlook are higher grain and oilseed prices if the current price of corn is sustained through twenty twenty and soybeans stay at or near their current prices do you think there is any material room for higher pk prices in the market thank you mark clearly oilseed and grain prices do have implications for us but in general the farmers tend to work a lot more on their needs to plant so what's a lot more important to us is planting intentions number of acres planted and remember also that grain and oilseed are just a few of the products that we fertilize so it really depends On what does the whole global market look like and what is the demand for pnk and what is the supply balance there as opposed to something on the grain and oilseed it has an indirect impact but i would say no direct impact on our pricing vincent andrews from morgan stanley wants to know about our market forecast given that the last ten years of pnk shipments show some pattern of lumpiness pottash more than potash why? not forecasting lumpiness going forward rather than just cagers thanks, vince. we tend to forecast on annual growth simply because some of the other factors that go into the lumpiness of our business are impossible to forecast. and those are really inventory movements globally and of course, weather. you saw in twenty nineteen the weather impacts in the u s. U S made a fundamental difference to the growth rate of both phosphate and potash on a global scale. so we really have to look at it on averages but recognize that there will be lumpiness as we go forward. Fell by sixteen dollars to three hundred and fourteen dollars per ton. yet, mosaic's average finished product selling price fell by almost three times that amount or by forty four dollars to three oh eight from three fifty two why how could we think this so how should we think about this relationship going forward thanks, ben the answer here is simply that the average selling price in portland, oregon, is based on all the components we sell, including urea and potash. In the blends, both of which are down significantly. so when you look at that relationship going forward, you have to take into account all three products that could be in our blends that we sell. ben also asked, staff shipping margins have started to improve in july after remaining largely flat throughout the second quarter. are you seeing this flow through to the phased margins? thank you, ben. again. that stripping margin is we track that because that really is what do we get after the cost of raw materials and transport as as revenue so of course this flows directly into our margins an improvement in stripping margin that really is almost directly related to our overall profitability To know, or what does noah see is the equilibrium prices of u. s. nola d. a. p. and maps versus key offshore benchmarks thank you, adam all i can really say there is if you look at it historically, other than the last say three years, where there has been a real increase in imports we have seen nola prices being similar to To other global prices. and i would expect that under a more fair trade market, that's what you would see, is you would see the nola price being equal to what the prices is in other markets adjusted for the transport cost and that's exactly what we expect will happen after a countervailing duty case if they do re-adjust that market. Jack steedburn would like more insight into our global phosphate demand outlook and its relationship to inventory swings specifically what is your estimate of underlying global consumption of phosphate in twenty nineteen and was it below the shipments for seventy one million tons did it reflect channel inventory builds thank you steve if we look at twenty nineteen there was no question that there was a build up of global inventory particularly in the u.s. i mean, in the u.s. there was a poor season and the imports in particular kept coming in we shut down our louisiana operation for a number of months last year and and still the inventory build in the u.s. was very high likewise the brazilian inventory build was very high likewise the inventory build in the u.s. was very high likewise the brazilian inventory build was very high likewise the inventory build in the u.s. was very high likewise the brazilian inventory build was very high likewise the inventory build in the u.s. was very high likewise the brazilian inventory build was very high likewise the inventory build in the u.s. was very high likewise the brazilian invent was probably slightly above normal coming into this year for maybe some of the same reasons but what i will say is in the first and second quarter of this year we have largely cleared out all of that inventory and probably have moved from an area of high inventory to very low inventory in phosphates as we move into the third quarter of this year In a related question, he also asked are normalized inventory levels the reason for the increased phosphate shipping forecast in twenty twenty one thanks steve yeah, in terms of twenty twenty one what we really see is the inventory levels should be pretty much leveled off and we expect normal growth in the market as per any other year so that two percent type annual growth in twenty twenty one Vincent andrews would like our opinion on farmer economics. he asks given the recent run-up in dap prices, are you all concerned about us farmers deferring all applications? thanks, vincent. look, our experience has been, and if you look even at this spring with the covid uncertainty that farmers will put fertilizer on their fields according to their needs. and you know, frankly, today with precision agriculture they're more likely to put the right amount of fertilizers on every year. so you know, and fosfate prices, frankly, also are a very small piece of the overall cost of running a farm. so i don't believe that most farmers will look at fosfate. Pricing and have it change their application. but i'd also highlight that fertilizer prices are still very affordable when you look at where grain and oilseed prices are. so as with most fall seasons we would expect that weather will be the main arbitrator of demand and you know with expecting an early crop maturity this year we expect we should have a good fall. Joshua, we have three questions related to China and Thailand. First, Dustin Anderson asks, what do you anticipate would be the Chinese DAP exports in the second half of twenty twenty, and what second-half twenty twenty DAP price does that assume? If the DAP prices are higher or lower than your assumption, what would happen to Chinese exports? The first half of the year were lower by about eight hundred thousand tons from last year. our base forecast calls for chinese exports to end the year about six hundred thousand tons lower. in other words, we expect that international pricing is a little higher. we will send a few extra tons coming out of china in the second half. and if prices are higher than our expectations there might be a little bit more upside. but we don't see significant upside. the reason for this is domestic demand is coming in fairly strong as we move into fall and i think the big issue there will be export availability limitations. now obviously if our prices are lower than expectations you know the volumes could be even lower than what they are now. what is the status and outlook for reduced phosphate production at specific facilities in china and tanzania? and do you expect lower exports over the next several years? well, let me hit china first. you know, there's been a well-known shift towards shutting down some of the higher polluting plants, particularly along the yangtze river. and we've seen some of that. That have resulted in production declines in the first half of the year in terms of chinese export volume over the next years we maintain that chinese exports will trend lower and will establish a new normal i mean we've now seen what we think is the bottoming out of chinese domestic demand and we're seeing a lowering of production so with that will have to come a lowering of exports as they meet domestic demand and we're seeing a lowering of production so with that will have to come a lowering of exports as they meet domestic demand and we're seeing a lowering of production so with that will have to come a lowering of exports as they meet domestic demand and we're seeing a lowering of production so with that will have to come a lowering of exports as they meet domestic demand and we're seeing a lowering of production so with that will have to come For tunisia it would appear that expectations for a plant research and resurgence of production in in twenty twenty were somewhat overstated but it's also important to put tunisia in context they have produced an average of about seven hundred and fifty thousand tons of nap and tsp over the last five years current protests will certainly lead to the shuttering of their rock production this has plagued them for over a decade so which means we would expect them to stay about the same ramp rate as we go Forward as well josh the last section of questions relates to podash global markets steve bernard and seth gouldstein asked about the impact of palm oil demand on podash what is the typical lag between movements in palm oil prices and changes in podash demand in south east asia and has the rebound in palm oil prices resulted in increased podash demand in south east asia Thank you, gentlemen. The palm oil demand is important for potash. And what we have seen recently is an improvement in palm oil prices. And we know that for production reasons, they will be adding potash to their palm oil plantations. So we see that as a fairly direct relationship. I wouldn't say we see increased demand, but we see that as a fairly direct relationship. Demand that is getting back to its normal levels. in terms of a longer term, export demand and domestic demand for biodiesel is helping in terms of optimism for recovery. so, all of these things mean that we should see a better demand for palm oil in the southeast asia region, particularly malaysia and indonesia. global product inventory stands in the various regions, particularly in china. thank you, gentlemen. if we look at china, there's there's sort of a bifurcation of of inventory. we know there's about three and a half million tons at the port, but we believe there's relatively low inventories as we move inland. and so as we're now seeing a strong demand for n p k's in the dairy industry, Domestic market we do expect with the movements out of the port to those n p k plans we will start bringing down inventory levels assuming that the arrivals are about at normal levels compared to last year mark connolly and steve bern are both interested in potash demand group what is driving the acceleration in potash demand in your podcast? Other specific geographies thanks i wouldn't say we're actually forecasting an acceleration of potash demand. our potash demand growth from a long-term trend is staying fairly steady at what we believe to be around three percent. and if you take twenty nineteen out of it i think we still stay just on that trend If demand ends up toward the high end of your range do you see increased supply balance in the market or would you expect the market to tighten? well, i guess this requires two things. one, the success of production ramp ups on the new projects, particularly i guess yurukem's, valgorga and yusolski, but given the delays we've seen in recent years on these ramp ups, It would seem that the market should tighten, actually, if demand comes in at the high end of our expectation. the last related question, also, what is the bull case for potash pricing over a three to five year period? thanks. there's a number of factors that could create a bull run in potash prices and the first i've already mentioned which is slower ramp up of the Projects, particularly the ones in russia and belorussia but what we would really expect is probably a higher utilization rate of the north american assets over the next say three to five years and a more modest rise in prices that would suggest prices appreciate slightly to where they were maybe in twenty eighteen and utilization of assets goes up at the same time another output related question from adam samuelson and dan iverson they're both asking about the disconnect between pricing trends between brazilian m o p that rallied off loads in the second quarter versus u s and southeast asian m o p prices that have continued to leak lower are strong brazilian economics enough to offset this weakness in other regions thanks brazilian farm economics are really outstanding present, which is certainly helping to underpin pricing in that market. and we expect that to continue for the u s. and southeast asian markets. i think it's important that remember that this is a seasonally slow period for potash demand and that will impact prices. i'd also like to highlight that our summer fill program was extremely well received and it is typical of commodity markets to necessarily see first a rebound in demand and then prices following after that. We have now completed our three submitted questions and so now i would like to do is open it up to the audience for live q and a operator thank you as a reminder to ask a question you will need to press star one on your telephone keypad to draw a question please press the pound key we will limit the question to one per participant to allow the other's questions to be Addressed thank you please stand by while we compile the gene regulator first question comes from the line of adam sampson from goldman sachs your line is open yes thanks good morning everyone so i guess i wanted to follow up on the affordability question jacob on phosphates and on your own kind of affordability question the metric that you published were now above long-term average and just trying to think about where where you would see an upper limit to that and especially if you think about next year and farmer income risks from from government support programs in the us or lack thereof given kind of the big farmer support payments that have been experienced both this year and last year thanks adam welcome you know, There's certainly a relationship between crop prices and how people feel about the imports but as you say, you know, support payments from governments and whatnot have done a lot to keep farmer incomes at least stable and yes, while we're pushing phosphate and potash prices, probably not potash prices much, but certainly phosphate prices a little bit closer to that ratio two things on this side I say is first of all you gotta look at december twenty one prices and if you look at december twenty one prices i think we i i think we'd be looking at what three sixty and nine three sixty for corn and nine bucks for for beans so there they're gonna see some reasonable prices on their if they sold forward into that market so they'd be incentivized to get a good crop and and use the fertilizer In terms of the direct relationship between the two, i'd say you could easily go a standard deviation above that ratio and not have it materially affect demand. Imports during the month of july following the countervailing duty petition and just ask for an update on your gips sales out of your gipsacks in brazil. any, any update on that. sure, thanks. first of all, yeah, in july, i believe imports were lower in july. i'd have to get an exact number, but i believe imports were lower in july. i'd have to get an exact number, but i believe imports were lower in july. i'd have to get an exact number, but i believe imports were lower in july. i'd have to get an exact number, but i believe imports were lower in july. i'd have to get an exact number, but i believe imports were lower in july. i'd have to get an exact number, but i believe imports were lower in jul You know on how much that was down but our understanding and we we did talk to a lot of customers and our understanding is certainly the the importers who were importing either the ocp or the russian products i definitely took a step back to understand what the risks might be in terms of them picking up some sort of counterfeit duty risk so We did see a step back in july, whether they will come back into the market in the next couple of months. i don't know. what we have seen, however, is new products coming in from places like egypt and australia and mexico. so it does say there is some some change. i gotta ask somebody to give me what was the second part of your question there, steve. i missed the missed in my writing"

OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ALIGNING WITH THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVES AND MEDICAL ADVISORIES IN REAL TIME TO THAT END WE'VE ENCOURAGED THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT DIRECTLY PERFORMING CUSTOMER-FACING ESSENTIAL JOBS TO WORK FROM HOME WHEREVER POSSIBLE BUT GIVEN THE MISSION CRITICAL WORK WE DO AT GE NOT EVERYONE CAN STAY HOME I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR EMPLOYEES OUT IN THE FIELD AND IN OUR FACTORIES FOR THEIR UNWAVERING DEDICATION AS THEY CONTINUE TO DELIVER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS SUPPORTING ESSENTIAL SERVICES LIKE HOSPITALS POWER GENERATION AIRLINES AND NATIONAL DEFENSE WE'RE ENSURING THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB SAFELY THIS INCLUDES TEMPERATURE SCREENINGS FACE COVERINGS AND GLOVES AS NECESSARY AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING ALL KEEPING WITH NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL GUIDELINES I'M ALSO INSPIRED BY THE SUPPORT THAT OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE SHOWN EACH OTHER WE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED AN EMPLOYEE RELIEF FUND AND MORE THAN 75 SENIOR LEADERS ACROSS GE HAVE CONTRIBUTED PORTIONS OF THEIR SALARY TO SUPPORT THOSE AFFECTED BY THIS CRISIS OUR SECOND PRIORITY IS CONTINUING TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS IN HEALTHCARE WE'RE RAMPING PRODUCTION OF CRITICAL MEDICAL EQUIPMENT USED TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS INCLUDING RESPIRATORY CT MONITORING SOLUTIONS X-RAY ANESTHESIA AND POINT OF CARE ULTRASOUND PRODUCT LINES ALREADY OUR TEAM HAS DOUBLED PRODUCTION OF VENTILATORS AND PLANS TO DOUBLE AGAIN BY THE END OF JUNE HEALTHCARE'S DIGITAL AND AI SOLUTIONS ARE HELPING HOSPITALS REMOTELY MONITOR MULTIPLE PATIENTS AT ONCE AND AUTOMATE ROAD TASKS SO CLINICIANS CAN SPEND MORE OF THEIR PRECIOUS TIME FOCUSED ON LIFE-SAVING WORK ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES WE'RE IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS SUPPLIERS AND GOVERNMENTS TO MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY WITHOUT DISRUPTION OUR THIRD PRIORITY IS PRESERVING OUR STRENGTH FIRST AND FOREMOST SOUND LIQUIDITY IS CRUCIAL AND SOLIDIFYING OUR BALANCE SHEET REMAINS A KEY FOCUS WITH THE RECENT CLOSING OF THE BIOPHARMA TRANSACTION WE RECEIVED $20 BILLION OF NET PROCEEDS THIS PROVIDES GE WITH OPTIONALITY T-TO PROTECT OUR COMPANY AND REMAIN FLEXIBLE AND IMPORTANTLY WE RETAINED A $17 BILLION LEADING HEALTHCARE BUSINESS AT THE CENTER OF AN ECOSYSTEM STRIVING FOR PRECISION HEALTH PRESERVING OUR STRENGTH IN A TIME LIKE THIS ALSO REQUIRES A DIFFERENT OPERATING MODEL HERE I DRAW ON MY EXPERIENCES AS CEO MANAGING THROUGH NINE ELEVEN AND THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS THERE ARE THREE STEPS IN THIS MODEL EMBRACE REALITY REDEFINE WINNING AND EXECUTE THE PLAN EASY TO SAY HARD TO DO STARTING WITH EMBRACE REALITY THIS IS NECESSARY IN A TIME LIKE THIS WHEN SO MUCH HAS CHANGED AND REMAINS UNCERTAIN FOR US IT MEANS RECOGNIZING THAT WE'RE FACING SIGNIFICANT HEADWINDS IN AVIATION AND WE MAY BE FOR AWHILE WE WISH IT WERE OTHERWISE BUT THAT'S NOT OUR REALITY NEXT REDEFINE WINNING WE CAME INTO 2020 WITH A PLAN TO DEFINE WINNING AS PROFITABLE GROWTH MARGIN EXPANSION AND CASH GENERATION NOW WE NEED TO ADJUST TO THE ALTERED ENVIRONMENT TO FOCUS AND INSPIRE OUR TEAM LET ME SHARE SOME WAYS WE'RE DOING THIS WHILE SAFETY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TOP PRIORITY FOR GE COVID-19 HAS RESHAPED OUR SAFETY AGENDA IN TERMS OF OUR FINANCIAL PRIORITIES IMPROVING OUR CASH GENERATION AND DECREMENTAL MARGINS IN THE SECOND HALF ARE KEY FOCUS AREAS AND IN HEALTHCARE WE CLEARLY DIDN'T COME INTO THE YEAR EXPECTING TO INCREASE OUR VENTILATOR PRODUCTION FOURFOLD BUT WE WILL AND FINALLY EXECUTE THE PLAN WE'RE MOVING WITH SPEED DISCIPLINE AND INTENSITY TO IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE IT'S ALREADY MORE THAN TWO BILLION OF COST ACTIONS AND MORE THAN THREE BILLION OF CASH ACTIONS AND THIS IS WHERE LEAN IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FROM DAILY MANAGEMENT TO TRADITIONAL KANBAN SYSTEMS WHICH HELP RESET INVENTORY LEVELS TO DO PROBLEM SOLVING TOOLS WE'RE ROLLING OUT ACROSS GE LET ME SHARE A RECENT EXAMPLE FROM GAS POWER IN OUR GREENVILLE FACILITY THE TEAM USE LEAN TO CUT THE DISTANCE THAT A SINGLE PART TRAVELS DURING PRODUCTION FROM THREE MILES YES THREE MILES TO A MERE 165 FEET SLASHING THE TIME IT TOOK TO MAKE THAT PART BY 42% THESE ARE THE SORT OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES THAT ARE MORE ESSENTIAL THAN EVER IN THIS ENVIRONMENT SO THAT'S OUR APPROACH HERE WE'RE FACING THE PANDEMIC HEAD-ON WHILE CONTINUING TO EXECUTE OUR LONGTERM STRATEGY FOR GE MOVING TO SLIDE THREE YOU'LL FIND A SNAPSHOT OF OUR FIRST QUARTER RESULTS AND CAROLINA WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH THIS IN DETAIL BUT FIRST A FEW TOP LINE THOUGHTS AS I NOTED WE ENTERED THE YEAR WITH MOMENTUM HOWEVER AS COVID-19 CONTINUED TO SPREAD GLOBALLY AND I'M NOT GOING TO SUGAR COAT THIS WE GOT HIT HARD IN SOME OF OUR HIGHEST MARGIN PARTS OF OUR BEST PERFORMING BUSINESSES THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE AT AVIATION SERVICES WHERE COVID-19 COSTS ARE RAPID DECLINE IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION DEMAND AND EVEN ESSENTIAL TRAVEL BECAME DIFFICULT IN THE SECOND HALF OF MARCH A SIMILAR SITUATION ALSO TRANSPIRED AT POWER SERVICES WHERE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS CAUSED BY COVID-19 IMPACTED OUR FIELD PERSONNEL AND ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES WE STARTED TO SEE SOME PROJECT FULFILLMENT AND EXECUTION ISSUES AT THE SAME TIME HEALTHCARE PERFORMED WELL DUE TO URGENT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS USED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19 TAKING A STEP BACK ABOUT 80% OF OUR ROUGHLY $100 BILLION BACKLOG IS IN SERVICES WHICH HAVE A LONG TIME HORIZON AND WHILE SERVICES HAVE BEEN HURT IN THE NEAR TERM THOSE CAPABILITIES REMAIN ONE OF OUR GREATEST STRENGTHS THEY KEEP US CLOSE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITH DEEP STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS ESPECIALLY THROUGH PERIODS OF VOLATILITY SO IN THE SPIRIT EMBRACING REALITY LET ME FRAME FOR YOU WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW AT A HIGH LEVEL AND THEN I'LL DO A DEEPER DIVE AFTER CAROLINA REVIEWS THE FIRST QUARTER IN AVIATION AND AT GECAS AIRLINES ARE CONSERVING CASH NOT FLYING THE PLANES THEY HAVE LIMITING MAINTENANCE SPARE SPEND WHERE THEY CAN AND ALL THE WHILE DEFERRING ORDERS IN MANY PLACES NO ONE CAN PREDICT WHEN AND HOW LEISURE AND BUSINESS TRAVEL WILL RESUME BUT THE REALITY IS LIKELY IT'S NOT SOON SO WE'RE REDEFINING WINNING FOR MARGIN EXPANSION IN 2020 TO IMPROVING OUR DETRIMENTAL MARGINS THIS YEAR WHICH RE- REQUIRES WE AGGRESSIVELY ADJUST OUR COST STRUCTURE THAT'S WHAT WINNING LOOKS LIKE FOR AVIATION AND THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO BE CLEAR WE'LL GET BACK TO TARGETING THOSE 20% OPERATING MARGINS POST PANDEMIC IN HEALTHCARE WE'VE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE COMBATING COVID-19 SINCE THE EARLY DAYS IN WUHAN THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR MISSION WHILE WE'VE SEEN DEMAND SURGE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS OTHER PRODUCTS INCLUDING THOSE IN OUR HIGH MARGIN PHARMACEUTICAL DIAGNOSTICS BUSINESS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS MULTIPLE PROCEDURES ARE DEFERRED HEALTHCARE IS LIKELY TO REBOUND FASTER THAN AVIATION BUT WE'RE STILL FAST TRACKING ADDITIONAL COST OUT ACTIONS TARGETING AN INCREMENTAL $700 MILLION SINCE KIERAN AND THE TEAM SPOKE WITH YOU IN DECEMBER IN POWER AND RENEWABLE ENERGY THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 HAS BEEN MORE LIMITED TO DATE SPECIFICALLY AT POWER WE'RE EXPERIENCING OUTAGE DELAYS AND RESTRICTIONS AND FIELD SERVICE TRAVEL AND WE'RE MONITORING NEW UNIT ORDERS AND SERVICES TO OFFSET THIS WE'RE FURTHER RIGHTSIZING THE COST STRUCTURE AND IN POWER WE ALREADY REDUCE HEAD COUNT BY 700 IN THE FIRST QUARTER NOW CLEARLY ACROSS GE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LARGE VARIABLES THAT ARE UNKNOWN AT THIS POINT INCLUDING THE FULL DURATION MAGNITUDE AND PACE OF REC- RECOVERY ACROSS OUR END MARKETS OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAINS WE'RE ALSO MONITORING HOW THE RESULTING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WILL IMPACT PENSION OBLIGATIONS AND OUR RUN-OFF INSURANCE BUSINESS SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WE DO KNOW THE SECOND QUARTER WILL BE THE FIRST FULL QUARTER WITH PRESSURE FROM COVID-19 AND WE EXPECT THAT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL DECLINE SEQUENTIALLY BEFORE THEY IMPROVE LATER THIS YEAR THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGING TIMES AHEAD BUT THIS TOO SHALL PASS I'M CONFIDENT THE UNDERLYING RESET WE TOOK OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS TO FOCUS GE'S PORTFOLIO AND INSTILL A GREATER FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS AND LEAN GIVE US A RUNNING START FOR WHAT WE FACE TODAY MOREOVER I SEE IN OUR RESPONSE TO COVID-19 SIGNS OF HOW WE'RE MOVING FASTER TO CHANGE GE FOR THE GOOD MORE LEAN WORK TO HELP REDUCE INVENTORIES IN THE FACE OF DEMAND CHALLENGES IN AVIATION TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS SPURRING ON THE USE OF REMOTE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO COMPLETE FIELD WORK AND RENEWABLES AND MORE CAPITAL DISCIPLINE ACROSS THE BOARD WITH NEW LEADERS ASSIMILATING FASTER AND WITH REAL IMPACT HEALTHCARE COMES TO MIND SO ALL OF THIS IN COMBINATION WITH THE PLANNED ACTIONS WE'LL DISCUSS LATER ARE ACCELERATING OUR TRANSFORMATION OF GE WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO CAROLINA BUT BEFORE I DO LET ME SAY HOW PLEASED I AM TO HAVE HER ON BOARD IN TWO SHORT MONTHS IT'S CLEAR WE SHARE THE SAME PERSPECTIVES OF EMBRACING REALITY AND OPERATIONAL BIAS FOR ACTION AND EXECUTING WITH SPEED THANK YOU LARRY I'M PROUD TO JOIN MY FIRST CALL AS CFO OF GE AND HELP LEAD THIS COMPANY <INAUDIBLE> FORWARD AS YOU'RE NOTED WE'RE OPERATING IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AND WE'RE FOCUSED ON FIRST KEEPING OUR FINANCIAL POSITION STRONG AND SAFE WITH A KEEN EYE ON LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY AS WELL AS CASHFLOW AND CAPITAL DISCIPLINE WHILE GE'S ACTIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAVE PUT US ON A STRONGER FOOTING AHEAD OF THIS SITUATION WE WILL DO MORE SECOND WORKING WITH OUR BUSINESSES TO TAKE THE RIGHT ACTION NOT ONLY TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 BUT TO SERVE CUSTOMERS BETTER OPERATE SMARTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY AND INTEGRATED LEAN MORE HOLISTICALLY WHILE LARRY AND I ARE FOCUSED ON THE NEAR TERM WE'RE ALSO MANAGING FOR THE LONG TERM WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY AT GE ADDING A LEAN CULTURE THAT DELIVERS SUSTAINABLE EARNINGS AND CASHFLOW GENERATION TODAY MY INTENTION IS TO TAKE YOU THROUGH OUR RESULTS IN DETAIL AND PROVIDE CONTEXT THAT HELP YOU SEE WHAT I SEE ACROSS THE BUSINESSES WITH THAT LET'S TURN TO SLIDE FOUR THIS WAS A CHALLENGING QUARTER FOR US AS THE MACRO ENVIRONMENT RAPIDLY DETERIORATED TAKING IT FROM THE TOP FIRST QUARTER ORDERS WERE DOWN 3% ORGANICALLY OR DOWN FOUR EX BIOPHARMA GROWTH IN POWER AND HEALTHCARE WAS EFFECT BY DOUBLE DIGIT DECLINE IN AVIATION AND RENEWABLES BOTH EQUIPMENT AND SERVICE ORDERS WERE DOWN BELOW SINGLE DIGIT I'LL COVER THIS BY BUSINESS SHORTLY INDUSTRIAL REVENUE WAS DOWN 5% ORGANICALLY OR DOWN SIX EX BIO PHARMA IS EQUIPMENT REVENUE FLAT AND SERVICES DOWN 9% BOTH AVIATION AND POWER SERVICES WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN THE QUARTER DUE TO COVID-19 ADJUSTED INDUSTRIAL PROFIT MARGINS WERE DOWN 450 BASIS POINTS ORGANICALLY MOST OF THE <INAUDIBLE> CAME FROM AVIATION OR RENEWABLE WITH AVIATION IMPACT MOSTLY DRIVEN BY COVID-19 NOW LET'S DISCUSS <INAUDIBLE> STARTING AT CONTINUING ETF OF 0.72 CENTS THERE WAS A 0.75 CENTS GAIN PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE 11.5 BILLION AFTER TAX GAIN CAN FROM THE BIOPHARMA SIDE WHICH ALSO INCLUDED ONE CENT OF TAX BENEFIT IN GE CAPITAL THIS WAS PARTIALLY AFFECT BY A 4.6 BILLION AFTER TAX LOSS ON OUR REMAINING BAKER HUGHES WHICH WILL MEASURE AT FAIR VALUE EACH QUARTER ON RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS WE INCURRED 2 CENTS OF CHARGES IS THIS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE REDUCTION OF AVIATION'S US WORKFORCE LASTLY NON-OPERATING PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS WERE 6 CENTS HEADWIND IN THE QUARTER EXCLUDING THIS ITEM ADJUSTED TAX WAS 5 CENTS AS DESCRIBED EARLIER OUR EARNINGS PERFORMANCE WAS MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY COVID-19 AND OTHER MARKET DYNAMICS THIS WAS PRIMARILY IN AVIATION AND GE CAPITAL LINE WITH NEGATIVE MARKS AND IMPAIRMENT IN BOTH GECAS AND INSURANCE AS WELL AS HIGHER CREDIT COSTS WE ESTIMATES THE FIRST QUARTER INDUSTRIAL OPERATING PROFIT IMPACT FROM COVID-19 ROUGHLY 700 MILLION DRIVERS INCLUDED LOWER AFTERMARKET SALES PROJECT DELAYS AND SUPPLY CHAIN CONSTRAINTS THIS IMPACT IS HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED AT THE MARCH OUTLOOK CALL REFLECTING THE RAPID GLOBAL PROGRESSION OF THE PANDEMIC BUT OUR PRIOR FORECAST LARGELY REFLECTED THE SLOWDOWN IN CHINA OUR FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THIS PANDEMIC IS GLOBAL WE'RE TARGETING MORE THAN TWO BILLION OF COST OUT THIS YEAR WHILE THIS MAY NOT AFFECT THE FULL IMPACT WE'RE RAPIDLY ADDRESSING BOTH COSTS AND CASH TO MAKING OUR BUSINESSES MORE AGILE AND CUSTOMER FOCUSED OVER TIME I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY EXPERIENCE THAT AS THIS PROGRAM BUILDS MOMENTUM AND THE COMPANY LEADERS BEGIN TO SEE HOW POWERFUL RESULTS CAN BE THEY TEND TO EXTEND BEYOND THEIR STATED GOALS WITH JUST WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR I'M ENCOURAGED THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME OF THAT SAME EXPERIENCE AT GE MOVING TO CASH AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE FIRST QUARTER IS TYPICALLY LOW FOR OUR FREE CASHFLOW THIS YEAR WE'RE IMPACTED BY OUR USUAL SEASONALITY BUT ALSO COVID-19 ESPECIALLY IN AVIATION INDUSTRIAL FREE CASHFLOW FLOW WAS USE OF 2.2 BILLION ONE BILLION WORSE THAN PRIOR YEAR THAT'S NOTABLY EXCLUDING AVIATION EACH INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS IMPROVED FREE CASHFLOW VERSUS LAST YEAR TURNING TO THE KEY DRIVERS IN THE QUARTER STARTING WITH NET EARNINGS IF YOU EXCLUDE THE BIO PHARMA AND THE MARK TO MARKET ON OUR BAKER HUGHES INVESTMENT INCOME DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION TOTAL 700 MILLION THAT'S DOWN 900 MILLION VERSUS PRIOR YEAR NEXT WORKING CAPITAL NEGATIVE 2.6 BILLION ASA SIGNIFICANT USE OF CASH DOWN 1.1 BILLION LET ME TAKE YOU THROUGH THE MAIN FACTORS FIRST WE HAD THE NET INFLOW IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DRIVEN BY SEASONALLY LOWER VOLUME IN GAS POWER AND RENEWABLES SECOND WE HAD AN OUTFLOW IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DRIVEN BY LOWER VOLUME IN AVIATION AND HIGHER DISBURSEMENTS RELATED TO PRIMARY END MATERIAL BUYS IN RENEWABLES THIRD THE INCREASED INVENTORY TO SUPPORT AN EXPECTED SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER VOLUME RUN IN ONSHORE WIND AND SHOP OUTPUT DECLINED AVIATION FOURTH PROGRESS COLLECTIONS THERE WERE A USE OF CASH AS NEW ORDERS AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS WERE MORE THAN EFFECT BY BURNDOWN OF PRIOR PROGRESS PAYMENTS IN POWER AND RENEWABLES LASTLY WE ALSO SPENT ABOUT 600 MILLION IN GROSS CAPEX WE'RE ON TRACK NOW TO REDUCE 25% OF OUR CAPEX SPEND THIS YEAR FOR CASHFLOW IN TOTAL WE ESTIMATE THE FIRST QUARTER IMPACT FROM COVID-19 OF AROUND ONE BILLION THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WAS HEALTH AND AVIATION AS WE LOOK FORWARD WE EXPECT CONTINUED FREE CASHFLOW PRESSURE RETARGETING MORE THAN THREE BILLION IN CASH ACTION HOWEVER OVER TIME WE KNOW THAT EACH BUSINESS CAN BE A BETTER CASH GENERATOR AS WE IMPROVE EXECUTION MOVING TO SLIDE SIX WE CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR BALANCE SHEET LARGEST <INAUDIBLE> IN THE QUARTER WAS CLOSING BIO PHARMA THE 20 BILLION <INAUDIBLE> WE ENDED THE QUARTER WITH 33.8 BILLION OF

LIQUIDITY BALANCE COVERING 12 MONTHS OF GE DEBT MATURITY THE RISK THAT WE TAKE IN ACTION TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND OUR LIQUIDITY AND PAY DOWN DEBT ON APRIL 17 GE ENTERED INTO A THREE YEAR 15 BILLION SYNDICATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THIS WAS THE PLANNED REFINANCING OF GE'S PRIOR 20 BILLION SYNDICATED REVOLVER CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDING BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WE EXPECT TO HAVE IN THE RANGE OF 20 BILLION IN TOTAL CREDIT LINE ACCESS GOING FORWARD FOLLOWING THE SALE OF BIO PHARMA WE ALSO IMPROVED OUR LIQUIDITY PROFILE IN APRIL WE REDUCED OUR NEAR TERM DEBT MATURITIES BY ISSUING SIX BILLION IN GE DEBT IN APRIL AND SUBSEQUENTLY TENDERING FOR 4.2 BILLION OF DEBT THE PLAN TO USE THE REMAINING 1.8 BILLION OF PROCEEDS TO FURTHER DEBT REDUCTION AND THE COMBINATION OF TRANSACTION WILL THEREFORE BE LEVERAGE NEUTRAL FOLLOWING THIS GE CAP GE INDUSTRIAL HAS NO DEBT MATURITIES IN 2021 1.9 BILLION OF MATURITY IN 2022 AND 900 MILLION IN 2023 AS GE INDUSTRIAL WILL REDUCE DEBT BY APPROXIMATELY SEVEN

WIND VOLUME SEGMENT MARGIN CONTRACTED 210 BASIS POINTS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE SAME ITEMS MENTIONED ABOVE AND DURING RANGE OF EXECUTION ISSUES WITH FIXING AT GRID AND HYDRO MOVING TO SLIDE EIGHT STARTING

MILLION OF EARNINGS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR WHICH EXCLUDES EXCLUDES THE TAX REFORM BENEFIT CONTINUING NET EARNINGS WAS UNFAVORABLE BY 154 MILLION THIS WAS DUE TO NEGATIVE MARK AND IMPAIRMENT AT <INAUDIBLE> AND INSURANCE LOWER GAIN AND LOWER EARNINGS FROM A SMALLER ASSET BASE THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EXCESS INTEREST COSTS AND AS <INAUDIBLE> WE ENDED THE QUARTER WITH 101 BILLION OF ASSETS EXCLUDING LIQUIDITY THIS WAS DOWN 1 BILLION SEQUENTIALLY PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY <INAUDIBLE> DUE TO ASSET SALES DEPRECIATION AND COLLECTION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW VOLUME INSURANCE ASSETS WERE FLAT SEQUENTIALLY UH AS THE DECREASE IN UNREALIZED GAINS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER MARKET RATES WITH EFFECT UH THE ANNUAL ISSUANCE AND THE CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE ASSETS WERE DOWN AS OUR

DRIVEN BY DEATH MAJORITY DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS GENERATED A NET LOSS OF 164 MILLION WHICH WAS UNFAVORABLE VERSUS PRIOR YEAR BY 200 MILLION IF THEY PLAN TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPORT TO GE CAPITAL IN LINE WITH INSURANCE STATUTORY FUNDING NEXT JUST LIKE OUR BUSINESSES CORPORATE NEEDS TO ADJUST OUR NEW REALITIES AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STRUCTURAL ACTION TO RATIONALIZE COSTS AND REDUCE THE SIZE AT CORPORATE LOOKING AT THE QUARTER ADJUSTED CORPORATE COSTS WERE 374 MILLION 8% HIGHER BUT THAT'S PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTER-COMPANY PROFIT ELIMINATION WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BETTER DIGITAL PERFORMANCE FROM CONTINUING COST REDUCTION ACTIONS SANCTIONS AND OPERATIONS WERE 25% LOWER PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GE DIGITAL IMPROVEMENT YOU CAN SEE FROM DIGITAL'S PERFORMANCE THAT THE FOCUS COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS ARE GETTING TRACTION THEY CONTINUE TO RIGHT-SIZE OUR FUNCTION COSTS ACROSS GE AND PUSH MORE ACCOUNTABILITY INTO THE DIVISION LARRY AND I ARE CONDUCTING COSTS AND CASH REVIEWS OF EACH OF THE BUSINESSES WITH FRESH EYES IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT SO YOU CAN EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE MORE TO COME STAY TUNED I HAVE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER IN LEADERSHIP AT MANY DECENTRALIZED COMPANIES FUNDAMENTALLY I BELIEVE COMPANIES OUTPERFORM WHEN THEY HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT EMPOWERS BUSINESSES TO TAKE THE RIGHT ACTIONS QUICKLY THIS TYPE OF STRUCTURE IS CRITICAL TO RESPOND TO SITUATIONS LIKE WE HAVE TODAY WITH COVID-19 BUT ALSO TO BE PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO GROW WE'RE WORKING TOWARD THIS GOAL AND THERE WILL BE MORE TO COME WITH THAT BACK TO YOU LARRY <UNK> THANK YOU THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT COVID-19 IS PUTTING REAL PRESSURE ON OUR BUSINESSES GIVEN THAT SO MUCH HAS CHANGED AND THIS QUARTER WILL BE OUR FIRST FULL QUARTER WITH PRESSURE FROM COVID-19 I'D LIKE TO SPEND SOME TIME HERE DISCUSSING SECOND QUARTER TRENDING BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING THROUGH THE MONTH OF APRIL SO STARTING WITH AVIATION ON SLIDE NINE OF ALL OF OUR INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS THIS BUSINESS IS FEELING THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC MOST SEVERELY THE RAPID CONTRACTION OF AIR TRAVEL HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEMAND AS COMMERCIAL AIRLINES SUSPEND ROUTES AND GROUND LARGE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR FLEETS WE'LL COVER COMMERCIAL SERVICES AND ENGINES ON THE NEXT TWO SLIDES IN DETAIL BUT ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM DEMAND FOR OUR MILITARY BUSINESS REMAINS STRONG TO THAT END WE'VE RE- REBALANCED SOME OF OUR CAPACITY TO MEET THIS INCREASED DEMAND TO OFFSET SOME PRESSURE IN THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS WE'RE TAKING SEVERAL STEPS THAT WHILE PAINFUL PRESERVE OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT AS THE ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE WE'VE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED 500 TO ONE BILLION IN COST IN CASH ACTIONS AND WE'VE NOW INCREASED THIS TARGETING MORE THAN ONE BILLION IN COST ACTIONS AND MORE THAN TWO BILLION IN CASH ACTIONS THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DIFFERENT INITIATIVES SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN COMPLETED OTHERS IN FLIGHT AS WE SPEAK THESE INCLUDE A 10% REDUCTION IN AVIATION'S TOTAL US WORKFORCE AND FURLOUGHS IMPACTING 50% OF ITS US MAINTENANCE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL FACILITIES AND NEW ENGINE MANUFA- WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND POTENTIALLY EXTEND AS REQUIRED WE'RE ALSO FOCUSED ON REDUCING THE DISCRETIONARY AND CAPEX SPEND AND OPTIMIZING WORKING CAPITAL I KNOW AVIATION'S DETRIMENTAL MARGIN THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC IS TOP OF MIND FOR INVESTORS AND KAROLINA TOUCHED ON THE MAIN DYNAMICS IMPACTING OUR MARGINS IN THE QUARTER WHILE WE EXPECT OUR COMMERCIAL REVENUES AND PROFITS WILL CONTINUE TO BE DOWN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT THE COST ACTIONS WE'RE UNDERTAKING WILL IMPROVE DETRIMENTAL MARGINS IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR WHILE THERE ARE MANY UNCERTAINTIES I EXPECT THAT WE WILL EXIT THE YEAR WITH A MUCH LOWER DETRIMENTAL MARGIN THAN WHAT YOU SAW IN THE FIRST QUARTER SO MAKE NO MISTAKE DRIVING IMPROVEMENT HERE IS OUR NUMBER ONE FOCUS AS WE THINK ABOUT THE FULL YEAR WE'RE TRACKING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS CARRIER AND PASSENGER BEHAVIOR DISEASE COUNTERMEASURES AND FREIGHT DEMAND ALL OF WHICH WILL IMPACT AIRCRAFT DEPARTURES AND REVENUE PASSENGER KILOMETERS WHILE WE'RE SEEING AN UNPRECEDENTED DECLINE IN 2020 WE'RE TAKING ACTION AND DAVID AND THE TEAM ARE WORKING PROACTIVELY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS CRISIS SO SPENDING A LITTLE MORE TIME ON COMMERCIAL SERVICES WHICH REPRESENTED $3.3 BILLION OF REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER LET'S GO TO SLIDE 10 AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE DEPARTURES ACROSS THE FULL INDUSTRY WERE STRONG IN THE FIRST QUARTER BEFORE RAPIDLY DECLINING IN MID-MARCH AS WE LOOK AT IT THIS WEEK FOCUSED ON THE GE AND CFM FLEET GLOBAL DEPARTURES ARE DOWN APPROXIMATELY 75% ROUGHLY 60% OF THE CFM FLEET IS PARKED TODAY IN LINE WITH THIS WE'RE ALSO SEEING SIGNIFICANT HEADWINDS IN GLOBAL SHOP VISITS WHICH WERE DOWN LOW DOUBLE DIGITS IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS AIRLINES TO FIRST SHORT-TERM MAINTENANCE AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND GETS WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER WITH SOME POTENTIAL TO MODERATE IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE YEAR DEPENDING ON THE VARIABLES JUST OUTLINED BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING THROUGH THE MONTH OF APRIL IN THE SECOND QUARTER WE'RE SEEING SHOP VISITS DOWN ROUGHLY 60% AND CSA BILLINGS DOWN ROUGHLY 50% ADDITIONALLY WE EXPECT THIS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN UTILIZATION IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO PRESSURE OUR CSA MARGINS THAT SAID WHEN THE AVIATION INDUSTRY RECOVERS AND IT WILL RECOVER OVER TIME GE IS WELL POSITIONED WITH THE LARGEST AND YOUNGEST INSTALLED BASE OF ALL ENGINE MANUFACTURERS ADDITIONALLY ROUGHLY 62% OF OUR GE CFM FLEET HAS SHE- HAS SEEN ONE SHOP VISIT OR LESS AND THIS WILL GENERATE DEMAND UPON RECOVERY WE HAVE MORE NARROW BODIES THAT ARE 10 YEARS OR YOUNGER THAN THAN THE NARROW-BODY INSTALLED BASE OF THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY AND WHEN WE SEE A PICKUP IN AIR TRAVEL DEMAND WE EXPECT NARROW BODIES WILL RECOVER MOST QUICKLY OVERALL IT WAS A CHALLENGING QUARTER AND WE'RE EXPECTING ADDITIONAL PRESSURE HERE IN THE SECOND BUT OUR COST ACTIONS WILL ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PRESSURE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2020 MOVING TO COMMERCIAL ENGINES WHICH REPRESENTED $1.5 BILLION OF REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER IN LIGHT OF COVID-19 AIRFRAMERS ARE PRODUCING AT A LOWER RATE BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING THROUGH THE MONTH OF APRIL IN THE SECOND QUARTER WE SEE INSTALLED ENGINES DOWN ROUGHLY 45% AND SPARE ENGINES DOWN ROUGHLY 60% YEAR-ON-YEAR ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DELIVERY DEFERRALS IN ADDITION TO THE ALREADY PLANNED LOWER PRODUCTION RATE ON THE 737 MAX IN THE NEAR-TERM WE'RE RIGHT-SIZING PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND ACTIVELY MANAGING THE SUPPLY BASE WE HAVE VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AIRFRAMERS AND AN ATTRACTIVE VALUE PROPOSITION IS EVIDENCED BY A MULTI-YEAR BACKLOG AS YOU'LL SEE ON THE RIGHT WE HAVE STRONG POSITIONS SOLE SOURCE ON TWO OF THE BIGGEST NEW ENGINE ENTRANCE AND A 65% WIN RATE ON THE OTHER WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S PRESSURE ON NEAR-TERM DEMAND FOR NEW AIRCRAFT THESE STATS DEMONSTRATE THE CUSTOMERS SEE THE VALUE OF GE TECHNOLOGY WE'RE TAKING THE RIGHT ACTIONS TO BE WELL POSITIONED FOR THE POST-PANDEMIC WORLD MOVING TO HEALTHCARE WHICH CONSISTS OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND PDX IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO DATE WE'RE SEEING INCREASED DEMAND FOR VITAL MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF COVID-19 WITHIN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS NOW THESE PRODUCT ORDERS INCLUDING VENTILATORS HAVE INCREASED ONE AND A HALF TO TWO TIMES VERSUS PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE SEEING REDUCED DEMAND FOR OTHER DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS AS CERTAIN PROCEDURES ARE DEFERRED OR CANCELED AROUND THE WORLD TO BE CLEAR THESE OTHER DIAGNOSTICS ARE STILL ESSENTIAL AND OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH SAVING LIVES IN AREAS INCLUDING ONCOLOGY AND CARDIOLOGY BUT ARE CURRENTLY DEPRIORITIZED PDX IS A SIMILAR STORY THIS IS A HIGH MARGIN BUSINESS MADE UP OF CONTRAST AGENTS AND NUCLEAR TRACERS ASSOCIATED WITH PROCEDURES THAT ARE BEING DEFERRED OR CANCELED RIGHT NOW SEVERAL HCS PRODUCT LINES AND MOST OF PDX IS DOWN AS MUCH AS 50% VERSUS PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS WHILE THESE DYNAMICS VARY BY COUNTRY THERE APPEARS TO BE A PATTERN EMERGING AS GEOGRAPHIES EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE VIRUS TAKING CHINA FOR EXAMPLE AS HOSPITALS COME BACK ONLINE WE'RE SEEING A RAMP IN PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED PROCEDURES AND INCREASED DEMAND FOR OUR EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMABLES HEALTHCARE IS ACCELERATING ITS PLAN TRANSFORMATION TO EX- TO EXPAND MARGINS POST BIOPHARMA BY REDUCING HEADCOUNT FIXED COSTS DISCRETIONARY SPEND AND MARKETING SPEND PRIORITIZING R&D DIFFERING CAPEX AND OPTIMIZING WORKING CAPITAL LOOKING FORWARD WE'RE MOST FOCUSED ON THE FOLLOWING INDICATORS FOR HEALTHCARE HOSPITAL ADMISSION AND AND OCCUPANCY RATES AND INCREASE IN NON COVID-19 PROCEDURES CHANGES IN HOSPITAL CAPEX BUDGETS GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON HEALTHCARE BROADLY AND DEVELOPMENT OF COVID 19 TESTS TREATMENTS AND VACCINES BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE IN CHINA AND THE MARKET IN APRIL WE EXPECT TO BE DOWN IN THE SECOND QUARTER WITH POTENTIAL RECOVERY AFTERWARDS COVID-19 HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO BUILD AND TRULY INVEST AND AND SCALE A NEW DIGITIZED INFRASTRUCTURE AND QUICKLY WE'RE COMMITTED TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR DIGITAL EDISON PLATFORM AND SOLUTIONS LIKE MURAL VIRTUAL CARE SOLUTION WHICH ALLOWS ONE CLINICIAN TO REMOTELY VIEW NUMEROUS VENTILATED PATIENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY HELPING TO EXPAND THEIR CAPACITY WHILE REDUCING THEIR RISK OF EXPOSURE AS OUR DIGITAL HEALTHCARE JOURNEY CONTINUES WE'RE AT THE CENTER OF AN ECOSYSTEM STRIVING FOR PRECISION HEALTH I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WORK OUR TEAM IS DOING TO COMBAT COVID-19 MOVING TO POWER ON SLIDE NINE ON SLIDE 13 WE'LL TALK TO THE CURRENT TRENDING IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO DATE AND DYNAMICS AT GAS POWER AND POWER PORTFOLIO STARTING WITH GAS POWER EQUIPMENT WHILE WE'RE MONITORING AND MANAGING SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS AS OF TODAY WE STILL SEE A PATH TO 45 TO 50 GAS TURBINE DELIVERIES THIS YEAR BUT OUR ORDERS PROFILE AND THEREFORE CASH DOWN PAYMENTS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR LIKELY WEAKER DUE TO IPP PRESSURES IN THE US AND MEXICO AS WE EXPECT THAT DEAL FINANCING WILL BECOME HARDER THROUGH THE YEAR ADDITIONALLY WITH OIL PRICE PRESSURE IMPACTING MIDDLE EAST AND SSA INVESTMENT INCLUDING DEMAND FOR NEW LNG WE ARE EXPECTING A LONGER ROAD TO NORMALIZATION ULTIMATELY WE'RE STICKING TO OUR STRATEGY OF SECURING A LOWER RISK MARGIN OF CREATIVE BACKLOG WITH DISCIPLINED EXECUTION IN SERVICES APPROXIMATELY 20% OF PLANNED AVERAGES ARE SHIFTING FROM THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR DUE TO COVID-19 FIELD LABOR CONSTRAINTS WE'RE ALSO SEEING PRESSURE ON UPGRADES PRIMARILY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE LOW OIL PRICES ARE IMPACTING CUSTOMER BUDGETS WE ARE SEEING GE GAS TURBINE UTILIZATION IN THE US UP MID-SINGLE DIGITS DUE TO LOW GAS PRICES AND THE SHIFT FROM COAL BUT UTILIZATION GLOBALLY IS DOWN LOW-DOUBLE DIGITS DUE TO LOWER ELECTRICITY DEMAND WITHIN POWER PORTFOLIO OUR STEAM BUSINESS IS MOST IMPACTED FACTORY CLOSURES PRESSURED OUR STEAM OPERATIONS INCLUDING ONE FACILITY IN MOVE-ON WHICH WAS CLOSED FOR APPROXIMATELY EIGHT WEEKS IN THE FIRST QUARTER TODAY WE'RE BACK UP TO MORE THAN 70% OF CAPACITY THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN HAS ALSO BEEN DISRUPTED BY THE SHUTDOWN IN INDIA DRIVEN BY GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS OVERALL WE'RE SEEING ABOUT 30% OF OUTAGES SHIFT FROM THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR TO THE SECOND HALF WITH ANOTHER 10-15 % PUSHING INTO NEXT YEAR OUR POWER BUSINESSES ARE TAKING SEVERAL MEASURES TO OFFSET THESE PRESSURES IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHERE WE REDUCED HEAD COUNT BY 700 NOTIFIED APPROXIMATELY 1300 CONTRACTORS IMPLEMENTED A HIRING FREEZE AND IN LINE WITH THE DEMAND PROFILE WE ARE TAKING EVEN FURTHER ACTIONS THIS WAS SERVE TO REDUCE SIX COSTS IN 2020 AND DRIVE BENEFITS IN 2021 LOOKING FORWARD WE'RE TRACKING A NUMBER OF ITEMS INCLUDING TIMING OF OUR GAS TURBINE NEW ORDER CLOSURE SERVICE OUTAGES AND VOLUME LEAK UTILIZATION IN THE ENERGY MIX AND FUEL PRICES ARE IMPACTING EACH REGION DIFFERENTLY SUPPLIER IMPACTS AND PROJECT EXECUTION BILLING MILESTONES AND CUSTOMER COLLECTIONS WE'RE TARGETING TO HAVE OUR ACCELERATED COST OUT MEASURES DRIVE ORGANIC MARGIN EXPANSION DESPITE THESE DEMAND CHANGES MOVING TO SLIDE 14 ON RENEWABLES THERE WAS A LIMITED IMPACT OF COVID-19 IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND OUR DISAPPOINTING RESULTS CONTINUE TO BE LARGELY ABOUT IMPROVING EXECUTION AS WE'VE SAID WE THINK ABOUT RENEWABLES IN THREE DISTINCT OPERATING POOLS STARTING WITH ONSHORE WIND WHILE WE CONTINUE TO DELIVER AT RECORD LEVELS IN THE AMERICAS WE ARE SEEING SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION AT OUR LM WIND FACILITIES AND WE'RE MONITORING KEY COMMERCIAL MILESTONES SUCH AS PERMITTING AND FINANCING WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE TIMING DELAYS IN OFFSHORE WIND CERTIFICATION FOR OUR INDUSTRY LEADING TURBINE THE HALIADE-X REMAINS ON TRACK WE'RE ALSO ON PLAN TO START DELIVERING ON OUR 80-UNIT SIX MEGAWATT COMMITMENTS TO EDF AFTER COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT IN 2021 WE EXPECT TO START SHIFTING PRODUCTION TO THE HALIADE-X WE'RE ALSO MONITORING FINANCIAL CLOSURE OF 2020 DEALS GRID AND HYDRO ARE TWO TURNAROUNDS ARE IMPACTED BY SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS WITH OVER HALF OF OUR GRID FACILITIES NOW OPERATING BELOW FULL CAPACITY AND A GRID AUTOMATION WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY LOWER BOOK-TO-BILL ORDER CONVERSION ACROSS ALL THREE OF THESE POOLS WE'RE INCREASING COST DOWN IN RESTRUCTURING AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL ACTIONS LONGER-TERM A LOWER COST STRUCTURE WILL BENEFIT RENEWABLES RELATING TO THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE SAFE REOPENING OF OUR PLANTS GLOBALLY AND THEN OPTIMIZING THE WORKFORCE AND PLANT LOAD LEVELS LOOKING FORWARD WE'RE EXPECTING A LARGER IMPACT OF COVID-19 IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND BY BUSINESS WE'RE TRACKING 20 AND 21 DEMAND IMPACT ON PROGRESS COLLECTIONS AND POTENTIAL SITE DELAYS IN ONSHORE WIND THE RISK OF FINANCING DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALS AT OFFSHORE PROJECT SITE DELAYS AT GRID AND HYDRO AND THE BACKLOG AT GRID ON SLIDE 15 WITHIN GE CAPITAL OUR <UNK> AND INSURANCE BUSINESSES ARE WHERE WE WERE FEELING THE LARGEST IMPACTS SO I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS FOCUSED THERE FIRST G- CAS IS BETTER POSITIONED TODAY THAN IN PREVIOUS DOWNTURNS WITH BETTER ASSET QUALITY LESS CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION AND MORE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY THAT SAID WE'RE PREPARING FOR ELEVATED REPOSSESSIONS AND REDEPLOYMENTS AS WELL AS LEASE RESTRUCTURINGS AND WE'VE HAD APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR CUSTOMERS SEEK SHORT-TERM DEFERRALS AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN WE AGREED WITH GOING ON A REBALANCING OF OUR 737 MAX ORDER BOOK SECOND AT INSURANCE MARKET AND RATE VOLATILITY IS IMPACTING THE CURRENT VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND REINVESTMENT YIELDS THEREFORE WE'RE DEPLOYING CAPITAL TO CAPTURE MARKET DISLOCATION INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WE'RE CLOSELY MONITORING HOW THIS VOLATILITY WILL IMPACT INSURANCE THIS YEAR AND SIMILAR TO THE INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS WE'RE IMPLEMENTING INCREMENTAL COST AND CASH ACTIONS LOOKING FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT HIGHER IMPAIRMENTS AND LOWER ASSET SALES AT G- CAS AND INSURANCE OUR SEASONED TEAMS ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS PERIOD SO TO CLOSE OUR PRIORITIES ARE CLEAR WE RAPIDLY MOBILIZED OUR TEAM IN THE FACE OF COVID-19 WITH OUR TOP PRIORITY BEING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND OVERALL THE PRIORITIES WE REVIEWED WITH YOU AT THE OUTLOOK CALL REMAIN INTACT WE'RE INTO OUR NEAR TERM REALITIES WHILE CONTINUING TO MANAGE GE FOR THE LONG-TERM WHEN THE WORLD IS FACING THE WORST PANDEMIC IN A CENTURY OUR TEAM IS RISING TO THE CHALLENGE WITH HUMILITY TRANSPARENCY AND FOCUS WE CONTINUE TO DELIVER VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ENABLING AIR CARRIERS TO TRANSPORT ESSENTIAL GOODS SUPPLYING VITAL HEALTHCARE EQUIPMENT AND KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON AND WHILE THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNS THERE WILL BE ANOTHER SIDE PLANES WILL FLY AGAIN HEALTHCARE WILL NORMALIZE AND MODERNIZE AND THE WORLD STILL NEEDS MORE EFFICIENT RESILIENT ENERGY AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE EMBRACING THIS NEW REALITY WE'RE REDEFINING WINNING AND WE'RE EXECUTING OUR PLAN THE COST AND CASH <INAUDIBLE> WE'VE TAKEN YOU THROUGH THIS MORNING ARE A MAJOR RESULT THESE MOVES WILL ULTIMATELY ALLOW US TO ACCELERATE OUR MULTI-YEAR TRANSFORMATION TO MAKE GE A STRONGER NIMBLER AND MORE VALUABLE COMPANY AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT GE WILL EMERGE STRONGER WITH THAT STEVE LET'S GO TO QUESTIONS GREAT UH BEFORE WE OPEN THE LINE I'D ASK EVERYONE IN THE QUEUE TO CONSIDER YOUR FELLOW ANALYSTS AGAIN AND ASK ONE QUESTION AND A FOLLOW-UP SO WE CAN GET TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE BRANDON CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE YES THANK YOU SIR WE'LL NOW BEGIN THE QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS * 1 ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD IF YOU'D LIKE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE QUEUE PLEASE PRESS THE POUND SIGN OR THE HASH KEY IF YOU'RE ON A SPEAKERPHONE PLEASE PICK UP YOUR HANDSET FIRST BEFORE DIALING ONCE AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS * 1 ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD AND FROM VERTICAL RESEARCH WE HAVE JEFF SPRAGUE PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYONE HOPE EVERYONE IS WELL UM THANKS FOR ALL THE UH THE GREAT DETAILS <CROSSTALK> GOOD MORNING JEFF GOOD MORNING UM I WAS HOPING YOU COULD UH PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR ON HOW YOU UH YOU KNOW KIND OF VIEW THE KIND OF THE ASSET QUALITY OF THE YOU KNOW THE CONTRACTUAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND THE LIKE RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF ASSETS THERE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S AT LEAST UH A TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OF CASH FLOWS UM HOW DOES THAT TEST WORK HAVE YOU DONE IT YET AND ARE ARE YOU CLOSE TO ANY PARTICULAR THRESHOLDS THERE THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT JEFF I I THINK IF IF WE LOOK AT THE UH TH- THE SERVICE BACKLOG RIGHT BROADLY JUST UNDER $325 BILLION FOR THE COMPANY UH THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT $234 BILLION IS IN AVIATION I SUSPECT THAT'S THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MOST FOCUSED WE WE GO THROUGH THOSE UH THOSE BACKLOG REVIEWS AND THE CSA UH REVIEWS ON A REGULAR BASIS UH WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE OVER THE LAST UH CALL IT THE LAST SEVEN EIGHT WEEKS IS REALLY TIGHTEN AND QUICKEN THE REVIEW PROCESS THAT WE DO WITH THE UH THE BUSINESSES BOTH UH AT AVIATION AND AT GECAS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT THE LATEST AND UM IF YOU WILL MOST UH MOST ACCURATE INFORMATION POSSIBLE WITH RESPECT TO CUSTOMER RISK GIVEN UH GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S THAT'S GOING ON SO WE WE WE DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS WE DID THAT AT THE F- AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER IN UH IN IN CLOSING MUCH AS WE DO EVERY QUARTER CLEARLY WE'VE GOT A UH WE WE'VE GOT A FLUID UH SITUATION AND I THINK THE UH THE MODEST CHARGES THAT WE TOOK UH THE MODEST CHANGES IN THE FIRST QUARTER CLEARLY ARE GONNA PLAY OUT AS WE GO THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE YEAR WE CAN'T REALLY SCOPE THAT UH FOR YOU TODAY IF YOU LOOK AT THE CSA BOOK AND AVIATION FOR EXAMPLE UH AS WE WENT THROUGH THE UH THE MECHANICS OF THE FUTURE BILLINGS THE FUTURE COSTS RELATED TO THOSE BILLINGS UH BASED ON THE INFORMATION AT THE TIME IT WAS REALLY JUST 100-BILLION D- $100 -MILLION UH ADJUSTMENT NON-CASH OF COURSE WHICH IS WHY YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THE EARNINGS CASH UH DYNAMIC UH CERTAINLY AS WE GO FORWARD WE'RE GONNA BE UPDATING UH THOSE UH THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND AGAIN W- WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WE WOULD SEE UH MORE OF THAT UH GIVEN WHAT THE AIRLINES ARE DOING WITH UH WITH THEIR PLANES BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND AGAIN YOU KNOW THESE THESE ARE 10 TO 15-YEAR AGREEMENTS AS YOU KNOW AND UH THOSE ADJUSTMENTS ARE TAKE- TAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT UH UH PARTICULARLY EXTENDED TIME PERIOD GREAT THANKS FOR THAT AND JUST AS A FOLLOWUP IF I COULD UM I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GET REAL PRECISE ON GUIDANCE BUT UH YOU KNOW YOU YOU ARE UH POINTING US TO UH A FURTHER DECLINE IN CASHFLOW IN Q2 WHICH ISN'T SURPRISING QUITE QUITE FRANKLY BUT UH COULD YOU BRACKET THAT AT ALL FOR US WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT FOR FOR Q2 AND UH YOU KNOW ANY HIGH LEVEL THOUGHTS ON HOW THE YEAR PLAYS OUT FROM THE CASH STANDPOINT YEAH JEFF I I THINK THAT WE UH WE TOOK GUIDANCE OFF THE TABLE A FEW WEEKS BACK AND UM DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A UH AN ATTEMPT AT AT AT FRAMING FORMAL GUIDANCE HERE TODAY IN LIGHT OF ALL THAT IS FLUID AND ALL THAT IS IS STILL EVOLVING HERE AND I THINK THAT THE TACK WE TOOK WAS REALLY TO TRY TO TO TO SHARE AS MUCH WITH YOU AS AS WE POSSIBLY COULD IN TERMS OF THE UH THE APRIL DETAIL BUSINESS BY BUSINESS UM AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE A UH A MORE CHALLENGING UH SECOND QUARTER HERE GIVEN THE FULL IMPACT OF OF COVID AND THE LIKE UH BUT BEYOND THAT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE ARE WE WE WE KNOW WE'VE GOT TO TO GET TO WORK ON THE COST AND THE CASH ACTIONS THAT'S WHY YOU SEE US DOUBLING THAT ACTIVITY IN AVIATION STEPPING IT UP UM ELSEWHERE UH AROUND THE COMPANY SO UH THE THE $2 BILLION OF COSTS THE $3 BILLION OF CASH UH WILL CLEARLY HELP US LATER UH ON IN THE YEAR IF THOSE UH THOSE ACTIONS UH TAKE UH TAKE ROOT BUT FOR TODAY I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE UH THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE COMFORTABLE SHARING GREAT THANKS BEST OF LUCK LARRY THANKS FROM MORGAN STANLEY WE HAVE JOSH POKRZYWINSKI THANKS JEFF PLEASE GO AHEAD JOSH YOUR LINE'S OPEN JOSH YOU MIGHT BE ON MUTE JOSH YOU MIGHT BE ON MUTE JOSH JOSH ARE YOU THERE WHY DON'T WE UH W- BRANDON LET'S UH MOVE ON AND COME BACK TO

JUST A QUESTION ON THANK YOU SO MUCH AND UM UH GOOD LUCK TO EVERYBODY UM SO RUN RATE MINUS 60% IN TERMS OF SHOP VISITS UH 50% IN CSA DO YOU THINK YOU'LL CONTINUE TO TREND AT THIS LEVEL IN THE SECOND QUARTER OR IS THERE A MORE DOWNSIDE ANDREW THE UH I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO TO PAGE NINE IN THE SLIDE DECK YEAH THERE IT IS YEAH I THINK THIS IS WHAT UH YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE YEAH I I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE'RE UH WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW RIGHT AND GIVEN UH GIVEN WHAT THE CARRIERS HAVE UH HAVE SAID PUBLICLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WE THINK THESE ARE UH THESE ARE GOOD LIKELY UH YEAR-END RUN RATES TO SHARE WITH YOU WE'RE AGAIN WE'RE NOT UM TRYING TO OFFER UP A DEFINITIVE VIEW AS TO THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS UH BUT THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IN THE SECOND QUARTER FOR SURE AND UH MY MY FOLLOW-UP QUESTION ON UH <INAUDIBLE> ENGINE SALES I THINK UH MINUS 60% UH HAVE WE LOST THESE OR WILL THESE COME BACK UH WHEN THE SITUATION NORMALIZES MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE US SOME SORT OF FRAMEWORK HOW TO THINK ABOUT SPARE ENGINE DEMAND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THANK YOU SO MUCH ANDREW WE WERE UH WE WERE RAMPING UH SPARES WITH WITH BOTH THE UH THE LEAP-1A A AND THE LEAP-1B AS UH THE NARROW-BODY MARKET WAS TAKING OFF UH TYPICAL EARLY IN THE LIFE OF AN ENGINE ACTIVITY UH W- WE ARE CLEARLY SEEING THAT UH SOFTEN UH NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO ZERO UH AS PREPARATIONS ARE BEING MADE FOR THE RETURN TO SERVICE OF THE MAX RIGHT UH I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY IS LOST BUT I THINK LIKE MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN AVIATION BROADLY IT WILL BE UH IT WILL BE PUSHED OUT FOR A FEW YEARS AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK WE'RE TAKING A DEFINITIVE VIEW AS TO WHAT YEAR WHAT QUARTER THINGS UH GET BACK TO IF YOU WILL A NORMALIZED 2019 LEVEL UH BUT WE RECOGNIZE UH THE UH THE DISCUSSIONS OUT THERE ABOUT THIS BEING A MULTI-YEAR UH RECOVERY GRADUAL SLOW LIKE WE'RE EMBRACING THAT REALITY AND THAT APPLIES UH REALLY ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO BOTH ON THE OE SIDE AS WELL AS THE AFTERMARKET SPARES INCLUDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE DETAIL AND STAY SAFE THANK YOU LIKEWISE ANDREW THANK YOU FROM MELIUS RESEARCH WE HAVE FROM MELIUS RESEARCH WE HAVE SCOTT DAVIS PLEASE GO AHEAD HEY GOOD MORNING GUYS AND WELCOME CAROLINA THANK YOU <INAUDIBLE> LARRY ANY UH GOOD MORNING LARRY ANY ANY WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE COST ACTIONS AS IT RELATES TO KIND OF STRUCTURAL VERSUS MORE KIND OF PANDEMIC SHORT-TERM RELATED SURE WELL I I WOULD I WOULD SAY SCOTT AS YOU WELL KNOW THAT WHEN WE'RE IN A WE'RE IN A MODE LIKE THIS YOU'RE UH YOU'RE YOU'RE MOVING AS QUICKLY AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN UM ALMOST ANYWHERE THAT YOU CAN SO IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE ANNOUNCED AT AVIATION THE DOUBLING OF THOSE ACTIVITIES TODAY THE THE THE BROADENING ACROSS THE COMPANY UH IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE TALLY TODAY THERE IS A DECIDEDLY SHORT-TERM BIAS THERE THAT CAROLINA AND I ARE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE CEOS OVER THE COMING WEEKS TO UH TRANSITION TO A MORE PERMANENT UH ACTION RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE DID IN AVIATION FOR EXAMPLE EXAMPLE IN TERMS OF THE TEMPORARY LACK OF WORKS UH THAT WAS A WAY TO QUICKLY ADJUST OUR COST STRUCTURE IN THAT BUSINESS ON A VARIABLE BASIS TO THESE UH SHOCKINGLY FAST CHANGES UH IN DEMAND YOU MIGHT CATEGORIZE THAT AS AS TEMPORARY WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH UH THE CHANGES ON A MORE PERMANENT BASIS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN IN LIGHT OF THE UH THE LENGTH OF THE RECOVERY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SO WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THESE IN THESE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE SHARING TODAY THE $2 BILLION OF COSTS THE $3 BILLION OF CASH UH THERE'S A BIT OF UH TACTICAL BIAS TODAY JUST GIVEN HOW FRESH THIS IS BUT WE WILL BE LEANING IN TOWARD MAKING MORE OF THEM PERMANENT RECOGNIZING THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WILL BE A UH A BIT OF A MIX UH BE IT BE IT HEADCOUNT RELATED DISCRETIONARY SPEND ON THE COST SIDE IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE WORKING CAPITAL AND CERTAINLY THE THE THE CAPEX REDUCTION THAT CAROLINA REFERENCED THE 25% REDUCTION UH YEAR ON YEAR SO A LOT GOING ON AND UH BY NO MEANS IS THIS UH UH THESE HEADLINES TODAY THE UH THE END IT'S VERY MUCH A WORK IN IN PROGRESS OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL LARRY AND WE THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE $20 BILLION KIND OF CAME TO YOU PRETTY MUCH ABOUT PERFECT TIMING BUT YOU KNOW DOES THAT MONEY JUST SIT ON THE BALANCE DOES THAT HAVE TO SIT ON THE BALANCE SHEET PRETTY MUCH AS IS FOR THE FOR THE YEAR CAN YOU OR IS IT JUST SUCH A BIG NUMBER YOU CAN START TO PARSE SOME OF IT OUT TO THINK OF IN TERMS OF WHITTLING DOWN SOME OF THE YOU KNOW DEBT THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN MANAGE WELL WE UH IT IT IT IT DID COME AT A UH AT A AT A GOOD TIME UH THERE'S THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT'S WHY WE PUT THE EMPHASIS IN IN THE BIOPHARMA SET UP UH ON ON ON CERTAINTY RIGHT WE WANT TO TAKE THE MARKET RISK OFF THE TABLE RELATIVE TO THINKING THROUGH THE UH THE HEALTHCARE OPTIONS CAROLINA ANYTHING UH YOU WANT TO ADD RELATIVE TO KIND OF MANAGING LIQUIDITY VERSUS LEVERAGE RIGHT HERE I THINK THAT'S <CROSSTALK> YEAH I I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT NOW COMPARED TO LIKE BEFORE COVID AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US OF COURSE LEVERAGE IS IMPORTANT BUT LIQUIDITY IS VERY IMPORTANT UH AND WE END THE QUARTER WITH $47 BILLION CASH RIGHT AND THAT'S REALLY TO COVER $13 BILLION OF GE AND GE CAPITAL LONG-TERM DEBT MATURITIES NOW THROUGH ' 21 AND ACTUALLY AFTER THE APRIL ACTIONS WE ARE DOWN TO $13 BILLION OF MATURITIES FOR ' 20 AND ' 21 ALMOST ALL OF THAT IN IN CAPITAL UM AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT WE EXPECT TO HAVE AROUND $20 BILLION IN TOTAL CREDIT LINES GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S REALLY IN LINE WITH OUR RISK APPETITE WE HAVE THE NEW $15 BILLION THREE-YEAR RCF THAT I MENTIONED AND $5 BILLION EITHER WILL BE ON 20 BILLION CREDIT LINES I THINK WE'RE JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW WE WE REALLY INTEND TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF CASH I WOULD SAY TO MAXIMIZE FLEXIBILITY AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE TAKING THESE ACTIONS ALSO TO DE-RISK OUR BALANCE SHEET AND BASICALLY PRUDENTLY MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY IN THESE VERY CHALLENGING EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT AND TIME THAT THAT MAKES SENSE AND THANK YOU AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU GUYS THANK YOU THANKS SCOTT BE WELL YEAH LET'S TRY JOSH POKRZYWINSKI AGAIN FROM MORGAN STANLEY PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR HI THERE CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS TIME YES YES CLEARLY JOSH GOOD MORNING AWESOME UM AND AND HOPE EVERYONE IS IS WELL TO ECHO EARLIER COMMENTS W- LARRY CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A SENSE AND I I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE DATA GOING BACK EONS IN IN AVIATION HOW THE IMPACT OF OF RETIREMENTS AND CANNIBALIZATIONS YOU KNOW KIND OF MAKE MORE OF A UH A U SHAPE VERSUS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW THE THE AIR TRAFFIC MAY LOOK LIKE IS IS THERE A NATURAL LAG BETWEEN WHEN FOLKS START FLYING AGAIN AND WHEN WHEN SHOP VISITS CAN HAPPEN JUST AS A FUNCTION OF KIND OF USING UP SOME OF THE RUNTIME ON ON OTHERWISE IDLED ASSETS WELL JOSH UH YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE HAVE UH WE HAVE REVISITED THE HISTORY THE TEAM IS UH IS WELL-VERSED IN IN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN YEARS PAST I'M NOT SURE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN ANYTHING UH KIND OF ON PAR WITH UH WITH THIS UM BUT THERE'S THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE'S THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIAS ON THE PART OF SOME AS SOME OF THESE FLEET UH REDUCTIONS PLAY OUT TO RETIRE SOME OF THE OLDER AIRCRAFT UM AND THAT WILL FACTOR INTO THE UH TO THE AFTERMARKET MUCH LIKE SOME OF THE DYNAMICS AROUND GREEN TIME AND HOW YOU'RE IN THE SHORT-TERM UH FOLKS TRY TO PRESERVE CASH CARRIERS TRY TO PRESERVE CASH IN UH IN IN THEIR BUSINESS SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE IS NECESSARILY UH AN EXACT MODEL THAT CAPTURES WHAT ALL THE CARRIERS IN AGGREGATE ARE GOING TO DO HERE UH A MODEL THAT OFFERS GREAT PRECISION I THINK WE DO KNOW THAT THIS THAT THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS IS GONNA CREATE PRESSURE FOR US UM A FORCE HERE IN THE SHORT TERM UH I THINK WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT FOR OUR BUSINESS REALLY IS IS CYCLES MUCH MORE SO THAN REV- UH REVENUE PASSENGER MILES UH AND AS WE SEE SCHEDULES COME BACK AS WE WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC THAT WILL UH THAT'LL PUT US BACK ON I THINK BETTER FOOTING BUT HERE IN THE SHORT TERM I THINK WE'RE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE SHOP VISITS AND CSA BILLINGS UH TAKE ON SOME REAL PRESSURE DUE TO THE DOWNTURN UNDERSTOOD THANKS I'LL LEAVE IT THERE FROM JP MORGAN WE HAVE STEVE TUSA PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS JOSH UH HEY GUYS GOOD MORNING HEY STEVE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING UM IN IN UH IN EARLY MARCH YOU GUYS HAD THAT SLIDE THAT SHOWED UM YOU KNOW $2 TO $4 BILLION IN YOU KNOW FREE CASH FLOW GUIDANCE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY OFF THE TABLE BUT YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THINGS GROWING IN YOU KNOW ' 21 AND ' 22 AND YOU KNOW OFF THAT KIND OF $3 BILLION BASE I THINK YOU KNOW MOST UH RESEARCH AND UM NUMBERS I SAW WERE KIND OF IN THAT YOU KNOW UM $6 BILLION RANGE OF OF FREE CASH FLOWS TO KIND OF GROWTH OFF OF THAT LEVEL ARE ARE WE STILL UM LIKE IS IS ARE THE IATA NUMBERS UM STILL AT ALL LEGIT OR IS THAT YOU KNOW ARE ARE YOU KIND OF WITHDRAWING THAT LONG-TERM OUTLOOK AS WELL STEVE I THINK WE HAVE ADMITTEDLY BEEN ON TAKING THE RIGHT ACTIONS BOTH THE COSTS THE CASH THE UH THE BALANCE SHEET ACTIONS HERE IN THE SHORT TERM IN THE FACE OF THIS UH THIS UNPRECEDENTED DYNA- PANDEMIC UM WE'VE TAKEN GUIDANCE OFF FOR THE YEAR WE'RE NOT PUTTING IT BACK ON TODAY JUST GIVEN THE UH GIVEN THE UNDUE UN- UNCERTAINTY OF IT ALL RIGHT SO I I DON'T UH I DON'T THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT ANY FURTHER THAN THAN THAT UM I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BUT I THINK FOR PURPOSES OF TODAY WE'RE REALLY JUST TRYING TO UM FRAME FOR FOLKS WHAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING BUT THAT SAID HOWEVER LONG UH IT TAKES US TO WORK THROUGH THIS I THINK WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO COME OUT STRONGER AND GET BACK ON A UH ON A POSITIVE UH CASHFLOW GROWTH TRAJECTORY GOT GOT IT AND- CAROLINA ANYTHING YOU WOULD ADD TO THAT UH WELL NO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY TAKING OUT COST NOW AND PART OF IT BEING STRUCTURAL THAT GIVES US SORT OF SELF-MITIGATING THE DECREMENTAL THAT HELPS IMPROVING THE INCREMENTAL THE THE THE OUTER YEARS I MEAN THAT WOULD DEPEND ON THE RECOVERY ON THE INDUSTRIES AS WELL SO SO THAT'S THAT'S I WOULD SAY ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TO SPEAK TO TODAY R- RIGHT AND AND I GUESS HOW MUCH ON THAT'S STRUCTURAL COSTS SIDE YEAH YEAH STEVE YEAH GO AHEAD YEAH NO I'M JUST JUST ONE ONE OTHER POINT I THINK WORTH MENTIONING I MEAN I THINK WHAT WE'RE ACKNOWLEDGING HERE IS THAT ASSISTANCE PLAYED OUT IN MARCH AND AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING ALREADY IN APRIL RIGHT IT IT REALLY IS HITTING UH HITTING US FROM A MIX A MIX PERSPECTIVE HARD UH OUR HIGHEST MARGIN BUSINESSES ARE REALLY FEELING IT HERE I WOULD THINK THAT ON THE ON THE RECOVERY WE WOULD SEE UM WE WOULD SEE IT SWING THE OTHER WAY WHEN WE GET BACK UH AND COME OFF A BOTTOM WE SHOULD HAVE POSITIVE MIXED EFFECT UH REALLY ACROSS THE ACROSS THE BOARD PARTICULARLY IN AVIATION AND HEALTHCARE YEAH UM Y- YOUR YOUR SECOND QUESTION STEVE IS RELATIVE TO THE COST ACTIONS AND HOW MUCH PERMANENT HOW MUCH UH NOT PERMANENT YEAH I I KNOW I GUESS HOW MUCH IS THAT GONNA COST YOU I MEAN LIKE YOU KNOW TO COME UP WITH 2 TO $3 BILLION OF OF COST AND CASH YOU KNOW YOU'VE DONE YOU YOU CUT YOUR RESTRUCTURING LAST YEAR PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY NEEDED A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER UM I MEAN UH MOST COMPANIES KIND OF ONE FOR ONE UH WHAT HOW MUCH IS THIS STUFF GONNA COST YOU THIS YEAR ON A CASH BASIS YEAH I I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SAID UM PREVIOUSLY WE WERE GONNA BE DOWN OFF OF LAST YEAR FROM A UH FROM AN EXPENSE AND FROM A CASH PERSPECTIVE I THINK WE'RE WE'RE UH PROBABLY GONNA END UP MORE OR LESS IN LINE RIGHT KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME OF THE COST ACTIONS LIKE FURLOUGHS DON'T CARRY A RESTRUCTURING CHARGE WITH THAT RIGHT UH BECAUSE THEY AREN'T PERMANENT SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS SQUEEZE OUT SOME OF THE TEMPORARY COSTS UM BUT ALL THE WHILE IF WE CAN UH WE CAN MAKE MORE STRUCTURAL MOVES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT ROOM TO DO THAT BUT I'D SAY RIGHT NOW ASSUME THAT IT UH BE RELATIVELY FLAT YEAR ON YEAR BUT AS CAROLINA INDICATED IN HER REMARKS UM WE WANNA TRY TO DO MORE IF WE CAN GREAT ALL RIGHT THANKS ALL THAT THAT'S ALL I HAVE GUYS THANKS STEVE FROM UBS WE HAVE MARKUS MITTERMAIER PLEASE GO AHEAD ALL RIGHT GOOD MORNING LARRY CAROLINA AND STEVE UM LET ME MAYBE FOLLOW UP ON THE UH ON THE AVIATION- MARCUS GOOD MORNING UM HEY GOOD MORNING UM WITHIN THE YEAR SO IN YOUR Q 10-Q YOU'VE REFERENCED THE IATA NUMBERS OF 48% RPK REDUCTION IF IF AND I KNOW OBVIOUSLY FLY DOLLARS AND RPKS ARE ARE TWO DIFFERENT STORIES BUT IS THAT SORT OF A UH A KIND OF SCENARIO THAT YOU'RE PLAYING THROUGH INTERNALLY AND AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IF WE LOOK AT OUR SORT OF LIKE ' 19 AVIATION CASH AS A BASELINE SORT OF LIKE WHERE YOU KNOW ON ON THAT TYPE OF SCENARIO WE COULD END UP PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW LOOKING AT SORT OF WHAT YOU'VE MENTIONED IN YOUR PREPARED RE- REMARKS THAT YOU HAVE I THINK 62% OF OF ENGINES STILL AHEAD OF SHOP VISITS ONE WHICH ARGUABLY ARE THE ENGINES THAT ARE ON THE NARROW BODIES COMING BACK FIRST BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY THE YOUNGEST UM THE YOUNGEST IN THE FLEET RIGHT RIGHT AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE FOR WITHIN THE YEAR HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT WELL I I I THINK THAT GIVEN WHAT WE WHAT WE HIGHLIGHTED RELATIVE TO THE THE THE APRIL EXPERIENCE AND THE NEAR-TERM PROJECTION OF THAT UM THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE THE PRESSURE ON UH ON CASH AT AVIATION THAT WE'VE SEEN UH HERE OF LATE RIGHT AND THAT THAT WILL BE OUR UM UNDOUBTEDLY OUR OUR BIGGEST HEADWIND NO SURE SURE SURE BUT UH YOU KNOW THE UH THE YOU KNOW SH- SHOP VISITS WE HEARD SORT OF THE THE NUMBERS THAT YOU THAT YOU SAID BUT DID YOU DO SORT OF INTERNAL INTERNAL UM STRESS TEST AROUND UM W- WHERE YOU COULD END UP OR IS THAT IS THAT JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU SAY IT'S IT'S TOO EARLY TO COMMENT NO NO NO THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S PLENTY THERE'S PLENTY OF OF OF PLANNING FOR UH AGAIN A UH AN EXTENDED UH SLOWDOWN HERE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE EMBRACING THIS REALITY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE WE ARE NOT EXPECTING UH THIS TO BOUNCE BACK UH IN IN THE NEAR TERM SO WE WE WE FLAG IN THE QUEUE THE IATA NUMBERS WE ALSO REFERENCE OTHERS YOU SEE IT IN OUR OWN UH DEPARTURE DATA HERE IN APRIL RIGHT WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE WAY DOWN THAT HAS A DIRECT FEED INTO SHOP VISITS CSA BILLINGS AND THE LIKE SO WE'RE- WE'RE- WE'RE ADAPTING TO THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL RECOVER SO WE'RE MARCUS WE'RE- WE'RE SIMPLY NOT TRYING TO UH- UH ASSUME THAT- THAT THE- THE PRESSURE ABATES ANYTIME SOON WITNESS THE UH THE COST AND THE CASH ACTIONS THAT WE'RE TAKING SURE OKAY NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND MAY- MAYBE AS A FOLLOWUP QUICKLY ON- ON THE CAPITAL SIDE DO YOU ANTICIPATE UM ANY CHANGE IN THE IN THE CAPITAL SUPPORT THERE FOR- FOR INSURANCE IN PARTICULAR YOU- YOU- YOU REFERENCED THAT A LITTLE BIT IN THE PREPARED REMARKS I THINK TWO BILLION IS SORT OF THE CURRENT NUMBER HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THAT AT THE MOMENT ON THE CURRENT SUPPORT UH TO CAPITAL UM- YEAH ON THE INSURANCE- YEAH LET'S YEAH LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK THEN SO UH IN ' 19 THE CAPITAL HAD AN INFUSION FROM UH GE OF FOUR BILLION RIGHT AND THE ESTIMATE FOR- FOR THIS YEAR IS TWO BILLION UH ON THE INSURANCE FUNDING UM AND THOSE TWO BILLION UM YOU KNOW THEY'RE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE YEAR UH BEFORE UM WE ESTIMATED THAT THE <INAUDIBLE> WILL NEED TO SUPPORT ROUGHLY <INAUDIBLE> VARIABLES ARE STILL OPEN AND THAT DEPENDS ON GE CAPITAL ITSELF RIGHT GE CAPITAL EARNINGS THE- THE <UNK> THE CAPITAL AND THE ASSET LIQUIDITY LEVELS BUT BASICALLY IT'S ABOUT TWO BILLION AS IT LOOKS NOW UM AND I WOULD ALSO SAY GOING FORWARD <INAUDIBLE> FOLLOWUP UH WE DO CONTINUE TO- TO ANTICIPATE FURTHER FUNDING UM AND THAT WILL BE AGAIN THROUGH A COMBINATION OF GE CAPITAL ITSELF THROUGH THEIR ASSET <INAUDIBLE> LIQUIDITY AND THEIR FUTURE EARNINGS UM AND ON TOP OF THAT POSSIBLE CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM GE THANK YOU FROM COHEN AND COMPANY WE HAVE <UNK> PLEASE GO AHEAD YEAH THANK YOU GOOD MORNING GUYS GOOD MORNING TWO QUESTION UH TWO QUESTIONS SO- MORNING AT- AT AVIATION IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ON THE WAY UP UM THE SPARES BUSINESS THE AFTERMARKET THE $15 BILLION COMMERCIAL AFTERMARKET BUSINESS WILL LAG ASM GROWTH BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW A YOUNGER FLEET EMERGING YOU KNOW UH A SURGE OF USED SERVICEABLE MATERIAL AND THE LIKE PART OUTS AND OBVIOUSLY LOWER SPARES PROVISIONING AS THE OE RATES COME DOWN 30% TO 50% I GUESS FIRST QUESTION IS WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE AVIATION-FREE CASHFLOW UH GETTING TO BREAK EVEN IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE BEFORE CALENDAR ' 22 UH IN THAT IN TY- TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT AND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOWUP I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE WE WOULD BUY INTO THE PREMISE PER SAY RIGHT I MEAN WE- WE- WE ARE A CYCLES BUSINESS MUCH MORE SO UM THAN- THAN ANY OTHER INDICATOR AND THOSE CYCLES ARE GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK UH BEFORE THE PASSENGERS DO UH A- AS YOU INDICATED THE AGE OF THE FLEET WILL- WILL HELP US OVER TIME THERE COULD BE SOME SHORT-TERM HEADWINDS BUT WE'LL UH WE'LL- WE'LL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT UM I THINK I THINK WHAT WE'RE ACKNOWLEDGING HERE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN HIT FROM A FREE CASH PERSPECTIVE UH IN OUR UH KIND OF OUR- OUR- OUR BIGGEST AND BEST CASH GENERATOR AT- AT AVIATION UH BUT WE'RE REALLY NOT GETTING INTO UH MUCH MORE MUCH MORE IN TERMS OF THE UH THE- THE PRE-CASH FORECAST ON- ON A MULTI-YEAR BASIS IT'S JUST TOO SOON THERE'S JUST TOO MANY UH MOVING PIECES FOR US TO UH TO BE THAT FORWARD LEANING AT THIS POINT WE WISH WE COULD BE IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOT WHERE WE ARE OKAY AND JUST A FOLLOWUP YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY 2020'S A TOUGH YEAR WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME CASH BURN 2021 UNCLEAR BUT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IN AVIATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE A STRONG RECOVERY UM ANY SO- SO AS WE EMERGE FROM THIS WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU KNOW MORE LEVERAGE AND I- I GUESS THE QUESTION IS YOU GUYS HAVE MADE SOME ASSET SALES TO DE-LEVERAGE WHAT ELSE BESIDES COST REDUCTION CAN YOU DO UM TO GET THE BALANCE SHEET BETTER UH FASTER IS THERE ANY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU GUYS ARE EXPLORING OR THAT YOU MIGHT EXPLORE THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'VE DONE OVER THE PAST YEAR THANK YOU WELL I WOULD- <CROSSTALK> I'M NOT SURE I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S A LOT THAT IS NO PLEASE CAROLINA I- I WAS I WAS GONNA SAY THAT TO DO THINGS THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE- WELL I- I- I WOULD SAY- IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS <LAUGH> YEAH WELL I- I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY AT- AT- AT A HIGH LEVEL WE- WE ARE COMMITTED TO OUR DE-LEVERAGING TARGET OF LESS THAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES ON THE INDUSTRIAL SIDE AND I THINK YOU'VE SEEN US MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS YEAR TO DATE WHICH I HOPE UNDERSCORES UH THE SERIOUSNESS OF- OF- OF THAT OBJECTIVE BOTH ON THE GE SIDE RIGHT I THINK IT'S SEVEN BILLION OF UH OF DEBT REDUCTIONS IN THE QUARTER AND UH CAPITAL I THINK IT'S UP TO 10 UM ON- ON A YEAR TO DATE BUSINESS GIVEN- GIVEN SOME OF THE THINGS WE DID IN APRIL CLEARLY IT'S GONNA TAKE US A- A- A WHILE LONGER HERE TO HIT THOSE TARGETS LIKE I- I SUSPECT MOST- MOST COMPANIES BUT IN TERMS OF DOING ANYTHING NEW OR DIFFERENT I THINK WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO TRY TO RUN THESE BUSINESSES AS- AS BEST WE CAN BE AS DISCIPLINED AS WE CAN ON THE CAPITAL FRONT UH BE- BE- BE SMART AND THOUGHTFUL RELATIVE TO SOME OF THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS LIKE UH LIKE PENSION AS YOU'VE SEEN US RELATIVE TO UH THE PLAN DESIGN AND- AND SOME OF THE SETTLEMENT OPTIONS SO I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE NECESSARILY NEW PLAYS PER SE UH BUT WE'LL CONTINUE TO- TO LOOK AT- AT EVERY AND- AND EVERY OPTION AVAILABLE TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE COMPANY STRENGTHEN THE BALANCE SHEET BRING THOSE LEVERAGE LEVELS DOWN IN THE FACE OF UH OF COVID-19 CAROLINA I'M SORRY I JUMPED IN THERE ANYTHING TO ADD THERE I WOULD JUST ADD THAT UH TO THE LEVERAGE COMMENT ALSO THE LIQUIDITY THAT AT TIMES LIKE THIS YOU KNOW YOU DO LOOK AT THE LIQUIDITY AND UH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT UM YOU REALLY WANT TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF TRUST TO MAXIMIZE THE FLEXIBILITY UH AND YOU HAVE <INAUDIBLE> THE DE-RISKING ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAVE MADE UM TO SORT OF PUSH OUT THE DEBT AND UH FOR THE YEAR SO <INAUDIBLE> THANK YOU YEAH AND I AND I- I BUT I BUT I THINK TO THAT I MEAN IT'S JUST IMPORTANT FOR US ALL TO REMEMBER WE- WE ENDED THE QUARTER WITH 47 BILLION OF LIQUIDITY UM ON THE BACK OF THE BIO PHARMA ACTION AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE UH DONE SO WE'LL- WE'LL CONTINUE TO BE NIMBLE AND- AND FLEXIBLE UH MINDFUL OF- OF- OF OUR OBLIGATIONS AND OUR REALITY OKAY AND FROM BARCLAYS WE HAVE JULIAN MITCHELL PLEASE GO AHEAD HI GOOD MORNING UM MAYBE UH JUST A QUESTION AROUND- GOOD MORNING JULIAN GOOD MORNING UH MAYBE JUST A FIRST QUESTION AROUND THE UM THE WORKING CAPITAL UH DYNAMICS AND THE FREE CASHFLOW AT AVIATION UM I GUESS YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES WHERE WHEN YOU GET THIS RAPID SALES DOWN DRAFT YOU GET A WORKING CAPITAL CASH OFFSET TO AN EXTENT AND THEN IT REVERSES UH WHENEVER THE SALES COME BACK COULD YOU JUST UPDATE US ON HOW YOU SEE THE WORKING CAPITAL CASH IMPACTS AT GE AVIATION SORT OF IN THE EARLY STAGES NOW IN THIS DOWNTURN UM WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO HAPPEN TO WORKING CAPITAL WHEN THINGS RECOVER AND IF THERE'S MA ANY MAJOR DIFFERENCE ON THE CASH DYNAMICS OF THE POWER BY THE HOUR TYPE SERVICE RELATIVE TO THE AD HOC SPARES ACTIVITY AT AVIATION JULIAN I WOULD SAY WHAT UH- <CROSSTALK> WORKING CAPITAL PART YEAH ON- ON WITH RESPECT TO WORKING CAPITAL UH I- I THINK OUR- OUR- OUR PRIMARY CHALLENGE IS REALLY INVENTORY AT AVIATION RIGHT WE- WE CAME INTO THIS YEAR KNOWING WE WERE GONNA HAVE TO ADJUST TO A DIFFERENT SCHEDULE UM WITH THE MAX CHASING THE UH THE STEP UP AT UH AT AIRBUS WITH THE 320NEO UH WHILE DEALING WITH A GOOD BIT OF- OF- OF PAST DUE ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE BOTH- BOTH OE AND UM AFTERMARKET WHILE HAVING PRETTY GOOD MILITARY DEMAND TO UH TO- TO CONTEND WITH THAT ALL GETS UH RESET HERE AND ONE OF THE REAL PRESSURES WE SAW FROM A FROM A CASHFLOW PERSPECTIVE WAS IN INVENTORY AT AVIATION IN UH IN THE QUARTER SO THAT- THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE MOST FOCUSED TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REDUCE THE DELINQUENCIES ADJUST TO TH- THESE PRODUCTION SCHEDULES THE LOWER AFTERMARKET REQUIREMENTS WHILE CONTINUING TO TAKE CARE OF A MILITARY BUSINESS IT UH THAT- THAT'S A THAT'S A COMPLEX UH SUPPLY CHAIN UNDERTAKING UH BUT THE TEAM AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IS UH KEENLY FOCUSED ON USING SOME OF THE LEAN TOOLS WORKING WITH OUR SUPPLY BASE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NOT ONLY TAKE THE COST OUT OF THE BUSINESS BUT UH BRING THOSE INVENTORY LEVELS DOWN UH IN- IN- IN LIGHT OF CURRENT- CURRENT DEMAND BUT SHOULD WE EXPECT UM SO I GUESS I- I UNDERSTAND <CROSSTALK> YEAH IS THERE A SECOND PART TO YOUR QUESTION I- I MAY HAVE MISSED THAT I THINK WE'RE ON A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY HERE- YEAH SO I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I GUESS YOU KNOW IN AVIATION YOU HAVE THE- THE YOU HAVE THE DROP IN EBITDA IN A DOWNTURN AND THE RECOVERY IN EBITDA IN THE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE UPTURN I WAS JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ON <INAUDIBLE> CAPITAL IS THAT CASH IMPACT COUNTER-CYCLICAL OR IS IT PRO-CYCLICAL SO YOU'RE- YOU'RE GETTING THE WORKING CAPITAL OUTFLOW THROUGH THE DOWNTURN AS WELL AS THE EBITDA DECLINE I UNDERSTAND THE- THE- THE- THE HIGH LEVEL DYNAMIC THERE THAT YOU'RE ALLUDING TO I- I THINK RIGHT NOW THE UH THE SIMPLE REALITY AT AVIATION GIVEN THE PRESSURES AND THE CROSS-CURRENTS IS THAT IT IS A NEGATIVE AND WE NEED TO WORK TO IMPROVE IT HOW MUCH OF A UH A TAILWIND COULD IT BE UM KIND OF AT THIS POINT IN THE CYCLE UM I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL WE- WE- WE'VE- WE'VE GOTTA GET ON THE IMPROVEMENT PATH FIRST JULIAN TO BE ABLE TO UH TAKE THAT UH POTENTIAL AND- AND DELIVER IT IN THE FINANCIALS AS A REALITY THANK YOU AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION WAS JUST AROUND THE UM THE OPERATIONAL ISSUES SO I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE THE COST OUT TAILWIND SHOULD BUILD THROUGH THE YEAR UM BUT IN Q1 YOU HAD SOME OPERATIONAL ISSUES IN- IN POWER ON THE ON THE SERVICE SIDE YOU KNOW STEEP DECREMENTALS EVEN WITH THE FIXED COST UH DOWN 16% RENEWABLES THE MARGINS WERE DOWN DESPITE A BIG REVENUE INCREASE SO I GUESS WHAT'S THE CONVICTION THAT OPERATIONAL INEFFICIENCIES WILL NOT SWALLOW UP A LOT OF THESE COST SAVINGS OVER THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR WELL I THINK YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT BUSINESS BY BUSINESS RIGHT UM IF- IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN POWER UH CLEARLY THE- THE PUSH OUT BY CUSTOMERS BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN SITE UH RESTRICTIONS AND BY US ON THE BACK OF THE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS REALLY PUSHED A LOT OF HIGH MARGIN UH REVENUE OUT OF THE QUARTER AND PROBABLY OUT OF THE FIRST HALF THAT WAS ON TOP OF UH SOME COST UH PRESSURES OF- OF OUR OWN MAKING WHICH WE NEED TO UH WE NEED TO IMPROVE UPON BUT I THINK IN- IN- IN POWER I BELIEVE THAT THE TEAM IS DOING A VERY NICE JOB WORKING OFF THE UH THE- THE SO-CALLED INHERITANCE TAXES DRIVING REAL COST UH IMPROVEMENTS YOU SEE THAT IN THE HEAD COUNT REDUCTIONS HERE IN THE FIRST QUARTER UH AND AS WE GET TO A MORE NORMALIZE SERVICE ENVIRONMENT I THINK YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SEE THAT UH THAT TURNAROUND CONTINUE TO UH TO TAKE FLIGHT I THINK IN RENEWABLES JULIAN IT'S A IT'S A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC UH YES WE HAD UH PHENOMENAL REVENUE GROWTH IN THE QUARTER DOUBLED THE UH THE ON-SHORE UH TURBINE DELIVERIES HERE IN THE U.S. GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE BIT BETTER PRICE GOT A BETTER POINT OF PRICE WHICH IS ENCOURAGING TO SEE BUT UH IT IS BY NATURE A- A VERY LOW GROWTH MARGIN BUSINESS SO THE GROWTH ISN'T HIGH CALORIE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD A- A- A- A FEW UH WHAT WE THINK ARE ONE-OFFS BUT THEY'RE NOT ONE-OFFS UNTIL THEY GO AWAY PERMANENTLY UH COST AND EXECUTION ISSUES ALL THE WHILE THE UH THE TURNAROUNDS IN HYDRO AND GRID ARE- ARE I THINK MOVING FORWARD BUT IT'S EARLY DAYS AND THEY HAVE A- A NUMBER OF INHERITANCE TAXES THAT WILL TAKE A FEW YEARS TO UH TO WORK THROUGH SO I- I THINK THE COST ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY WILL ACCELERATE THOSE TURNAROUNDS IN POWER AND RENEWABLES THEY'RE DEALING WITH DIFFERENT UH DYNAMICS IN THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES UM AND THAT'S REALLY WHY I THINK I HAVE THE- THE- THE CONFIDENCE TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT THE DECREMENTAL MARGIN SEQUENTIALLY UH TO IMPROVE THAT THE RESTRUCTURING AND COST ACTIONS SHOULD PRESENT THEMSELVES UH IN- IN- IN PRO IN IMPROVED DECREMENTALS IN THE BACK HALF BUT WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO TO- TO MAKE THAT UH TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN GREAT THANK YOU FROM WOLF RESEARCH WE HAVE NIGEL <UNK> PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS JULIAN HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND UH CAROLINA GREAT TO UH SEE YOU ON BOARD UM SO LOOK WE APPRECIATE ALL THE COLOR AND- AND SLIDES AND- YOU BET ADDITIONAL COLOR IN- IN THE IN THE QUEUE UM SO IS- IS LARRY IS IT NOW A BASE CASE THAT INDUSTRIAL FREE CASHFLOW WILL BE NEGATIVE AND MAYBE JUST ADDRESS THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT UH YOU KNOW UH CASH BURN THIS YEAR UH OR YOU KNOW IS THERE ENOUGH ON THE ON THE COST OUT AND- AND THE WORKING CAPITAL SIDE TO MAYBE MITIGATE SOME OF THAT PRESSURE AND KEEP THE INDUSTRIAL FREE CASH RELATIVELY STEADY YEAH I- I- I THINK WHAT UM I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO- TO SHARE THIS MORNING NIGEL IS THAT UM PROBABLY THREE THINGS ONE WE- WE'VE- WE'VE BEEN VERY WE'VE BEEN HIT HARD AND FAST HERE RIGHT IN UM SOME OF OUR UH MOST IMPORTANT HIGHEST MARGIN BUSINESSES BE IT AVIATION IN SERVICES PARTICULARLY UM GAS/POWER SERVICES UH PDX AND- AND HEALTHCARE WE THINK THAT THAT UH GETS- GETS WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER PARTICULARLY HERE IN THE SECOND QUARTER WITH A FULL UH A- A FULL EFFECT IT'S UNCERTAIN AS TO UH HOW THINGS PLAY OUT FROM UH FROM HERE UH WE'RE GONNA ACKNOWLEDGE THAT UNCERTAINTY HENCE THE UH THE- THE- THE- THE PULLING OF THE GUIDE UH BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA SIT BACK AND HOPE THAT IT ALL PASSES WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE THE VIEW THAT UH WE'VE GOT A SHARP V BOUNCE COMING HENCE THE UH THE TWO BILLION OF- OF COST ACTIONS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND THE THREE BILLION OF- OF CASH ACTIONS WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN UH TO- TO CONTROL OUR DESTINY HERE WITHOUT IMPAIRING THE UH THE LONG-TERM VALUE AND THE LONG-TERM TRAJECTORY OF OUR COMPANY UH SO WE'RE TELLING YOU WHAT WE KNOW TODAY UH WE WISH WE UH WE KNEW MORE BUT THAT IS REALLY THE UH STATE OF PLAY RIGHT NOW AND- AND THE APPROACH THE HEADSET THAT WE'RE TAKING TO IT OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT LARRY THANKS AND THEN UM YOU KNOW I THOUGHT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE REAL HIGHLIGHTS OF THE QUARTER WAS THE UNDERLYING STRENGTH OF THE HEALTHCARE MARGINS UH YOU KNOW EX EVEN EX BIOPHARMA YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY GIVEN SOME OF THE HEADWINDS YOU FACE IN THERE SO WE'RE SEEING STRENGTH IN SMALL EQUIPMENT AND- AND PRESSURE IN BIG IRON HOW DOES THAT MIX LOOK THOUGH WHEN- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE- THE- THE- THE MIX ON SMALLER YOU KNOW PATIENT MONITORING EQUIPMENT ET CETERA VERSUS THE BIG IRON HOW DOES THAT EQUIPMENT MIX UH PLAY OUT UH TO THE MARGINS WELL WE UH WE- WE CERTAINLY I- I THINK THE- THE KEY THING TO KEEP IN MIND NIGEL IS UM THE- THE BIG IRON CERTAINLY GOT HIT UM THE- THE- THE LOWER UM- UH THE LOWER TICKET THE- THE LOWER PRICE POINTS BE IT PATIENT MONITORS VENTILATORS AND THE LIKE CERTAINLY GOT UH QUITE- <LAUGH> QUITE A BOOST BUT IT'S A SM IT'S A SMALL PART OF THE UH OF THE OF THE BUSINESS UH SO THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF MIX THERE UM BUT- BUT NOT A LOT IT WAS REALLY MORE A FUNCTION YOU KNOW FRANKLY OF- OF THE TEAM DOING A NICE JOB MORE BROADLY RECOGNIZING THAT ABSENT BIOPHARMA UH WE NEEDED TO TEND TO THE CORE COST STRUCTURE IN ALL ITS FORM UM IN THE HCS BUSINESS RIGHT WE- WE'VE BEEN GROWING HEALTHCARE UH BIOPHARMA LEADING THE WAY WE GOT SOME GOOD MARGIN SUPPORT FROM THAT BUSINESS THE LAST UH SEVERAL YEARS WELL NOW AS WE THINK ABOUT THE $17 BILLION CORE THE TEAM'S REALLY I THINK PUT THEIR SIGHTS THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS ON GROWING THAT BUSINESS GROWING IT WITH A CREED OF MARGINS AND IT'S REALLY THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT THAT- THAT I THINK YOU SEE A BIT HERE IN THE FIRST QUARTER BEFORE WE UH- UH WE- WE GOT HIT WE GOT HIT A LITTLE BIT LATER NOT AS MUCH UH YOU'LL SEE MORE OF THAT UNFORTUNATELY HERE IN THE SECOND QUARTER UH BUT I THINK YOU'VE GOT A TEAM WHO THINKS THAT LIKE MANY OTHER MED TECH COMPANIES THEY CAN GROW MID OR LOW TO MID SINGLE DIGITS OVER TIME AND UH PUT MORE DIGITAL INTO THE MIX BETTER COST THAT SHOULD UH GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW WITH A CREED OF MARGINS ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT <UNK> LAID OUT IN DECEMBER AND I- I HAVE NO LESS CONVICTION ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT UH TODAY THAN- THAN WE DID WHEN WE MADE THAT PRESENTATION AGAIN MINDFUL THAT WE'VE GOT SOME UH GYRATIONS HERE IN THE IN THE NEAR-TERM TO DEAL WITH RIGHT OKAY THANKS LARRY GOOD LUCK HEY THANKS NIGEL HEY BRANDON- THANKS NIGEL UH WE- WE ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUR SO BRANDON WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUR SO WE CAN JUST TAKE ONE MORE QUESTION SURE FROM RBC CAPITAL MARKETS WE HAVE DEAN <UNK> PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU UH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE WISHING EVERYONE GOOD HEALTH AND ADD MY WELCOME TO CAROLINA THANK YOU HEY JUST UH- GOOD MORNING DEAN GOOD- GOOD MORNING JUST TWO QUESTIONS UH BOTH AVIATION UM LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT STRUCTURAL COST OUT AND LARRY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HOW HAVE YOU BALANCED THE UH THE STRUCTURAL COST OUT IN AVIATION WITH RIFTS AND- AND BALANCING THE RIFTS AND FURLOUGHS VERSUS HOW YOU MIGHT BE COMPROMISING THE ABILITY TO BOUNCE BACK UH WHEN IT DOES RAMP BACK UP SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION AND THEN THE SECOND ONE JUST TO MAKE SURE I HEARD IT CORRECTLY WERE THERE UH DID YOU QUANTIFY THE LEAD CANCELLATIONS IN THE QUARTER I KNOW THERE WAS DELIVERY DEFERRALS OUR EXPERIENCE IN 2008 WAS THAT YOU DID NOT SEE MANY OUTRIGHT ENGINE CANCELLATIONS BECAUSE CUSTOMERS WOULD LOSE THAT NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT SO WHAT'S THE EXPECTATION HERE IN TERMS OF ENGINE CANCELLATIONS THAT'S IT FOR ME THANK YOU D- DEAN UH- UH MAYBE I'LL TAKE THE FIRST PART OF THAT AND- AND PERHAPS CAROLINA CAN TAKE THE SECOND UM I- I THINK WE ARE MINDFUL UH EVER MINDFUL THAT THERE WILL BE A RECOVERY RIGHT AND WE AND WE WANT TO BE WELL POSITIONED FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE VERY GOOD BUSINESS FOR GE FOR- FOR UM DECADES UM BUT I- I THINK WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO AGAIN EMBRACE OUR REALITY UH AND TAKE THE- THE COST ACTIONS IN THE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS AND MORE BROADLY AT AVIATION UH MINDFUL THAT WE'VE GOT A PERIOD OF TIME HERE UH OF AN UNKNOWN DURATION BUT IT'S- IT'S NOT GONNA BE MEASURED IN MONTHS RIGHT WHERE THAT BUSINESS IS GONNA BE UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE SO AFTER UH- UH A PERIOD OF TIME AS- AS THE AFTERMARKET UH HAS- HAS GROWN AS IT HAS THE LAST THE LAST DECADE UH THIS IS GONNA GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO UH TO RETHINK TO RE TO- TO CONSOLIDATE ALL THE WHILE UH MINDFUL OF OUR OBLIGATIONS TO CUSTOMERS UH THE NATURE OF HOW THE FOOTPRINT HAS CHANGED UH THE CHANGES THAT ARE PROBABLY STILL- STILL- STILL COMING SO THERE- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VARIABLES UH IT'S- IT'S VERY MUCH A- A WORK IN PROGRESS AS WELL BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT LINE OF SIGHT TO BUILD ON SOME OF THE TEMPORARY ACTIONS TO UH TO TAKE PERMANENT UH ACTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- WE HAVE A LEAN COST STRUCTURE WITH ADEQUATE CAPACITY TO UH TO COME OUT OF UH THE- THE DOWNTURN HERE UH WELL POSITIONED TO PERFORM BOTH FOR CUSTOMERS AND FOR INVESTORS THANK YOU WE'LL NOW TURN IT BACK TO STEVE <UNK> FOR CLOSING REMARKS WELL DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ON- YEAH YEAH SECOND QUESTION GO AHEAD CAROLINA SORRY GO AHEAD YEP <CROSSTALK> YEAH- GO AHEAD GO AHEAD CAROLINA YEAH YOU WERE RIGHT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY MENTIONED THAT IN MY IN MY NOTES THAT I LEFT IN OUR UH BACKLOG WHICH WAS UH FLAT SEQUENTIALLY AND UP 22% VERSUS PRIOR YEAR THAT DID INCLUDE ROUGHLY 200 <INAUDIBLE> ORDER CANCELLATIONS IN THE QUARTER UH BUT I WOULD SAY THE PROGRESS REFUNDS ARE VERY SMALL SO FAR UM BUT ON TOP OF THAT WE ALSO SAW <UNK> RIGHT SO WE HAVE G CAST CANCELLATION <INAUDIBLE> IN APRIL SO THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER AVIATION BACKLOG GREAT TH-

Thanks, brandon. Good morning and welcome to ge's first quarter, twenty twenty earnings call. i'm joined by our chairman and ceo, larry culp, and cfo, carolyn dibattista. before we start, i'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available on our website. note that some of the statements we are making are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. as described in our sec filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes. WITH THAT, I'LL HAND THE CALL OVER TO LAURY STEVE THANKS, GOOD MORNING EVERYONE WE HOPE YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES ARE HEALTHY AND SAFE OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH ALL THOSE AFFECTED BY THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC WE RECOGNIZE THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TIME FOR EVERYONE ON BEHALF OF G E I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY MANY OF WHOM WERE PRIVILEGED TO CALL OUR CUSTOMERS W Entirely to protect all of us thank you when we last spoke during our outlook call in march we were encouraged by the continued strength in aviation and healthcare and the progress made in power and renewables in the eight weeks since the world has fundamentally changed as we all know the covid nineteen pandemic evolved rapidly hitting hard and hitting fast while this is an earnings call our goal today is to provide you with the following most current and relevant information we have and as always to be as open and transparent as we possibly can so forgive us if we run a little long today the covid nineteen dynamics at g e like the economy at large are fluid and still evolving but clearly challenging in the near term with that i'll start with our response to covid nineteen carolina who is joining our earnings call for the first time will cover the financials then i'll wrap with a more in-depth view of our current operations moving to slide two during this unprecedented time we're focused on three areas first the health and safety of our employees and our communities we established a covid nineteen task force that is working to ensure we're doing everything in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with various government directives and medical advisories in real time to that end we've encouraged those employees who were not directly performing customer facing essential jobs To work from home wherever possible but given the mission critical work we do at ge, not everyone can stay home i'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers supporting essential services like hospitals power generation airlines and national defense we're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely this includes temperature screenings, face coverings, and gloves as necessary and physical distancing all keeping with national, state, and local guidelines. i'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other. we recently established an employee relief fund and more than seventy five senior leaders across g e have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis. our second priority is continuing to serve our customers. in healthcare we are ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose and treat covid nineteen patients including respiratory ct monitoring solutions, x ray anesthesia and point of care ultrasound product lines already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the end of june healthcare's digital and ai solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients at once and automate routine tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused on life-saving work across all of our businesses, we're in constant communication with employees, customers, suppliers, and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption our third priority is preserving our strength first and foremost, sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains a key focus with the recent closing of the biopharma transaction, we've received Twenty billion dollars of net proceeds this provides ge with optionality to protect our company and remain flexible and importantly, we retained a seventeen billion dollar leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem striving for precision health preserving our strength in a time like this also requires a different operating model here i draw on my experiences as a ceo managing through nine eleven and the global financial crisis there are three steps in this model embrace reality redesign winning and execute the plan easy to say hard to do starting with embrace reality this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed and remains uncertain for us it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may be for a while we wish they were otherwise but that's not our reality next redesign winning and execute the plan easy to say hard to do starting with embrace reality this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed and remains uncertain for us it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may be for a while we wish it were otherwise but that's not our reality next redesign winning and execute the plan easy to say hard to do starting with embrace reality this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed and remains Winning we came into twenty twenty with a plan that defined winning as profitable growth, margin expansion, and cash generation. now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team. let me share some ways we're doing this. while safety has always been a top priority for g e, covid nineteen has reshaped our safety agenda in terms of our financial priorities, improving our cash generation and deleterious margins in the second half are our key focus areas and in healthcare. we clearly didn't come into the year expecting to increase our ventilator production fourfold but we will and finally execute the plan we're moving with speed, discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure to already more than two billion of cost actions and more than three billion of cash actions and this is where lean is particularly relevant from daily management to traditional kanban systems which help reset inventory levels to do problem-solving tools we're rolling out across g. E e let me share a recent example from gas power in our greenville facility the team used lean to cut the distance that a single part travels during production from three miles yes three miles to a mere one hundred and sixty five feet flashing the time it took to make that part by forty two percent these are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this environment so that's our approach here we're facing the pandemic head on while continuing Aiming to execute our long-term strategy for g e moving to slide three you'll find a snapshot of our first quarter results and carolina will take you through this in detail but first a few top-line thoughts as we noted we entered the year with momentum however as covid nineteen continued to spread globally and i'm not going to sugarcoat this we got hit hard and some of our highest margin parts of our best performing businesses this is especially true at aviation services where covid nineteen caused a rapid decline in commercial aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the second half of march a similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions caused by covid nineteen impacted our field personnel and across all of our businesses we started to see some project fulfillment and execution issues at the same time healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products in the fight against the virus Covid nineteen taking a step back, about eighty percent of our roughly four hundred billion dollar backlog is in services which have a long time horizon and while services have been hurt in the near term, those capabilities remain one of our greatest strengths they keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships especially through periods of volatility so in the spirit of embracing reality, let me frame for you what we're seeing right now at a high level and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then I'll do a deeper dive after carolina reviews the first quarter in aviation and at gcas airlines are conserving cash, not flying the planes they have, limiting maintenance, spending where they can, and all the while deferring orders in many places no one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume but the reality is likely it's not soon so we're redefining winning from margin expansion in twenty twenty to improving our deleterious margins this year murchison Requires we aggressively adjust our cost structure that's what winning looks like for aviation and they're moving forward with a comprehensive plan to be clear we'll get back to targeting those twenty percent operating margins post pandemic in healthcare we've been on the front lines battling covid nineteen since the early days in wuhan this is fundamental to our mission while we've seen demand surge for certain products other products including those in our high margin pharmaceutical diagnostics division the diagnostics business have been negatively impacted as multiple procedures are deferred healthcare is likely to rebound faster than aviation but we're still fast tracking additional cost out actions targeting an incremental seven hundred million dollars since caren and the team spoke with you in december in power and renewable energy the impact of covid nineteen has been more limited to date specifically at power where we're experiencing outages and restrictions restrictions in field service travel and we're monitoring new unit orders and services to offset this. we're further right-sizing the cost structure and in power, we've already reduced headcount by seven hundred in the first quarter. now, clearly, across ge, there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point, including the full duration, magnitude, and pace of recovery across our end markets, operations, and supply chains. we're also monitoring new unit orders and services to offset this. we're further right-sizing the cost structure and in power, we've already reduced headcount by seven hundred in the first quarter. now, clearly, across ge, there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point, including the full duration, magnitude, and pace of recovery across our end markets, operations, and supply chains. we're The resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations and our run-off insurance business. so let me tell you what we do know. the second quarter will be the first full quarter with pressure from covid nineteen and we expect that our financial results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year. the bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead but this too shall pass. i'm confident the underlying reset we took over the last eighteen months will help us navigate these challenges. To focus ge's portfolio and instill a greater focus on customers and lean give us a running start for what we face today moreover i see in our response to covid nineteen signs of how we're moving faster to change ge for the good more lean work to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges in aviation travel restrictions spurring the use of remote digital technology to complete field work and renewals and more capital Discipline across the board with new leaders assimilating faster and with real impact healthcare comes to mind so all of this in combination with the planned actions we'll discuss later are accelerating our transformation of g e with that i'll turn it over to carolina but before i do let me say how pleased i am to have her on board in two short months it's clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality an operational bias for action and executing with speed Thank you Larry, I am proud to join my first earnings call as CEO of GE and help lead this company forward. As you noted, we're operating in unprecedented times and we've focused on first keeping our financial position strong and safe with a keen eye on leverage and liquidity as well as cash flow and capital discipline. GE's actions over the last couple of years have put us on stronger footing ahead. in this situation, we will do more second, working with our businesses to take the right actions not only to help mitigate the impact of covid nineteen but to serve customers better operate smarter and more efficiently and integrate lean more holistically while larry and i are focused on the near term, we're also managing for the long term we're working together to reduce complexity at g&e and build a lean culture that delivers sustainable earnings and cash flow generation Today, my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that will help you see what i see across the businesses. with that, let's turn to slide four. this was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated. taking it from the top, first quarter orders were down three percent organically or down four ex biopharma growth in power and healthcare was offset by double-digit declines in aviation and renewable. both equipment and service orders were down low single digits i'll cover this by business shortly industrial revenue was down five percent organically or down six ex biopharma with equipment revenue flat and services down nine percent both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to covid nineteen adjusted industrial profit margins were down four hundred and fifty basis points organically most of the dilution came from aviation and renew with the aviation impact mostly driven by covid nineteen now let's discuss the eps walk starting at continuing eps of seventy two cents there was a seventy five cent gain primarily related to the eleven point nine billion after tax gain from the biopharmaceuticals which also included one cent of tax benefit in gil capital this was partially offset by a four point six billion after tax loss on our remaining baker hughes stake which we measure at fair value value edge quarter on restructuring and other items, we incurred two cents of charges. this is principally related to the reduction of aviation's u.s. workforce. lastly, non-operating pension and other benefit plans were six cents a head within the quarter. excluding these items, adjusted eps was five cents as described earlier, our earnings performance was materially impacted by covid nineteen and other market dynamics. this was primarily in aviation and gas capital. Negative marks and impairments in both cash and insurance as well as higher credit costs we estimate the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from covid nineteen roughly seven hundred million drivers included lower aftermarket sales project delays and supply chain constraints this impact is higher than we anticipated at the march outlook call reflecting the rapid global progress of the pandemic while our prior forecasts largely reflected the impact of covid nineteen this impact is higher than we anticipated at the march outlook call reflecting the rapid global progress of the pandemic while our prior forecasts largely reflected the impact of covid nineteen this impact is higher than we anticipated at the march outlook call reflecting the rapid global progress of the pandemic while our prior forecasts largely reflected the impact of covid nineteen this impact is higher than we anticipated at the march outlook call reflecting the The slowdown in china our focus on addressing this pandemic is global we're targeting more than two billion of costs out this year while this may not off set the full impact we're rapidly addressing both cost and cash and making our businesses more agile and customer focused over time i can tell you from my experience that as these programs build momentum and the company leaders begin to see how powerful results can be they tend to extend beyond their stated goals just as i have seen since So far, i'm encouraged that we can have some of that sale experience at g. moving to cash as many of you know, the first quarter is typically low for our free cash flow this year were impacted by our usual seasonality but also covid nineteen, especially in aviation. industrial free cash flow was a use of two point two billion one billion worse than prior year but notably, excluding aviation, each industrial business improved free cash flow versus last year. Turning to the key drivers in the quarter starting with net earnings if you exclude the biopharmaceuticals and the mark-to-market on our baker hughes investment income depreciation and amortization totalled seven hundred million that's down nine hundred million versus prior year next working capital negative two point six billion for the significant use of cash down one point one billion let me take you through the main factors first we had a net inflow in Accounts receivable, driven by a seasonally lower volume in gas power and renewables. second, we had an outflow in accounts payable, driven by a lower volume in aviation and higher disbursements related to prior year material buys in renewables. third, we increased inventory to support an expected second and third quarter volume ramp in onshore wind and shop output declined in aviation. fourth, progress collections were a use of cash as new orders and milestones were achieved. Payments were more than offset by burn down of prior progress payments in power and renewables lastly, we also spent about six hundred million in gross capex we're on track now to reduce twenty five percent of our capex spend this year for cash flow in total we estimate the first quarter impact from covid nineteen was around one billion the majority of which was felt in aviation as we look forward we expect continued free cash flow pressure retirement Serving more than three billion in cash actions however, over time we know that each business can be a better cash generator as we improve execution moving to slide six we continue to strengthen our balance sheet the largest milestone in the quarter was closing biopharma with twenty billion of proceeds we ended the quarter with thirty three point eight billion of industrial cash up approximately sixteen billion sequentially t e capital ended with thirty one billion Point five billion of cash sound approximately five point three billion sequentially driven by contractual maturities we continue to hold a liquidity balance covering twelve months of gd maturities we've recently taken action to enhance and expand our liquidity and pay down debt on april seventeenth g e entered into a three year fifteen billion syndicated revolving credit facility this was the planned refinancing of g's prior twenty billion syndicated revolver credit facility including bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of twenty billion in total credit line access going forward following the sale of biopharma we also improved our liquidity profile in april we reduced our near-term debt maturities by issuing six billion in gd debt in april and subsequently tendering for four point two billion of debt we plan to use the remaining one point eight billion of proceeds to further debt reduction and the combination of transaction will therefore be levered new following this g e capital g e industrial has no debt maturities in twenty twenty one one point nine billion of maturities in twenty twenty two and nine hundred million in twenty twenty three at g e industrial we reduced debt by approximately seven billion we reduced commercial paper used by one point one billion in the quarter and repaid six billion of the intercompany loans from g e to g e industrial in april using proceeds from biopharma at g e capital in april we reduced debt by approximately seven billion we reduced commercial paper used by one point one billion in the quarter and repaid six billion of the intercompany loans from g e to g e capital in april using proceeds from biopharma at g e capital in april we reduced debt by approximately seven billion we reduced commercial paper used by one point one billion in the quarter and repaid six billion of the intercompany loans we reduced debt by four billion so we reduced external debt by ten billion ytd including four point seven billion of maturities in the quarter and an additional five point four billion of twenty twenty maturities tendered in april offset by g's six billion repayment of the intercompany loan our financial policy goals remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than two point five times net debt to gbic at g our financial policy goals remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than two point five times net debt to gbic at g our financial policy goals remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than two point five times net debt to gbic at g our financial policy goals remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than two point five times net debt to gbic at g our financial policy goals remain maintaining a Industrial and less than four times debt to equity at gib capital a credit rating in the single a range and reinvesting a dividend in line with peers over time we remain committed to achieving our leveraged targets but we now expect to achieve those targets over a longer period than previously anticipated due to the impact of covid nineteen next on slide seven we'll discuss the industrial segment's results starting with aviation As we've noted, our first quarter results were materially impacted. Orders were down thirteen percent organically, with both equipment and service orders down. Equipment orders were down twenty-seven percent, primarily driven by commercial aerospace business due to the max grounding and the covid impact. Service orders were down four percent, primarily driven by commercial services, partially offset by military. Which one new fighter and helicopter service orders from the u. s. do. Service Orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders which were up sixty percent year over year. Backlog of two hundred and seventy three billion was flat sequentially and up twenty two percent versus prior year primarily driven by long-term service agreements. This included roughly two hundred and one lvdi unit cancellations in the quarter. Revenue was down eleven percent organically. Equipment revenue was down seventeen percent. We shipped four hundred and seventy two commercial products. install and spare engine units this quarter down thirty seven versus prior year sales of two hundred and seventy two dip one a and one b units were down one hundred and fifty two and cfm fifty six units were down ninety eight units service revenue was down eight percent due to commercial services down eleven percent this was driven by lower spare part shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of covid nineteen total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down total military revenue was down seven percent with a hundred and forty six engine units shipped down nine percent and this was driven by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound material lead times partly offset by the advance programs growth operating profit was down thirty nine percent organically primarily on lower volume and negative mix pressure in commercial services from the impact of covid nineteen and lower spare engine units segment margin contracted six hundred and fifty basis points organically This was primarily due to covid nineteen impacting our commercial businesses in both engines and services the continued seven three seven max grounding the non-repetition of prior year favorable contract adjustments and the first full quarter of revenue from our aero derivative business now that we have deconsolidated pegasus to add a bit more color covid nineteen represents just over half of the year-over-year margin difference seven three seven max timing considering insights Stall and spare engine volumes and supply chain costs represent additional twenty percent of inventory moving to healthcare which performed well orders were up nine percent organically equipment orders were up fourteen percent and services were up one healthcare orders excluding vaccine were up six percent driven by a surge demand related to covid nineteen this was partially offset by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related to covid nineteen Examples like m r and interventional in healthcare systems as well as contrast media and nuclear tracers in pharmaceutical diagnostics life sciences orders were up ten percent backlog was seventeen point four billion down six percent sequentially and down three versus prior year due to the sale of bayer so excluding biopharma backlog was up one percent sequentially and four versus prior year revenue was up two percent organically and one percent excluding biopharma revenue was up two percent organically and one percent excluding biopharma revenue was up two percent organically and one percent excluding biopharma revenue was up two percent organically and one percent excluding biopharma revenue was up two percent organically and one percent excluding biopharma revenue was up two percent organically and one percent excluding biopharma revenue was up two percent organically health care systems revenue was up two percent with services and three percent with equipment flat life sciences was up four percent operating profit was up ten percent organically segment margin expanded the hundred and forty basis points organically or thirty basis points excluding biopharma this was driven by volume and cost productivity offset by price and logistics pressures from covid nineteen next on power we had mixed results with equipment. Top-line strength or faced by challenges in services orders were up fourteen percent organically gas power orders were up eight percent with equipment orders up thirty-seven percent largely due to one-turn key orders we booked two point two gigawatts of orders for nine gas turbines gas power service orders were down three percent with contractual services down and transactional upgrades roughly flat power portfolio orders were up twenty-seven percent with strong equipment and service growth. orders in steam and power conversion backlog close to eighty five billion flat sequentially and down one percent versus prior year gas backlog was seventy one billion flat sequentially revenue was down twelve percent organically largely driven by services in gas power revenue was down twelve percent organically on higher hedge turbine mix we shipped nine gas turbines versus sorry we shipped nine gas turbines seven gas turbines versus nine gas turbines in the first quarter of nineteen we helped our customers achieve commercial operations on over thirty two units translating to almost four point seven gigawatts of new power added to the grid that power services revenue was down ninety percent scantly as outages this and transactional sales pushed out of the quarter due to covid nineteen and we had lower revenue on higher margin upgrades despite this services would still have been down in the quarter This was driven by supply-based constraints on hot gas path parts and outage costs overall, pressing our csaa margin rates. power portfolio revenue was down twelve percent. this was driven by lower volumes across the subsegments. in steel, we had lower services, backlogs, and convertibility. in nuclear, the decline was driven by outage timing and in power conversion, we refined our sales paradigm focused on higher margin market segments. operating profit was down two hundred and thirty. ninety million and segment margin contracted five hundred and seventy basis points organically while gas powered cost cuts were down nine percent sequentially and sixteen versus prior year this was more than offset by lower service volume and additional costs from covid nineteen disruption next on renewals continue revenue growth was more than offset by fulfillment and execution issues impacting profitability orders were down eleven percent organically Equipment were down eleven as we recycle a stronger u s p t c and services were down twenty three percent a positive spot in the quarter was international orders which were up eleven percent backlog of twenty six point five billion was down four percent sequentially but up five percent versus prior year revenue was up twenty eight percent organically this was mainly driven by onshore wind up sixty percent Percentage with the new unit turbine deliveries of seven hundred and thirty one more than double prior year and repower kit deliveries of two hundred and nineteen up forty percent onshore services revenue excluding repower kits was up fifteen percent onshore order pricing index continues to stabilize at one percent in line with leading trends grid revenue was down eight percent mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones driven by covid nineteen operating losses Was down a hundred and fifteen million this was driven by the supply chain disruptions due to covid nineteen, fulfillment delays and the non-recurrence of a non-gain non-cash gain from an offshore wind contract termination in the prior year this was partially offset by higher onshore wind volume segment margin contracted two hundred and eleven basis points mainly driven by the same items mentioned above and the range of execution issues we're fixing at grid and hydro Moving to slide 8 starting with g i capital in the quarter adjusted continuing operations generated a net loss of a hundred and eighteen million this excludes the impact of the capital loss tax benefit utilized against biopharma gain resulting in eighty eight million of earnings compared to prior year which excludes excludes the u s tax reform benefit continuing net earnings was unfavorable by a hundred and fifty four million this was due to a negative mark to market adjustment and impairments at gcas and insurance lower gains and lower earnings from a smaller asset base this was partially offset by lower excess interest costs and sgna they ended the quarter with a hundred and one billion of assets excluding liquidity this was down one billion sequentially primarily driven by gcas due to asset sales depreciation and collections partially offset by new volume insurance assets were flat sequentially as a decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily by gcas due to asset sales depreciation and collections partially offset by new volume insurance assets were flat sequentially as a decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily by gcas due to asset sales depreciation and collections partially offset by new volume insurance assets were flat sequentially as a decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily by gcas due to asset sales depreciation and collections partially offset by new volume insurance assets were By higher market rates was offset by the annual insurance capital contribution supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continue to migrate to mufg as noted earlier capital ended the quarter with thirteen point five billion of liquidity capital also ended with fifty four point five billion of debt which was down four point five billion sequentially driven by debt maturities these continued operations generated a net loss A hundred and sixty four million which was unfavorable versus prior year by two hundred million we still plan to provide the required support to g e capital in line with insurance statutory funding next just like our businesses corporate needs to adjust to our new realities and we are continuing to take additional structural actions to rationalize costs and reduce the size at corporate looking at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were three hundred and seventy four million eight percent Hire, but that's primarily due to hire company profit elimination, which would be partially offset by better digital performance from continued cost reduction actions. functions and operations were twenty five percent lower, primarily driven by g e digital's improvement. you can see from digital's performance that the focus cost reduction programs are gaining traction. we continue to right size our functional costs across g e and push more accountability into the divisions mary and i are here. I am conducting cost and cash reviews of each of the businesses with fresh eyes in the current environment so you can expect that there will be more to come. stay tuned i have spent most of my career in leadership at lean decentralized companies fundamentally i believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers businesses to take the right actions quickly this type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with covid nineteen but We also have to be prepared to pivot to growth. we're working toward this goal and there will be more to come. with that, thank you larry. carolina, thank you. there is no question that covid nineteen is putting real pressure on our businesses. given that so much has changed, and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure from covid nineteen, i'd like to spend some time here discussing second quarter. Order trending based on what we're seeing through the month of april. so starting with aviation on slide nine of all of our industrial segments, this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely. the rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets. we'll cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail but on the other end of the spectrum The demand for our military business remains strong to that end we've rebalanced some of our capacity to meet this increased demand to offset some pressure in the commercial business we're taking several steps that while painful preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve we've previously announced five hundred to one billion dollars in costs and cash actions and we've now increased this targeting more than one billion in cost actions and more than two billion in cash actions. billion in cash actions this will be achieved through different initiatives some of which have been completed others in flight as we speak these include a ten percent reduction in aviation's total u s. workforce and furloughs impacting fifty percent of its u s. maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities and new engine manufacturers will continue to monitor and potentially extend as required we are also focused on reducing the discretionary and cap x spend and optimizing working capital i know aviation's de minimis margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors and carolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter while we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the second quarter our expectations are that the cost actions we are undertaking will improve de minimis margins in the back half of the year while there are many uncertainties i expect we will exit the year with with a much lower de minimis margin than what you saw in the first quarter. so make no mistake, driving improvement here is our number one focus. as we think about the full year, we're tracking travel restrictions, carrier and passenger behavior disease countermeasures and freight demand, all of which will impact air cargo departures and revenue passenger kilometers. while we're seeing an unprecedented decline in twenty twenty, we're taking action and david and the team are working proactively with our customers to address these challenges. customers to navigate through this crisis so spending a little more time on commercial services which represented three point three billion dollars of revenue in the first quarter let's go to slide ten as you can see on the left side departures across the full industry were strong in the first quarter before rapidly declining in mid-march as we look at it this week focused on the ge and cfm fleet global departures are down approximately seventy five percent roughly sixty percent of the cfm fleet is parked today in line with this, we also see significant headwinds in global shop visits which were down low double digits in the first quarter as airlines defer short-term maintenance and we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better with some potential to moderate in the latter half of the year depending on the variables just outlined based on what we're seeing through the month of april in the second quarter, we're seeing shop visits down roughly sixty percent and csa billings down roughly forty percent Fifty percent. additionally, we expect this significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure our csa margins. that said, when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time ge is well positioned with the largest and youngest install base of all engine manufacturers. additionally, roughly sixty-two percent of our ge cfm fleet has seen one shop visit or the less and this will generate demand upon recovery we have more narrow bodies that are ten years or younger than than the narrow body installed base of the rest of the industry and when we see a pickup in air travel demand we expect narrow bodies will recover most quickly over all it was a challenging quarter and we're expecting additional pressure here in the second but our cost actions will alleviate some of the pressure in the second half of twenty twenty moving to commercial engines Which represented one point five billion dollars in revenue in the first quarter. in light of covid nineteen, airframers are producing at a lower rate. based on what we're seeing through the month of april in the second quarter, we see installed engines down roughly forty five percent and spare engines down roughly sixty percent year on year. attributable to the delivery deferrals in addition to the already planned lower production rate on the seven three seven maxes in the near term, we're right sizing production capacity and actively Managing the supply base we have very strong relationships with the airframers and an attractive value proposition is evidenced by a multiyear backlog as you'll see on the right we have strong positions sole source on two of the biggest new engine entrants and a sixty five percent win rate on the other while we acknowledge there's pressure on near term demand for new aircraft these stats demonstrate the value of g e technology we're taking the right actions to be well positioned for the post pandemic world moving to healthcare which consists of healthcare systems and pds in the second quarter to date we're seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment and the diagnosis and treatment of covid nineteen within healthcare systems now these product orders including ventilators have increased one and a half to two times versus pre pandemic levels but at the same time we're seeing reduced demand for other diagnostic products Products as certain procedures are deferred or cancelled around the world to be clear these other diagnoses are still essential and often associated with saving lives in areas including oncology and cardiology but are currently de-prioritised p d x is a similar story this is a high margin business made up of contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with procedures that are being deferred or cancelled right now several hcs product lines and most of p d x is down as much as fifty percent versus pre pandemic levels while these dynamics vary by country there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies experience different stages of the virus taking china, for example, as hospitals come back online we're seeing a ramp in previously deferred procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables healthcare is accelerating its plan transformation to expand margins post biopharma by reducing headcount fixed costs, discretionary spending and marketing spending, prioritizing r and d, deferring cap x and optimizing working capital. looking forward, we are most focused on the following indicators for healthcare: hospital admission and occupancy rates, an increase in non-covid nineteen procedures, changes in hospital cap x budgets, government spending on healthcare broadly and development of covid nineteen tests, treatments and vaccines based on our experience and expertise. china and the market in april we expect to be down in the second quarter with potential recovery afterwards. covid nineteen has highlighted the need to build and truly invest in and scale a new digitized infrastructure and quickly. we're committed to our investments in our digital edison platform and solutions like neuravir care solution which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous ventilated patients simultaneously helping to expand their capacity. Capacity while reducing their risk of exposure as our digital healthcare journey continues, we're at the center of an ecosystem striving for precision health i'm very proud of the work our team is doing to combat covid nineteen moving to power on slide nine on slide thirteen we'll talk to the current trending in the second quarter to date in dynamics at gas power and power portfolio starting with gas power and power portfolio equipment while we monitor and manage supply chain disruptions as of today we still see a pass to forty five to fifty gas turbine deliveries this year but our orders profile and therefore cash down payments worth several hundred million dollars are likely weaker due to ippp pressures in the us and mexico as we expect deal financing will become harder through the year additionally, with oil price pressure impacting middle east and ssa investment. including demand for new lng we are expecting a longer road to normalization ultimately we are sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin accretive backlog with disciplined execution in services approximately twenty percent of planned atrocities are shifting from the first half of this year due to covid nineteen field labor constraints we are also seeing pressure on upgrades primarily in the middle east where low oil prices are impacting customer budgets We are seeing g e gas turbine utilization in the u s up mid single digits due to low gas prices and the shift from coal but utilization globally is down low double digits due to lower electricity demand within power portfolio our steam business is most impacted factory closures pressured our steam operations including one facility in mumbai which was closed for approximately eight weeks in the first quarter today we're back in stock. More than seventy percent of capacity the global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in india driven by government restrictions overall we're seeing about thirty percent of aluminum shifts from the first half of this year to the second half with another ten to fifteen percent pushing into next year our power businesses are taking several measures to offset these pressures in the first quarter we reduced headcount by seven hundred notified approximately thirteen hundred contractors implemented a hiring freeze and in line with the demand profile we are taking even further actions this will serve to reduce fixed costs in twenty twenty and drive benefits in twenty twenty one looking forward we're tracking a number of items including timing of our gas turbine new order closure service outages in volume fleet utilization is the energy mix and fuel prices are impacting each region differently supplier impacts and project execution billing milestones and customer collections we're targeting to have our accelerated cost out measures drive organic margin expansion despite these demand changes moving to slide fourteen on renewables there was a limited impact of covid nineteen in the first quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution as we've said we think about renewables in three distinct operating pools starting with onshore wind while we continue to deliver at record levels in the americas we are seeing supply chain disruption at our l m wind facilities and we're monitoring key commercial milestones such as permitting and financing which could potentially cause timing delays in offshore wind certification for our industry leading turbine the haliade x remains on track we're also on plan to start delivering on our 80 unit six megawatt commitments to edf after completion this project in twenty twenty one we expect to start shifting production to the hollyoaks we're also monitoring financial closure of twenty twenty deals grid and hydro our two turnarounds are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half of our grid facilities now operating below full capacity and at grid automation we're also impacted by lower book to bill order conversion across all three of these pools we're increasing costs out in restructuring And we've identified several hundred million dollars of additional actions longer term a lower cost structure will benefit renewables relating to the global supply chain we're focused on the safe reopening of our plants globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels looking forward we're expecting a larger impact from covid nineteen in the second quarter and by business we're tracking twenty and twenty one demand impact of progress collections and potential site delays in onshore wind the risk of financing delays associated with deals at offshore project site delays at grid and hydro and the backlog at grid on slide fifteen, within g e capital, our gcass and insurance businesses are where we are feeling the largest impacts so i'll keep my comments focused there first gcass is better positioned today than in previous downturns with better asset quality, less customer concentration and more geographic diversity economy that said we're preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments as well as lease restructurings and we've had approximately eighty percent of our customers seek short-term deferrals as you may have seen we've agreed with going on a rebalancing of our seven three seven max order book second at insurance market and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment portfolio and reinvestment yields therefore we're deploying capital to Capture market dislocation investment opportunities. we're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year and similar to the industrial segments, we're implementing incremental cost and cash actions. looking forward, we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales at gcas and insurance. our seasoned teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period. so to close, our priorities are clear. we rapidly We mobilized our team in the face of covid nineteen with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees and over all the priorities we reviewed with you at the outlook call remain intact we're facing into our near term realities while continuing to manage g e for the long term when the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century our team is rising to the challenge with humility transparency and focus we continue to deliver a value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential goods supplying vital healthcare equipment and keeping the lights on and while there are many unknowns there will be another side planes will fly again healthcare will normalize and modernize and the world still needs more efficient resilient energy at the same time we're embracing this new reality we're redefining winning we're continuing to deliver a value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential goods supplying vital healthcare equipment and keeping the lights on and while there are many unknowns there will be another side planes will fly again healthcare will normalize and modernize and the world still needs more efficient resilient energy at the same time we're embracing this new reality we're redefining winning we're continuing to deliver a value for our customers en and we're executing our plan the costs and cash outlays we've taken you through this morning are a major result these moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multiyear transformation to make g e a stronger, nimbler, and more valuable company and i am confident that g e will emerge stronger with that steve let's go to questions To consider your fellow analysts again and ask one question in a follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible. brandon, can you please open the line? yes, thank you, sir. we will now begin the question and answer session. if you have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. if you would like to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key. if you're on a speaker phone, please pick up your handset first before dialing. once again, if you have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. And from vertical research, we have jeff sprague. please go ahead. thank you. good morning, everyone. help everyone as well. thanks for all the great details, jeff. good morning. i was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on how you view the kind of asset quality of the contractual service agreements and the like. there's a lot of assets there. obviously, there's at least a temporary impairment. IMPACT OF CASH FLOWS HOW DOES THAT TEST WORK HAVE YOU DONE IT YET AND ARE YOU CLOSE TO ANY PARTICULAR THRESHOLDS THERE THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT JEFF I THINK IF IF WE LOOK AT THE SERVICE BACKLOG RIGHT BROADLY JUST UNDER THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION FOR THE COMPANY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR BILLION BILLION FOR THE COMPANY Is in aviation. i suspect that's that's where your most focused we we go through those those backlog reviews and the csa reviews on a regular basis what we've done here over the last call it the last seven or eight weeks is really tighten and quicken the review process that we do with the the businesses both at aviation and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and Gcast. what we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest and if you will most most accurate information possible with respect to customer risk given given everything that's going on. so we we do that on a regular basis we did that at the end of the first quarter in in closing much as we do every quarter. clearly we've got a we've got a fluid situation and i think the the modest the modest the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the Charges that we took the modest changes in the first quarter clearly are going to play out as we go through the course of the year. we can't really scope that for you today. if you look at the csaa book in aviation, for example, as we went through the the mechanics of the future billings, the future costs related to those billings based on the information at the time, it was really just a hundred billion a hundred million dollar adjustment, non-cash. Of course, which is why you see a little bit of the earnings cash cash dynamic certainly as we go forward, we're going to be updating those those adjustments and again, we would expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines are doing with their planes but i think it's important to keep in mind again, these are ten to fifteen year agreements as you know and those adjustments are taken in the context of That particularly extended time period. great, thanks for that. and just as a follow-up, if i could, i know you don't want to get real precise on guidance, but you know, you you are pointing us to a further decline in cash flow in q two, which isn't surprising, quite frankly. but could you bracket that at all for us, what we should expect for q two, and you know, any high level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint? Yeah, Jeff, I think that we we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and didn't want to take an attempt at at framing formal guidance here today in light of all that has flown and all that is still evolving here i think that the tack we took was really to try to to share as much with you as we possibly could in terms of the the april detail business by business And acknowledge that we're going to see a more challenging second quarter here given the full impact of covid and the like but beyond that, i think that's really where we are. we we know we've got to get to work on the cost and the cash actions that's why you see us doubling that activity in aviation stepping it up elsewhere around the company so the two billion of cost, the three billion of cash will clearly help us later on In the year is those those actions take root but for today i think that's really what we're that's what we know and that's what we're comfortable sharing great thanks best of luck larry thanks from morgan's family we have josh pooker's whiskey please go ahead and josh, you might be up for this. josh, are you up for this? why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we Good luck to everybody. So, run rate minus sixty percent in terms of shop visits, fifty percent on csas. Do you think you continue to trend at this level in the second quarter or is there a more downside? andrew, the i think you're referring to page nine in the slide deck. yeah, the i think you're referring to page nine in the slide deck. yeah, the i think you're referring to page nine in the slide deck. yeah, the i think you're referring to page nine in the slide deck. yeah, the i think you're referring to page nine in the slide deck. yeah, the i think you're referring to page nine in the slide deck. yeah, the i think you're referring to page nine in the slide deck. yeah, the i think you're referring to page nine in the slide deck. Yeah, i think this is what we're, what we're seeing right now, right, and given given what the carriers have have said publicly what they're doing, we think these are these are good likely near-in run rates to share with you. again, we're not trying to offer a definitive view as to the next several quarters, but this is what we're seeing right now in the second quarter, for sure. Question on spare engine sales, i think minus sixty percent. have we lost these or will these come back when the situation normalizes. maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over the next couple of years. thank you so much. andrew, we were, we were, we were ramping spares with, with both the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the leap one a and the leap one b as the narrow body market was taking off typical early in the life of an engine activity we are clearly seeing that soften not necessarily going to zero as preparations are being made for the return to service of the max right i don't think that that opportunity is lost but i think like much of what we're seeing in aviation broadly Largely it will be it will be pushed out for a few years and again, i don't think we're taking a definitive view as to what year, what quarter, things get back to, if you will, a normalized twenty nineteen level but we recognize the discussions out there about this being a multi-year recovery, gradual, slow, think we're embracing that reality and that applies really across the portfolio both on the oe side as well as the aftermarket spares included thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe. thank you very much As it relates to kind of structural versus more kind of pandemic short-term related sure i would i would say scott as you well know that when we're in a when we're in a mode like this you're you're moving as quickly as you possibly can almost anywhere that you can so if you look at what we've announced at aviation the doubling of those activities today the the broadening Across the company if you look at the tally today, there is a decidedly short-term bias there that carolina and i are going to be working with the ceos over the coming weeks to transition to a more permanent action. right. if you look at what we did in an aviation, for example, example, in terms of the temporary lack of works that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure in that business. on a variable basis to these shockingly fast changes in demand you might categorize that as temporary. we need to work through the changes on a more permanent basis that are required in light of the length of the recovery that we're looking at. so we have confidence in these, in these numbers that we're sharing today, the two billion of costs, the three billion of cash. there's a bit of a tactical approach. Diyas today, just given how fresh this is but we will be leaning in toward making more of them permanent, recognise and know at the end of the day there will be a bit of a mix be it, be it headcount related discretionary spend on the cost side in addition to some of the working capital and certainly the cap x reduction the carolina referenced the twenty five percent reduction year on year so a lot going on and by no means is this this these headlines today the the end it's very much at work in in progress ok that's helpful larry and we think you know that the twenty billion dollars kind of came to you pretty much about perfect timing but you know does that money just sit on the balance sheet does it have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as is for the for the year can you or is it just such a big number you can start to part some of it out to you know thinking in terms of widowing down some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some of the some You know, the debt that you can you can manage well, we, it, it did come at a a good time there's, there's no question that's why we put the emphasis in in the biopharmaceutical set up on on uncertainty, right? we wanted to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the the healthcare options carolina, anything you want to add relative to managing liquidity versus leverage right here? yeah. i think it's important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared to before covid. and it's very important for us. of course, leverage is important, but liquidity is very important. and we end the quarter with forty seven billion cash, right? and that's really to cover eighteen billion of debt and equity. and we are the quarter with forty seven billion cash, right? and that's really to cover eighteen billion of debt and equity. and we are the quarter with forty seven billion cash, right? and that's really to cover eighteen billion of debt and equity. and we are the quarter with forty seven billion cash, right? and that's really to cover eighteen billion of Term debt maturities now through twenty one and actually after the april actions we are down to thirteen billion of maturities for twenty and twenty one almost all of that in capital and i would also say we know we expect to have around twenty billion in total credit lines going forward and that's really in line with our risk appetite we have the new fifteen billion three year arc that i mentioned and five billion additional lines that will be on twenty billion of credit lines and i think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we'll just say we think we Say that, you know, we, we really intend to maintain a high level of cash, i would say to maximize flexibility and that's why we're taking these actions also to de-risk our balance sheet and basically prudently manage our liquidity in these very challenging external environment and time that, that makes sense and thank you and good luck to you, guys thank you family, please go ahead, sir. all right, guys, can you hear me this time? yes, yes, clearly. josh, good morning. awesome, and i hope everyone is as well to echo earlier comments. wally, can you just give us a sense, and i know you guys have data going back eons in aviation how the impact of, of retirements and cannibalizations kind of make more of a u shape versus what you know, the air traffic may look like? Is there a natural lag between when folks start flying again and when when shop visits can happen just as a function of kind of using up some of the run time on on otherwise idle assets well josh i certainly we have we have revisited the history the team is is well-burst and in what we have seen in years past i'm not sure we've we've seen anything kind of on part With with this but there's no question that there's going to be a bias on the part of some as some of these fleet reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft and that will factor into the aftermarket much like some of the dynamics around green time and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash and how here In in in their business so i'm not sure that there is necessarily an exact model that captures what all the carriers and aggregators are going to do here a model that offers great precision. i think we do know that this that the combination of these factors is going to create pressure for us for us here in the short term i think what's most important for our business really is is cycles much more so than revenue passenger miles and as we see schedules come back as we work our way through the pandemic that will that will put us back on i think better footing but here in the short term i think we're acknowledging that we're going to see shop visits and csa buildings take on some real pressure due to the downturn understood thanks i'll leave it there Hey Steve, good morning. In early march, you guys had that slide that showed you know, two to four billion in free cash flow guidance, which is obviously off the table. But you also talked about things growing and you know, twenty one and twenty two and you know, off that kind of a three billion dollar base. I think you know most research and numbers i saw were kind of in that you know, six billion dollar range of free cash flows. A growth off of that level are we still like is are the outlier numbers still at all legit or is that you know are you are kind of withdrawing that long-term outlook as well steve i think we have admittedly been focused on taking the right actions both the cost the cash the balance sheet actions here in the short term in the face of this this unprecedented DYNAMIC PANDEMIC WE'VE TAKEN GUIDANCE OFF FOR THE YEAR. WE'RE NOT PUTTING IT BACK ON TODAY, JUST GIVEN THE UNDUE UNCERTAINTY OF IT ALL. RIGHT. SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT ANY FURTHER THAN THAT. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION, BUT I THINK FOR PURPOSES OF TODAY, WE'RE REALLY JUST TRYING TO FRAME FOR PEOPLE WHAT WE'RE SEEING. BUT THAT SAID, HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES IT TAKES TO WORK THROUGH THIS. I think we feel very good about our ability to come out stronger and get back on a on a positive cash flow growth trajectory got it, carolyn anything you would add to that well, now i think it's important to to acknowledge that by taking out costs now and part of it being structural that gives us sort of as well as mitigating the deleterious effects that helps improving the earnings Prometheus the outer years, i mean, that would depend on the recovery on the industries as well so, so that's i would say would be impossible to speak to today right and and i guess how much on that structural cost side of things yeah yeah i'm just just just one one other point i think worth mentioning i think what we're acknowledging here is that as this plays out in march and what we're seeing already in april, it really is hitting our Hitting us from a mix a mix perspective hard our highest margin businesses are really feeling it here i would think that on the on the recovery we would see we would see it swing the other way so when we get back and come off of bottom we should have a positive mix effect it really across across the board particularly in aviation and healthcare your your second question steve is relative to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the Actions and how much permanent, how much not permanent yeah, i know, i guess how much is that gonna cost you? i mean, like, you know, to come up with two to three billion dollars of cost in cash, you know, you've done, you cut your restructuring last year, pretty significantly, needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter, i mean, most companies kind of one for one, what, how much is this stuff gonna cost you this year on a cash basis? Yeah, i think what we have said previously is we were going to be down off of last year from a from an expense and from a cash perspective. i think we're probably going to end up more or less in line right. keep in mind that some of the cost actions like furloughs don't carry a restructuring charge with that right because they aren't permanent. so part of what we're trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary costs. But all the while, if we can, we can make more structural moves. we want to make sure we've got room to do that. but i'd say right now, assume that it'll be relatively flat year on year. but as caroline indicated in her remarks, we want to try to do more if we can. great, thanks a lot. best of luck. thanks, dave. from u b s, we have mitchell smith bayer. please go ahead. good morning, larry, caroline, and steve. Um, let me maybe follow up on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the aviation cash as a base line sort of like where you know on on that type of scenario we could end up particularly you know looking out sort of what you've mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have i think sixty two percent of of engines built ahead of shop visit one which arguably are the engines that are on the narrower bodies coming back first because they're probably the youngest the youngest in the fleet right just trying to get a sense for within the year how you're thinking about that Well, i i think that given what we we highlighted relative to the the april experience and the near term projection of that there's no question that we're going to continue to see the pressure on on cash at aviation that we've seen here of late right and that that will be our undoubtedly our biggest headwind No, no, sure, but you know, you know, shoplifting, you heard, sort of, the numbers that you, that you said, but did you do sort of internal, internal stress tests around where you could end up, or is that just something that you say, it's too early to comment? No, no, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's Again, a an extended slowdown here. we're we're embracing this reality to the fullest extent possible. we are not expecting this to bounce back in in the near term. so, we we flag in the queue the iota numbers. we also reference others. you see it in our own departure data here in april, right? we are we are way down that has a direct feed in the shop visits csa billing and the like. So we're we're adapting to this new environment confident that it will recover but we're margaret's we're simply not trying to assume that the the pressure abates anytime soon witness the the the cost and the cash actions that we're taking sure ok no i appreciate that and maybe as a follow up quickly on the capital side do you anticipate any changes In the capital support, thereof, for insurance, in particular, you, you, you, reference that a little bit in the prepared remarks. I think two billion is sort of the current number. How are you thinking about that at the moment? On the parent support to capital, and on the insurance. Let's, let's, let's take a step back then. So in nineteen, the capital had an infusion from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, And the estimate for for this year is two billion on insurance funding and those two billion you know that's significantly lower than the year before we estimated that the parent will need to support roughly in line with this with some variables are still open and that depends on g capital itself right the g capital earnings the lrt the capital ending assets liquidity levels but basically it's about two billion as it looks now And i would also say, going forward, anticipating follow-up, we do continue to, to anticipate further funding and that would be, again, through a combination of g capital itself, whether it's asset sales, liquidity and their future earnings and on top of that, possible captain contributions from g capital. thank you. yeah, thank you. good morning, guys. good morning. two questions: two questions. morning. at aviation, it sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up the spares business, the aftermarket, the fifteen billion dollar commercial aftermarket business will lag as m growth because of you know, a younger fleet emerging, you know, a surge of usable material and the like, hard outs. and obviously lower spares provisioning as the oe rates come down thirty to fifty percent i guess first question is when do you anticipate aviation free cash flow getting to break even is it even possible before calendar twenty two in that type of environment and then i have a follow up I'm not sure we would buy into the premise per se. right. i mean we we are a cycles business much more so than any other indicator and those cycles are going to have to come back before the passengers do as you indicated the age of the fleet will will help us over time there could be some short term headwinds but we'll we'll see how that plays out I think what we're acknowledging here is that we've been hit from a free cash perspective in our biggest and best cash generator at aviation but we're really not getting into much more much more in terms of the pre cash forecast on a multiyear basis. It's just too soon. There's too many moving pieces for us. To be that forward-leaning at this point. we wish we could be. it's just it's just not where we are. okay, and just to follow up, you know, obviously, twenty twenty is a tough year. we're gonna have some cash burn. twenty twenty one unclear, but certainly doesn't seem like an aviation, we're gonna have a strong recovery. any so as we emerge from this, we're gonna have, you know, more leverage. and i guess the question is, You guys have made some asset sales to deleverage. What else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster? Is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore? That's different than what you've done over the past year. Thank you. I would i'm not sure i would say that there's a lot that is no please caroline well i was going to say that to do things that we have done in the last couple of years we we are committed to our de-leveraging target of less than two and a half times on the industrial side and And i think you've seen us make a lot of progress year to date which i hope underscores the seriousness of of that objective both on the ge side right i think it's seven billion of of debt reductions in the quarter and that capital i think it's up to ten on it on a year to date basis given some of the things we did in april clearly it's going to take us a a while longer here to hit those targets like i i suspect most most companies BUT IN TERMS OF DOING ANYTHING NEW OR DIFFERENT THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO RUN THESE BUSINESSES AS AS BEST WE CAN BE AS DISCIPLINED AS WE CAN ON THE CAPITAL FRONT BE SMART AND THOUGHTFUL RELATIVE TO SOME OF THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS LIKE LIKE PENSION AS YOU'VE SEEN US RELATIVE TO THE PLAN DESIGN AND AND SOME OF THE SETTLEMENT OPTIONS so i'm not sure they're necessarily new places per se but we'll continue to look at it at every and every option available to continue to strengthen the company and strengthen the balance sheet. she'd bring those leveraged levels down in the face of of covid nineteen carolina, i'm sorry, i jumped in there. anything to add to that? i would just add that to the leveraged comment also the liquidity that at times like this, you know, you do look at the liquidity and i think it's important to say that we really wanna maintain a high level of cash to maximize the flexibility and you have seen the desiring activities that we have done. Made to sort of push out the death in the further years. so we keep options open. thank you. yeah. and i i but i i think to that it means it's just important for us all to remember we we ended the quarter with forty seven billion of liquidity on the back of the biopharma action and some of the other things that we have done so we'll continue to be nimble and flexible mindful of our obligations and our reality. and from barkley's we have julian mitchell. please go ahead. hi, good morning. may be just a question. hi, good morning. may be just the first question around the working capital dynamics in the free cash flow at aviation. um, i guess there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales down draft, you know, there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales down draft, you know, there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales down draft, you know, there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales down draft, you know, there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales down draft, you know, there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales working capital cash off set to an extent and then it reverses whenever the sales come back could you just update us on how you see the working capital cash impacts at g aviation sort of in the early stages now in this downturn what you would expect to happen to working capital when things recover and if there's any major difference on the cash dynamics of the power by the hour type service relative to the ad hoc hook spares activity in aviation john i would like to say that it's a great pleasure to be here today and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. i think our primary challenge is really inventory at aviation, right? yeah, on with respect to working capital, i think our are our are our primary challenge is really inventory at aviation, right? we we we came into this year no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, We're going to have to adjust to a different schedule with the max chasing the the step up at airbus with the three twenty neo while dealing with a good bit of of past due on the commercial side both o e and aftermarket while having pretty good military demand to contend with that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from out of that is that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from out of that is that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from out of that is that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from out of that is that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from out of that is that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from out of that is that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures from a cash flow perspective, was an inventory at aviation in in the quarter. so that's where we're going to be most focused, trying to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies, adjust to the reduced production schedules, the lower aftermarket requirements while continuing to take care of a military business it that's that's a complex supply chain undertaking but the team as you can imagine is keenly focused on using some of the lean tools, working with our supply base to make sure that we not only take the costs out of the business but bring those inventory levels down in in light of current current demand but should we expect so i guess i'm assuming that you're going to do this yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess, you know, in aviation, you have the the you have the drop in ebitdar in a downturn, then the recovery in ebitdar in the early part of the upturn. I was just trying to understand on working capital is that cash impact countercyclical or is it procyclical? So you're you're getting a working capital outflow through the downturn as well as the ebitdar decline. I understand these the the high level dynamic there that you're alluding to. I think right now the the simple reality of aviation given the pressures and the cross currents is that it is a negative and we need to work to improve it how much of a tailwind could it be kind of at this point in the cycle i think it's too early to tell we've we've got to get on the improvement path first julian to be able to Take that potential and and deliberate in the financials is a reality thank you and then my second question was just around the operational issues so i think it sounds like the cost out tailwind should build through the year but in q1 you had some operational issues in power on the service side you know steep decimals even with the fixed cost down renewables the margins were down Despite a big revenue increase so i guess what's the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of these cost savings over the balance of the year well i think you have to take it business by business right if you look at what happened in power clearly the push out by customers because of their own site restrictions Restrictions and by us on the back of its travel restrictions really pushed a lot of high margin revenue out of the quarter and probably out of the first half that was on top of some cost pressures of our own making which we need to we need to improve upon but i think in in power i believe that the team is doing a very nice job working off of that The so-called inheritance taxes, driving real cost improvements. You see that in the headcount reductions here in the first quarter. And as we get to a more normalized service environment, i think you'll continue to see that, that turnaround continue to take flight. I think it's renewables, julie, it's a different dynamic. Yes, we had phenomenal revenue growth in the quarter, doubled the onshore turbine deliveries here in the u s. Got a lot of good news. A little bit, a little bit better price, about a point price which is encouraging to see but it is by nature a very low gross margin business so the growth isn't high calorie unfortunately we had a few what we think were one offs but they're not one offs until they go away permanently cost and execution issues all the while the the turnarounds in hydro and grid are are i think moving forward but it's a little bit better price about a point price which is encouraging to see but it is by nature a very low gross margin business so the growth isn't high calorie unfortunately we had a few what we think were one offs but they're not one offs until they go away permanently cost and execution issues all the while the the turnarounds in hydro and grid are are i think moving forward but it's a little bit better price about a And they have a number of inherent taxes that will take a few years to work through. so i i think the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate those turnarounds in power and renewables. they're dealing with different dynamics in the respective businesses and that's really why i think i have the confidence to say that you should expect a deleterious margin sequentially to improve the restructuring and the cost actions in the business. should present themselves in and in and in improved deleterials in the back half but we've got work to do to make that to make that happen great thank you from wolf research we have nigel coe please go ahead thanks julian good morning everyone and carina great to see you on board so look we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional color in the in the cue we look we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional color in the in the cue we look we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional color in the in the cue we look we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional color in the in the cue we look we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional color in the in the cue we look we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional color in So is it now a base case that industrial free cash flow will be negative and maybe just address the risk of significant cash burn this year or is there enough on the cost out and the working capital side to maybe mitigate some of that pressure and keep industrial free cash flow relatively steady? i think what i think we're trying to share this morning, nigel, is that It's probably three things. One, we've been very we've been hit hard and fast here right in some of our most important, highest margin businesses, be it aviation and services, particularly gas power services px and in healthcare we think that that gets gets worse before it gets better, particularly here in the second quarter with a full a full effect it Uncertain as to how things play out from from here we're going to acknowledge that uncertainty hence the the pulling of the guide but we're not going to sit back and hope that it all passes we're not going to take the view that we've got a sharp v bounce coming hence the the two billion of of cost actions we've talked about and the three billion of of cash actions we're going to do everything we possibly can to control our destiny here without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without and without Prepare the long-term value and the long-term trajectory of our company. so we're telling you what we know today. we wish we knew more, but that is really the state of play right now and the approach, the headset that we're taking to it. ok, i appreciate that, larry. and then, you know, i thought one of the, one of the real highlights of the quarter was the underlying strength of the healthcare margins. you know, even as biopharma, especially given some of the headwinds you face in there. so we're very In strengthen small equipment and and pressure in big eye, how does that mix look though? when you look at the the the mix on smaller patient monitoring equipment et cetera versus the big eye how does that equipment mix play out to the margins well we we certainly i i think the key thing to keep in mind nigel is the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the The lower the lower ticket, the lower the price points, be it patient monitors, ventilators, and the like certainly got quite a boost, but it's a small part of the business so there was a little bit of a mix there, but not a lot. It was really more of a function of the team doing a nice job more broadly recognized. realizing that absent biopharma we needed to tend to the core cost structure in all its form in the hcs business right. we've been growing healthcare biopharma leading the way. we've got some good margin support from that business the last several years. well now as we think about the seventeen billion dollar core the teams really i think put their sights the last couple of quarters on growing that business, growing it with a creative approach. MARGINS AND IT'S REALLY THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT THAT THAT I THINK YOU SEE A BIT HERE IN THE FIRST QUARTER BEFORE WE WE GOT HIT WE GOT HIT A LITTLE BIT LATER NOT AS MUCH YOU'LL SEE MORE OF THAT UNFORTUNATELY HERE IN THE SECOND QUARTER BUT I THINK YOU'VE GOT A TEAM WHO THINKS THAT LIKE MANY OTHER MED TECH COMPANIES THEY CAN GROW MID LOAD MID SINGLE DIGITS OVER TIME AND PUT MORE DIGITAL INTO THE MIX BETTER COSTS TH Degree of margins along the lines of what karen laid out in december. and i have no less conviction about their ability to do that today than than we did when we made that presentation again, mindful that we've got some gyrations here in the in the near turn to deal with right. okay, thanks, larry. good luck. thanks, nigel. thanks, brandon. we are at the bottom of the hour. so we can just take one more question. sure, from R b s capital markets. we have dean deray. please go ahead. thank you. good morning everyone, wishing everyone good health and add my welcome to carolina. thank you. just morning, dean. good morning, good morning. just two questions, both aviation. a lot of discussion about structural cost out in aviation with riffs. and larry, be interested in how you balanced the the structural cost out in aviation with riffs. And balancing the riffs and furloughs versus how you might be compromising the ability to bounce back when it does ramp back up so that's the first question and then the second one just make sure i heard it correctly were there did you quantify the leap cancellations in the quarter i know there's delivery deferrals our experience in two thousand and eight was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations because customers would lose that that's the first question and then the second one just make sure i heard it correctly were there did you quantify the leap cancellations in the quarter i know there's delivery deferrals our experience in two thousand and eight was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations because customers would lose that that's the first question and then the second one just make sure i heard it correctly and refundable deposit. so what's the expectation here in terms of engine cancellations? that's it for me. thank you. It's going to be very good business for g e for four decades but i think we are really trying to again embrace our reality and take the cost actions in the aftermarket business and more broadly at aviation mindful that we've got a period of time here of an unknown duration but it's it's not going to be measured in months right where that business is going to be under considerable pressure so after a period of time, as is the aftermarket has as grown as it has in the last decade, this is going to give us an opportunity to to rethink, to rethink to consolidate all the while mindful of our obligations to customers the nature of how the footprint has changed the changes that are probably still still coming so there are a number of variables It's, it's very much a work in progress as well. but i think we've got line of sight to build on some of the temporary actions to to take permanent action to make sure that we we have a lean cost structure with adequate capacity to to come out of the downturn here well positioned to perform both for customers and for investors thank you. we will now turn it back to steve winnacker for closing remarks Or do you want me to answer the question on yeah, second question? go ahead, carolyn. i will. go ahead, carolyn. yeah, go ahead, carolyn. yeah, you were right, because i actually mentioned that in my notes that in our backlog, which was flat sequentially and amounted to twenty two percent versus prior year that did include roughly two hundred loop one billion unit order translations in the quarter what i would say is progress refunds are very small so far but on top of that we also have gcas, right? so we have gcas cancellation of sixty nine aircraft in april so that will be reflected in the second quarter aviation backlog. great, thanks everybody. i know i know it's a long call and it's a busy day so if you need more just reach out to us and best of luck Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining and you may now disconnect."

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR INVESTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS ON SLIDE TWO WITH THAT I'LL TURN THE CALL OVER TO FRANCIS THANKS JACQUIE GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE I'M EXCITED TO SHARE THAT EARLIER THIS MORNING WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE GRAIL AND TO WORK TOGETHER TO LAUNCH A NEW ERA IN CANCER DETECTION BEFORE WE START I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GRAIL TEAM FOR WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED WE SPUN OUT GRAIL FOUR YEARS AGO TO FOCUS ON AN AMBITIOUS GOAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE DETECT CANCER BY DEVELOPING A BLOOD TEST THAT COULD FIND CANCER EARLIER THAN IS POSSIBLE TODAY THEIR INNOVATION AND RESULTS SINCE THEN HAVE EXCEEDED EVEN OUR LOFTY EXPECTATIONS SETTING THE STAGE FOR EARLY CANCER DETECTION TO LIKELY BE THE LARGEST GENOMIC APPLICATION OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS BY FAR THIS COMBINATION WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE FOR CANCER DETECTION THE ACQUISITION WILL ENABLE GRAIL TO LEVERAGE ILLUMINA'S GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CLINICAL AND OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES ACCELERATING THEIR MISSION AND ALLOWING US TO IMPACT MORE PEOPLE FASTER THAN THEY MIGHT'VE DONE ALONE ILLUMINA'S NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCERS WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT GENOMIC MEDICINE TO BECOME STANDARD OF CARE ACROSS CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND WITH THIS ACQUISITION WE WILL ACCELERATE AND PARTICIPATE MORE FULLY INDIRECTLY IN THE HIGHEST VALUE CLINICAL OPPORTUNITY ENABLED BY OUR TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICALLY THE ACQUISITION POSITIONS ILLUMINA TO PARTICIPATE IN WHAT WE EXPECT WILL BE A $75 BILLION MARKET FOR NGS BASED ONCOLOGY TESTS BY 2035 60 BILLION HIGHER THAN OUR ONCOLOGY TAM EXCLUDING GRAIL CANCER IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO HUMAN HEALTH DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS MADE AND THE IMPORTANT MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS ACHIEVED SO FAR WHEN WE DIAGNOSE CANCER TOO LATE WHEN IT IS METASTATIC LESS THAN 20% OF PATIENTS WILL SURVIVE MORE THAN FIVE YEARS IN CONTRAST IF WE DIAGNOSE CANCER EARLY APPROXIMATELY 90% OF PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO SURVIVE BEYOND FIVE YEARS ABOUT 71% OF CANCER RELATED DEATHS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CANCERS WITH NO RECOMMENDED SCREENING TESTS AND WITH LIMITED SCREENING TESTS CANCER IS MORE LIKELY TO BE DETECTED IN THE LATE STAGES AND OR MORE OFTEN THAN NOT TOO LATE THIS IS BOTH A HUMAN TRAGEDY AND AN ENORMOUS BURDEN  ON THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EACH YEAR THERE ARE OVER 600,000 CANCER RELATED DEATHS IN THE US AND APPROXIMATELY 10 MILLION DEATHS WORLDWIDE MAKING IT THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH WE SPEND APPROXIMATELY $250 BILLION PER YEAR ON CANCER IN THE US AND GLOBALLY THE ECONO- THE ANNUAL ECONOMIC IMPACT IS MORE THAN $1.20 TRILLION AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE IS A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT ENABLES US TO ADDRESS THIS BURDEN STARTING WITH GRAIL'S MULTI CANCER DETECTION TEST GALLERI WHICH AIMS TO REDUCE CANCER DEATHS BY TRANSFORMING HOW AND WHEN CANCER IS DETECTED GRAILS TECHNOLOGY CHARACTERIZES THE DNA THAT CANCER CELLS SHED INTO THE BLOOD DETECTING UNIQUE SIGNATURES THAT IDENTIFY BOTH THE PRESENCE AND OFTEN THE TISSUE OF ORIGIN OF THE CANCER EARLIER THIS YEAR GRAIL SHARED POSITIVE RESULTS FROM IT'S CIRCULATING CELL-FREE GENOME ATLAS OR CPGA STUDY THAT HAS ENROLLED 15,000 PARTICIPANTS THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE FIRST VERSION OF GALLERI REPORTED SENSITIVITY OF 44% FOR STAGE ONE THROUGH THREE TUMORS FOR 50 DIFFERENT CANCERS AND 67% SENSITIVITY FOR THE 12 DEADLIEST CANCERS AND IN 93% OF THE POSITIVE RESULTS THE TEST CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED THE TISSUE OF ORIGIN ALL WITH A SPECIFICITY OF GREATER THAN 99% AND FROM A SINGLE BLOOD DROP ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR DOCTORS AND PAYERS IS THE POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE OR PPV WHICH IS THE PERCENTAGE OF POSITIVE TESTS THAT <INAUDIBLE> CANCERS FOR GALLERI WE PREDICT A PPV 43% THIS REPRESENTS THE VERY SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD COMPARED TO TODAY'S MOST COMMONLY USED SCREENING TESTS WHICH OFTEN HAVE A PPV IN THE RANGE OF 3% TO 5% THE GRAIL TEAM IS PREPARING TO LAUNCH GALLERI AS A LAB DEVELOPED TEST OR LDT IN 202 WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A REMARKABLE ADVANCE IN THE ABILITY TO DETECT CANCER EARLIER WHICH CAN TRANSFORM CANCER CARE AND IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH AS NOTED EARLIER MOST CANCERS ARE CURRENTLY DIAGNOSED IN LATE STAGES AS SHOWN BY THE GRAY BARS IN THE CHART ON THE LEFT HALF OF SLIDE SIX THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT SCREENING METHODS LEAD TO ONLY 31% OF CANCERS BEING IDENTIFIED IN STAGES ONE AND TWO WHEN THEY'RE THE MOST TREATABLE BASED ON GRAIL'S STUDIES THIS COULD INCREASE TO 82% WITH BROAD ADOPTION OF GALLERI'S BLOOD TESTS COMPLIMENTING TODAY'S RECOMMENDED CANCER SCREENING THIS MATTERS BECAUSE IF WE MENTIONED EARLIER SURVIVAL RATES ARE DIRECTLY CORRELATED WITH HOW EARLY CANCER IS DETECTED BROAD ADOPTION OF GALLERI COULD AVERT NEARLY 40% OF THE FIVE-YEAR CANCER MORTALITY ON AROUND 100,000 DEATHS ANNUALLY IN THE US MY APOLOGIES FOR THE TECHNICAL ISSUES WE WILL PICK UP AGAIN FROM SLIDE SIX AS NOTED EARLIER MOST CANCERS ARE CURRENTLY DIAGNOSED IN LATE STAGES AS SHOWN BY THE GRAY BARS AND THE CHARTS ON THE LEFT HALF OF SLIDE SIX THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT SCREENING METHODS LEAD TO ONLY 31% OF CANCERS BEING IDENTIFIED IN STAGES ONE AND TWO WHEN THEY'RE MOST TREATABLE BASED ON GRAIL'S STUDIES THIS COULD INCREASE TO 82% WITH BROAD ADOPTION OF GALLERI'S BLOOD TESTS COMPLIMENTING TODAY'S RECOMMENDED SCREENING THIS MATTERS BECAUSE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER SURVIVAL RATES ARE DIRECTLY CORRELATED WITH HOW EARLY CANCER IS DETECTED BROADER ADOPTION OF GALLERI COULD AVERT NEARLY 40% OF THE FIVE-YEAR CANCER MORTALITY OR AROUND 100,000 DEATHS ANNUALLY IN THE US TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE IT ROUGHLY MATCHES THE NUMBER OF DEATHS PREVENTED BY ALL CURRENT SCREENING TESTING TREATMENT AND SURGERY STANDARDS COMBINED ONCE AVAILABLE WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT GALLERI WILL ENABLE SCREENING FOR MORE CANCERS THAN EVER BEFORE WHILE SCREENING HAS IMPROVED FOR SOME CANCERS INCLUDING LUNG BREAST COLORECTAL AND CERVICAL WE KNOW THAT ROUGHLY SIX IN 10 CANCERS DIAGNOSED IN 12 MILLION CASES AND FIVE MILLION DEATHS A YEAR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CANCERS WITH NO RECOMMENDED TREATING REQUIREMENTS SINCE GALLERI WILL HELP DISCOVER CANCER EARLIER WE BELIEVE THAT GALLERI CAN HELP DETECT THREE TIMES AS MANY CANCERS WHEN ADDED TO RECOMMEND SINGLE CANCER SCREENINGS THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF GRAIL'S WORK WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS BY IMPROVING THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY AS CANCER DETECTION PAYERS WILL BE ABLE TO REALIZE THE LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TREATMENT OF CANCER AT EARLIER STAGES BASED ON GRAIL'S ESTIMATES THE ADOPTION OF GALLERI ALONGSIDE EXISTING SCREENING GUIDELINES COULD HELP REDUCE DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP COSTS BY UP TO 65% THESE BENEFITS ARE KEY DRIVERS IN THE MARKET POTENTIAL WHICH WE ANTICIPATE REFLECTS AN ADDRESSABLE MARKET FOR NGS BASED ONCOLOGY TESTING OF $75 BILLION TODAY WE'RE SEEING RAPID ADOPTION OF NGS'S BASED THERAPY SELECTION TESTS MANY BASED ON ILLUMINA'S TECHNOLOGY OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS WE EXPECT THIS MARKET TO GROW IN THE CAGR OF ABOUT 16% TO $14 BILLION TO AN ANNUAL 7 MILLION TEST OPPORTUNITY AT APPROXIMATE ASD OF $1,300 TO $2,300.0 ILLUMINA PARTICIPATES IN THE THERAPY SELECTION MARKET WITH OUR TSO 500 TESTS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY AND MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR COMMERCIAL LAUNCH IN EARLY 202 AS THE REIMBURSEMENT LANDSCAPE CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN AND DRIVES UTILIZATION OF THERAPY SELECTION TESTS WE'RE SEEING MORE COMPANIES WORKING ON MONITORING TESTS THAT WILL ASSESS THE ACTIVITY OF A PATIENT'S CANCER THIS CAN OPTIMIZE THE DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CANCER THERAPIES FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS THESE ASSAYS CAN ALSO ACT AS SURVEILLANCE TESTS FOR CANCER PATIENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THERAPY AND ARE IN REMISSION WE EXPECT THIS MARKET TO GROW WITH A CAGR OF ABOUT 27% TO 15 BILLION IN 203 THE TEST OPPORTUNITY HERE IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO ABOUT 20 MILLION TESTS PER YEAR WITH AN EXPECTED ASP OF $700 TO $1,000.0 THE CANCERS SCREENING OPPORTUNITY IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER IN THERAPY SELECTION AND MONITORING COMBINED THIS MARKET IS EXPECTED TO GROW QUICKLY TO ABOUT 150 MILLION TESTS IN 2035 A 75% CAGR TO APPROXIMATELY $46 BILLION LET'S ASSUME THAT ASP THAT STARTS AROUND $1,200 AND TRENDS TO ABOUT $300 IN 2035 AS WE SCALE AND DRIVE ADOPTION WITH INCREASINGLY ACCESSIBLE PRICING WITH REGARDS TO THE MARKET FOR GALLERI SPECIFICALLY THERE IS A SIZABLE ADDRESSABLE MARKET OF OVER 100 BILLION PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGE OF 50 TO 79 IN THE US WE BELIEVE APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THIS ADDRESSABLE MARKET IS ACCESSIBLE WITH GALLERI PRIOR TO REIMBURSEMENT THE GRAIL GO-TO MARKET STRATEGY NEXT YEAR WILL CONSIST OF THREE CORE CHANNELS HEALTH SYMPTOMS SELF-INSURED EMPLOYERS AND CONCIERGE MEDICINE GIVEN THE COST IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL WE FEEL THAT HEALTH SYSTEM AND SELF-INSURED EMPLOYERS WILL RECOGNIZE THE COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITIONS AND DRIVE ADOPTION OF THE FIRST MULTI-CANCER DETECTION LDT AVAILABLE THERE'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY IN CONCIERGE MEDICINE SEGMENT THAT TYPICALLY CATERS TO HEALTH CONSCIOUS MEMBERS THAT LIKE TO BE ON THE FOREFRONT OF NEW MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES WHO COULD BE EARLY ADOPTERS OF GALLERI WE EXPECT THAT GRAIL WILL LAUNCH GALLERI IS 2021 WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL RESULTS NEXT YEAR FROM THE CCGA STUFF STUDY THREE AND PATHFINDER TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE CLINICAL VALIDATION OF GALLERI ADDITIONALLY GRAIL WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON ITS DIAGNOSTIC AID FOR CANCER TESTS OR DAC WHICH IS INTENDED FOR SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS AND IS DESIGNED TO SPEED UP THE TIME TO DIAGNOSIS WHEN CANCER IS SUSPECTED AND GRAIL ALSO HAS THE MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE OR MRD TEST IN DEVELOPMENT INTENDED FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED AND TREATED TO DETECT PERSISTENT DISEASE FOLLOWING DEFINITIVE THERAPY ON THAT NOTE I'D LIKE TO INVITE HANS THE CEO OF GRAIL TO SAY A FEW WORDS THANK YOU FRANCIS I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY LET ME START BY RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE GRAIL TEAM WE'RE A MISSION DRIVEN COMPANY FOCUSED ON DETECTING CANCER EARLY WHEN IT CAN BE CURED WE BELIEVE OUR EARLY CANCER DETECTION TELE- TECHNOLOGY COULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CANCER WORLDWIDE AND IT DEVELOPED UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY THAT PREFERENTIALLY TARGETS THE MOST INFORMATIVE REGIONS OF THE GENOME AND USES MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF CANCER AND IDENTIFY THE TUMOR TISSUE OF ORIGIN WE BELIEVE BY JOINING FORCES WITH ILLUMINA WE'LL ACHIEVE SCALES FASTER PREVENTING MORE LATE STAGE CANCER DIAGNOSES WE ARE STRONGLY POSITIONED WITH OUR FIRST TWO CONVENTIONAL PRODUCT LAUNCHES EXPECTED IN 202 AND ONCE OUR DEAL CLOSES WE'LL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE GLOBAL SCALE AND REACH OF ILLUMINA THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS AND IN-COUNTRY INFRASTRUCTURE TO FURTHER OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS SIMPLY PUT SALES MISSION AND FOCUS WILL NOT CHANGE BUT ILLUMINA'S INTERNATIONAL FOOTPRINT AND EXPERTISE ACROSS MARKET ACCESS REGULATORY GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND MANUFACTURING WILL ACCELERATE OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR MISSION AND GOALS OF IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES WE BUILT A WORLD-CLASS TEAM OF DATA AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AT THE FOREFRONT OF APPLYING AI TO GENOMICS AND WERE BETTER TO SERVE OR LEVERAGE THOSE CAPABILITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF HUMAN HEALTH <INAUDIBLE> IN THE PROCESS WE'VE ALSO ESTABLISHED AN IMPRESSIVE IP PORTFOLIO WITH MORE THAN 230 PATENTS GRANTED GLOBALLY AND ANOTHER 170 PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS WITH 115,000 PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED AND ANOTHER 30,000 PLANS GRAIL HAS BUILT ONE OF THE LARGEST POPULATION SCALE CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAMS EVER PURSUED IN GENOMIC MEDICINE GRAIL'S GENOMIC DATABASE CONTINUES TO GROW WITH EACH TASK AND ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIAL PARTICIPANT AND TODAY STANDS AT OVER 12.6 PETABYTES WORTH OF GENOMIC DATA THE COMPARISON WHICH IS FIVE TIMES LARGER THAN THE CANCER GENOME ATLAS ILLUMINA REMAINS THE MOST INNOVATIVE COMPANY IN SEQUENCING AND GRAILS' ABILITY TO KEEP PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE TO KEEP FINDING MORE AND MORE CANCERS EARLIER STAGES WILL BE FURTHER STRENGTHENED AS A RESULT OF THIS COMBINATION HAVING SPENT TIME WITH FRANCIS AND THE ILLUMINA TEAM I'M CONFIDENT WE ALL SHARE THE SAME GOAL AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO ACCELERATING OUR MISSION AND DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISE FASTER THAN COULD BE DONE ALONE WE BOTH BELIEVE THIS IS A CASE WHERE ONE PLUS ONE WILL EQUAL WELL OVER TWO AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HAND THE CALL BACK TO FRANCIS THANKS HAN I COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE GRAIL TEAM TO ACCELERATE ADOPTION OF THEIR LIFE-SAVING PRODUCTS BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CLINICAL AND OPERATIONS CAPABILITY ON GLOBAL COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION MARKET SALES AND SUPPORTS <UNK> 6,600 CUSTOMERS IN 115 COUNTRIES INCLUDING A NUMBER OF NATIONAL POPULATION SCALE GENOMICS PROGRAM POWERED BY ILLUMINA SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY ILLUMINA FIRST ESTABLISHED OUR CLINICAL LAB IN 200 AND SINCE THEN HAVE ADDED TWO MORE INCLUDING ONE IN THE UK TO SUPPORT GENOMICS ENGLAND AND THE NHS THIS CERTIFIED AND ACCREDITED LABS ARE STAFF BY MORE THAN 250 TEAM MEMBERS INCLUDING BOARD CERTIFIED PATHOLOGISTS MEDICAL GENETICISTS GENETIC COUNSELORS AND PHD SCIENTISTS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS OUR LAB HAS PROCESSED MORE THAN 17 MILLION OR RASS AND ALMOST ONE MILLION CLINICAL SAMPLES WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED OUR CLINICAL CAPABILITIES AND BUILT-OUT WORLD-CLASS MARCHING ACCESS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND REGULATORY FUNCTIONS IN ADDITION OUR CLINICAL GRADE DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING TEAM DELIVERED SYSTEMS AND KITS REGISTERED FOR IVD USE IN MORE THAN 35 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN EXTENDING OUR REACH INTO THE CLINICAL MARKET THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH LEADING CLINICAL COMPANIES INCLUDING BMS CELGENE AND ROCHE AS ILLUMINA AND GRAIL COME TOGETHER WE ACCELERATE ADOPTION OF CLINICAL NGS BASED TESTING THIS WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OVER TIME MORE OF OUR REVENUE WILL REFLECT THE CLINICAL VALUE OF OUR NGS PRODUCTS AND NOT ONLY THE UNDERLYING SEQUENCING OUTPUT AS A RESULT ILLUMINA WILL PLAY A DIRECT ROLE IN ACCELERATING THE ADOPTION OF GENOMIC MEDICINE IN ADDITION TO ENABLING IT AS WE EVOLVE ILLUMINA REMAINS COMMITTED TO ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS WE'RE DEDICATED TO DELIVERING THE MOST INNOVATIVE SEQUEING SEQUENCING SYSTEMS AS CONSUMABLES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS THERE'S STILL SO MUCH IMPORTANT RESEARCH TO BE DONE AND WE KNOW THIS WILL BE ENABLED IN PART BY CONTINUED INNOVATION IN SEQUENCING AND ON THE CLINICAL SIDE OUR MISSION HAS ALWAYS BEEN IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH BY UNLOCKING THE POWER OF THE GENOME WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENABLE OUR CLINICAL CUSTOMERS TO SCALE AS THEY DO WORK TOWARDS THE SHARED GOAL WITH THAT LET ME HAND THINGS OVER TO SAM FOR A QUICK REVIEW OF FINANCIAL TERMS AND IMPACT THANKS FRANCIS AS ANNOUNCED EARLIER TODAY WE HAVE AGREED TO ACQUIRE GRAIL FOR TOTAL CASH AND STOCK CONSIDERATION OF $8 BILLION WITH ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS LINKED WITH CERTAIN PRODUCT SALES OVER THE FIRST 12 YEARS THIS ACQUISITION EXPANDS THE ILLUMINA'S MARKET OPPORTUNITY BY MORE THAN $60 BILLION IT ALLOWS US TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CLINICAL MARKETS MORE FULLY AND IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO REVENUE GROWTH STARTING MODESTLY IN 2021 AND MEANINGFULLY ACCELERATE OVER TIME WE EXPECT THE TRANSACTION FLOWS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2021 AND WE WILL SHARE MORE DETAILED EXPECTATIONS ABOUT REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPACT ON EPS WHEN THAT HAPPENS CASH AND STOCK CONSIDERATION IS $8 BILLION SINCE ILLUMINA CURRENTLY OWNS 12% OF GRAIL'S EQUITY ON A FULLY EXCLUDED BASIS THE PURCHASE PRICE IS APPROXIMATELY $7 BILLION TO GRAIL'S OTHER SHAREHOLDERS AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION ILLUMINA WILL PAY GRAIL'S SHAREHOLDERS APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION IN COMMON STOCK WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A COLLAR THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED BE BASED ON PENETRATE VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF ILLUMINA COMMON STOCK 10 DAYS PRIOR TO CLOSE MOREOVER THE STOCK CONSIDERATION COLLAR ENSURES THE FINAL NUMBER OF SHARES THE GRAIL SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVED IS DERIVED FROM A PRICE THAT WILL BE WITHIN A SHARE PRICE BAND OF $295 AND $399.0 THE REMAINING $3.10 BILLION CASH CONSIDERATION IS EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED WITH BALANCE SHEET CASH AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $1 BILLION RAISED EITHER THROUGH EQUITY OR DEBT WE HAVE A $1 BILLION FULLY COMMITTED BRIDGE FILE WITH GOLDMAN SACHS AND SURE FUNDING AVAILABILITY THE LAST COMPONENT OF THE DEAL INCLUDES CONTINGENT PAYMENT RIGHTS TO GRAIL'S SHAREHOLDERS BASED ON GRAIL RELATED REVENUES FOR A 12-YEAR PERIOD SPECIFICALLY A 2.50% PAYMENT RIGHT IS APPLIED TO THE FIRST $1 BILLION OF REVENUE EACH YEAR AND ALL REVENUE ABOVE THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A 9% PAYMENT RIGHT TO GRAIL'S SHAREHOLDERS WITH THAT BACK TO FRANCIS THANK YOU SAM WHEN WE CREATED GRAIL IN 2016 WE KNEW THAT ITS MISSION WAS A MOONSHOT BUT AN IMPORTANT ONE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE DETECTION OF CANCER SUCCESSFUL POSITIVELY IMPACTING MILLIONS OF LIVES AND OPENING A MASSIVE MARKET OPPORTUNITY WE WANTED TO SEE THE TECHNOLOGY PROGRESS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE CREATE THE LARGEST POLITICAL TRIALS AND GET IT TO PATIENTS IN YEARS NOT DECADES IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS AND CAPITALIZE THE EFFORT WAS AS A SEPARATE COMPANY WITH THIS SINGULAR FOCUS AND AN EXTRAORDINARY TEAM THAT COULD EXECUTE QUICKLY ILLUMINA HAS SET IT UP FOR SUCCESS BY SEEDING IT WITH TECHNOLOGY AND SOME OF OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST FOUR YEARS LATER GRAIL HAS PROVEN THE SKEPTICS WRONG AND IS NOW AT THE PRE-COMMERCIAL STAGE IT WAS A BIG BET AND IT PAID OFF OVER THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS GRAIL HAS RAISED ALMOST $2 BILLION TO FUND ITS MISSION DURING THE SAME PERIOD ILLUMINA GENERATED ABOUT $4 BILLION IN EBITDA GRAIL'S MISSION IS NO LONGER A MOONSHOT AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S POISED TO TRANSFORM CANCER DETECTION OUR MISSION AT ILLUMINA IS TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH BY UNLOCKING THE POWER OF THE GENOME THIS HASN'T CHANGED IN OVER THE LAST 22 YEARS WE BEGAN OUR JOURNEY BY LAUNCHING OUR MICRO-ARRAY BASED SERVICES AND PRODUCTS OUR BREAKTHROUGH ARRAYS OFFERED HIGHER THROUGHPUT LOWER COSTS MORE FLEXIBILITY AND HIGHER QUALITY THAN EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES AND WE BECAME THE LEADING MICRO-ARRAY VENDOR BY 2006 MORE THAN DOUBLING REVENUES FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR WHILE WE ENJOYED THE SUCCESS WE SAW THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP FORWARD TOWARDS OUR MISSION THROUGH SEQUENCING <INAUDIBLE> GOING AWAY AND IN 2020 WE STILL HAVE AN ARRAY BUSINESS BUT WE SAW THE POTENTIAL FOR ENORMOUS AND VERY ELASTIC RESEARCH MARKET FIRED BY HIGH QUALITY LOWER COST SEQUENCING SO IN 2006 WE ACQUIRED SOLEXA SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WITH NO REVENUE FOR $600 MILLION A THIRD OF OUR MARKET CAP AT THE TIME THE MARKET WAS INITIALLY SKEPTICAL BUT WE BEGAN THE RACE TO THE $1,000 GENOME AND OVER THE LAST 14 YEARS THE VISION HAS PROVED RIGHT WE REDUCED THE COST OF HIGH QUALITY SEQUENCING OF A GENOME FROM $150,000 IN 2007 TO $600 TODAY ENABLING GROUNDBREAKING GENOMIC DISCOVERIES INCLUDING CIRCULATING FETAL DNA IN MATERNAL BLOOD AND THE IMPACT OF RARE VARIANTS ON CANCER THERAPY RESPONSE BY 2014 WHEN WE DELIVERED THE INDUSTRY'S FIRST $1,000 GENOME OUR RESEARCH SEQUENCING BUSINESS WAS THRIVING AND ONCE AGAIN WE SENSE WE WERE ENTERING A NEW ERA OF GENOMICS ENTERING THE CLINIC IN 2013 WE ACQUIRED VERINATA A PROVIDER OF NON-INVASIVE PRENATAL TESTING IN DECEMBER OF 2013 WE RECEIVED THE FIRST EVER FDA AUTHORIZATION FOR OUR NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCER WE EMBARKED ON OUR OWN MULTI-YEAR CLINICAL TRANSFORMATION BUILDING OUT THE CAPABILITIES I REFERENCED EARLIER TODAY OUR CLINICAL BUSINESS THERAPY SELECTION AND ONCOLOGY AND IDT AND GENETIC DISEASE TESTING ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF OUR SEQUENCING CONSUMABLE REVENUES WE'RE NOW ENTERING THE NEXT PHASE OF GENOMICS SEQUENCING TO THE STANDARD OF CARE EARLY CANCER DETECTION REPRESENTS THE LARGEST GENOMIC APPLICATION BY FAR WE BELIEVE OVER THE NEXT DECADE BECAUSE CANCER SCREENING IMPACTS A VERY LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION <INAUDIBLE> IS IN AN ERA WHERE REGULAR GENOMIC TESTING IS THE NORM FOR A POPULATION WE ACCELERATE THIS VISION BY ACQUIRING GRAIL BEFORE WE OPEN UP TO Q AND A I WANNA SUMMARIZE A FEW THINGS FIRST EXCLUDING GRAIL FOR A MOMENT WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN OUR BUSINESS AND EXCITED BY THE OPPORTUNITY AHEAD WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE AS THE LEADING INNOVATOR IN SEQUENCING SUPPORTING BOTH RESEARCH AND CLINICAL CUSTOMERS GRAIL IS NOT REPLACING ANYTHING AND AS SUCH THE ACQUISITION WILL BE ADDITIVE TO ILLUMINA'S OPPORTUNITY AND GROWTH WE CONSIDER EARLY CANCER DETECTION TO BE ONE OF THE LARGEST CLINICAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS AND WE BELIEVE WE WILL ACCELERATE GLOBAL ADOPTION BY PARTICIPATING MORE DIRECTLY SECOND THIS ACQUISITION IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGY TO EXTEND IT TO THE CLINICAL MARKET THE FASTEST GROWING OPPORTUNITY IN SEQUENCING WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER SEQUENCING SYSTEMS AND CONSUMABLES AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF SEQUENCING INNOVATION TO DEMOCRATIZE ACCESS AND REALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO POSITIVELY IMPACT HUMAN HEALTH THIRD WE SPUN OUT GRAIL FOUR YEARS AGO ON A MOONSHOT MISSION THE TERRIFIC PROGRESS THEY MADE HAS DE-RISKED THE MISSION OVER TIME NOW THAT THEY STAND POISED TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN 2021 WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO BRING THE GRAIL TEAM INTO ILLUMINA SO THAT WE CAN HELP TO COMMERCIALIZE AND ACCELERATE ITS ADOPTION IN CLOSING OUR MISSION TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH BY UNLOCKING THE POWER OF THE GENOME AND GRAIL'S MISSION IN DETECT CANCER EARLY WHEN IT CAN BE CURED COULD NOT BE MORE CONSISTENT WE LOOK FORWARD TO ACCELERATING THE AGE OF GENOMIC MEDICINE TOGETHER WITH THAT I'LL INVITE THE OPERATOR TO BEGIN THE Q AND A CERTAINLY AT THIS TIME IF YOU'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PLEASE PRESS STAR ONE AGAIN YOU WILL BE LIMITED TO ONE QUESTION DOUG SCHENKEL WITH COWEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN MORNING UM SO- SO GRAIL IS CLEARLY A- A REALLY EXCITING AND PROMISING ASSET AND- AND YOU DID A GREAT JOB THIS MORNING OUTLINING UH A LOT OF THAT UM AND YOU WERE VERY COMPREHENSIVE IN EXPLAINING UH WHY YOU WANNA DO THIS DEAL I'M I'M ACTUALLY HOPING THAT YOU COULD ADDRESS HOW YOU GOT COMFORTABLE OVERCOMING SOME OF THE REASONS NOT TO DO THE DEAL THESE INCLUDE THREE THINGS THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR YOU TO ADDRESS THE FIRST IS THE CHALLENGE OF COMPETING WITH CUSTOMERS WHICH HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR YOU IN THE PAST AND SOMETHING YOU TALKED ABOUT AVOIDANCE SO UM FIRST OFF WONDERING HOW YOU EXPECT TO MANAGE THAT AND WHY THE CHANGE WHY THE PIVOT THERE SECOND THE- THE DILUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEAL UM WHICH COULD CREATE A POTENTIAL INTERNAL P AND L CONFLICT WHEN IT COMES TO INCENTIVE STRUCTURE NOT TO MENTION AN ISSUE WITH INVESTOR VALUATION METHODOLOGIES UM I THINK THIS IS PART OF THE REASON YOUR STOCK GOT HIT SO MUCH LAST WEEK IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SO HOW DO YOU HANDLE POTENTIAL P AND L CONFLICT INTERNAL AND EXTERNALLY MOVING FORWARD AND THEN THIRD SO THE LACK OF CLEAR CLINICAL OPERATING SYNERGIES UM AND- AND HOW YOU PLAN TO SUCCEED AS A CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY IN A WAY THAT YOU HAVEN'T IN THE PAST WE KNOW THAT ILLUMINA IS GREAT AT CERTAIN THINGS THAT ESPECIALLY DEVELOPING LEADING GENETIC TOOLS PLATFORMS AND HAVING AN AMAZING UH COMMERCIAL TEAM IN PLACE TO SUPPORT NOT JUST THE PLACEMENT OF THESE PLATFORMS BUT HOW USERS USE THEM THAT SAID WHILE YOU'VE BEEN GREAT AS AN ARMS DEALER TO CLINICAL CUSTOMERS YOUR TRACK RECORD ISN'T AS STRONG WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPING AND SELLING ASSAYS AND GETTING THEM THROUGH REGULATORY AND REIMBURSEMENT PATHWAYS SO- SO WHAT ARE THE CLINICAL SYNERGIES AND HOW DO YOU QUANTIFY THEM AGAIN ONE HOW DO YOU MANAGE THE COMPETING WITH CUSTOMERS TWO HOW DO YOU MANAGE THE P AND L CONFLICT INTERNAL AND EXTERNALLY AND THIRD WHY SHOULD WE GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS GIVEN THE LACK OF CLEAR CLINICAL OPERATING SYNERGIES THANK YOU SURE UH THANK YOU DOUG SO LET'S GO THROUGH EACH OF THOSE THE FIRST ONE IS HOW DO WE MANAGE THE CHALLENGE OF COMPETING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR STRATEGY THERE CONTINUES TO BE THAT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF APPLICATIONS UH IN THE MARKET THAT WE SERVE WE WILL LOOK TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR PARTNERS TO DEVELOP THE APPLICATIONS AND OUR SEQUENCERS AND CONSUMABLES AND THAT'S GONNA BE TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF APPLICATIONS WHAT WE'VE SAID HOWEVER IS THAT FOR A VERY SMALL SET OF APPLICATIONS WHERE- WHERE WE FELT THE MARKET WAS LARGE AND WE FELT THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING THAT WE COULD PUT INTO THE MARKET AND WE WOULD UH WE WOULD ENTER THAT MARKET DIRECTLY IN THOSE MARKETS WE STILL ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO CREATE A COMPETING OFFERING SO WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT EVERYBODY BUT WE SAID IN THE VERY LARGE MARKETS WHERE WE FELT WE HAD A DIFFERENTIATED CAPABILITY TO BRING INTO THE MARKET WE WOULD ENTER THOSE AND YOU'VE SEEN US DO THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE NIPT SPACE WHERE WE BROUGHT INNOVATIONS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INTO THAT MARKET AND I'VE PUT TOGETHER AN END TO END SOLUTION YOU SAW US DO THAT IN THE LARGE CANCER PANELS LIKE THE 500 GENE PANEL TSO 50 AND NOW YOU'RE SEEING US DO THAT HERE IN THIS CASE WE FEEL THAT THE CRITERIA WE USE HAVE BEEN MET THIS IS A VERY LARGE UH UH APPLICATION FOR US WE THINK THAT OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE THE LARGEST GENOMICS APPLICATION IN THE MARKET IN TERMS OF UH ADDRESSABLE MARKET SIZE AND THE GRAIL TEAM HAS PUT TOGETHER A VERY DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION A LOT OF IP THAT WAS CREATED HANS TALKED ABOUT THE 230 APPLICATIONS OF PATENTS THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED AND 170 MORE THAT HAVE BEEN FILED SO THERE IS A VERY DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING AND IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW WITH GRAIL PIONEERING THE MARKET YOU KNOW THEY'RE SORT OF LEADING THE WAY IN CREATING THAT MARKET AND SO AS WE LOOKED AT THE MARKET WE FELT IT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR ONE OF THE VERY SMALL SET OF MARKETS THAT WE WOULD GET INTO DIRECTLY WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THOUGH TO- TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO CREATE THEIR OWN OFFERINGS IN THIS MARKET TOO SO THAT'S HOW WE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT QUESTION THE NEXT QUESTION WAS AROUND DILUTION AND HOW WE GOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND HOW WE TO MANAGE P AND L COSTS AND SO THE THINKING HERE IS THAT WE'RE GONNA MANAGE GRAIL AS A AS A SEPARATE DIVISION AND WE GET A REPORT REALLY TRANSPARENT ABOUT UH THE P AND L OF GRAIL AND WE MANAGE THAT DIFFERENTLY AND SEPARATELY FROM THE P AND L FOR THE REST OF THE BUSINESS AND WE UNDERSTAND THE PROFILE OF WHAT IT'LL TAKE TO GET GRAIL SUCCESSFUL IN THE MARKET GOING FORWARD AND SO WE'LL BE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE NOW WE EXPECT THAT TO BE DILUTIVE FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT THEN BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE OPPORTUNITY WE EXPECT IT TO BE UH HIGHLY ACCRETIVE AS THIS AS WE START TO SCALE THE OFFERING IN THE LATER YEARS AND- AND AGAIN WE'LL BE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT SHARING WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE LONGTERM WE HAVE A HIGH CONFIDENCE IN THE- THE P AND L ATTRACTIVENESS OF THIS BUSINESS BUT WE DO KNOW IT TAKES INVESTMENT IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS AND THE NEXT QUESTION WAS ABOUT YOU KNOW CLINICAL SYNERGY SO WHAT ARE THE SYNERGIES THAT YOU KNOW GRAIL WILL ENJOY COMING INTO ILLUMINA AND AS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN BUILDING OUT OUR CLINICAL CAPABILITIES SINCE 2000 201 AND SO TODAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PLACES WHERE WE THINK GRA- UH GRAIL CAN BENEFIT YOU KNOW AS SOON AS THEY COME IN UH SOME OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE CALL ONE FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE'RE ENGAGED WITH OVER 50 POPULATION SEQUENCING EFFORTS AROUND THE WORLD UH TODAY WE'RE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT ONCOLOGY THERAPY SELECTION GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS UM WE THINK IT'S A VERY NATURAL ADD TO EXPAND THE CONVERSATION TO INCLUDE UH YOU KNOW CANCER SCREENING AND EARLY DETECTION WE THINK IT'D BE VERY VALUABLE IN CONVERSATIONS WE'RE IN SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY SCALE UP A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS THAT GRAIL IS HAVING AROUND THE WORLD WE TALKED ABOUT OUR CLINICAL LAB UM WE HAVE AMONG THE LARGEST UH CLINICAL GENOMICS LABS IN THE WORLD WE HAVE UH TWO IN THE US ONE IN THE UK THOSE LABS HAVE ALREADY PROCESSED OVER A MILLION CLINICAL SAMPLES AND BUILD THE WORKFLOWS AND EXPERTISE NECESSARY TO DO THAT AND THEN WE'VE ALSO BUILT UH YOU KNOW THE REGULATORY CAPABILITIES THE MARKET ACCESS CAPABILITIES UH IN-COUNTRY SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT CLINICAL OFFERINGS AROUND THE WORLD TODAY WE HAVE IVES THAT ARE CLEARED IN 35 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD LEVERAGING RELATIONSHIPS WE BUILD WITH THE REGULATORY BODIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AS WELL AS HAVING A MARKET SUR- SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITY FROM THOSE COUNTRIES AND YOU CAN SEE THAT PLAYING OUT IN THE SUCCESS OF PRODUCTS THAT WE'VE BOUGHT ON THE MARKET LIKE OUR VERISEQ NIPT PRODUCT WHICH IS CE- IVD MARKED AND DOING REALLY WELL IN EMEA SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CLINICAL CAPABILITIES AND FRANKLY WE SPEND THE LAST FIVE PLUS YEARS BUILDING THAT GRAIL PLUGS INTO IMMEDIATELY YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM TYCHO PETERSON WITH JP MORGAN YOUR LINE IS OPEN HEY THANKS UH A COUPLE OF QUICK ONES SO YOU KNOW YOUR- YOUR STOCK LOST 20 BILLION IN MARKET CAP LIST LAST WEEK BECAUSE ALLUDED TO YOU KNOW DID THAT INFLUENCE YOUR THINKING AND WHAT IS IT THAT YOU THINK THE STREET DOESN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND HERE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY GIVEN THIS AS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT I THINK ABOUT A $4 BILLION STEP UP SINCE THE LAST ROUND GRAIL DID IN MAY AND WHY IS BUYING IT ALL NOW THE RIGHT APPROACH GIVEN THAT YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN YOUR EQUITY STAKE UP HIGHER MAYBE TO 40% 50% HEALTHY IPO AND THEN YOU KNOW HAD A CALL OPTION TO BUY IT LATER SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION SECOND ON MARGINS CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHERE COGS CAN GO YOU KNOW WE KNOW YOU HAVE OFF THE SHELF TECHNOLOGY FOR $100 GENOME SO HOW MUCH OF THIS IS ABOUT DRIVING DOWN COGS QUICKLY AND THEN WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY CAN GO AND THEN HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK GRAIL NEEDS TO SPEND ON R&D AND THE SALES FORCE RAMP UH TO- TO REALLY SCALE UP THIRD YOU KNOW FRANCIS YOU TALKED ABOUT UH YOU KNOW UH UH COMPETENCE IN- IN THE CORE BUSINESS YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS INVESTOR IS GONNA WORRY ABOUT IS- IS YOU KNOW UH YOU KNOW CONCERNS ABOUT GROWTH IN THE CORE BUSINESS OR MAYBE YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS DEAL TO- TO DIVERSIFY AND COVER UP YOU KNOW CONTINUED TO SLOW DOWN SO CAN YOU MAYBE TALK TO WHAT YOU THINK UH ABOUT THE CORE BUSINESS FOR NEXT YEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE QUANTITATIVELY AND THEN LASTLY YOU KNOW EITHER FOR FRANCIS OR HANS YOU KNOW WHY IS A 44% SENSITIVITY FOR A SCREEN TEST YOU KNOW OF CLINICAL VALUE ESPECIALLY AT THE PRICE THAT'S BEEN- BEEN TALKED ABOUT THANK YOU THANK YOU TYCHO ALL RIGHT UH A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER SO I'M GONNA START BY TALKING ABOUT YOUR FIRST QUESTION WHICH IS THE WHY NOW QUESTION AND THEN SAM I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO YOU TO TALK UH ABOUT THE MARGINS QUESTION AND THEN I'LL COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT OUR CORE BUSINESS AND THEN UH AND THEN I'LL LOOK TO- TO YOU HANS MAYBE ALSO TO COMMENT A LITTLE BIT AROUND THE- THE SCREENING TESTS AND THE CLINICAL VALUE SO LET'S START UM SO WHY NOW UM AND- AND- AND WAS THERE ANY SORT OF REACTION IN OUR MIND YOU'RE ASKING AROUND THE STOCK DROP <INAUDIBLE> SO THE REASON FOR WHY NOW UH AND- AND FRANKLY WE TOOK A LONGER-TERM VIEW SO THE EVENTS OF LAST WEEK DIDN'T REALLY IMPACT OUR WHY NOW DECISION UH AND I'LL I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT THE- THE REASON FOR WHY NOW IS UH FRANKLY THE TERRIFIC PROGRESS THAT THE GRAIL TEAM HAS MADE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WHERE THEY STAND RIGHT NOW WHEN WE SPUN OUT GRAIL FOUR YEARS AGO YOU'LL REMEMBER HOW THIS IDEA GOT STARTED RIGHT SO WE WERE PROCESSING SAMPLES UH FOR NIPT AND OUR CLINICAL LABS AND ALTHOUGH WE WERE SEEING NORMAL UH YOU KNOW FETAL DNA WE NOTICED ABNORMALITIES IN THE MOTHER'S DNA AND SO WE REPORTED THAT TO THE DOCTOR AND IN ALL OF THOSE CASES IT TURNED OUT THAT THE MOTHER HAD CANCER AND DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT AND SO WE INCUBATED SO THERE WAS A THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT YOU COULD GET SIGNALS FOR CANCER IN THE BLOOD AND WE INCUBATED THAT IDEA WITHOUT A TEAM FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS TO FEEL LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF UNKNOWNS IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER THERE WAS ENOUGH SIGNAL TO DETECT EARLY STAGE CANCER IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER YOU COULD JUST DETECT ONLY CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER IT WAS UNCLEAR IF THE APPROACH WE WERE THINKING ABOUT WAS THE RIGHT APPROACH AND SO WHAT WE WANTED WAS TO- TO CREATE A COMPANY THAT WAS GOING AFTER THIS- THIS UH THIS MOONSHOT MISSION UH THAT COULD BE FOCUSED ON THAT MOVE QUICKLY ON THAT SO WE ALSO WANTED TO KNOW MAYBE OTHER APPROACHES IN THE MARKET WOULD- WOULD BE MORE FRUITFUL THE TEAM HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND SORT OF <INAUDIBLE> A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THE- THE TECHNOLOGY THEY PUT TOGETHER THE TEAM THEY'VE ASSEMBLED AND THEN PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY THE RESULTS THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING FROM THEIR LARGE SCALE CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE PUT TO BED A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD YOU KNOW THE- THE GALLERI RESULTS I TALKED ABOUT BASED ON THE CCGA SAMPLES SHOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY OVER 50 50 TYPES OF CANCER THAT THEY HAVE A SPECIFICITY THAT THAT MEANS THE FALSE OF 99% THAT THE FALSE POSITIVE RATE OF LESS THAN 1% THEY WON'T FLOOD YOU KNOW HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WITH FALSE POSITIVES UM AND THEY HAVE HIGH SENSITIVITY ESPECIALLY FOR THE DEADLIEST CANCERS AND SO THEY STAND TODAY ON THE PRECIPICE OF COMMERCIALIZING A PRODUCT NEXT YEAR AND SO NOW- NOW IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FOR US TO- TO ACQUIRE THEM AND SO WHY A PART OF YOU ARE ASKING WHY NOT JUST INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT AND THE REASON TO ACQUIRE THEM IS BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT INTO HOW WE CAN ACCELERATE A PLAN THAT THEY ARE ON TODAY AND WE CAN ONLY DO THAT IF THEY'RE PART OF ILLUMINA PLUGGING THEM INTO OUR COMMERCIAL UH CONVERSATIONS WITH POPULATION SEQUENCING EFFORTS FOR EXAMPLE STANDING THEM UP IN OUR CLINICAL LABS AROUND THE WORLD RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THEM TO BUILD OUT THEIR OWN CLINICAL LABS PLUGGING INTO OUR REGULATORY EXPERTISE IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WITH THEIR PART OF ILLUMINA AND FRANKLY WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO AS WELL EVEN IF WE WERE A 30% 40% OWNER OFF OF GRAIL AND SO YOU KNOW THEY ARE YOU KNOW THEY- THEY TALK ABOUT LAUNCHING THE PRODUCT NEXT YEAR SO THEY'RE CLOSE TO MA- COMMERCIALIZATION SO IT'S EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME WE FELT WHERE THERE IS A PRODUCT YOU KNOW THE VALUE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AND THEY'RE READY TO SCALE AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAN HELP FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE FROM A CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE FROM A COMMERCIAL PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE STOCK DROP YOU KNOW UH WE'VE SEEN BEFORE AND I MENTIONED THIS IN MY PREPARED REMARKS THAT THIS IS A BIG STEP I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS ALSO A BIG AMOUNT I UNDERSTAND THAT AND YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD THIS HAPPENED TO US BEFORE WHEN WE WERE IN THE ARRAY BUSINESS AND WE WANTED TO GET INTO SEQUENCING AND WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE ACQUIRING THE SOLEXA TO GET INTO THE SEQUENCING BUSINESS UH OUR STOCK DROPPED THAT DAY TOO AND- AND IT TOOK A WHILE FOR US TO WORK WITH- WITH THE MARKET TO EXPLAIN WHERE WE WERE GOING AND WHY WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A BIG OPPORTUNITY AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW TODAY THAT'S BEEN ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL STORY AND SEQUENCING IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES AND SO YOU KNOW WE ANTICIPATED THAT THERE'D BE WORK FOR US TO DO AND EXPLAINING THIS STEP AND EXPLAINING THE OPPORTUNITY AND EXPLAINING WHY GRAIL AND WHY GRAIL AND ILLUMINA AND THAT'S THE WORK WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US BUT WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT THAT IT'S THE RIGHT NEXT STEP IN TERMS OF FULFILLING OUR MISSION WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO SAM FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT MARGINS AND THE QUESTIONS TYCHO HAD YEAH SO I'LL TACKLE A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE MARGINS AND I THINK YOU HAD A QUESTION ON OPERATING EXPENSES AS WELL TYCHO SO UH YOU KNOW FROM AN OVERALL COGS STANDPOINT UH THE COGS WILL INITIALLY START OUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY MUCH HIGHER THAN OUR AVERAGE COST DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW VOLUMES ARE RAMPING UP SO INITIALLY YOU'RE GONNA SEE A HIGHER COST PROFILE FOR THE BUSINESS AS THE VOLUME START RAMPING UP THOUGH AND TWO AND A HALF TO THREE YEARS POST LAUNCH OF GALLERI THE COGS STARTS TO GET TO A LEVEL WHICH IS COMMENSURATE WITH OUR OVERALL SERVICES BUSINESS AND UH SLIGHTLY BELOW OUR OVERALL COGS PROFILE AND UH OBVIOUSLY AS WE INTRODUCE MORE INNOVATIONS AND YOU KNOW UH LOWER THE COST OF SEQUENCING TO YOUR QUESTION UH THE COGS WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT AS WELL JUST LIKE OUR ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT UM IN TERMS OF OPERATING EXPENSES YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT UM WHAT UM UH WHAT THE GRAIL INVESTED LAST YEAR OR- OR THIS YEAR I SHOULD FOR THE FIRST MONTH IT WAS ROUGHLY $135 MILLION IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT FOR THE FULL YEAR LET'S SAY IT'S UH YOU KNOW IT'S EXACTLY DOUBLE THAT IT'S ABOUT 270 MILLION FOR THE FULL YEAR AS WE LOOK FORWARD OBVIOUSLY THAT NUMBER IS GONNA GROW BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE RAMPING AND LAUNCHING UH PRODUCTS WE'RE GONNA BE ACCELERATING THE COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS AND BUILDING OUT A SALES FORCE UH AND THERE'S GONNA BE CONTINUING R&D AS WELL SO YOU KNOW OPEX ESPECIALLY IN THREE YEARS THERE'S GONNA BE UH YOU KNOW I'VE BACKED ON DILUTION YOU KNOW BUT UH LET ME REMIND YOU OF THE JUST THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THIS OPPORTUNITY LONGER TERM AND EVENTUALLY AS THE VOLUME SCALE UH THE- THE OPPORTUNITY IS SIGNIFICANT ON THE TOP LINE AND EVEN THOUGH IT REQUIRES INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF COMMERCIAL EFFORTS IN R&D YOU KNOW WE WILL DEFINITELY UH AFTER A FEW YEARS START TO SEE ACCRETION ON P&L AND THEN MAYBE HANS YOU COMMENT ON THE- THE CLINICAL VALUE AND THE QUESTIONS AROUND THIS SCREENING TEST AND WHERE WE ARE SURE SO- SO AS YOU AS YOU NOTED TYCHO UM THE UH SENSITIVITY FOR 50 CANCERS IS 44% SO LE- LET ME EXPLAIN WHY WE THINK THIS IS QUITE THROUGH PERFORMANCE UM FRANCIS TOUCHED ON THE FACT THAT WHEN WE PRE-SPECIFIED A BASKET OF 12 CANCERS WE HAVE SENSITIVITY OF JUST UNDER UH UH 70% AND THOSE 12 CANCERS BY THE WAY ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE MORTALITY UM WHAT YOU'RE OBSERVING IS WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING FOR MORE CANCERS IN THOSE 12 AND YOU START ADDING IN CANCERS WHERE THE TEST HAS LOWER SENSITIVITY THE SENSITIVITY DOES DROP BUT HERE'S WHAT MATTERS EVEN THOUGH THE SENSITIVITY DROPS AS YOU EXPAND THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER OF CANCERS YOU LOOK FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CANCERS YOU DETECT GOES UP SO A TEST LOOKING FOR 50 CANCERS AT 44% SENSITIVITY IN AGGREGATE DETECT MANY MORE CANCERS AND A TEST LOOKING FOR 12 CANCERS AT A 67% SENSITIVITY AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MEDICAL NEED WE ALL HAVE YOU KNOW 70% OF DEATHS IN THIS COUNTRY FROM CANCER OCCURRING CANCERS WHERE THERE IS NO SCREENING THIS TEST WILL DETECT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE SO- SO THAT THAT'S WHY IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO HAVE A TEST THAT CAN REALLY DETECT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CANCERS POSSIBLE THANK YOU HANS AND THEN YOUR LAST QUESTION TYCHO WAS YOU KNOW IS- IS THIS MOVE ANY REFLECTION OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE CORE MARKET AND IS THAT WHAT'S DRIVING THIS AND I THINK NOT AT ALL UH ARE WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN OUR CORE MARKET UH YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS YEAR THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS WE'VE SEEN A SLOW DOWN BECAUSE OF PEOPLE'S SHELTERING IN PLACE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC BUT WE THOUGHT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT'S SLOWLY BEEN- BEEN BUILDING UH SINCE THE END OF- OF Q1 AND YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR CERTAINLY AS WE START TO SEE A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES KICK BACK UP WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WITH THE CORE BUSINESS WE TALKED ABOUT THE POPULATION EFFORTS THAT ALL OF US IS GONNA BE STARTING IN THE BACK HALF OF THIS YEAR IN THE US BUT WE'LL BE WRAPPING UP NEXT YEAR SIMILARITY THAT UK BIOBANK PROJECT HAS BEEN GOING ON IT PAUSED FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S STARTING TO SCALE UP AGAIN UM AND THEN UH AT THE NHS EFFORT WHICH THIS YEAR HAS BEEN UH SIDELINE TO FOCUS ON- ON COVID IS GONNA BE KICKING BACK UP NEXT YEAR SO AS WE WE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHERE POPULATION SEQUENCING EFFORTS ARE GONNA BE STARTING INTO NEXT YEAR WE'VE SEEN GOOD NEWS IN TERMS OF UH GUIDELINE CHANGES FOR NIPT AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN NIPT AROUND THE WORLD UH WE'RE SEEING CONTINUED ADOPTION OF OUR TSO 500 PRODUCTS AND WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE GROWTH AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE LAUNCHED THE NEXTSEQ 2000 THIS YEAR AND SO WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SEE THAT UPGRADE CYCLE PLAY OUT CERTAINLY AS WE GET INTO NEXT YEAR THIS MOVE IS REALLY ABOUT OUR STRATEGY AND OUR STRATEGY HAS BEEN GUIDED BY OUR MISSION TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH BY UNLOCKING THE PART OF THE GENOME OUR STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE SEQUENCERS AND CONSUMABLES TO UH TO UH ABROAD RAF MARKETS AND THEN TO PICK VERY SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS WHERE WE WANT TO PROVIDE THE SOL- SOLUTION OURSELVES WE WANNA PICK THE LARGEST MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE A DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING AND FRANKLY IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CRITERIA THERE PROBABLY IS NO OTHER CRITERIA NO OTHER SPACE THAT MEETS THAT CRITERIA AS WELL AS EARLY CANCER DETECTION IT'S THE LARGEST OF THE GENOMIC APPLICATIONS THAT WE CAN IMAGINE OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS AND GRAIL HAS BUILT A- A- A VERY INNOVATION RICH PORTFOLIO WITH GOOD IP AROUND IT AND SO WE WILL HAVE A DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING IN THAT MARKET AND SO THE PRICE AGAIN THE STRATEGY IS YOU KNOW HORIZONTALLY PROVIDE SEQUENCERS AND <INAUDIBLE> EVERYWHERE AND THEN BE VERY SURGICAL AND THAT'S VERY COMMON FOR PLATFORM COMPANIES CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK AT YOU'RE IN TECHNOLOGY WHETHER IT'S APPLE OR AMAZON OR MICROSOFT THEY PROVIDE THE PLATFORM BUT THEN THERE ARE SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS THAT THEY PROVIDE DIRECTLY THEMSELVES TYPICALLY THE LARGEST APPLICATION AND HAVING AN APPLICATION ACTUALLY GIVES YOU ACCESS TO INSIGHTS THAT HAVE YOU CREATED A BETTER PLATFORM TOO SO HAVING SPECIFIC APPLICATION ALSO HELP YOU HELPS YOU HAVE THE BEST PLATFORMS IN THE MARKET SO WITH THAT WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION CERTAINLY AND AS A REMINDER PLEASE LIMIT YOURSELF TO ONE QUESTION TO ALLOW OTHERS AN OPPORTUNITY DERIK DE BRUIN WITH BANK OF AMERICA YOUR LINE IS OPEN UM HI GOOD MORNING SO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS UM I GUESS THE FIRST ONE HOW MUCH ILLUMINA'S REVENUES IN 2019 AND ESTIMATED REVENUES FOR 2028 WERE TIED TO SALES TO GRAIL NUMBER ONE UH NUMBER TWO I A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FROM INVESTORS THIS MORNING JUST WANTING TO GET SOME BETTER CLARITY ON THE EPS SOLUTION IS A 20% TO 30% UH EPS DILUTION A REASONABLE NUMBER FOR THE MA- INVESTORS TO SORT OF DO THEIR MODELS AND NUMBER THREE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM THE PATHFINDER TRIAL READOUTS UH AND- AND WHAT WOULD BE A WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD READOUT TO UH ENABLE THE LDT LAUNCH AND JUST SOME INITIAL THOUGHTS ON THE EARLY COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS AND- AND WHAT CONVERSATIONS GRAIL HAS HAD WITH POTENTIAL UM UH SELF-INSURED EMPLOYERS AND SORT OF THE OTHER MEMBERS THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THANK YOU SURE SO THREE QUESTIONS I'LL TAKE THE FIRST ONE AROUND UH GRAIL REVENUE TO ILLUMINA IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS UH MAYBE SAM YOU CAN TALK ABOUT EPS SOLUTIONS AND THEN HANS YOU CAN UH ANSWER THE QUESTION AROUND THE PATHFINDER READOUT UM SO FIRST ONE SORT OF SHORT UH IN 2019 AND 2020 GRAIL WAS A VERY VERY VERY VERY SMALL PART OF OUR OVERALL REVENUE UM IN FACT I TYPICALLY LOOK AT OUR TOP 20 CUSTOMERS ON A DAILY AND WEEKLY BASIS I DON'T THINK I EVER SAW THEM IN EITHER OF THOSE TWO YEARS ON THOSE LISTS SO SINCE A VERY SMALL PART OF OUR REVENUE FOR 2019 OR ' 2 UM SAM MAYBE UH EPS YEAH SO UH AS I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE- THE RAMP OF OFF IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS IS SIGNIFICANT DRIVEN BY THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF GALLERI SO OUR EXPECTATIONS RIGHT NOW IS THAT IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR POST-CLOSE OF THE DEAL THAT UH THERE WOULD BE EPS DILUTION OF SOMEWHERE IN THE UH 325 TO $375 RANGE AND THEN UH HANS COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PATHFINDER AND- AND THE UPCOMING READOUTS AND PLACE THAT IN CONTEXT A LITTLE BIT SURE AND- AND UH FOLKS THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR PATHFINDER IS A 6,000 PATIENT CLINICAL TRIAL THAT'S ENROLLING AS WE SPEAK IT'S A RETURN OF RESULTS STUDY SO PATIENTS IN THIS TRIAL GETTING THE GRAIL TEST WHEN THE TEST DETECTS THE CANCER THEY'RE GETTING WORKED UP UM OBVIOUSLY THE RESULTS RETURNED TO THEM SO UH OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT THAT REAL-WORLD TRIAL WILL- WI- WILL CONFIRM THE PERFORMANCE WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STUDIES THAT WE'VE REPORTED TO YOU AND COVERED ON THE CALL THIS MORNING THE- THE OTHER THING THAT UH THIS STUDY IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR IS IT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND THE SERVICE COMPONENTS OF THE TEST THAT WE'LL PROVIDE UH TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT THE WORKUP PROCESS POST A POSITIVE TEST IS- IS- IS SIMPLE AND GOOD TO USE FOR PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NEXT QUESTION PATRICK DONNELLY WITH CITI YOUR LINE IS OPEN GREAT THANKS GUYS MAYBE JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON DERIK THERE JUST GIVE HIM THE DILUTION NUMBER A- A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN WE WERE MODELING UH SO JUST AS THE NEWS CAME OUT LAST WEEK SAM CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT MAYBE THE OPEX TRAJECTORY OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AGAIN TO GET TO THAT UH 350 375 NUMBER YOU NOTED UM SHOULD WE EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO REALLY TAKE A BIG JUMP UP FROM WHAT WE SAW ON THE S1 FROM THE FROM THE UM THE GRAIL OPEX NUMBERS AND THEN MAYBE JUST QUICKLY AFTER THAT YOU GUYS WERE OBVIOUSLY PARTICIPATING WITH SOME UPSIDE FROM GRAIL AND ROYALTY AS A CUSTOMER ET CETERA SO CAN YOU JUST EXPAND A LITTLE MORE FRANCIS ON- ON I GUESS WHY YOU GUYS WANTED TO BRING IT IN HOUSE AND THEN ALSO GIVE THE ROYALTY ALMOST BACK TO THEM WITH A 9% OVER A BILLION UM THEY'RE JUST KIND OF FLUSH THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT THANKS GUYS YEAH SO I CAN START ON THE UH ON THE OPEX TRAJECTORY AND MAYBE EXPANDING ON THIS SOLUTION TO SOME EXTENT AND I'LL REMIND EVERYBODY THAT WE WILL BE PROVIDING MORE UH REFINED FINANCIAL ESTIMATES AS WE UM AS WE GET CLOSER TO UH CLOSE OF THE ACQUISITION SO AT THIS POINT WE'RE GIVING YOU KNOW DIRECTIONAL NUMBERS JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF- OF WHAT TO EXPECT IN YOUR MODELS UM BUT UH TO- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AROUND THE OPEX INVESTMENTS PATRICK YES UH OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE FROM WHAT YOU SAW IN THE S1 AND WHAT YOU SAW LAST YEAR OR THIS YEAR SORRY I KEEP SAYING LAST YEAR BUT WHAT YOU SAW THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT BY GRAIL YOU KNOW THE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN UH FOCUSED ON R&D AND AS I SAID YOU KNOW THE INVESTMENT THAT UH WAS DISCLOSED WAS 135 MILLION SO IF YOU EXPECT THAT THAT'S GONNA UM YOU KNOW BE A FULL YEAR WORTH OF INVESTMENT THAT'S CLOSER TO 270 BUT AS YOU LOOK FORWARD KIND OF THE GALLERI LAUNCHES THERE'S GONNA BE INVESTMENTS AROUND A NUMBER OF FACTORS YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE R&D IS GONNA BE COMMERCIAL IT'S GOING TO BE MARKET ACCESS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS UH YOU KNOW UH DNA TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT DRIVE THAT OPEX IN THE FIRST UM YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS AND UNTIL THE REVENUE START TO SCALE UM THAT'S GONNA BE SIGNIFICANTLY DILUTED UM SO THE NUMBER THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER WHICH IS THE 325 TO 375 IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR POST LAUNCH SO UM I THINK UH YOU KNOW I WAS ALSO THOUGH MENTION THAT WE'RE AT A $6 BILLION TAM THAT'S GOTTEN ADDED TO OUR BUSINESS YOU KNOW THE- THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITY IS QUITE ATTRACTIVE AS WE AS WE LOOK AT THE LONG TERM YEAH AND THEN THIRDLY LET ME PICK UP ON YOUR QUESTION AROUND ROYALTIES SO AS YOU POINTED OUT YOU KNOW THOSE THE ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE YOU KNOW HAVE PRE- ACQUISITION WAS <INAUDIBLE> THAT THEY BUY SEQUENCERS AND CONSUMABLES FROM US BUT WE ALSO GET A ROYALTY ON- ON THE GRAIL REVENUE AND YOU KNOW AS WE'VE THOUGHT THROUGH YOU KNOW WE MODELED WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS YOU KNOW IT'S CLEAR TO US THAT YOU KNOW WE PARTICIPATE UH MORE FULLY SO WE GET MORE REVENUE MORE MARGIN DOLLARS UH IN YOU KNOW IF WE ACQUIRED GRAIL SO JUST FINANCIALLY THIS IS A MUCH BETTER WAY OF CAPTURING THE- THE VALUE IN THE MARKET UH THAN CONTINUING TO BE A SUPPLIER TO GRAIL WITH THE ROYALTY AND AS SAM POINTED OUT THERE'S A $60 BILLION MARKET OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW WE- WE ARE ABLE TO SORT OF CAPTURE THE VALUE BETTER IN THE CURRENT AGREEMENT IN TERMS OF UH THE ROYALTY BACK TO GRAIL SHAREHOLDERS AND JUST AS A POINT THERE AS YOU HEARD IN THE PREPARED REMARKS WE ARE 12% CURRENTLY WITH THE UH GRAIL SHAREHOLDING SO YOU KNOW THE ROYALTY BY THE WAY ADJUSTED TO THE 12% THAT UH THAT WE OWN OURSELVES AND THE THINKING HERE WAS LOOK WE WERE WORKING WITH THE GRAIL INVESTORS NOW THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE YOU KNOW CLEARLY THEY SEE THE OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF THEM AND THERE WAS A GAP AND I THINK THEY SAW US AND WE WERE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE AND SO THIS WAS A NICE WAY TO SORT OF BRIDGE DOCTORS TO SAY LOOK WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE PARTICIPATE IF THE OPPORTUNITY IS MUCH BIGGER THAN WE THINK THAT EVERYBODY WINS UH OTHERWISE WE ALL SHARE IF IT'S IF IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN WE THOUGHT SO THIS WAS THE WAY TO STRUCTURE IT OVER THE NEXT 12 YEARS WHERE WE COULD YOU KNOW ALIGN ON YOU KNOW BENEFITING AS THE MARKET ENDS UP BEING MUCH BIGGER THAN WE THAN WE THOUGHT STEVE BEUCHAW WITH WOLFE RESEARCH YOUR LINE IS OPEN UH HI GOOD MORNING UH THANKS FOR THE TIME I'LL ASK JUST TO UH ONE I ACTUALLY WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A POINT THAT- THAT TYCHO RAISED AND IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW YOU WANNA ARTICULATE UH RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE- THE CORE BUSINESS I APPRECIATE THE POINTS THAT ALL OF US BIOBANK NHS ALL COMING ON THE NEXT UH NEXT YEAR I'M AWAY TO DO THE PIPELINE BUT I WONDER WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE YOU KNOW TAKING A VIEW THAT THE- THE CORE BUSINESS THE EX- GRAIL BUSINESS IS A DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWER UH AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE OUT INTO THE FUTURE AND THEN MY SECOND ONE IS AS YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE LANDSCAPE OF PROVIDERS YOU KNOW OUT FIVE OR- OR 10 YEARS AGO UH FROM NOW RATHER FIVE OR 10 YEARS FROM NOW WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF HOW MANY DIFFERENT CANCER DETECTION ASSAYS YOU- YOU THINK ARE OUT THERE HAVING ILLUMINA INVOLVED IN- IN THIS PARTICULAR UH WAY IT MEANS THAT THERE'S GONNA BE ONE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY VERY LARGE SCALE PLAYER THE WAYS TO UH TO COME AT THIS PARTICULAR MARKET CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU- YOU SEE THAT LOOKING AND WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF UH THE RATHER SUBSTANTIAL IP PORTFOLIO UH THAT UH YOU HAD FLAGGED UH FRANCIS AND HANS AS YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT LANDSCAPE LOOKS LIKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU STEVE SO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ONE IS HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE- THE CORE BUSINESS AND THE SECOND ONE IS HOW DO WE THINK THE UH LANDSCAPE FOR CANCER DETECTION ASSAYS WILL PLAY OUT WOULD THERE BE A- A SIGNIFICANT SINGLE WINNER OR WOULD THERE BE MULTIPLE PLAYERS SO LET ME GO TO THE FIRST ONE YOU KNOW THE UH I ABSOLUTELY AM COMFORTABLE YOU KNOW SAYING THAT WE EXPECT OUR CORE BUSINESS OVER A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD YOU KNOW TO GENERATE DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH YOU KNOW WE ARE STILL AS WE SAID IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF UNDERSTANDING FROM A RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE EVEN HOW GENOMICS TRANSLATES INTO YOU KNOW HEALTH AND DISEASE BUT FROM A CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE WE'RE ALSO IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF PENETRATING SOME OF THE MARKETS WE TALKED ABOUT LIKE ONCOLOGY THERAPY SELECTION AND GENETIC DISEASE TESTING GENETIC DISEASE TESTING WE'RE LESS THAN 1% PENETRATION SO I AM COMFORTABLE THAT OVER A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD YOU SHOULD BE SEEING DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH FROM THE CORE BUSINESS UM AND THAT YOU KNOW THE ACQUISITION OF GRAIL IS INTENDED TO ACCELERATE THAT EVEN FURTHER BUT EVEN WITHOUT IT IT'S A DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IN TERMS OF HOW WE EXPECT THE UH CANCER DETECTION MARKET TO PLAY OUT NOW THIS IS A VERY VERY LARGE MARKET AND YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT A $60 BILLION MARKET AND SO WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE APPROACHES UH FOR THIS MARKET THAT YOU KNOW SOME WILL FOCUS ON SINGLE CANCERS OR SMALL SET OF CANCERS SOME WILL BE PAN-CANCER UM AND- AND FINALLY THAT'S HOW WE'VE MODELED YOU KNOW SORT OF UH THE REVENUES FOR US THAT WE EXPECT THERE TO BE MULTIPLE PLAYERS IN ARE TRYING MULTIPLE DIFFERENT APPROACHES SERVING DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE MARKET UM AND- AND AGAIN WITH A MARKET THIS BIG AND- AND THIS IMPORTANT WE- WE EXPECT IT TO PLAY OUT THAT WAY AND THIS IS ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR QUESTIONS THE ILLUMINA TEAM THANKS YOU ALL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN TODAY'S CONFERENCE THIS CONCLUDES TODAY'S CALL YOU MAY NOW DISCONNECT",

With that, I'll turn the call over to Franz. Thanks, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on such short notice. I'm excited to share that earlier this morning, we announced an agreement to acquire GRAIL and to work together to launch a new era in cancer detection. Before we start, I want to acknowledge the GRAIL team for what they've accomplished. We spent out GRAIL four years ago to focus on cancer detection. ON AN AMBITIOUS GOAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE DETECT CANCER BY DEVELOPING A BLOOD TEST THAT COULD FIND CANCER EARLIER THAN IS POSSIBLE TODAY THEIR INNOVATION AND RESULTS SINCE THEN HAVE EXCEEDED EVEN OUR LOFTY EXPECTATIONS SETTING THE STAGE FOR EARLY CANCER DETECTION TO LIKELY BE THE LARGEST GENOMIC APPLICATION OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS BY FAR THIS COMBINATION WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE FOR CANCER DETECTION THE ACQUISITION WILL ENABLE To leverage Illumina's global commercial, clinical and operations capabilities, accelerating their mission and allowing us to impact more people faster than they might have done alone. Illumina's next generation sequencers will continue to support genomic medicine to become the standard of care across clinical applications. And with this acquisition, we will accelerate and participate more fully and directly in the highest value clinical opportunity enabled by our technology. PHARMACOLOGY SPECIFICALLY THE ACQUISITION POSITIONS ALUNA TO PARTICIPATE IN WHAT WE EXPECT WILL BE A SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR MARKET FOR NGs BASED ONCOLOGY TESTS BY THIRTY FIVE YEARS FROM NOW SIXTY BILLION HIGHER THAN OUR ONCOLOGY TAM EXCLUDING GRAIL CANCER IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO HUMAN HEALTH DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS MADE AND THE IMPORTANT MEDICAL ADVANCES ACHIEVED SO FAR WHEN WE DIAGNOSE CANCER TOO Metastatic less than twenty percent of patients will survive more than five years. In contrast, if we diagnose cancer early, approximately ninety percent of patients are expected to survive beyond five years. About seventy one percent of cancer-related deaths are attributable to cancers with no recommended screening tests. And with limited screening tests, cancer is more likely to be detected in the late stages and often too late. This is both a human tragedy and an enormous burden on the healthcare system. Each year, there are over six hundred thousand cancer-related deaths in the U.S. and approximately ten million deaths worldwide, making it the second leading cause of death. We spend approximately two hundred and fifty billion dollars per year on cancer in the U.S. and globally, the annual economic impact is more than one point two trillion dollars. In time, there is a technology platform that enables us to address this burden. Starting with Grail's multi-cancer detection test gallery, which aims to reduce cancer deaths by transforming how and when cancer is detected. Grail's technology characterizes the dna that cancer cells shed into the blood, detecting unique signatures that identify both the presence and often the tissue of origin of the cancer. GRAIL SHARED POSITIVE RESULTS FROM ITS CIRCULATING CELL-FREE GENOME ATLAS OR CCGA STUDY THAT HAS ENROLLED FIFTEEN THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE FIRST VERSION OF GALLERY REPORTED SENSITIVITY OF FORTY FOUR PERCENT FOR STAGE ONE THROUGH THREE TUMORS FOR FIFTY DIFFERENT CANCERS AND SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT SENSITIVITY FOR THE TWELVE DEADLIEST CANCERS. AND IN NINETY THREE PERCENT OF THE POSITIVE RESULTS. The test correctly identified the tissue of origin, all with a specificity of greater than ninety-nine percent, and from a single blood draw. Arguably, one of the most important performance measures for doctors and payers is the positive predictive value, or PPV, which is the percentage of tests that actually result in a cancer diagnosis. For galleri, we predict a PPV of forty-three percent. This is a very significant step forward compared to today's most commonly used screening tests which often have a ppv in the range of three to five percent the grey team is preparing to launch gallery as a lab developed test or ldt in twenty twenty one we believe that this is a remarkable advance in the ability to detect cancer earlier which can transform cancer care and improve population health as noted earlier MOST CANCERS ARE CURRENTLY DIAGNOSED IN LATE STAGES AS SHOWN BY THE GRAY BARS IN THE CHART ON THE LEFT HALF OF SLIDE CHICKS. THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT SCREENING METHODS LEAD TO ONLY THIRTY ONE PERCENT OF CANCERS BEING IDENTIFIED IN STAGES ONE AND TWO WHEN THEY ARE THE MOST TREATABLE. BASED ON GRAIL STUDIES THIS COULD INCREASE TO EIGHTY TWO PERCENT WITH BROAD ADOPTION OF GALLERY'S BLOOD TEST COMPLEMENTING TODAY'S RECOMMENDED CANCER It Matters because if we mentioned earlier, survival rates are directly correlated with how early cancer is detected. Broad-based adoption of gallium could avert nearly forty percent of the five-year cancer mortality or around one hundred thousand deaths annually in the U.S. In the field, most cancers are currently diagnosed in late stages, as shown by the gray bars in the chart on the left half of slide six. The limitations of current screening methods lead to only thirty-one percent of cancers being identified in stages one and two when they are most treatable. Based on recent studies, this could increase to eighty-two percent with a broader option of gallium blood tests complementing today's recommended screening. This matters because, as we mentioned, it is crucial to catch cancers in their early stages. Earlier, survival rates are directly correlated with how early cancer is detected. Broad adoption of galleri could avert nearly forty percent of the five-year cancer mortality or around one hundred thousand deaths annually in the U.S. To put this in perspective, this roughly matches the number of deaths prevented by all current screening, testing, treatment, and surgery standards combined. Once available, we are confident. The galleries will enable screening for more cancers than ever before. While screening has improved for some cancers including lung, breast, colorectal and cervical, we know that roughly six and ten cancers diagnosed from twelve million cases and five million deaths a year are associated with cancers with no recommended screening requirements. Since galleries will help discover cancer earlier, we believe that galleries can help detect three times as many cancers when added to screening. RECOMMENDED SINGLE CANCER SCREENINGS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF GRAIL'S WORK WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS BY IMPROVING THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF CANCER DETECTION PAIRS WILL BE ABLE TO REALIZE THE LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TREATMENT OF CAN Alongside existing screening guidelines, this could reduce diagnostic workup costs by up to 65%. These benefits are key drivers in the market potential, which we anticipate reflects an addressable market for NGS-based oncology testing of 75 billion dollars. Today, we're seeing rapid adoption of NGS-based therapy selection tests, many based on illumina technology, over the next 15 years. Years, we expect this market to grow in a category of about sixteen percent to fourteen billion dollars to an annual seven million test opportunity and an approximate A S F of thirteen hundred to twenty three hundred dollars. Eli Lilly participates in the therapy selection market with our T S O five hundred tests currently available for research use only and making its way through regulatory approval for commercial launch in early twenty twenty two. To strengthen and drive the utilization of therapy selection tests, we are seeing more companies working on monitoring tests that will assess the activity of a patient's cancer. This can optimize disease management and determine the effectiveness of cancer therapies for individual patients. These assays can also act as surveillance tests for cancer patients who have completed therapy and are in remission. We expect this market to grow at a rate of about twenty seven percent. TO FIFTEEN BILLION IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE TEST OPPORTUNITY HERE IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO ABOUT TWENTY MILLION TESTS PER YEAR WITH AN EXPECTED ASV OF SEVEN HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS THE CANCER SCREENING OPPORTUNITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THERAPY SELECTION AND MONITORING COMBINED THIS MARKET IS EXPECTED TO GROW QUICKLY TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TESTS IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE A SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT CAGR Approximately forty six billion dollars. This assumes an ASP that starts around twelve hundred dollars and trends to about three hundred dollars in twenty thirty five as we scale and drive adoption with increasingly accessible pricing. With regards to the market for galleries specifically, there is the sizable, addressable market of over one hundred million people between the age of fifteen to seventy nine in the US. We believe approximately half of this addressable market. Is accessible in gallery prior to reimbursement the grail to go market strategy next year will consist of three core channels health systems self-insured employers and concierge medicine given the cost improvement potential we feel that health systems and self-insured employers will recognize the compelling value proposition and drive adoption of the first multicancer detection ldt available there's also an opportunity in concierge medicine MEDICINE SEGMENT THAT TYPICALLY CATERS TO HEALTH CONSCIOUS MEMBERS THAT LIKE TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF NEW MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES WHO COULD BE THE EARLY ADOPTERS OF GALLERY WE EXPECT THAT GRAIL WILL LAUNCH GALLERY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE LOOK FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL RESULTS NEXT YEAR FROM THE CCGA SUB STUDY THREE AND BAT FINDER TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE CLINICAL VALIDATION OF GALLERY ADDITIONALLY GRAIL WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON ITS DIAGNOSTIC AIDS FOR CAN OR DACC WHICH IS INTENDED FOR SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS AND IS DESIGNED TO SPEED UP THE TIME TO DIAGNOSE WHEN CANCER IS SUSPECTED AND GRAIL ALSO HAS A MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE OR MRD TEST IN DEVELOPMENT INTENDED FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED AND TREATED TO DETECT PERSISTENT DISEASE FOLLOWING DEFINITIVE THERAPY ON THAT NOTE I'D LIKE TO INVITE HANS THE CEO OF GRAIL TO SAY A FEW WORDS THANK YOU FRANCIS I'M EXCITED TO BE LET US START BY RECOGNISING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE GRAIL TEAM. WE'RE A MISSION-DRIVEN COMPANY FOCUSED ON DETECTING CANCER EARLY WHEN IT CAN BE CURED. AND WE BELIEVE OUR EARLY CANCER DETECTION TECHNOLOGY COULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CANCER WORLDWIDE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY THAT PREFERENTIALLY TARGETS THE MOST INFORMATIVE REGIONS OF THE GENOME AND USES MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO D Detect the presence of cancer and identify the tumor tissue of origin. We believe by joining forces with Illumina we will achieve scale faster preventing more late stage cancer diagnoses. We are strongly positioned with our first two commercial product launches expected in twenty twenty one and once our deal closes we will be able to leverage the global scale and reach of Illumina through relationships and...

The comparison is five times larger than the cancer genome atlas illumina remains the most innovative company in this field. SEQUENCING AND GRAIL'S ABILITY TO KEEP PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHAT'S PO ONE WILL EQUAL WELL OVER TWO AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HAND CALL BACK TO FRANCIS THANKS HENRY I COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE GRAIL TEAM TO ACCELERATE ADOPTION OF THEIR LIFE SAVING PRODUCTS BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CLINICAL AND OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES OUR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION MARKETS CELLS AND SUPPORT OUR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION MARKETS CELLS AND SUPPORT OUR GLOBAL COMM Including a number of national population-scale genomics programs powered by Illumina sequencing technology. Illumina first established our clinical lab in 2009 and since then have added two more, including one in the UK to support genomics England and the NHS. These certified and accredited labs are staffed by more than 250 team members, including board-certified pathologists, medical geneticists, genetic counselors, and PhDs. FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, OUR LABS HAVE PROCESSED MORE THAN SEVENTEEN MILLION ARRAYS AND ALMOST ONE MILLION CLINICAL SAMPLES. WE HAVE ALSO EXPANDED OUR CLINICAL CAPABILITIES AND BUILT OUT WORLD-CLASS MARKET ACCESS, GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, AND REGULATORY FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR CLINICAL GRADE DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING TEAMS DELIVER SYSTEMS AND KITS REGISTERED FOR IVD USE IN MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. At the same time, we've been extending our reach into the clinical market through partnerships with leading clinical companies including BMS, Pfizer, and Roche. As Illumina and Grail come together, we accelerate the adoption of clinical NGS-based testing. This will have a positive impact on our business over time. More of our revenue will reflect the clinical value of our NGS products and not only the underlying sequencing output. As a result, Illumina will play a direct role in accelerating the adoption of clinical NGS-based testing. We are accelerating the adoption of genomic medicine in addition to enabling it. As we evolve, lumina remains committed to all of our customers and partners. We are dedicated to delivering the most innovative sequencing systems and consumables to our customers and partners. There is still so much important research to be done and we know this will be enabled in part by continued innovation in sequencing. And on the clinical side, our mission has always been to... IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH BY UNLOCKING THE POWER OF THE GENOME WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENABLE OUR CLINICAL CUSTOMERS TO SCALE AS THEY TOO WORK TOWARDS THE SHARED GOAL WITH THAT LET ME HAND FLIP OVER TO SAM FOR A QUICK REVIEW OF FINANCIAL TERMS AND IMPACT THANKS FRANCIS AS ANNOUNCED EARLIER TODAY WE HAVE AGREED TO ACQUIRE GRAIL FOR A TOTAL CASH AND STOCK CONSIDERATION OF EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WITH ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS LINKED TO CERTAIN PRODUCT Over the first twelve years, this acquisition expands Illumina's market opportunity by more than sixty billion dollars. It allows us to participate in the clinical market more fully and will contribute to revenue growth starting modestly in 2021 and meaningfully accelerating over time. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2021 and we will share more detailed expectations about revenue growth and impact on EPS when that happens. The current stock consideration is eight billion dollars. Since Illumina currently owns twelve percent of GRAIL's equity on a fully diluted basis, the purchase price represents approximately seven billion dollars to GRAIL's other shareholders. As part of the transaction, Illumina will pay GRAIL shareholders approximately four billion dollars in common stock, which is subject to a collar. The number of shares issued should be based on the twenty-trade volume-weighted average price. Moreover, the stock consideration collar ensures the final number of shares that Grey shareholders receive is derived from a price that will be within a share price band of two hundred ninety five dollars and three hundred ninety nine dollars. The remaining three point one billion dollars cash consideration is expected to be funded with balance sheet cash and up to an additional one billion dollars raised. THROUGH EQUITY OR DEBT WE HAVE A ONE MILLION DOLLAR FULLY COMMITTED DRICH PARTNERSHIP FOR GOLDMAN SACHS TO SECURE FUNDING AVAILABILITY THE LAST COMPONENT OF THE DEAL INCLUDES CONTINGENT PAYMENT RIGHTS TO GRAIL SHAREHOLDERS BASED ON GRAIL RELATED PROFITS FOR A TWELVE YEAR PERIOD SPECIFICALLY A TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT PAYMENT RIGHT IS APPLIED TO THE FIRST ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE EACH YEAR AND ALL REVENUE WELL, WITH THAT, BACK TO THE PRESENT. THANK YOU, SAM. WHEN WE CREATED GRAIL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN, WE KNEW THAT ITS MISSION WAS A MOONSHOT, BUT AN IMPORTANT ONE. ONE THAT WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE DETECTION OF CANCER AND SUCCESSFULLY POSITIVELY IMPACT MILLIONS OF LIVES AND OPEN A MASSIVE MARKET OPPORTUNITY. WE WANTED TO SEE THE TECHNOLOGY PROGRESS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, CREATE THE LARGEST CLINICAL TRIALS AND GET IT RIGHT. PATIENCE IN YEARS, NOT DECADES IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS AND CAPITALIZE THE EFFORT WAS AS A SEPARATED COMPANY WITH THIS SINGULAR FOCUS AND AN EXTRAORDINARY TEAM THAT COULD EXECUTE QUICKLY THE LUMINA SET IT UP FOR SUCCESS BY SEEDING IT WITH TECHNOLOGY AND SOME OF OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST FOUR YEARS LATER GRAIL HAS VERIFIED THIS GUESS RIGHT AND IS NOW AT THE PRE-COMMERCIAL STAGE IT WAS A BIG BET AND IT PAID OFF OVER THE LAST Four and a half years, Grail has raised almost two billion dollars to fund its mission. During the same period, Illumina generated about four billion dollars in revenue. Grail's mission is no longer a moonshot, and we believe it is poised to transform cancer detection. Our mission at Illumina is to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. This has changed in over the last twenty-two years. We began our journey by launching the power of the genome. We offer microarray-based services and products. Our breakthrough arrays offer higher throughput, lower cost, more flexibility, and higher quality than existing technologies. We became the leading microarray vendor by 2006, more than doubling revenues from the previous year. While we enjoyed this success, we saw the opportunity to take the next step forward towards our mission through sequencing. Arrays aren't going away, and in 2020, we still have an array business. FOR A HUGE AND VERY ELASTIC RESEARCH MARKET REQUIRED BY HIGH QUALITY LOWER COST SEQUENCING SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE ACQUIRED SELEXA A SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WITH NO REVENUE FOR SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A THIRD OF OUR MARKET CAP AT THE TIME THE MARKET WAS INITIALLY SKEPTICAL BUT WE BEGAN THE RACE TO THE THOUSAND DOLLAR JEWEL AND OVER THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS THE VISION HAS PROVED RIGHT WE REDUCED THE COST OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TODAY ENABLES GROUNDBREAKING GENOMIC DISCOVERIES INCLUDING CIRCULATING FETAL DNA IN MATERNAL BLOOD AND THE IMPACT OF RARE VARIANTS ON CANCER THERAPY RESPONSE BY TWENTY FOUR TEEN WHEN WE DELIVERED THE INDUSTRY'S FIRST THOUSAND DOLLAR GENOME OUR RESEARCH SEQUENCING BUSINESS WAS THRIVING AND ONCE AGAIN WE SENSE WE WERE ENTERING A NEW ERA OF GENOM Invasive prenatal testing. In December 23, we received the first ever FDA authorization for a next-generation sequencer. We embarked on our own multi-year clinical transformation, building out the capabilities I referenced earlier. Today, our clinical business, therapy selection in oncology, NGS, and genetic disease testing account for half of our sequencing consumable revenues. We're now entering the next phase of genomics. Sequencing is the future. STANDARD OF CARE EARLY CANCER DETECTION REPRESENTS THE LARGEST GENOMICS APPLICATION BY FAR WE BELIEVE OVER THE NEXT DECADE BECAUSE CANCER SCREENING IMPACTS A VERY LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION IT URGES IN AN ERA WHERE REGULAR GENOMIC TESTING IS THE NORM FOR A POPULATION WE ACCELERATE THIS VISION BY ACQUIRING GRAILS BEFORE WE OPEN UP TO KUANA I WANT TO SUMMARIZE A FEW THINGS FIRST EXCLUDING GRAIL FOR A MOMENT We remain confident in our business and excited by the opportunity ahead. We expect to continue as the leading innovator in sequencing, supporting most research and clinical customers. Grail is not replacing anything and as such, the acquisition will be additive to illumina's opportunity and growth. We consider early cancer detection to be one of the largest clinical opportunities of the next fifteen years and we believe it will accelerate global adoption by participating more directly. SECOND: THIS ACQUISITION IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGY TO EXTEND INTO THE CLINICAL MARKET THE FASTEST GROWING OPPORTUNITY IN SEQUENCING. WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER SEQUENCING SYSTEMS AND CONSUMABLES AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF SEQUENCING INNOVATION TO DEMOCRATIZE ACCESS AND REALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO POSITIVELY IMPACT HUMAN HEALTH. THIRD: WE SPENT OUR GRAIL FOUR YEARS AGO ON A MOONSHOT MISSION. THE MISSION OVER TIME: NOW THAT THEY STAND POISED TO BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE, WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO BRING THE GRAIL TEAM INTO ILLUMINA SO THAT WE CAN HELP TO COMMERCIALIZE AND ACCELERATE ADOPTION. IN CLOSING, OUR MISSION TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH BY UNLOCKING THE POWER OF THE GENOME AND GRAIL'S MISSION TO DETECT CANCER EARLY WHEN IT CAN BE CURED COULD NOT BE MORE CONSISTENT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ACC Change in genomic medicine together. With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the Q and A. Certainly, at this time, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star one. Again, you will be limited to one question. Dag Sverre Olsen, with Kallen, your line is open. Good morning. So, gril is clearly a really exciting and promising asset, and it did a great job this morning outlining. A LOT OF THAT AND YOU WERE VERY COMPREHENSIVE IN EXPLAINING WHY YOU WANT TO DO THIS DEAL I'M ACTUALLY HOPING THAT YOU COULD ADDRESS HOW YOU GOT COMFORTABLE OVERCOMING SOME OF THE REASONS NOT TO DO THE DEAL THOSE INCLUDE THREE THINGS THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR YOU TO ADDRESS THE FIRST IS THE CHALLENGE OF COMPETING WITH CUSTOMERS WHICH HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR YOU IN THE PAST AND SOMETHING YOU TALKED ABOUT AVOIDING SO I'M FIRST OFF WONDER Why the pivot there? Secondly, the dilution associated with this deal which could create a potential internal PnL conflict when it comes to incentive structure, not to mention an issue with investor valuation methodologies. I think this is part of the reason your stock got hit so much last week in anticipation of its announcement. So how do you handle potential PnL conflict internally and externally moving forward? And then thirdly, the lack of clear clinical operating synergies. AND HOW YOU PLAN TO SUCCEED AS A CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY IN A WAY THAT YOU HAVEN'T IN THE PAST WE KNOW THAT ILLUMINA IS GREAT AT CERTAIN THINGS THAT ESPECIALLY DEVELOPING LEADING GENETIC TOOLS PLATFORMS AND HAVING AN AMAZING COMMERCIAL TEAM IN PLACE TO SUPPORT NOT JUST THE PLACEMENT OF THESE PLATFORMS BUT HOW USERS USE THEM THAT SAID WHILE YOU'VE BEEN GREAT AS AN ARMS DEALER TO CLINICAL CUSTOMERS YOUR TRACK RECORD ISN'T AS STR Questions and getting them through regulatory and reimbursement pathways. So, so what are the clinical synergies and how do you quantify them? Again, one, how do you manage competing with customers? Two, how do you manage the PnL conflict internally and externally? And third, why should we get excited about this given the lack of clear clinical operating synergies? Thank you. Sure. Thank you, Doug. So let's go through each of those. The first one is how do we manage competing with customers? Our strategy there continues to be that in the vast majority of applications in the markets that we serve, we will look to our customers and our partners to develop the applications and our sequencers and consumables. That's going to be true for the vast majority of applications. What we've said, however, is that for a very small set of applications, where we felt the market was large and we felt there was a differentiated offering that we could put into the market, then we would. In that market directly in those markets we still enable our customers and partners to create competing offerings. So we continue to support everybody. But we said in the very large markets where we felt we had a differentiated capability to bring into the market we would enter those. And you've seen us do that for example in the i p t space where we brought innovations and an international property into that market and put together an end-to-end solution. You saw us do that in the large cancer panels like the five hundred gene panel t s o five hundred. AND NOW YOU'RE SEEING TO DO THAT HERE IN THIS CASE WE FEEL THAT THE CRITERIA WE USE HAVE BEEN MET THIS IS A VERY LARGE APPLICATION FOR US WE THINK THAT OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE THE LARGEST GENOMICS APPLICATION IN THE MARKET IN TERMS OF ADDRESSABLE MARKET SIZE AND THE GRAIL TEAM HAS PUT TOGETHER A VERY DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING A LOT OF INNOVATION A LOT OF I P THAT WAS CREATED HANS TALKED ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY APPL AND SEVENTY MORE THAT HAVE BEEN FILED. AND THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING. AND IN THIS CASE, YOU KNOW, WITH GRAILS PIONEERING THE MARKET, THERE'S A SORT OF LEADING THE WAY IN CREATING THAT MARKET. SO AS WE LOOKED AT THE MARKET, WE FELT IT METS THE CRITERIA FOR ONE OF THE VERY SMALL SET OF MARKETS THAT WE WOULD GET INTO DIRECTLY. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THOUGH TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO CREATE THEIR OWN OFFERINGS IN THIS We got comfortable with that and how we'd manage PnL conflicts. So the thinking here is that we're gonna manage GREY as a as a separate division and we're gonna report we're gonna be transparent about the PnL of GREY and we're gonna manage that differently and separately from the PnL for the rest of the business. And we understand the profile of what it'll take to get GREY successful in the market going forward and so will be Kennedy very transparent about it. LOOKS LIKE: WE EXPECT THAT TO BE DILUTIVE FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. BUT THEN BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE OPPORTUNITY WE EXPECT IT TO BE HIGHLY ACREATIVE AS THIS AS WE START TO SCALE THE OFFERING IN THE LATER YEARS. AND AGAIN WE WILL BE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT SHARING WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. LONG TERM WE HAVE A HIGH CONFIDENCE IN THE P N L ATTRACTIVENESS OF THIS BUSINESS BUT WE DO KNOW IT TAKES INVESTMENT IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS. THE N Coming into illumina and as you know we've been building out our clinical capabilities since two thousand and thirteen and so today for example you know we have a number of places where we think grail could benefit you know as soon as they come in some things we talked about on the call one for example is that we're engaged with over fifty population sequencing efforts around the world today we're talking to them about oncology therapy selection genetic disease diagnosis we think it's a very A NATURAL AD TO EXPAND THE CONVERSATION TO INCLUDE CANCER PREVENTION AND DETECTION. WE THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE IN THE CONVERSATIONS WE'RE IN. SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY SCALE UP THE NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS THAT GRAIL IS HAVING AROUND THE WORLD. WE TALKED ABOUT OUR CLINICAL LABS. WE HAVE AMONG THE LARGEST CLINICAL GENOMICS LABS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TWO IN THE US, ONE IN THE UK. THOSE LABS HAVE ALREADY EXPERTISE NECESSARY TO DO THAT AND WE'VE ALSO BUILT YOU KNOW THE REGULATORY CAPABILITIES THE MARKET ACCESS CAPABILITIES THE IN COUNTRY SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT CLINICAL OFFERINGS AROUND THE WORLD TODAY WE HAVE I V D S THAT ARE CLEARED IN THIRTY FIVE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD LEVERAGING RELATIONSHIPS WE BUILT WITH THE REGULATORY BODIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AS WELL AS HAVING IN MARKET SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND YOU ON THE MARKET LIKE OUR VERISKY NIPT PRODUCT WHICH IS SEE IDV D MART AND DOING REALLY WELL IN AMEA. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CLINICAL CAPABILITIES THAT FRANKLY WE SPENT THE LAST FIVE PLUS YEARS BUILDING THAT GRAIL PLUGS INTO IMMEDIATELY. YOUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM TYEKO PETERSON WITH J P MORGAN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HEY THANKS A QUICK COUPLE OF ONES. SO YOU KNOW YOUR STOCK LOST TWENTY BILLION IN MARKET CAP LAST WEEK YOU KNOW, DOES THAT INFLUENCE YOUR THINKING AND WHAT DOES IT THAT YOU THINK THE STREET DOESN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND HERE, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THIS IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT I THINK ABOUT A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR STEP UP SINCE THE LAST ROUND GRAIL DID IN MAY AND WHY IS BUYING IT ALL NOW THE RIGHT APPROACH GIVEN THAT YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN YOUR EQUITY STAKE UP HIGHER, MAYBE TO FORTY PERCENT, HELP THE I.P.O WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY CAN GO AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK GRAIL NEEDS TO SPEND ON R&D AND THE SALESFORCE RAMP TO REALLY SCALE UP THIRD YOU KNOW FRANCES YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW A CONFIDENCE IN THE CORE BUSINESS YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THE INVESTORS ARE GOING TO WORRY ABOUT IS IS YOU KNOW YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT GROWTH IN THE CORE BUSINESS OR MAYBE YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS DEAL TO DIVERSIFY AND COVER UP YOUR CONTINU FOR BOTH FRANCES AND HANS YOU KNOW WHY IS A FORTY FOUR PERCENT SENSITIVITY FOR A SCREEN TEST YOU KNOW OF CLINICAL VALUE ESPECIALLY AT THE PRICE POINTS BEING BEING TALKED ABOUT THANK YOU THANK YOU SHARKO ALRIGHT A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER SO I'M GOING TO START BY TALKING ABOUT YOUR FIRST QUESTION WHICH IS THE WHY NOW QUESTION AND THEN SAM I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO YOU TO TALK ABOUT OUR CORE BUSINESS AND THEN I'LL COME BACK AND We need the screening tests and their chemical value. So let's start. So why now? And and and did there any sort of reaction in our minds we're asking around the stock drop that had a lasting effect? So the reason for why now and and frankly we took a longer term view. So the events of last week didn't really impact our why now decision. And I'll talk about that a little bit. But the reason for why now is frankly the terrific progress that the grayline has made. AGED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WHERE THEY STAND RIGHT NOW WHEN WE SPENT OUR GRADE FOUR YEARS AGO YOU REMEMBER HOW THIS IDEA GOT STARTED RIGHT? SO WE WERE PROCESSING SAMPLES FOR N I P T IN OUR CLINICAL LABS AND ALTHOUGH WE WERE SEEING NORMAL YOU KNOW FETAL D N A WE NOTICED ABNORMALITIES IN THE MOTHER'S D N A AND SO WE REPORTED THAT TO THE DOCTOR AND IN ALL OF THOSE CASES IT TURNED OUT THAT THE MOTHER HAD CANCER AND DIDN'T KNOW It was an idea that if you could get signals for cancer in the blood and we incubated that idea on our team for a couple of years to feel like there was something there but there was a lot of unknowns. It was unclear whether there was enough signal to detect early stage cancer. It was unclear whether you could detect only certain types of cancer. It was unclear if the approach we were thinking about was the right approach. And so what we wanted was to create a company that was going after this this moonshot mission that would be focused on this. The team moved quickly on that, but we also wanted to know if there were other approaches in the market that would be more fruitful. The team has done a fantastic job over the last four years and has sort of de-risked a lot of the questions. The technology they've put together, the team they've assembled, and then probably most importantly, the results they're demonstrating from their large-scale clinical studies have put to bed a lot of the questions that we had. You know, the gallery results I talked about based on the ctgf. AYAYA SAMPLES SHOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY OVER FIFTY FIFTY TYPES OF CANCER THAT THEY HAVE A SPECIFICITY THAT THAT MEANS THE FALSE OF NINETY NINE PERCENT IS A FALSE POSITIVE RATE OF LESS THAN ONE PERCENT SO THEY WON'T FLOOD YOU KNOW HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WITH FALSE POSITIVES AND THEY HAVE HIGH SENSITIVITY ESPECIALLY FOR THE DEADLIEST CANCERS AND SO THEY STAND TODAY ON THE PRECIPICE OF COMMERCIALIZING A DO YOU DO TO ACQUIRE THEM? AND WHY ACQUIRE THEM YOU ASK? WHY NOT JUST INCREASE OUR INVESTMENTS? AND THE REASON TO ACQUIRE THEM IS BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT INTO HOW WE CAN ACCELERATE THE PLAN THAT THEY ARE ON TODAY. AND WE CAN ONLY DO THAT IF THEY'RE PART OF LUMINA. PLUGGING THEM INTO OUR COMMERCIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH POPULATION SEQUENCING EFFORTS, FOR EXAMPLE. STANDING THEM UP IN OUR CLINICAL LABS AROUND THE WORLD RATHER EXPERTISE IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD\n\nALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WITH THEIR PARTICULAR LUMINESCENT MATERIALS THAT FRANKLY WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO AS WELL EVEN IF WE WERE A THIRD FORTY PERCENT OWNER OF GRAIL AND SO YOU KNOW THEY ARE YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT LAUNCHING THE PRODUCT NEXT YEARS THAT ARE CLOSEST TO COMMERCIALIZATION SO IT'S EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME WE FELT WHERE THERE IS A PRODUCT THE VALUE In terms of the stock drop, you know we've seen before and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks that this is a big step. I understand that this is also a big amount. I understand that and you know we've had this happen to us before when we were in the array business and we wanted to get into sequencing and we announced that we were acquiring Selecta to get into the sequencing business. Our stock dropped that day too and it took a while for us to work with with the market. EXPLAINING WHERE WE WERE GOING AND WHY WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A BIG OPPORTUNITY AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW TODAY THAT'S BEEN AN ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL STORY AND SEQUENCING IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE AND SO WE ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WAS WORK FOR US TO DO IN EXPLAINING THIS STEP AND EXPLAINING THE OPPORTUNITY AND EXPLAINING WHY GRAIL AND WHY GRAIL AND LUMINA AND THAT'S THE WORK WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US BUT WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT THAT IT' Cayco: \"Yeah, so I'll tackle a couple of things here. Our margins and I think you had a question on operating expenses as well, Cayco. So, you know, from an overall Cayco's standpoint, the Cayco's will initially start out, you know, obviously much higher than our average Cayco's, driven by the fact that you know volumes are ramping up. So initially, you're going to see a higher Cayco's profile for the business as the volumes start ramping up. And two and a half to three years post launch of gallery, the Cayco's will start out. START TO GET TO A LEVEL WHICH IS COMMENSURATE WITH OUR OVERALL SERVICES BUSINESS AND SLIGHTLY BELOW OUR OVERALL COGGS PROFILE AND OBVIOUSLY AS WE INTRODUCE MORE INNOVATIONS AND YOU KNOW LOWER THE COST OF SEQUENCING TO YOUR QUESTION THE COGGS WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT AS WELL JUST LIKE ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT IN TERMS OF OPERATING EXPENSES YOU KNOW WHAT GRAIL INVESTED LAST YEAR OR I SHOULD FOR THE FIRST MONTH IT WAS ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU EXTRA-POLATE THAT BACK FOR THE FULL YEAR LET'S SAY IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S EXACTLY DOUBLE THAT IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION FOR THE FULL YEAR AS WE LOOK FORWARD OBVIOUSLY THAT NUMBER IS GONNA GROW BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE Ramping and LAUNCHING PRODUCTS WE'RE GONNA BE ACCELERATING THE COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS AND BUILDING OUT Years, it's gonna be, you know, ah, back on Delucia, K-N-L, but let me remind you of the, just the attractiveness of this opportunity, longer term, and eventually, as the volume scales, the, the opportunity is significant on the top line and even though it required investments in terms of commercial efforts and R&D, you know, we will definitely, after a few years, start to see accretion on K-N-L. And then, maybe, Hank, can you comment on the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, MEDICAL VALUE AND AND THE QUESTIONS ARE AROUND THE SCREENING TEST AND WHERE WE ARE SURE SO SO AS YOU AS YOU NOTED TYKO THE SENSITIVITY FOR FIFTY CANCERS IS FORTY FOUR PERCENT SO LET ME EXPLAIN WHY WE THINK THIS IS GREAT PERFORMANCE PRINCESS HAS TOUCHED ON THE FACT THAT WHEN WE PRE SPECIFIED A BASKET OF TWELVE CANCERS WE HAVE SENSITIVITY OF JUST UNDER SEVENTY PERCENT AND THOSE TWELVE TWELVE CANCERS Cancers, by the way, account for about two-thirds of mortality. What you're observing is when you start looking for more cancers than those twelve, and you start adding in cancers where the test has lower sensitivity, the sensitivity does drop. But here's what matters even though the sensitivity drops as you expand the absolute number of cancers you look for, the total number of cancers you detect goes up. SO A TEST LOOKING FOR FIFTY CANCERS AT FORTY FOUR PERCENT SENSITIVITY IN AGGREGATE DETECTS MANY MORE CANCERS THAN A TEST LOOKING FOR TWELVE CANCERS AT A SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT SENSITIVITY AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE MEDICAL NEED WE ALL HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY FROM CANCER OCCURRING CANCERS WHERE THERE IS NO SCREENING THIS TEST WILL PROTECTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE SO THAT THAT THAT'S WHY IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO HAVE A TEST THAT CAN REALLY DETECT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CANCERS AS POSSIBLE GREAT THANK YOU HANS AND THEN YOUR LAST QUESTION TYCO WAS YOU KNOW IS THIS MOVE ANY REFLECTION OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE CORE MARKET AND IS THAT WHAT'S DRIVING THIS AND I THINK NOT AT ALL WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN OUR CORE MARKET YOU KNOW THIS YEAR IN THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS A SLO-DOWN BECAUSE OF PEOPLE SHELTERING IN PLACE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT WE THOUGHT WE'D TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT SLOWLY HAS BEEN BUILDING SINCE THE END OF QUEUE ONE AND YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR CERTAINLY AS WE START TO SEE A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES KICK BACK UP WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WITH THE CORPORATE BUSINESS. WE DID TALK ABOUT THE POPULATION EFFORTS THAT ALL OF US IS GONNA BE STARTING IN THE BACK HALF OF FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S STARTING TO SCALE UP AGAIN AND THEN AT THE NHS EFFORT WHICH THIS YEAR HAS BEEN SIDELINED TO FOCUS ON ON COVID IT IS GOING TO BE KICKING BACK UP NEXT YEAR SO WE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHERE POPULATION SEQUENCING EFFORTS ARE GOING TO BE STARTING INTO NEXT YEAR WE'RE SEEING GOOD NEWS IN TERMS OF GUIDELINE CHANGES FOR NIPT IN CONTINUED GROWTH AND NIPT AROUND THE WORLD WE'RE SEEING CONTINUED ADOPTION OF OUR T S O F FIVE CONTINUED DRIVE FOR GROWTH AND THAT OBVIOUSLY WE LAUNCH THE NEXT SEA K TWO THOUSAND THIS YEAR AND SO WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SEE THAT UPGRADE CYCLE PLAY OUT CERTAINLY AS WE GET INTO NEXT YEAR THIS MOVE IS REALLY ABOUT OUR STRATEGY AND OUR STRATEGY HAS BEEN AGAIN GUIDED BY OUR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH BY UNLOCKING THE POWER OF THE GENOME OUR STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE SEQUENCERS AND CONSUMABLES TO A BROAD ARRAY OF MARKETS AND TO PROVIDE THE SOLUTION OURSELVES WE WANT TO PICK THE LARGEST MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE A DIFFERENTIATED OFFERING AND FRANKLY IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CRITERIA THERE PROBABLY IS NO OTHER CRITERIA NO OTHER SPACE THAT MET THAT CRITERIA AS WELL AS EARLY CANCER DETECTION IT'S THE LARGEST OF THE GENOMIC APPLICATIONS THAT WE CAN IMAGINE OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS AND GRAIL HAS BUILT A VERY INNOVATION RICH PORTFOLIO WITH GOOD I Differentiated offering in that market. And so the strategy is you know horizontally provide sequencers and you know everywhere and then be very surgical. And that's very common for platform companies. Certainly if you look at you know in technology whether it's apple or amazon or microsoft they provide the platform but then there are specific applications that they provide directly themselves. Typically the largest applications and having an application actually gives you access to insights that have you created a platform.

Thank you.\n\nSure, so three questions. I'll take the first one around Grail revenue to illuminate the last couple of years. Maybe Sam, you can talk about EPS solutions and M&A and you can essentially push around it. So, first of all, it's a bit short. In 2019 and 2020, Grail was a very, very, very small part of our overall revenue. In fact, I typically look at our top 20 customers on a daily and weekly basis. I don't think I ever saw them in either of those two years on those lists. So, it's a very small part of our revenue for 2019 and 2020. Sam, maybe EPS? Yeah, so, as I talked about earlier, the ramp of Ophirx in the 20s. Yeah, as I talked about earlier, the ramp of Ophirx in the 20s. Yeah, as I talked about earlier, the ramp of Ophirx in the 20s. A FEW YEARS OF SIGNIFICANT DRIVEN BY THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF GALLERY. SO OUR EXPECTATIONS RIGHT NOW IS THAT IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR POST CLOSE OF THE DEAL THAT THERE WOULD BE EPS DELUSSION OF SOMEWHERE IN THE THREE TWENTY FIVE TO THREE SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR RANGE. AND THEN HENCE, CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PATCHFINDER AND THE UPCOMING READOUTS AND PLACE THAT IN CONTEXT A LITTLE BIT? Sure, and for folks that aren't familiar, Pathfinder is a six thousand patient clinical trial that's enrolling as we speak. It's a return of results study, so patients in this trial getting the Glaxo test when the test detects cancer, they're getting worked up and obviously the results return to them. So our expectation is that that real world trial will will will confirm the performance of the test. In other studies that we've reported to you and covered on the call this morning, the other thing that this study is very important for is it will help us understand the service components of the test that we'll provide to help make sure that the workup process post-positive test is is simple and good to use for primary care doctors. Thank you. ALL RIGHT. NEXT QUESTION. PATRICK DONNELLY WITH CITY. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GREAT THANKS GUYS. JUST A FOLLOW-UP ON DEREK THERE. JUST GIVING THE DELUXION NUMBER. A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN WE WERE MODELLING. TO SEE IF THE NEWS CAME OUT LAST WEEK. SAM, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT MAYBE THE APEX TRAJECTORY OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TO GET TO THAT THREE FIFTY THREE THREE FIFTY NUMBER YOU NOTED. SHOULD WE EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO REALL AND THEN MAYBE JUST QUICKLY AFTER THAT YOU GUYS ARE OBVIOUSLY PARTICIPATING IN SOME UPSIDE FOR MORGAN GREY THE ROYALTY AS A CUSTOMER ETC. SO CAN YOU JUST EXPAND A LITTLE MORE FRANCIS ON I GUESS WHY YOU GUYS WANTED TO BRING IT IN HOUSE AND ALSO GIVE THE ROYALTY ALMOST BACK TO THEM WITH THE NINE PERCENT OVER A BILLION AMERICAN DOLLARS MAYBE JUST KIND OF FLUSH THAT OUT A LITTLE MORE THANKS GUYS YEAH SO I CAN START ON THE FINANCIAL ESTIMATES AS WE AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE CLOSE OF THE ACQUISITION SO AT THIS POINT WE'RE GIVING YOU YOU KNOW DIRECTIONAL NUMBERS JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTING IN YOUR MODELS BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AROUND THE ALPHA X INVESTMENT PATRICK YES OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE FROM YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAW ON THE S I ONE AND WHAT YOU SAW LAST YEAR OR THIS YEAR SORRY I KEEP SAYING LAST YEAR BUT WHAT AND R D AND AS I SAID YOU KNOW THE INVESTMENT THAT WAS DISCLOSED WAS A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION SO IF YOU EXPECT THAT THATS GONNA BE A FULL YEAR WORTH OF INVESTMENT THATS CLOSER TO TWO SEVENTY BUT AS YOU LOOK FORWARD AND AS GALLERY LAUNCHES THERELL BE INVESTMENTS AROUND THE NUMBER OF FACTORIES YOU KNOW ITS GONNA BE R D ITS GONNA BE COMMERCIAL ITS GONNA BE MARKET ACCESS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS YOU KNOW G N A TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESS THERE TO START TO SCALE THAT'S GONNA BE SIGNIFICANTLY DILUTED TO THE NUMBER THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER WHICH IS THE THREE TWENTY FIVE TO THREE SEVENTY FIVE IN THE FIRST FULL YEAR POST LAUNCH SO I THINK YOU KNOW I WOULD ALSO THOUGH MENTION THAT WITH A SIX BILLION DOLLAR TAM THATS GOTEN ADDED TO OUR BUSINESS YOU KNOW THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITY IS QUITE ATTRACTIVE AS WE LOOK AT THE LONG TERM YEAH AND THAT DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME PICK UP ON YOUR The arrangement we have, you know, is a pre-acquisition with Grail, obviously laid by buyers and consumables from us. But we also get a royalty on on the Grail revenue. And as we saw through, you know, we modeled what that looks like over the next fifteen years. It's clear to us that we participate more fully. So we get more revenue, more margin dollars in. If we acquired Grail, just financially, this is a much better way of capturing value. THE VALUE IN THE MARKET THAN CONTINUING TO BE A SUPPLIER TO GRAIL WITH THE ROYALTY AND AS SAND POINTED OUT THIS IS A SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR MARKET OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW WE ARE ABLE TO SOMEHOW CAPTURE THE VALUE BETTER IN THE CURRENT AGREEMENTS IN TERMS OF THE ROYALTY BACK TO GRAIL SHAREHOLDERS AND JUST AS A POINT THERE YOU HEARD IN THE PREPARED REMARKS WE ARE TWELVE PERCENT CURRENTLY OF THE GRAIL SHAREHOLDERSHIP SO THE ROYALTY YOU GUYS Y THE THINKING HERE WAS THAT WE AS WE WERE WORKING WITH THE GRAIL INVESTORS NOW THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE CLEARLY THEY SEE THE OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF THEM AND THERE WAS A GAP IN WHAT THEY THOUGHT AND WE WERE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE AND SO THIS WAS A NICE WAY TO SORT OF BRIDGE THAT TO SAY WE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT WE PARTICIPATE IF THE OPPORTUNITY IS MUCH BIGGER THAN WHAT WE THINK AND EVERYBODY WINS OTHERWISE WE ALL SHARE IF IT' I want to demonstrate that the market ends up being much bigger than we initially thought. Steve, with Wolfe Research, your line is open. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. I'll ask just two questions. One, I actually want to follow up on a point that Tyler raised and it's about how you want to articulate right now what you think about the core business. I appreciate the points that you raised and it's about how you want to articulate right now what you think about the core business. I appreciate the points that you raised and it's about how you want to articulate right now what you think about the core business. I appreciate the points that you raised and it's about how you want to articulate right now what you think about the core business. I appreciate the points that you raised and it's about how you want BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. ALL COMING ONLINE NEXT YEAR I'M AWAY THROUGH THE PIPELINE. BUT I WONDER WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE TAKING A VIEW THAT THE CORE BUSINESS, THE EX GRILLED BUSINESS, IS A DOUBLE DIGIT GROWER AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE OUT INTO THE FUTURE. AND THEN MY SECOND ONE IS AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE OF PROVIDERS OUT THERE FIVE OR TEN YEARS AGO RATHER FIVE OR TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF HOW MANY DIFFER YOU THINK ARE OUT THERE HAVING ALUMINA INVOLVED IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY IT MEANS THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE YOU OBVIOUSLY VERY LARGE SCALE PLAYER THE WAYS TO COME AT THIS PARTICULAR MARKET CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU YOU SEE THAT LOOKING AND WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RATHER SUBSTANTIAL I P PORTFOLIO THAT YOU HAVE FLAGGED FRANCIS AND HANS AS YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT LANDSCAPE LOOKS LIKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE IS HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE CORE BUSINESS AND THE SECOND ONE IS HOW DO WE THINK THE LANDSCAPE FOR CANCER DETECTION ASSETS WILL PLAY OUT? WILL THERE BE A SIGNIFICANT SINGLE WINNER OR WILL THERE BE MULTIPLE PLAYERS? SO LET ME GO TO THE FIRST ONE YOU KNOW THE ABSOLUTELY UNCOMFORTABLE YOU KNOW SAYING THAT WE EXPECT OUR CORE BUSINESS OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD TO GENERATE DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH. WE ARE STILL AS WE SAID IN THE VERY RELATED TO HEALTH AND DISEASE BUT FROM A CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE WE'RE ALSO IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF PENETRATING SOME OF THE MARKETS WE TALKED ABOUT LIKE ONCOLOGY THERAPY SELECTION AND GENETIC DISEASE TESTING AND GENETIC DISEASE TESTING IS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT PENETRATED SO I AM COMFORTABLE THAT OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD YOU SHOULD BE SEEING DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH FROM THE CORE BUSINESS AND THAT YOU KNOW THE ACQUISITION OF GRAIL IS INTENDE THE CANCER DETECTION MARKET TO PLAY OUT NOW THIS IS A VERY VERY LARGE MARKET. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT A SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR MARKET AND SO WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE APPROACHES FOR THIS MARKET THAT YOU KNOW SOME WILL FOCUS ON SINGLE CANCERS OR A SMALL SET OF CANCERS SOME WILL BE PAN CANCER AND FRANKLY THAT'S HOW WE'VE MODELED SOME OF THE REVENUES FOR US THAT WE EXPECT THERE TO BE MULTIPLE PLAYERS YOU KNOW TRYING ADDITIONS OF THE MARKET AND AGAIN WITH A MARKET THIS BIG AND THIS IMPORTANT WE WE EXPECT IT TO PLAY OUT THAT WAY THIS IS ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR QUESTIONS THE ILLUMINATI TEAM THANKS YOU ALL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN TODAY'S CONFERENCE THIS CONCLUDES TODAY'S CALL YOU MAY NOW DISCONNECT"
